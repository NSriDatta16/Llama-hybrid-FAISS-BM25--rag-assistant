contrast to find dependence on continuous variable within a group?

I have a linear model like Y ~ group * X , where X is a continuous variable and group is a categorical variable. Let's say group designates different animals (badgers, ferrets, or weasels), X is bees per hectare, and Y is, umm, average tail size. Now I know how to ask, what is the dependence of ferret tail length on bee density, but how do I determine if that dependence statistically significant? set.seed(1) mustelid $tail tail + ifelse(dat $mustelid=="ferret", 0, 10 - dat$ bees / 100) lmObj and the summary is: Call: lm(formula = tail ~ mustelid * bees, data = dat) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.06766 -0.54566 0.02774 0.55211 2.34569 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 19.035790 1.248556 15.246 So the estimated dependence of ferret tail length on bee density is (iinm), the bees coefficient plus the mustelidferret:bees coefficient. Both of these coefficients are significant by themselves, but I can't tell how I'd figure out if their sum is significant. Any suggestion? For reference, here's a plot showing how tail length changes with bee density (bees per hectare, by the way, is definitely, absolutely, beyond all question an important factor in mustelid ecology): Basically, we expect our model to show that tail length varies with bee density in weasels and badgers but not ferrets.
