How to bind IP address to a Spring 3 @ModelAttribute?

Here's how my method looks like: @RequestMapping(value = "/form", method = RequestMethod.POST) public String create(@ModelAttribute("foo") @Valid final Foo foo, final BindingResult result, final Model model) { if (result.hasErrors()) return form(model); fooService.store(foo); return "redirect:/foo"; } So, I need to bind the IP address to the Foo object probably by calling getRemoteAddr() on HttpServletRequest . I've tried creating CustomEditor for Foo , but it doesn't seem to be the proper way. @InitBinder looks more promising but I've yet to found out how. The IP address is mandatory on the object and Spring combined with JSR-303 bean validation will give a validation error unless it is there. What would be the most elegant way to solve this?
