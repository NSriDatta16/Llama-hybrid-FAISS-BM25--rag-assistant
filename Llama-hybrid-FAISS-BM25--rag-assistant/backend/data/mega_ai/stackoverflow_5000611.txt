Problem in RAD 7.0 with java Swing component

I am working on swing components and got the following error when i tried to add swing label "add(label)". Here is the error. *Unhandled exception Type=Segmentation error vmState=0x00040000 J9Generic_Signal_Number=00000004 ExceptionCode=c0000005 ExceptionAddress=6918465C ContextFlags=0001003f Handler1=008505B0 Handler2=008974F0 InaccessibleAddress=AB924D78 EDI=68D11CA4 ESI=FF333333 EAX=00000000 EBX=00000006 ECX=00000009 EDX=AB924D78 EIP=6918465C ESP=698FFC70 EBP=00000A00 Module=C:\Program Files\IBM\SDP70\jdk\jre\bin\awt.dll Module_base_address=69170000 Offset_in_DLL=0001465c Target=2_30_20060915_08260_lHdSMR (Windows XP 5.1 build 2600 Service Pack 2) CPU=x86 (4 logical CPUs) (0xcb53f000 RAM) JVMDUMP006I Processing Dump Event "gpf", detail "" - Please Wait.

I also tried this code on another machine in RAD but got the same error. I am in serious hurry as I am getting late for my this task. All my other projects are working good in RAD 7.0. Please tell me is this is a bug in RAD 7.0 or there is a miss in settings for JRE etc. Thanks & Ragards Imran Tariq http://www.imrantariq.com/blog
