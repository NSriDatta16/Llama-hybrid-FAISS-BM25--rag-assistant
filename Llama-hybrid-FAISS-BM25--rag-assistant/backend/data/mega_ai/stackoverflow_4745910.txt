This appears to be a bit of an old post, but hey... I moved from C# to Java and I've just started a role and am moving from Java to PHP... First off: Java is awesome :) for your IDE get Eclipse, once you get used to it, you never have to leave the IDE (apart from SQL bits). It manages projects really well, you can download alsorts of plugins, such as SVN plugins. It allows you to run a Tomcat server within Eclipse and it will output errors straight to the Eclipse console. for the framework, I used Struts and Tiles and Torque for the ORM, took me a while to get my head around them, but once we made friends, I can't imagine any other way of developing. Although I imagine for a small project it would be a lot of overhead! agreed with an above post - get HEADFIRST JAVA, thats how I learnt and I used it for lots of other languages, they have a visual method of learning thats alot easier than pure textbooks - well for me anyway. I was up and running with in a day and confident within a couple of weeks I guess - but always learning :) yip Java is strict, but you come to love it, for me moving to loose 'ol PHP is a bit wierd. you will also need to download Tomcat to run your Java bits, its easy as to get running. Java organises all your classes very nicely, none of this 'require_once(some_text_file.php)' rubbish, just 'import myClass' and off you go. one of the things that annoys me is, there is no way of telling which JAR libraries you are NOT using, so after a couple of years working on a site, your lib folder can get a bit messy - specially if mulitple people are removing and adding functionality. I could go on. Paul
