C# Dictionary Application: Applying Values through the selection of keys

I have a dictionary that I am using to define the ratings of copper cable. I want to use these values to calculate how many cables it will take to meet a certain connections rating. The size of the connection, the cable type, and system type are selected by two ComboBoxs named cb_amperage, cb_cable_size and, cb_system_type. The answer found once the equation runs is to be displayed in a text box named tb6_cable_qty. I welcome any and all comments and suggestions. Thank you in advance for the assistance. The math is easy: decimal x, y, z; x = decimal.Parse(cb_amperage.); y = decimal.Parse();// cable_dictionary_1 = new Dictionary (); cable_dictionary_1.Add ("#1", 130); cable_dictionary_1.Add ("1/0", 150); cable_dictionary_1.Add ("2/0", 175); cable_dictionary_1.Add ("3/0", 200); cable_dictionary_1.Add ("4/0", 230); cable_dictionary_1.Add ("250", 255); cable_dictionary_1.Add ("300", 285); cable_dictionary_1.Add ("400", 355); cable_dictionary_1.Add ("500", 380); cable_dictionary_1.Add ("600", 720); cable_dictionary_1.Add ("750", 475); //System Type Dictionary used for cable quantity calculation Dictionary system_type_dictionary = new Dictionary (); system_type_dictionary.Add ("3P 3W", 3); system_type_dictionary.Add ("3P 4W", 4); EDIT 1: mmr; please take a look at the code below. I have a feeling I missed something that I would know if I was a little more expierenced. The following is my implementation of the first part of the solution you suggested. I get an error. I think it is because these two items, the string and the dictionary dont know they are supposed to be linked. Here is the error; *Invalid token ',' in class, struct, or interface member declaration (CS1519). See what you can see. Thanks again. //The following strings are used in the cable quantity calculation private const string cblsize1 = "#1"; private const string cblsize2 = "1/0"; private const string cblsize3 = "2/0"; private const string cblsize4 = "3/0"; //Cable Dictionary 1 used for cable quantity calculation Dictionary cable_dictionary_1 = new Dictionary (); cable_dictionary.Add(cblsize1, 130);//#1 Cable cable_dictionary.Add(cblsize2, 150);//1/0 Cable cable_dictionary.Add(cblsize3, 175);//2/0 Cable cable_dictionary.Add(cblsize4, 200);//3/0 Cable
