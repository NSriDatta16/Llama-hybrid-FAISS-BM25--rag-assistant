Is there a way through the Visual Studio IDE to move buttons between ToolStrips?

I have multiple ToolStrips with buttons on my form. I'd like to move some buttons from one ToolStrip to another. However, the Visual Studio IDE is not allowing me to drag the buttons off of a ToolStrip. I could go and edit the designer file for the form, but I try to avoid that as much as possible. So is there some way to do this through the IDE?
