why model view controller is not view logic database?

I'm using MVC model for 5 months. I agree with MVC, good technique for organizing mind. But every time I try to write model I write module, that confusion rised a question, why it is model, not data or database or storage or etc. Most irrelevant and generic name is model. I'm okey with view, but controller should be logic or router I think. From wikipedia: The pattern isolates "domain logic " (the application logic for the user) from the user interface (input and presentation ) The model manages the behavior and data of the application domain The controller receives input and initiates a response by making calls on model objects Why we use model, view and controller as name of this pattern?
