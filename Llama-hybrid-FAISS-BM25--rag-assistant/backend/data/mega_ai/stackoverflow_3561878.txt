jquery sortable's absolutly positioned 'handle' problem- Doesn't influence the sorting while outsite of the sortable element scope

I got a problem I cannot manage to resolve. I have a Basecamp alike list of items with a small menu on the left with Drag, Edit and Trash icons. The handle is there. He is sitting outside of the scope of the sortable element, and this is why he doesn't influence the sorting at all. As you can see, my dragging icon is on the left. He is outside of the {LI} scope. The LIs endings where the char ends, so the Handle is out from his parent and wont influence at all the sorting and wont initiate it. When I drag it but move my mouse inside the LI's borders, than it influencing and sorting like it suppose to. What can I do. I broke my head and searched for an property of an handle offset, or any way to define for him that my handle is outside of your scope. I hope anyone faced this thing in the past and might help :) I think to put a bullet image bg, and this way to give the LI more space to its left. Might do the trick... :) Thank you
