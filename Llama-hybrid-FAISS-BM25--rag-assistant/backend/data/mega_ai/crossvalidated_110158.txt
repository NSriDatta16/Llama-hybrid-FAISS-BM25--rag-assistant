Interpreting the logit results in terms of dollars

If we regress the choice on some cost variables, then how would you interpret the meaning of the coefficients? In this paper published in American Economic Review, link: http://economics.mit.edu/files/4513 Based on the estimation results in table 1, authors conclude that "individuals are willing to pay over $300 for full donut hole coverage" (it is an insurance plan which covers the Medicare donuts holes. it is a dummy variable with coefficient of 1.865) I can not understand how the authors could come to that conclusion based on the logit estimation results! would you please help with that?
