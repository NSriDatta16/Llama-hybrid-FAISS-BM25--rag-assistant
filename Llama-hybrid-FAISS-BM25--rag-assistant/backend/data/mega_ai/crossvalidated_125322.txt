$\hat{R}$ and "potential scale reduction factor" refer to the same thing. See Chapter 6 of the Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo , "Inference from Simulations and Monitoring Convergence" by Andrew Gelman and Kenneth Shirley. In Stan, the number reported is actually split $\hat{R}$; the calculation of $\hat{R}$ is computed with each of the chains split in half.
