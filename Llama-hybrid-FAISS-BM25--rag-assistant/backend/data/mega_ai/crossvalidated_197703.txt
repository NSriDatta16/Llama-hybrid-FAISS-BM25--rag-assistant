Any machine learning algorithm perform better than Time Series Analysis for seasonal signals?

For example, consider training samples based on daily sales of a superstore during the last few years. We are pretty sure there are seasonal factors. With Time Series Analysis, one firstly have to de-seasonal for the sales, and then do a regression on a curve without any seasonal signal, and finally multiply the seasonal factor back. Is there any regression method without going through any deseasonal process, but provide even better accuracy in predicting the future daily sales?
