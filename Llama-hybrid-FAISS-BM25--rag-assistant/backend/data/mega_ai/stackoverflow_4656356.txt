Need help running automatic tasks on SQL Server

We run a server hosted with Go-Daddy and use SQL Server 2005 Express. One of our customers needs to schedule an automatic SQL process overnight that takes the data from an ftp transfer that feed the csvs onto our server. We upgraded to SQL Server Workgroup on go-daddy but the have told us that although we can select the SQL Agent option, the ability to edit this does not appear in the SSMS as Go Daddy tell me they only supply the Express version rather than the standard version with all of the SQL packages and the express version of SSMS does not support this auto scheduling. Can anyone advise as to how we might be able to do this either through SQL Server itself (without having to dump the go-daddy version and pay $5000 for the software from MS; or alternatively a third party plugin that will do this?
