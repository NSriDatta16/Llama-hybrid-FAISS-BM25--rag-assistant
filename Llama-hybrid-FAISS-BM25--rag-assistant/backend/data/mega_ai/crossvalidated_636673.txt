low accuracy in random forest model

HCV.Egy.Data $Baselinehistological.staging) HCV.Egy.Data$ Baselinehistological.staging $Baselinehistological.staging) library("randomForest") library(caTools) split Baselinehistological.staging, ntree = 500, type="classification") classifier_RF$classes y_pred = predict(classifier_RF, newdata = test[, -c(28,29)]) confusion_mtx = table(test[, 29], y_pred) confusion_mtx table(train[, 29], classifier_RF$predicted) I have low accuracy (20-30%) for my ML models for this model using a lot of different ML methods (random forest, XGboost, adaboost, LR, etc.) Here is the confusion matrix from running the above code: y_pred 1 2 3 4 1 13 22 36 38 2 21 17 39 33 3 15 20 38 27 4 13 16 37 45 We even applied SMOTE and the discretization steps to increase the accuracy to only 33%. Does anyone know why the papers that have used this dataset are getting accuracies in the 70-95% range? Is something glaringly missing? For example, here's a paper: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Md-Satu/publication/341987762_Predicting_Infectious_State_of_Hepatitis_C_Virus_Affected_Patient%27s_Applying_Machine_Learning_Methods/links/5edcab8a45851529453fc609/Predicting-Infectious-State-of-Hepatitis-C-Virus-Affected-Patients-Applying-Machine-Learning-Methods.pdf We also applied SMOTE 8 times but accuracy only increased to 33%. Here is the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/503/hepatitis+c+virus+hcv+for+egyptian+patients If you know any fixes, it would be much appreciated.
