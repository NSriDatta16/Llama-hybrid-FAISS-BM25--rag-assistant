nround parameter in xgboost

i was implementing xgb code is like below, bst so i am surprised with the result of xgb, especially with nround nround when -> 5 it gave train-error:0.175896 [final pass] nround when -> 10 it gave train-error:0.154723 [final pass] nround when ->20 it gave train-error:0.114007 [final pass] nround when ->30 it gave train-error:0.099349 [final pass] I think when i am using nround as high number it is overfitting the data, So i am confused, I want to know how to choose ideal value of nround. Thanks
