In WPF, what is the best way to create a calendar view similar to Outlook 2007?

I'm writing a WPF desktop application and have a view that needs to look like a calendar. I only need to show four weeks (fixed). Each week will have a list of items (probably represented with a ListView). I'm debating between two approaches: Using layout controls - a Grid control where each "cell" contains a ListView Using a ListView + GridView and then customizing the style to look more like a calendar In my opinion, the layout controls would be easier to implement but something about it feels dirty. I would essentially be hard-coding 28 cells each containing a ListView. But again, it would be simple. I'm thinking the ListView/GridView would be more elegant, but I still need to create a ListView for each cell and then I have to figure out how to style the control in such a way that it looks more like a calendar and less like a table. Thoughts?
