How do sample weights work in classification models?

What does it mean to provide weights to each sample in a classification algorithm? How does a classification algorithm (eg. Logistic regression, SVM) use weights to give more emphasis to certain examples? I would love going into the details to unpack how these algorithms leverage weights. If you look at the sklearn documentation for logistic regression, you can see that the fit function has an optional sample_weight parameter which is defined as an array of weights assigned to individual samples.
