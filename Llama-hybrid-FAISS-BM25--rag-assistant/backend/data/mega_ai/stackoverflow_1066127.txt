Custom forms in Magento

Can anyone provide a dummy guide \ code snippets on how to create a front end form in Magento that posts data to a controller action. Im trying to write a variant of the contact us from. (I know its easy to modify the contact us form, as outlined here ). I'm trying to also create a feedback form with additional fields. Given this basic form: getFormAction(); ?>" id="feedbackForm" method="post"> __('Name') ?> * __('Name') ?>" value=" htmlEscape($this->helper('contacts')->getUserName()) ?>" class="required-entry input-text" type="text" /> __('* Required Fields') ?> __('Submit') ?> What are the basic step I need to take to get inputted name to a controller action for processing?
