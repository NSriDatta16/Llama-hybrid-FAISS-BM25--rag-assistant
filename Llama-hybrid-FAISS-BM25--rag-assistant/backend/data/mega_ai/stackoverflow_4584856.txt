With strager's code, you can also check the CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE for other codes. Some websites do not report a 404, rather they simply redirect to a custom 404 page and return 302 (redirect) or something similar. I used this to check if an actual file (eg. robots.txt) existed on the server or not. Clearly this kind of file would not cause a redirect if it existed, but if it didn't it would redirect to a 404 page, which as I said before may not have a 404 code. function is_404($url) { $handle = curl_init($url); curl_setopt($handle, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, TRUE); /* Get the HTML or whatever is linked in $url. */ $response = curl_exec($handle); /* Check for 404 (file not found). */ $httpCode = curl_getinfo($handle, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE); curl_close($handle); /* If the document has loaded successfully without any redirection or error */ if ($httpCode >= 200 && $httpCode
