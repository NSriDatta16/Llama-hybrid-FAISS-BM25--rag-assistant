I would say that the answer should not come from the data, but rather from the science producing the data, the question to be answered, and the audience that you are trying to answer the question for. Think about the science that underlies the data/question. Do the discontinuities in the Random forest model make sense? are you allowing enough interaction and non-linearity in the regression model? What will your audience best understand? (random forests can sometimes be converted into a simple lookup table without needing to do any math, regression models can be more straight forward for future computation) These and other questions outside of the data should drive the general form of the model, then the data can help determine the specifics (coefficients, cut-points) of the general model. If one of the general forms is clearly superior, then pretty much any measure should show which is superior (and that should match with the science as well). If you need a specific measure to decide, and different measures are likely to give different results, then a small change in the data would likely make a difference as well. Would you be happy with a data driven decision that would have been different had one single data point not been collected? Knowledge outside of the data will be consistent and better for these choices.
