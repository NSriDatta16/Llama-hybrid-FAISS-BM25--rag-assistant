There isn't an elegant solution really, you either have nullable columns or you use an EAV solution. I posted about EAV before (and generated a lot of comments that might be worthwhile reading): What is so bad about EAV, anyway? I am a fan of that model in some scenarios, but if your dimensions/attributes do not change frequently, it can be a lot of extra work for nothing. NULL values in a column do not really make waste as long as the surrounding code can deal with them appropriately.
