Just expanding on what James wrote - Modules are the way to go here. And, although the docs for modules talk about a web scenario, there's no reason this wouldn't work with AIR also. You might need to write some custom code to first check to see if the module already exists in the local storage, and if not, download it and store it. However, from there, you should be good-to-go. However, remember that this approach you won't get the native updater behaviour you get out-of-the-box with AIR. You'd need to roll-your-own support for checking to see if a newer version of a module thats been previously cached is available.
