My recommendation would be to avoid imputing values . Imputing regressors is one thing, but imputing the outcome can impart a large amount of bias. You seem to have more than enough data to study how the outcome changes over time. As for the method, I wonder if it would be better to study how the outcome changes over time rather than posit that the outcome is constant or some period and then abruptly changes. A mixed effects ordinal logistic regression may be able to handle this data. Can you post the data as a tidy dataset? Columns should be PID , Day , Rating .
