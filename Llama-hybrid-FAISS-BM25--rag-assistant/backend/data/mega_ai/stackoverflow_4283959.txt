Google Collections HashMultiset : - quite elegant to use - but consume CPU and memory Best would be to have a method like : Entry getOrPut(K); (elegant, and low cost) Such a method will compute hash and index only once, and then we could do what we want with the entry (either replace or update the value). More elegant: - take a HashSet - extend it so that get(K) put a new Entry if needed - Entry could be your own object. --> (new MyHashSet()).get(k).increment();
