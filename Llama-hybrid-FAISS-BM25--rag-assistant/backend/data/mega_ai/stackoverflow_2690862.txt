In addition to the reasons mentioned in other answers (security, immutability, performance) it should be noted that String has special language support. You can write String literals and there's support for the + operator. Allowing programmers to subclass String , would encourage hacks such as: class MyComplex extends String { ... } MyComplex a = new MyComplex("5+3i"); MyComplex b = new MyComplex("7+4i"); MyComplex c = new MyComplex(a + b); // would work since a and b are strings, // and a string + a string is a string.
