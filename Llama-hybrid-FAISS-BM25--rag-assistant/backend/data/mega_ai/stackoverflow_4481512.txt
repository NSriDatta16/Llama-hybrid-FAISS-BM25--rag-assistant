Creating a customized "default" button in Expression Blend + WPF

I'm about 95% of the way to getting what I need but still have some issues. Basically I'd like the default style of all Button controls (to use when dragging a Button to the form using Expression Blend) to behave as below: On mouse over - change the button font's coloring to a gradient AND increase the size of the font by 2 points more than the font size the control is assigned in it's "normal" state. The size increase is important as the "buttons" don't have any border, they're just plain text with a drop shadow. On click - again change the font coloring, remove a drop shadow to make it appear depressed (the size would still remain the "normal" font size + 2 points) My current method is giving me some issues and it's a bit too much code to post here, so I'm hoping to get a few suggestions for alternative approaches from someone with more experience at this. I'd prefer not to have a totally custom Button control (like "CustomButton") and to simply override the regular default "Button" control's appearance/style since it'll be the only type of button in the application. But if a new class/control is the only way, I'll give that a try instead. Ex. On mouseover, the fontsize should go to +2 larger than each button's assigned size. Right now I'm doing this by overlaying a TextBlock on top of the button's real text (with a few bindings), but it's not quite working yet.
