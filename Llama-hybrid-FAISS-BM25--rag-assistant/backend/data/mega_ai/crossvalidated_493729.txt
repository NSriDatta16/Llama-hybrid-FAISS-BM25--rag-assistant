How to see Simpson's paradox effect via glm in R

I am using the UCBAdmissions dataset and glm from R to check for Simpson's paradox. I am aware that with data that I have, it is easier to visualise the paradox, but I am trying to inspect it via a Poisson / Log-linear model too. My attempt To visualise this is easy: library(broom) ucb_tidy % group_by(Gender, Dept) %>% mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) ggplot(ucb_tidy, aes(x=Gender, y=prop, fill = Admit)) + ggtitle("Acceptance Rate Split by Gender & Department") + facet_wrap(~ Dept, nrow = 2) + guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + xlab("Gender") + ylab("% of Applicants") + scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) But to check and show this with a Poisson model, I tried the following: # Postulate that Gender and Admission are conditionally independent, given Dept. cond_ind1 |z|) (Intercept) 6.27557 0.04248 147.744 This, however, is not a good fit if we use pchisq to check for goodness of fit, and does not directly show the effect of admission via departments, for sex. I thought of another formulation: # Postulate that Gender and Admission are jointly independent of Dept (or not) joint_ind1 |z|) (Intercept) 5.50922 0.04106 134.188 This has an even poorer fit, and does not have the logical appeal as the conditionally independent model. My question is: How can I study Simpson's paradox via the Poisson regression model? Would you recommend another model (e.g., binomial logistic regression)?
