An obligatory Dilbert comic: If you have a random number generator that at random generates "4" with probability $p$ , the probability of observing it $n$ times in a row is $p^n$ , assuming that the draws are independent. Notice that the more times you observe "4", the smaller the probability gets, but it will never go down to zero. There will always be a slight chance of observing one more "4" in a row. So you can never be 100% certain.
