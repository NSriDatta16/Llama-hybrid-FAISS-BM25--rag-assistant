You could do it off category name quite easily. Magento, by default, adds the following to the body tag: It follows that you could define your stylesheet to work off the .category-{$category_name} class instead of a .category-{$category_id} , or similar. It would make more sense to the next person that comes along and edits your stylesheet too :) Back to your question, if you would actually like to modify the code and actually used a category ID, then you'd have to modify the category controller, in the usual manner, and add: $this->getLayout()->getBlock('root')->addBodyClass('category-' . $category->getId()); ..in the Mage_Catalog_CategoryController::viewAction() at around the same point as the other classes are added.
