How does Django save decimal values?

What am I doing wrong? class MyModel(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_("Name"), blank=False, null=False) rating = models.DecimalField(max_digits=2, decimal_places=2, default=0) I do something like that: average = count/len(votes) mymodel.rating = average mymodel.save() count is the sum of all ratings of given MyModel and votes is an array of those ratings, their division gives an average rating for MyModel (sorry if I described it incorrectly due to my poor English). If i change previous to: mymodel.name = 'anything' mymodel.save() Then 'anything' ends up in the database, but rating does not. Why? am I using wrong field type? Alan.
