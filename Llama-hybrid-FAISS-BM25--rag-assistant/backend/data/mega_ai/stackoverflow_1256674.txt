Array Constants in Excel

I have an array constant defined in cell A1 as {1,2,3}. This displays as "1" (the first value in the array). I would like to have the formula SUM(A1) return 6. However, SUM is using A1 as a single-celled array, rather than the array constant contained inside A1 - and therefore SUM(A1) returns 1. Likewise, I would expect AVERAGE(A1) returns 1 instead of 2. So simply speaking, how do I get SUM(A1) to return the same value as SUM({1,2,3})? I don't want to make the array constant a named reference because i'm defining a different array constant for every row. It feels like i'm stuck in C++ w/o a way to dereference!
