Minimum number of observations in order to trust a difference?

I'm doing an experiment to measure a very small number. For example, first I expect a measurement to be 10.0005 and then after introducing a variable, I expect the next measurement to be 10.0007 The problem is, each time I take the first measurement, the result could be anywhere from 8.0 to 12.0 - I believe if I take the measurement many times, the average will come out to my expected value. And the same for the second measurement, after introducing the variable, each individual measurement varies, but it should eventually average out to my expected value. Now, if I just compare a single first measurement (without variable) to a single final measurement (with variable) even if the observed difference matches my expected difference, it could be a coincidence, considering how much each individual measurement can vary. My question is: Is there a minimum number of times I should take measurements before & after introducing the variable, so that when I compare the averages, I can trust the observed difference is not a coincidence? If so, how can I calculate that minimum number so I know how many times to take measurements?
