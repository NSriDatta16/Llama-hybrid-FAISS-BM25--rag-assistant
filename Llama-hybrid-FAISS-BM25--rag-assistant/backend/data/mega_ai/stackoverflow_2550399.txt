What are the essential Java libraries and utilities for a returning dynamic language user?

Long time Java developer here, but I've spent more time working with Ruby over the past 3 years or so as far as web applications go. I really have enjoyed it, but there are concerns I've uncovered that I won't cover here. Now that I've found the Play! framework , I'm thrilled about the prospect of having a Rails-like experience with Java's speed and reliability. Aside from what Play! provides out of the box, I'm looking for recommendations on "can't miss" libraries and tools for the Java developer used to pragmatic, dynamic experiences. I've found Project Lombok , which looks like a very intriguing way to eliminate a lot of the boiler plate, unnecessary Java noise. What else should I know about? I know Google has released quite a few libraries over the past three years that I've heard mentioned on the Java Posse, but I can't recall exactly what they are. I'm sure I've missed others in my absence. So, what makes up your essential Java toolbox these days? Thanks for your answers!
