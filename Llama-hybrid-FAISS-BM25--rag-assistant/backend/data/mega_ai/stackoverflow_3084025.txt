If you have some content loaded by an Ajax request, then, it is only loaded by user-agents that run Javascript code. Search-engine robots generally don't support Javascript (or not well at all). So chances are that your content that's loaded by an Ajax request will not be seen by search engines crawlers -- which means it will not be indexed ; which is not quite good for your website.
