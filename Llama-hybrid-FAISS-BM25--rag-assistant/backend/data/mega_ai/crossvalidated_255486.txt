What's the difference between $\ell_1$-SVM, $\ell_2$-SVM and LS-SVM loss functions?

Over the years, many developments led to adaptations and variations over the original SVM (here called $\ell_1$-SVM, alluding to the $L_1$ penalty for points across the margin). Two such formulations one frequently encounters are the LS-SVM 1 and the $\ell_2$-SVM 2 . What's the differences between the three, from an optimization perspective?
