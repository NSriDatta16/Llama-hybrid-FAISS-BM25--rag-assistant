BIC selection yields much smaller model than AIC - can I use the likelihood ratio test to compare?

I'm trying to model the data (not make predictions) and am NOT using lasso for this, just want to know if my plan is somewhat reasonable here: I'm modelling for a "yes/no" response variable, so I used logistic regression and stepwiseAIC for variable selection. The results gives me 13 parameters: 8 covariates with 5 interaction terms (several parameters are not significant on their own but have a significant interaction). When I instead used stepwise based on BIC criteria, I only got two covariates and their interaction. Much simpler of course, but the deviance increased quite a bit. Since all the parameters in the small model were also in the large one, I considered the small one to be nested, so I did the deviance test (likelihood ratio test) and it gave me a p-value of nearly 0, indicating that the larger model is better. Am I doing it right?
