I would put move into the class Agent . If not needed, the Agent shouldn't know the whole world, but only the relevant information he needs to move. If he does know the whole world, however, that is not too bad either. Here are some reasons: How would you move a single agent if you would put the move method in the World class? Do you want to pass the instance of Agent to be moved to that method? That seems quite ugly. If you want a single agent to do something, it is nicer to do that in an instance method from an OOP perspective. You can also call the move method from an instance of another class that does not know the world, but the specific agent. However, if all your agents move simultaneously and you don't want single agents to move, you could just put one method moveAllAgents into the world class and then iterate through the list of agents and move all of these agents. You then don't need a move method in the Agent class.
