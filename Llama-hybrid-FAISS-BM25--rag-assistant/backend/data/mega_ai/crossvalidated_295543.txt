A normal Q-Q plot is really not relevant for logistic regression . As the name says, it is for visually inspecting whether the residuals in a model with a normal error term (which logistic regression is not) approximately follow some normal distribution. If the observations for each ID are related (from a common sense thinking about it perspective, e.g. asking the same patient in consecutive weeks whether he/she feels better, checking whether the same server is up and running etc.), then a random effects version of logistic regression (or generalized linear mixed model) is one way (alternatives are e.g. GEE methods) of taking that into account. Otherwise you claim that observations that are not independent are independent, which can lead to seriously wrong results.
