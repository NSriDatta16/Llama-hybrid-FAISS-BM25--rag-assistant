Embedding resource in a C++/CLI project

I'd like to embed some files (text files, maybe graphics) in a C++/CLI project -- preferably the same way I can do in C# project. This might be however impossible, as I found in this post: http://bytes.com/topic/net/answers/571530-loading-markup-xamlreader-load-resource-file#post2240705 . This was written three years ago, so maybe now there is some way to do this (in VS2k8)?
