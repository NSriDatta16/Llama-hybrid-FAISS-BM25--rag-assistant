There are a few of these knocking about. Mike G's BigOldRailsTemplate ( http://github.com/ffmike/BigOldRailsTemplate ) is unapologetically fat, but has a lot of stuff that is commonly used ready and working together. This is probably your best starting point. One of the original attempts at this was Bort ( http://github.com/fudgestudios/bort ), which hasn't had much love recently. There's also FBRP which boasts feature coverage of commonly-unfeatured areas ( http://github.com/diabolo/fbrp ). I'll defer to others' opinions on this, but it seems to me that the passing fashions of plugins, gems and versions of rails means these projects are often difficult to maintain. And, of course, generally speaking much more time is spent maintaining existing apps than creating new ones!
