For connected dummies $d$ and $x$ , you might want to calculate this average of finite differences: $$AME_x =\frac{1}{N} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ \hat p(d=1,x=0,z=z_i)-\hat p(d=0,x=1,z=z_i) \right],$$ where $\hat p(.)$ is the predicted probability from the logit model. I don't know what encoding you are using, so replace that for the ones and zeros above. Note that std(x)/1000 for continuous variables is not quite right. If you recall the definition of derivatives, the limit of the change goes to zero. You are considering a tiny perturbation, not one of particular size that depends on the SD of x.
