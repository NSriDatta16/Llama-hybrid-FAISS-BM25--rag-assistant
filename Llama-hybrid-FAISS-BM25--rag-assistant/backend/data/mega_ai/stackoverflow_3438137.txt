Find string in Haystack and display that particular paragraph where the string was found

I have an sql resultset which is retrieved after searching through the database using the LIKE keyword. I want to display the result on a page but without showing the whole text. Just the paragraph where the result was found. Maybe even put that particular word in bold. Anyone with an idea of how best I can implement this?
