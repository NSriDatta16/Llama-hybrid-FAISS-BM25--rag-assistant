Does serial correlation have something to do with endogeneity?

I'm a beginner of econometrics, and I've construed that endogeneity is caused by omitted variable bias, measurement error, and reverse causality, and it makes OLS estimator be biased. And also I've learned that serial correlation which refers to correlation among the error terms makes variance-covariance matrix not to be identity matrix, which may eventually makes OLS estimator be inefficient. However, famous free youtube channel 'ben lambert' offers lectures and I've just seen that serial correlation is sometimes caused by omitted variable bias, measurement error etc. If it's the case, then it seems omitted variable bias not just lead to biased estimator but also inefficient estimator at the same time. How should I understand this lecture?
