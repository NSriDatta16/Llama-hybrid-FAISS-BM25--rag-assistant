I see your question as not technically a math or stat or time series issue. For time series prediction in general (your x-axis proves this is a time series analysis) we want to use a large quantity of data to make a prediction for a very short time period after the jump-off. The general rule of thumb is to avoid making far out predictions. You, Lloyd Christmas, are trying to arm wrestle with this age old wisdom by assuming that the 100 observations represent the 1000 population. You just need more data! I even believe a see a pattern in your data related to 60 time periods which means there is a good chance you will go astray with your limited data. Your dilemma is social influence or political. You need help obtaining more information. As an example without mentioning specific names, I know of a case where the Prime Minister of a nation was able to obtain data that the average person couldn't access. You might need to make new friends to get this one correct. Even if the series cycles every 60 obsevations & you ignore observations 61 thru 100 (& this assumption could be incorrect) the current 60 observations might not be representative of the remaining 15 cycles of 60 observations.
