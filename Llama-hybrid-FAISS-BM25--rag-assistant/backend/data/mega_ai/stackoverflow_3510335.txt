Google Maps Geocoder requests

I'm currently creating an estate agents website with a search which returns a set of properties stored in the database. Now I know that google has a limit on how many requests it has per day so I'm trying to think of the best way to do this process. Basically at the moment, step one of the search is to input a town or postcode with which I was going to send a request to the google maps api to get the latitude and longitude of these and store them in the database for future use if they weren't already in there. Do you think this would be ok? Or is there a better solution around this? Thanks.
