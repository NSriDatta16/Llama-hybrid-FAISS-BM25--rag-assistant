Thoughts: When you rebuild indexes, do you reorganise or rebuild? Rebuild is better above 25% ish fragmentation If using DMO/sqlmaint, you have to say "10" for a fillfactor of 90 Are you actually defragging all indexes eg ALTER INDEX ALL ON Mytable ... You can't get 90% fragmentation with that level of writes unless you are updating these columns over 90% of the rows...
