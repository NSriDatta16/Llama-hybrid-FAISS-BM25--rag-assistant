WPF/XAML: Set a style with a different TargetType?

I have an external style resource in a resource dictionary I'm referencing with x:Key. It has an x:TargetType specifying a target (TextBlock). Is it possible to apply this to a control containing a TextBlock and have all TextBlock elements within that control have the style applied? Thanks, Robert
