Is a Bayesian calculation still Bayesian if you don't explicitly include priors?

A simplification of my problem that I think conveys the essential parts of my question: I am trying to calculate the most likely values for the mean and the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution given some data that are drawn from the distribution.I don't know if it's relevant but I am using an MCMC sampler to find the "best" region of parameter space. Initially I considered this a Bayesian method and was calling it Bayesian in my write up. But when I stopped to think about it, I don't have any priors for my parameters (which I guess is the same as having a flat prior?) - all I am doing is calculating likelihood and when the likelihood is large, the parameters (mean and standard deviation) are favored. My question: is it wrong to call with a Bayesian technique because I am only calculating the likelihood? If so, what should I call it? I'm not using priors explicitly but I am getting a posterior distribution.
