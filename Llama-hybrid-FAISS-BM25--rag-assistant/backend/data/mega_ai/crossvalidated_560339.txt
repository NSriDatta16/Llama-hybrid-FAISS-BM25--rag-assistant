How to average across multiple regressions, correct for p-value and estimates?

In this data frame I have 2 replicates that were placed in low, mid, or high areas with recorded densities at x and y. Within a certain level e.g. rep 1 "mid" has x = 24 and y = NAs. Biologically, it makes sense for me to also compare 24 against 10 (i.e. within the same level). Edit in reply to comments: For each level, within each replicate I set up atleast 2 replicates of x and y. Therefore, replicate 1 of x can be compared with replicate 1 of y, or replicate 2 of y and vice-versa. replicate level x y 1 low 14 36 1 low 54 31 1 mid 82 10 1 mid 24 NA 2 low 12 28 2 low 11 45 2 mid 12 17 2 mid NA 24 2 up 40 10 2 up NA 5 2 up 20 2 Using this, I created multiple data-sets with no NAs like : replicate level x y 1 low 14 36 1 low 54 31 1 mid 82 10 2 low 12 28 2 low 11 45 2 mid 12 17 2 up 40 10 2 up 20 2 Next data-set make one change and keep the rest same. replicate level x y 1 low 14 36 1 low 54 31 1 mid 24 10 #Pair 24 with 10 instead of NA 2 low 12 28 2 low 11 45 2 mid 12 17 2 up 40 10 2 up 20 2 I do all permutation/ combinations of this and estimated glm regression for each run like this Now, I want to compute the average of these regressions to get the best estimate of the fit and a confidence interval. Any suggestions on best method to go about this?
