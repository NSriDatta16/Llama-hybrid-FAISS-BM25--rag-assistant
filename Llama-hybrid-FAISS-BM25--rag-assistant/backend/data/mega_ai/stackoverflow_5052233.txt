Use the GlassPane: http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/rootpane.html It's an invisible panel that sits on top of all other components. You can attach mouse listeners to it and then use SwingUtilities.getDeepestComponentAt() to figure out which component was clicked on beneath the GlassPane. Then use a mouseDragged listener on the glasspane and set the component location based on the mouse dragged event. You will need to set the layout of your container to "null" so the components' setLocation will work.
