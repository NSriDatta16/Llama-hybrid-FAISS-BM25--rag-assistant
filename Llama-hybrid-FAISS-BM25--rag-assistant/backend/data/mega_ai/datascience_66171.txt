The first step would be to get data. Stack Overflow allows for a lot of requests over here , but I do not know if you would be able to get a lot of time series/if those time series would be granular enough. The second one would be to build a model (look at Davide Fiocco's answer). But I am afraid that you would have to make some assumptions, like your post views dynamics being similar to other average Data.SE post, when your question is in fact a cool meta-question.
