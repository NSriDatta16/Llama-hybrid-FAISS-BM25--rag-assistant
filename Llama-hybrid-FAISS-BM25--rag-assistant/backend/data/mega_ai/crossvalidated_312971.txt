Missing Value because observation didn't happened

I need help how to deal with missing value to fit logistic regression or naive Bayes. I need to analyze who will likely to purchase the product and I have datasets looks like this. As you can see, purchased day and purchased location are filled up only when purchased = 1. When purchased = 0, the record itself doesn't exist. In this case, what is the solution for these NA.
