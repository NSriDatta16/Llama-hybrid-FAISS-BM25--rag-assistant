A simplified difference-in-difference approach here would assume that the average evasion is constant over time and only changes as a result of the reform. Hence, the simplest calculation would subtract average evasion before the reform from average evasion after the reform. A more complicated model would regress the evasion level at time t on a bunch of predictors at time t, plus an indicator for whether the reform had happened yet. Here, you are assuming that all the slopes that describe evasion are the same before and after reform; the only thing that changes is the level of reform conditional on the predictors. When using panel data, you need to worry about serial correlation. See this paper, for example: Bertrand, Marianne, Ester Duflo, and Sendhil Mullainathan. 2004.
