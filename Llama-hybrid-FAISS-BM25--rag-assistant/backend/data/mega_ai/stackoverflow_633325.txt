I must warn that JBoss embedded is a mess. You don't need to believe my word. See the forums for yourself. It is alpha by all possible means. Things may work for you now but who knows what bugs are still waiting there... Assuming that your project will live for a long time.. that's a risk. You can try OpenEJB. It is limited in some aspects (in terms of flexibility) but it is really easy to use and full compliant with the spec. There are a few links such as this and this . Download it and give it a try. By the way, OpenEJB came to my attention by reading JBoss Embedded Forum posts... from angry users pointing alternatives. Personally, I decided to create for my projects a kind of mock container that allows me to test almost anything I need. For persistence I use Hibernate Entity Manager + HSQL. It took me a week to implement but my teams (2 so far) are very happy with it. I'll make it open-source if possible. The last option is ejb3unit .
