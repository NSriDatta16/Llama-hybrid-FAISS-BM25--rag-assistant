How to resolve country and nationality entities?

I've tried stemming and lemmatization on this but nothing has quite worked so far. How can I resolve country name and nationality as a singular entity? For example: Canada and Canadian should just be one entity: Canada Uganda and Ugandan should just be Uganda It does seem like stemming is one approach here. I just have found it misses a fair number of countries.
