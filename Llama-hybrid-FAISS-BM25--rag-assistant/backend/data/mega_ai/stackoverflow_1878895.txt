There are a number of doable things, but none may be of your liking. Upgrade to Flash 10. The problem of fonts being non anti-aliased is windows-only : linux and macOs both anti-alias device fonts correctly anyway. Now, from Flash 10, it works on windows too, but you need to compile for Flash 10 for it to work. This is probably the best way if you can afford to target Flash 10. Limit the number of characters you can use, and embed only the needed characters. This will work on any Flash version, but might not be practical in many cases. Give up and use device fonts : if both the above ways are not possible in your case, I think this is really a shouganai case.
