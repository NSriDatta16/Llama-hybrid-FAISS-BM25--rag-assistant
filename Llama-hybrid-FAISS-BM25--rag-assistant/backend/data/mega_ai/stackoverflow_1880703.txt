Here are a few things I can give you after spending a fair bit of time developing on the platform in the last fortnight or so: There's no RESTful API. They have a soap based API that you can call, but there is no way of making true restful calls There's no simple way to take their SObjects and convert them to JSON objects. The visual force pages are ok until you want to customize them and then it's a whole world of pain. Visual force pages need to be bound to SObjects otherwise there's no way to get the standard input fields like the datepicker or select list to work. The eclipse plugin is ok if you want to work by yourself, but if you want to work in a large team with the eclipse plugin forget it. It doesn't handle synchronizing to and from the server, it crashes and it isn't really helpful at all. THERE IS NO DEBUGGER! If you want to debug, it's literally debugged by system.debug statements. This is probably the biggest problem I've found Their "MVC" model isn't really MVC. It's a lot closer to ASP.NET Webforms. Your views are tightly coupled to not only the models but the controllers as well. Storing a large number of documents is not feasible. We need to store over 100gb's of documents and we were quoted some ridiculous figure. We've decided to implement our document storage on amazons S3 infrastructure Even tho the language is java based, it's not java. You can't import any external packages or libraries. Also, the base libraries that are available are severely limited so we've found ourselves implementing a bunch of stuff externally and then exposing those bits as services that are called by force.com You can call external SOAP or REST based services but the message body is limited to 100kb's so it's very restrictive in what you can call. In all honesty, whilst there are potential benefits to developing on something like the force.com platform, for me, you couldn't use the force.com platform for true enterprise level apps. At best you could write some basic crud style applications but once you move into anything remotely complicated I'd be avoiding it like the plague.
