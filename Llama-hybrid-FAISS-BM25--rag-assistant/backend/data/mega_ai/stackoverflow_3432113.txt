I had a similar problem, where I did want to postload some javascript. What I did is separating loading the html-fragment and loading the script into two calls. For loading the script I call the following function (I have JQuery handling the ajax part): function loadModule(name, callback) { $.ajax({type: "POST" , url: "/js/" + name , dataType: "script" , success: callback }); }
