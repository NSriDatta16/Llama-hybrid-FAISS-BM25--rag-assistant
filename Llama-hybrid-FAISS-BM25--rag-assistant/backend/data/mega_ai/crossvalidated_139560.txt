What do you mean by "average"? Do you mean that your model for measured line length is $L = L_{avg} + \epsilon^{line}_{i} + \epsilon^{measure}_{i,j}$ (basically, there's some variance in line length and some variance in measurement on top of that) and you're trying to estimate $L_{avg}$ given a number of lines and measurements? If so, then this is a simple case of a multilevel model . For instance, you could fit it in R with glmer(length ~ (1|line)) and extract the global average from the global intercept term. (And the length of each line from that line's intercept term.) In fact, it's such a simple case that there might be a simpler way to estimate it; perhaps someone more familiar with multilevel models can correct me.
