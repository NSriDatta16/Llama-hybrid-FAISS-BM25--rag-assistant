Does it make sense to always use bootstrapping with regression models?

I was wondering if there is any reason to not always use bootstrapping when estimating regression coefficients? If I use the full sample, I only get one estimate which might be driven by specific observations in the sample. If I use bootstrapping, however, I can average a lot of estimates and perhaps receive coefficients with less noise. Thus, I am wondering why coefficients in research papers are so seldom reported bootstrapped but rather from a single regression with occasional robustness checks.
