Pseudo R Square is very easy to calculate manually. You just need to look up the -2LL value for the baseline based on the average probability of occurrence of the binomial event. And, you need the -2LL value for the actual Logistic regression. Let's say the -2LL value for the baseline is 10 and for the Logistic regression model it is 5. Then, the calculation of the Pseudo R Square is: (10 - 5)/10 = 50%. Another common Pseudo R Square measure is the McFadden R Square that generates the same result. Its calculation is: 1-(5/10) = 50%. The Pseudo R Square measures do tell you how much your Logistic Regression model reduces the error vs simply guessing the average probability of occurrence for every observations.
