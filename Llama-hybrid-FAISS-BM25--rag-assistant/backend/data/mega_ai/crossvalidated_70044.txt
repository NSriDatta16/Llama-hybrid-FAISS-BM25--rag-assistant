You might want to look at How to statistically compare two time series? as it treats the question of discriminating between time series. Essentially a common model is used to estimate parameters both globally AND individually. The error sums of squares are then compared to determine if a significan reduction is obtained by individual estimation as compared to global estimation. Upon concluding that there are benefits from individual estimation one needs to identify which ones are different from the "others" . This is akin to finding which means are different from other means.
