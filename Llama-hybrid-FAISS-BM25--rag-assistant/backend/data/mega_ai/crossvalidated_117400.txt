average difference between two sets of values

I've been keeping track of my car's gas mileage by calculating gallons divided by miles traveled miles traveled divided by gallons. The car itself calculates this mileage as well, but its values are always a little higher than the calculated values. I was just wondering about the best way to calculate, I guess, the average or typical amount that the car's numbers are different from mine. My understanding of statistics is pretty much nil, so I was hoping somebody could point me in the right direction.
