I am displaying a modal popup dialogue. The contents of the dialogue box is taken from a text file located in the server and i am reading the content using $.ajax() call. The functionaliy is not affected even when i open the page in IE6/7/8. But above javascript error is shown when i open the page in IE8, When I change the mode to IE7 it works great (Tools --> Developer Tools --> Browser Mode IE7). Does anyone has resolution to this. Some of the posts suggested using latest version of jQuery UI library. But i have been using it already. Plase help....
