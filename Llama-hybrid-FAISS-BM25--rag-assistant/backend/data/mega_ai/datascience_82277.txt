What algorithm should I use to get a mapping between two variables?

I have a dataset that contains for every row, a list X of x items, that is a subset of X_total, and a list Y of y items, that is a subset of Y_total. |Row| List X | List Y | |1 | A, B | 1, 4 | |2 | A, D, F | 2, 3, 6 | |3 | B, E | 5 | |4 | G, W, N | 1, 2, 5, 7| |5 | W, G, D, T | 3, 5 | I want to learn a mapping of X -> Y, so that when new items x appear, I want to know which items in y are likely to appear based on past history. The dataset has ~4k rows. So far I tried a simple Sequential Model in Keras, but with 2000 inputs and 4000 outputs the results are meaningless , I think there could be a smarter way. I think Embeddings might be a good path to follow, because they can group together items of X that "tweek" the same Y's. Any suggestions ? Something like RNN's ? Any useful links trying to solve some kind of similar problem ?
