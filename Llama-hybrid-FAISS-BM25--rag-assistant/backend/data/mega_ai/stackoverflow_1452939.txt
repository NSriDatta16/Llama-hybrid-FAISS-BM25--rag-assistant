I also like the fact with IEnumerable that you can enhance the underlying type of the collection with methods and properties which makes implementation far more elegant, and the code more maintainable. For example the FullName property. You can also add extension methods to the class if it is out of your control. public class SomeUser { public string FirstName { get; set; } public string LastName { get; set; } public string FullName { get { return String.Format("{0} {1}", FirstName, LastName); } } }
