Apart from the excellent reasons given by AndreyT for using DEFINES rather than constants in "C" code there is another more pragmatic reason for using DEFINES. DEFINES are easy define and use from (.h) header files, which is where any experienced C coder would expect to find constants defined. Defining consts in header files is not quite so easy -- its more code to avoid duplicate definitions etc. Also the "typesafe" arguments are moot most compilers will pick up glaring errors suchh as assing a string to and int, or, will "do the right thing" on a slight mismatch such as assigning an integer to a float.
