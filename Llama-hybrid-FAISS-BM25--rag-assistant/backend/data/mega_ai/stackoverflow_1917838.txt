http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/lights.htm See #18.050 In short, you need to make sure you're defining your light position in the right reference frame and applying the appropriate transforms each frame to keep it where you want it. Edit: With the removal of the fixed function pipeline in OpenGL 3.1 the code and answer here are deprecated. The correct answer now is to pass your light position(s) into your vertex/fragment shaders and perform your shading using that position in world space. This calculation varies based on the type of lighting you're doing (PBR, phong, deferred etc).
