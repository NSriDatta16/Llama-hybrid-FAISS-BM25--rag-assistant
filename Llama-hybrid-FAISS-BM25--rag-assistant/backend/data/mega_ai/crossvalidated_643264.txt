I read this graph as showing two groups of observations, with a difference in means of -19.5, and a confidence interval for this difference of (-26.0, -12.5). It is slightly asymmetric, but it extends on average by 6.75 out from the mean. We don't know the confidence level of this interval, but if no information is given, then it is almost certainly 95%. We can use the standard formula for the CI of the mean to work out the standard error of the mean used: $$ \text{CI} = m \pm z_{0.975}\times\text{SEM} = m \pm 1.96\times\text{SEM}, $$ so $$\text{SEM} \approx\frac{6.75}{1.96}\approx 3.44.$$ We get a p value for a one sided test against the null hypothesis of $\mu=0$ (which I assume you are interested in) in R like this: > 1-pnorm(0,-19.5,3.44) [1] 7.198256e-09 Given the assumptions above, and the rounding that went into the graphic, I would report $p , and nothing more precise.
