Cocoa - How to get Mouse Down Events when mouse isn't Dragging?

Cocoa, Mac OS X 10.6. My app (a game) needs to determine if the mouse is down within a view, repeatedly, even if the mouse position doesn't change. The problem: mouseDown will only be called the first time the mouse is pressed and held down. If the mouse is not moved at this point, mouseDragged is not called, and no more mouseDown events are generated. Question: how do I determine that the mouse is still down after that initial (and only) mouseDown event? Thanks.
