I can't give you a direct answer, but I would start by installing Fiddler and investigating the Content-type and last-modified response headers of the files that are causing you problems. Also take note of the If-Modified-Since and Pragma request header values. As well, I would check the Accessibility settings in IE (Tools > Internet Options... > Accessibility). In addition, ensure they haven't installed any add-ons that might be causing this type of behaviour. An unrelated example: a couple of years ago, we had a problem where IE6 stopped sharing Session cookies between browser windows for one of our users. It turned out to be some cursor add-on to IE causing the problem. Obviously if your users are using a locked down copy of IE, the above suggestions don't apply. Lastly, what happens if the user holds CTRL and hits F5 to refresh the page unconditionally, do they get the latest copy of the stylesheet and JavaScript files then? And have you tried clearing the browser history completely and loading a fresh copy of the page (perhaps the cache itself is corrupt somehow)?
