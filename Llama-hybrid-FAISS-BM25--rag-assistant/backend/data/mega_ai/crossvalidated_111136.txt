The standard Bayesian way to solve this problem (without Normal approximations) is to explicitly state your prior, combine it with your likelihood, which is Beta-distributed. Then integrate your posterior around 50%, say two standard deviations or from 49%–51% or whatever you like. If your prior belief is continuous on [0,1] — e.g. Beta(100,100) (this one puts a lot of mass on roughly fair coins) — then the probability that the coin is fair is zero since the likelihood is also continuous [0, 1]. Even if the probability that the coin is fair is zero, you can usually answer whatever question you were going to answer with the posterior over the bias. For example, what is the casino edge given the posterior distribution over coin probabilities.
