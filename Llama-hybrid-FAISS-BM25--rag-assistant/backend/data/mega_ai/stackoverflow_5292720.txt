Floating DIV in table cell in IE

first fo all, sorry for my english. I am trying to do dragable and resizible table columns in pure Javascript. I inserted inside a cell 2 areas, one for draging (div) and 2nd for resizing (span) like you can see in example bellow. Everything works fine in Chrome and Firefox but not in IE8. Problem is during resizing when div doesn't fit in cell and jump under cell as you can see "Column1" in image . I would suggest property "overflow:hidden" should fix it, but no luck. CSS: .ui-column-resizable { float:right; height:20px !important; display:inline; cursor:w-resize; position:relative; overflow:hidden; text-align:center; white-space:nowrap; background-color:blue; margin: -2px -2px -2px 0; } .ui-column-draggable { height:17px; cursor:move; position:relative; overflow:hidden; background-color:yellow; white-space:nowrap; text-align:center; } JavaScript: column.innerHTML = " &nbsp; " + " " + column.innerHTML + " "; http://jsfiddle.net/A5kVs/2/
