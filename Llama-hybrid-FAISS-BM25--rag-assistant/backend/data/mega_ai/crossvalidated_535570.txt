Which averages are you comparing, exactly? More specifically, with which Reputation values? Assuming free viewing is the reference condition, I think the answer may be in the interaction term: for each increment of Priority with 1 unit, there is a decrement of -0.4155 for the free viewing condition, while the decrement is limited to -0.4155 + 0.2342 = -0.1813 for the fixed viewing condition. So provided Reputation scores are sufficiently high, this difference could more than compensate the between condition intercept.
