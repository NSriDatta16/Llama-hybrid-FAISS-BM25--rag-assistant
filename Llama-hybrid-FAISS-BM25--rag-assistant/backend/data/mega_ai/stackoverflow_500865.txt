I never stumbled across something like that. And I don't think that something like that would be useful. That higher-level language would be very verbose and my guess is that you'd need pretty long statements to come up with a regular expression of average complexity. Maybe you just haven't been using regular expressions often enough. Believe me, my memory is far from being eidetic (or even good), but I rarely have problems crafting regular expressions or understanding those of my coworkers.
