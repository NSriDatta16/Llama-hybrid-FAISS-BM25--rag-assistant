How to forecast timeseries based on different events?

I have a few IoT sensors around my house that over time store some events with timestamps. Each sensor has a unique type e.g. ‘front’ or ‘back’. Let’s call this set X. Now I have one sensor which value is dependent on X. I have a value for approximately every 5 minutes over the last year. Let’s call this set Y. Now my goal is to create a model that given a current point and and a few hours of history (X events have influence on Y for longer time), it gives me the forecast of Y for the next 3 hours. How would one go and create such a model? Any common architectures for such inputs and outputs? I’d like to setup a neural network to allow to find patterns between different IoT sensors.
