Yes, there's definitely something wrong. A service endpoint WCF must always supply the ABC - Address, Binding, Contract. You only define the binding in your config - and that's exactly what the error message says - your address is null. So your config fragment should look something like: The Address defines where the service endpoint lives, at what address it's available to the outside world. If you have no address, then the service cannot talk to the outside where. It's there WHERE of your service. If you host your service in IIS, using a *.svc file, you might be leaving this address empty, since the service address is determined by the server and virtual directory where the *.svc file lives - but you still need to supply an address="" entry to your service / tag! The Binding defines how the service interacts - what protocol, what security settings etc. - it's the HOW of your service. And the Contract in the end defines (through a service contract, typically an interface in your service definition) what service methods (functions) are available to a caller. You must supply a contract, otherwise the caller has no way of knowing what methods he can call on your service. It's the WHAT of the service.
