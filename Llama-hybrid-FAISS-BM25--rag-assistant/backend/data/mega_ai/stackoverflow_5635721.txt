Sorry, slightly misunderstood your question but I'll keep my initial comments Remember that stored procedures return a result set , not a value; unless you count the value returned in a return statement. Therefore you need a type to wrap around the columns and rows that are returned. You can change the return type to a table if you know the SP returns a rowset that maps to one of your table types. But you are not going to be able to just return 'an int'. See this link: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/linqprojectgeneral/thread/1667a989-08a0-402c-9358-e4637406a75f (sorry it's over on MSDN forums - not SO :$) and the linked topic from that http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386975.aspx Update L2S uses the equivalent of SQL reflection to figure what an SP returns in order to auto-generate the result. If the SP doesn't SELECT , or if it only has a RETURN in it, you will get a basic int return type for your mapped function. This kind of thing can happen legitimately or erroneously if the SP uses IF statements to fork and return different results accordingly; L2S cannot possibly figure out a single return type that can satisfy all possible outcomes, and so it just plumps for one of them. As @JohnOpincar mentions in his comments, there is a question mark over whether the SP you've posted here is actually the one you've mapped - since the names are not the same? My guess is that you've dragged on the wrong SP - and that's only got a RETURN in it, or it returns multiple things and L2S has borked. Update 2 Okay - so you've changed the names in the source. My recommendation is to delete the SP from the L2S designer (and any other manual attempt you may have for this SP), and drag it back on again from the Server Explorer, making sure it's the same server/db you drag it from. With the SQL you've posted, L2S will most definitely be able to figure out what the result set is as it's very simple.
