On the off chance you haven't seen it, it's worth considering what independence is. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)#For_real_valued_random_variables What should we take into account in the definition of these variables to determine if they are truly paired or independent? Loosely, if there's another specific member in the other group whose value should tend to be more like this one than it would be (on average) if you replaced it with a random member of the other group, that's paired. As a result, the variance of the within-pair difference in paired data tends to be smaller than the variance of the difference of two randomly selected values from each group. If you could notionally replace some putative paired value with a randomly chosen other one without changing anything, you would often tend to treat it as independent (though strictly speaking that's a form of exchangeability rather than independence; if you have the first but not the second that means you have a particular kind of dependence that you're not accounting for, but going into that would get away from the specific distinction you're after here)
