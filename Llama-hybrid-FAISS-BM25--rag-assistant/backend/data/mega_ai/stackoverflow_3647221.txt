Ruby Net::HTTP::Get and JSON responses

I'm trying to connect to an API and retrieve the json results with my rails app, however it doesn't seem to work. Take for example: @request = Net::HTTP::Get.new "http://example.com/?search=thing&format=json" When I try the url in my browser it works! and I get JSON data, however when I try that in Ruby the body is nil. >> y @request --- !ruby/object:Net::HTTP::Get body: body_stream: header: accept: - "*/*" user-agent: - Ruby method: GET path: http://example.com/?search=thing&format=json request_has_body: false response_has_body: true Any thoughts?
