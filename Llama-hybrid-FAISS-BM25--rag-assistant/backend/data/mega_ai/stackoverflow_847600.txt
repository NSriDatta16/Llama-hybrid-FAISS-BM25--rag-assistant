I wonder how could I dynamically resized the div's width to fit the text content (without wrapping)? Assuming the content would fit without overflowing, you could use a float without a width set (width isn't required in CSS 2.1 or greater). Without more detail, I can't suggest where to put it or what other properties to set to get the desired effect (eg, floats float down around following content, so put it at the beginning of a paragraph). If you're not concerned with the effect looking perfect on old browsers like Internet Explorer, you could use display: table or display: table-cell , with the caveat that tables don't overflow: they stretch. That stretching may be desirable if you want to avoid overflow of your div, but allow it to overlow the viewport -- eg, a film strip that scrolls horizontally. In that case, altCognito's suggestion of white-space: nowrap would be very useful.
