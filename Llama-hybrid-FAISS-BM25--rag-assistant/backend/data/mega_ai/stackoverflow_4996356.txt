I'm actually in the opposite situation, learning Java while being a long-time AS3 developer. It's interesting that you're finding a lot of differences, as I'm actually finding similarities. The things that are probably most different are that AS3 has functions that are first class objects, and thus can be passed around Time measurement in AS3 is heavily dependent on the concept of the ENTER_FRAME event (though you do have the ability to create Timer objects, screen updates happen as close as possible to the ENTER_FRAME interval). You do NOT want to "sleep" execution in AS3 (no matter how much you think you might) as Flash wants very badly to be able to keep rendering the screen, and anything that would prevent code from executing (such as perhaps churning through a ten-million iteration for-loop) will stop the renderer from updating. If this continues past 15 seconds, "bad things" will happen. Flash is single-threaded, though you can simulate threads with Timer objects (maybe or maybe not a good idea. You gain no performance benefits at all from this, unless you use the timer to chop up execution of a ridiculously long process). As for similarities The type system is optional, but encouraged (and very much like Java's, except with different syntax). They both have single inheritance / multiple interface style OOP. They both have the same style of package structure for their classes They both have a notion of Exceptions, though in Flash you can think of all exceptions as being RuntimeExceptions and there is no such thing as a checked exception. As far as tutorial sites, that depends on what you really want to do with Flash. Are you looking more at doing games? RIAs?
