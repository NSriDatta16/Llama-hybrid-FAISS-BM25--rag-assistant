Parsing a text file

guys. I have a task and would like to hear your advice on implementation details. I have a file which contains information about clients and their accounts. FIRST_NAME=Joe LAST_NAME=Bishop RECEIPT.0.ID=123 RECEIPT.0.CURRENCY=USD RECEIPT.1.ID=3654 RECEIPT.1.CURRENCY=EUR ....................... CARD.0.TYPE=VISA ....................... FIRST_NAME=Peter LAST_NAME=Swalsky ............... And so on. So I need parse this information into classes like Account etc. Shall I use Scanner class with certain match pattern and parse information step by step or there might be another elegant way to do that? Thank you so much in advance.
