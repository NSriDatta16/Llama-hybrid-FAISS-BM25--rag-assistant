I think what you are asking is "How do I measure the time it takes for the process to run, irrespective of the 'external' factors, such as other programs running on the system?" In that case, the easiest thing would be to run the program multiple times, and get an average time. This way you can have a more meaningful comparison, hoping that various random things that the OS spends the CPU time on will average out. If you want to get real fancy, you can use a statistical test, such as the two-sample t-test, to see if the difference in your average timings is actually significant.
