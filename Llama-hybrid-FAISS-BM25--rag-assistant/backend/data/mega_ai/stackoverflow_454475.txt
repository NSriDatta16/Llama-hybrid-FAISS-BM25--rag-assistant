What does n-tier mean to you?

I have noticed over the years that different developers have different criteria for what constitutes a tier in the development of an n-tier system so I was curious about what the consensus is here at stackoverflow. Is separate logical layers sufficient to call it a separate tier or does it have to be deployable on a separate server (physical or virtual) in order to call it a separate tier? Let me phrase the question a little bit differently. If the calling mechanism can only be in process, thread local, or apartment local, then is it possible to claim that it is two different tiers depending on how the classes are organized into libraries or packages?
