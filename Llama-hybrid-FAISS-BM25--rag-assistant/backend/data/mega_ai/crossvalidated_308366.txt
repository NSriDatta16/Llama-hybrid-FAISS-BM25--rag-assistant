Why don't you do bag of words then? then take not of only those that are the most common say the 5000 most common words. You could also apply minimum or maximum word frequency. Which means that if the frequency of the word is less than 10 then you should disregard it, If the frequency of the word is say equals to the number of set of words that you have (which mean s it's in all of the sets), disregard it. If you want to do document embedding. you can try gensims doc2vec or word2vec. here and here
