You are complaining that your timeseries is only observed at discretized points, perhaps weekly. Yet the way you've formulated the problem implicitly makes the very strong assumption that prices are drawn from a smoothly differentiable manifold. So impute intermediate points, turning the observed timeseries into a continuous function. select look back and holding periods Prefer: "select look back and holding intervals". That is, rather than looking back 3 rows in a spreadsheet, you can instead look back 21 Ã— 86_400 == 1_814_400 seconds. And plug that into your linear interpolation imputer. Or use splines. Or a moving average that is windowed, or is exponentially smoothed, whatever.
