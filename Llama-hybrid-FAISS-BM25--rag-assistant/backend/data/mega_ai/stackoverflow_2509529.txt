Calling the same xsl:template for different node names of the same complex type

I'm trying to keep my xsl DRY and as a result I wanted to call the same template for 2 sections of an XML document which happen to be the same complex type (ContactDetails and AltContactDetails). Given the following XML: Bob 1 High Street TownName AB1 1CD test@test.com 3 Market Square TownName EF2 2GH bob@bob.com I wrote an XSL Stylesheet as follows: When i try to run the style sheet it's complaining to me that I need to: To use a result tree fragment in a path expression, either use exsl:node-set() or specify version 1.1 I don't want to go to version 1.1.. So does anyone know how to get the exsl:node-set() working for the above example? Or if someone knows of a better way to apply the same template to 2 different sections then that would also really help me out? Thanks Dave
