WinForms is the informal name given to Windows Forms, the graphical application programming interface (API) included as a part of Microsoft's .NET Framework, which provides access to the native Microsoft Windows interface elements by wrapping the existing windows-api in managed code. Wikipedia In addition to the Microsoft .NET Framework, a Windows Forms clone is available in Mono . A Windows Forms application is an event-driven application supported by Microsoft's .NET Framework. Unlike a batch program, it spends most of its time simply waiting for the user to do something, such as fill in a text box or click a button. Wikipedia Tag usage Questions in this tag should also be tagged with the target framework - .net or mono . Where a specific programming language is involved the language should also be tagged. Examples: c# , vb.net Some controls also have their own tags and if the question covers such a control in any substantive way adding the relevant additional tag is recommended. Examples: datagridview , webbrowser-control . Features All visual elements in the Windows Forms class library derive from the Control class. This provides a minimal functionality of a user interface element such as location, size, color, font, text, as well as common events like click and drag/drop. The Control class also has docking support to let a control rearrange its position under its parent. The Microsoft Active Accessibility support in the Control class also helps impaired users to use Windows Forms better. Besides providing access to native Windows controls like button, textbox, checkbox and listview, Windows Forms added its own controls for ActiveX hosting, layout arrangement, validation and rich data binding. Those controls are rendered using GDI+ (or libgdiplus for Mono WinForms). Noticeably, Mono's WinForms clone is far from complete, Missing certain API. Bugs (in both libgdiplus and Mono WinForms) without fixes or workarounds. No backend for recent macOS releases (as macOS deprecated the 32 bit Carbon backend used by Mono WinForms).
