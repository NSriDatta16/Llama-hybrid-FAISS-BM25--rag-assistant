In a plug-in 2 JRE (1.6.0_10+), you can use JWS extensions for embedded applets. This is important because JWS makes it much easier to ensure the correct binaries are on the run-time class path. AFAIU JOGL and Java 3D both offer JWS extensions for their APIs. Should you choose to go that way, please make the applet has the draggable parameter added, so the end user might choose if they want a (mostly useless) browser window wrapped around a 3D animation.
