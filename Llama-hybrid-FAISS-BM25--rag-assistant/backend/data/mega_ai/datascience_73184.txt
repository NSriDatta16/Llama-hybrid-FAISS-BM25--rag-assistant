Problem with the hub.load function in tensorflow ( TypeError: Autotrack object is not callable)

I have a problem with loading pretrained module for an NLP task and the problem is because of the tf migration I suppose. Tensorflow website says that the problem might be sorted if the signature variable is given correctly. Can you help me correct this code ? TypeError: 'AutoTrackable' object is not callable [code] import tensorflow_hub as hub # enabling the pretrained model for trainig our custom model using tensorflow hub module_url = "https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-large/3" embed = hub.load(module_url) # creating a method for embedding and will using method for every input layer def UniversalEmbedding(x): return embed(tf.squeeze(tf.cast(x, tf.string)), signature='default', as_dict=True)["default"]
