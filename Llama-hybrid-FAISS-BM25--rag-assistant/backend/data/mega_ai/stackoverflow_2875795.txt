You will need to do a few things: Keep track of the active textfield (use textFieldShouldBeginEditing, for example) Catch touches in your View Controller and if they do not occur in the active textField, cause the active textField to resignFirstResponder and have the new textField becomeFirstResponder. The following code is untested but should be a good starting point. Note that it will also cause your textField to lose focus if you tap on anything else outside of the active textField. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; if ([currentTextView isFirstResponder] && [touch view] != currentTextView) { [currentTextView resignFirstResponder]; if ([[touch view] isKindOfClass:[UITextField class]]) [[touch view] becomeFirstResponder]; } [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; }
