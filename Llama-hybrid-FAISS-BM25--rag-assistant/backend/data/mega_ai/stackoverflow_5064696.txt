Accessing BDB file fails on linux using Perl

I have a program that reads a very large data file from Berkeley DB [ which is mounted on a SAN Storage ]. This works perfectly fine on a solaris machine using perl5.6.0 version. However, the same program returns fewer values read from the same file on a linux machine. Is this a problem with the size of the data file? Any pointers to solve this mystery are welcome. Thanks, Shobha Deepthi edit to include Shobha's reproducer (from comments): #!/usr/cisco/bin/perl5.6 use strict; use DB_File qw($DB_HASH); my $db_file = "/vws/aak/qddts/data/value_cache/To-be-fixed"; my $db_ref; my %db; if (tie(%db, 'DB_File', $db_file, O_RDONLY, 0444, $DB_HASH)) { $db_ref = \%db; print Dumper($db_ref); } 1;
