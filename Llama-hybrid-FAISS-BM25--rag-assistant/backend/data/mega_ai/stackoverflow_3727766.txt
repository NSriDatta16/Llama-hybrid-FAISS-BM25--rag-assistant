Using exclusively the example you've given there is no difference whatsoever between the two methodologies. You could extrapolate to find differences, but they are not actually present. My guess is that you are trying to implement a class without designing it first. Because the picture is not complete, there are no obvious reasons to choose one methodology over the other. When you start to flesh out exactly what you want to do, you will likely discover that method one binds the filtering routine to the class, whereas method two encourages the routine to be separated from the class. Method one Works on side-effects Overwrites original data Cannot be reused on other data Method two Whereas method one could be easily modified to remember that it has already done the filtering, method two will struggle especially when trying to keep it abstracted Because of its abstraction, filterResults is no longer a logical name but rather something like applyXyzFilter , which is hard to justify keeping in the class
