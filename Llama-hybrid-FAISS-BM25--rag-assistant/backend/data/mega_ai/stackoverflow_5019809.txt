Dynamic link library does not generate a .lib file when compiled (Visual Studio C++ Express)

As part of learning C++, I wrote a simple class library + application that references it. Everything builds, except the class library does not generate a .lib file, which results in the application throwing a "LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file". This seems very reasonable; obviously, if a necessary file isn't there, there's an error and it's fatal. (Side note: I don't have a book yet) So, I went looking for reasons a .lib file might not be generated. My search-fu, by the way, is rather weak. All I did find was that, if the library did not have any __declspec(dllexport) tags, it would not export a .lib. I shall now post the header and .cpp contents of the class library (A simple "Console" class with one "Write(std::string)" method). Header: // Extensions.h #pragma once #include "stdafx.h" namespace Extensions { __declspec(dllexport) class Console { public: __declspec(dllexport) static void Write(std::string text); }; } I am unsure whether I need to tag the function when I've tagged the class, but I can check that when it works. And the .cpp file: // This is the main DLL file. #include "stdafx.h" // #include "Console.h" namespace Extensions { void Console::Write(std::string text) { std::cout I've checked and it is set to generate a dynamic link library. Thanks.
