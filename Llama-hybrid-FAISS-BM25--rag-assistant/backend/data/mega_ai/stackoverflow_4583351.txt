C# Drag and Drop Effect with Overlay/Opaque Image

I think this would be simple question and should be asked in the pas few years but unable to google around and dont know if there is a specific keyword. In c# WinForm I want to do drag and drop but I dont want the image of DragDropEffects Move, Copy or whatever. I want to display an image with half opaque. Just like Firefox when dragging an image, you would see the image folowing the mouse pointer like a ghost :) I already Implement DoDragDrop, DragEnter and DragDrop events. I just want to customize the dragging effects with overlay image.
