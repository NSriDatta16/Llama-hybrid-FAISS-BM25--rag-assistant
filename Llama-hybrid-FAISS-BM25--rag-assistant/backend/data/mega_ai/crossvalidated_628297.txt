Besides the reasoning flaws explained in the other answers, other possible flaws in Lilith's presentation of the situation are: Talking about " this machine". If there are other machines not really different from this one but that have experienced failure, this is possibly a case of cherry-picking . Not defining what a success is. Is a success teleporting someone and keeping them alive at the end of the process? Or is it just teleporting the body, no matter if the person is dead or alive at the end of the process? Has the machine even been tested on living organisms before? This might be a case of persuasive definition . In a comment under another answer, you say that she mentions her "right to remain silent on the number of trials". She uses a concept from a judicial context (right to silence) that is not relevant here, to dismiss the idea that she might have a duty to give complete and accurate information. This rhetorical device is sometimes called " Diminished Responsibility ". Not giving complete and accurate information to someone participating in an experiment or a study may be in violation of several laws and ethical guidelines.
