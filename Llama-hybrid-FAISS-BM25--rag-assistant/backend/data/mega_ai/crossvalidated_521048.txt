How can I use validation set for hyper parameter tuning in a direct forecast time series problem?

I have a time series dataset with features corresponding to the same dates as the target. I'm using these features, along with date features such as month, week number etc to build a multivariate model which predicts the target using Random forest. The model is a one step direct forecast, as in I predict the target value for 1 month in future, and then use it to train and predict the 2nd month in future in a rolling format for 6 months. Currently I have 24 months of data as training, 6 months validation and 6 months for testing. My current approach is that I use the 24 months data to train and predict 6 months rolling and use these 6 months against my validation set to measure the error, say MAPE while I tune the hyper parameters to see which combination gives me the minimum MAPE with the validation set. I have started wondering if this is a correct approach to be used with a direct forecast scenario? Are there any suggestions or changes that I need to make?
