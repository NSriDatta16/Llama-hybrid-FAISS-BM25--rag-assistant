You should be linking against QtCore and QtGui libraries but you don't. What does your .pro file look like? Edited to add after the .pro file was posted: Your .pro file looks all right. You're not overwriting the QT variable which by default includes core gui , which should result in QtCode and QtGui being linked to. It's also evident by the fact that both QtCore and QtGui are present in your include paths. I haven't used cl.exe with Qt but you could try adding LIBS += -lQtCore -lQtGui to force linking to QtCore and QtGui. (There's probably a more elegant fix though.)
