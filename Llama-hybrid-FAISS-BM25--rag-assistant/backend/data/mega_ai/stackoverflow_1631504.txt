IIUC, you are trying to copy the values of the structure members rather than the structure as a whole and store it to disk. Your approach looks good to me. I do not agree with those suggesting #pragma pack -- since they will help you get a packed structure at runtime. Few notes: sizeof(char) == 1, always, by definition use the offsetof() macro do not try to instantiate a Data object directly from this targetBuff (i.e. via casting) -- this is when you get into alignment issues and trip. Instead, copy the members out as you did while writing the buffer and you should not have issues
