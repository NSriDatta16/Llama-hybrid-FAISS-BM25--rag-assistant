How to report Ordinal Logistic Regression results?

I am analysing multiple Likert Style statements with an Ordinal Logistic Regression. I have many different factors that I am taking into account, from job to research area to location. I read that it is good practise to put results in a table, with the coefficient, CIs and the P-Value. However I do not want the reams of tables this will generate (as the way to show significance with the OLR is by looking at all factors' P values rather than one for the whole group). Do you think it would be acceptable just to write whether there was or was not significant results for each likert outcome, elaborating further in a text passage for the factors that influenced the result (i.e. reporting the coefficient / CI and P). Apologies I know this is a simple question I just wanted opinion on what is deemed acceptable. Many thanks.
