how to create webshare in a asp.net web application?

We want to offer some file storage capability in our asp.net 3.5 web app and would like users to create web folders by mapping to a particular URL [hosted on our IIS]. this will allow users to simply copy files from their systems to the mapped web folder and save them the task of uploading files, etc. Any ideas on how we can implement a webshare capability on webserver would be really appreciated.
