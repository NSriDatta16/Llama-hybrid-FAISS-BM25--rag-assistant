Are particle filters necessarily linked to state-space models?

I have been asked to look into using particle filters on financial time series. All the sources I have found describe particles filters in the context of state-space models. Are particle filters and state space models intrinsically linked? Can one estimate some properties of a time series using a particle filter without using a state-space model? Say for example, I want to estimate the variance of a time series sequentially using such a filter; what is the difference between a state estimation problem and estimating the variance of my series? Excuse the somewhat basic and confused nature of this question. I would really appreciate some clarity, just so I at least know what to read and what not to look into. To put it simply, one could paraphrase my question as: In order to understand and use a particle filter, must I understand (and use) a state space model?
