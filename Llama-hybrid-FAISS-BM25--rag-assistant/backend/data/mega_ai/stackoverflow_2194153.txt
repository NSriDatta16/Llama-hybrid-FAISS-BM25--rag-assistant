autocomplete dropdown in Infragistics ultrawebgrid cell

I want to an autocomplete dropdown control in the ultrawebgrid cell in edit mode, so user can type the data and value is filled in automatically if exists, invalid data should not be permitted. is this possible? I don't want to use webcombo, it is too heavy and I don't need a multi-column dropdown. I want a simple dropdownlist, but the ability for the user to type just like Google suggest, but all the values cached on the client, no roundtrip to server on each key stroke. the control should be like the following one http://www.asp.net/AJAX/AjaxControlToolkit/Samples/ComboBox/ComboBox.aspx thanks, RK
