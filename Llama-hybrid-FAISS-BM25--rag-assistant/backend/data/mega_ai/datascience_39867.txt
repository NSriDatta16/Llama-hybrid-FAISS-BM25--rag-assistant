Audio signal signal processing for background noise reduction or removal

I am performing simple audio recognition using tensor-flow to spot key word or hot word detection. The graph takes the microphone input directly and performs "Audio spectrometer --> mfcc's --> and input to the neural network." Now i would to like to perform some kind of real time back ground noise reduction or cancellation before inputting the mfcc's into the neural network. I am not sure what kind of algorithms/python packages that are helpful to reduce the back ground noise and If some one can point me to the pieces of code/knowledge base that can help to filter the mfcc's before inputting into neural network.
