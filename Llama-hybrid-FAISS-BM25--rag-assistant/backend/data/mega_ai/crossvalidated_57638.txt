Here's the Bayesian answer. How would the Bayesian estimate the population mean? Assuming a very noninformative prior (with precision zero, see comments), that's simply the average: $$\mu'=1/n\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\approx 6.7$$ Since you know the population standard deviation, you know the population variance $Var=SD^2$, and you know the precision $\rho=1/Var=16$. The Bayesian learning rule for the precision is the sum of the precisions of your observations. You have 3, so $\rho'=3*16=48$, $Var=1/48$, $SD=\sqrt{1/48}\approx 0.144$. So the Bayesian thinks the population mean is normally distributed with mean $\mu'$ and SD $0.144$. The question is: Given your estimate from the observations, how likely is it that the test value 6ppb or less can originate from $N(\mu',\rho')$? We check a standard normal table. Computing the Z score: $$Z=(6-\mu')/sd=-0.7/0.144\approx -4.86.$$ The cumulative table actually only goes as far as $Z=3$, at which point $0.9987$ of the values are below $Z$, hence $1-0.9987$ of the values are below $Z=-3$ (by symmetry of the normal) and even fewer below $Z=-4.8$. Thus, you can reject the hypothesis that the estimated population mean is equal to the test value $6$ with your $\alpha$ level, since $1-0.9987
