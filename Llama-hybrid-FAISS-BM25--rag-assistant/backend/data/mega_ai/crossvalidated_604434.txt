The Poisson goodness-of-fit test is applied as follows. I use R as an example just as you do. First, get the frequency table df You see thus you have territories 2 repeated once, 5, repeated once, 7 repeated twice and so on, but there are holes in the territory values. Fit the Poisson distribution to your data, i.e. compute the sample average: hat_lambda Now, for each territory, compute the expected counts. Each is just the probability under the estimated Poisson to observe the specified territory multiplied by the sample size. Before this, in the above table, we have to supply the other territory values that have not been observed but are probable under the estimated Poisson. There is a bit of arbitrariness in how you supply these additional values. You could bin the values in classes in order to avoid having too many classes with low frequencies. One option could be 23, which all have frequency zero and we bin the values less than 2 and those $>23$ . # sample size N $territories) + 7 # seven further categories x territories)) # categories with positive counts exp_counts = N*dpois(x, lambda = mean(df$territories)) Now compute the chi-squared statistic and the associated p-value (chisq_obs As rightly guessed, the counts are far from being Poisson distributed, i.e. the p-value is extremely small. Note 1. The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of unique observations, e.g. here the length of x , minus the number of estimated parameters, e.g. here equal to one. Note 2. Since the extra categories provided have zero observed counts, each of them contributes to the chi-square statistic by 1. Thus a consequence of using too many categories is that you will inflate the chi-square statistic as well as the degrees of freedom of its limiting distribution. Note 3. Since the $\chi_k^2$ is only a limiting distribution valid for large sample sizes, some writers caution the user of this approximation to be certain that the sample size is large enough s.t. each expected count is at least 5. As you can check in this example, such a rule fails. So if you want to follow this rule, you have to consider another (arbitrary) binning of the territory values in classes s.t. each class has expected value $\geq 5$ .
