F# Units of measure - 'lifting' values to float

When importing numbers from a csv file, I need to convert them to floats with unit. Currently I do this with an inline function: data |> List.map float |> List.map (fun n -> n * 1.0 ) But I'm wondering if there is a more elegant way to do this - or do I have to create my own 'units' module with conversion functions? What would be really nice would be something like this, but I doubt it's possible... data |> List.map float |> List.map lift This is the opposite of my previous question ( How to generically remove F# Units of measure ). UPDATE: For homemade units, I've tried this, which works ok: [ ] type km = static member lift (v:float) = v * 1.0 data |> List.map float |> List.map km.lift or, following the question in this answer data |> List.map (float >> km.lift)
