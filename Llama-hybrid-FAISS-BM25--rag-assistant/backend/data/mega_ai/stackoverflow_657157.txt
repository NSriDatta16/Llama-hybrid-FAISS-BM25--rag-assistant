Dynamically load additional jar files using Web Start / JNLP

The Web Start Developers Guide states All application resources must be retrieved from the JAR files specified in the resources section of the JNLP file, or retrieved explicitly using an HTTP request to the Web server. Storing resources in JAR files is recommended, since they will be cached on the local machine by Java Web Start. Now, I have some resources I want to dynamically load after my application has been started (for example OSGi bundles). I can do this using plain HTTP, but I would like to make use of Web Start's support for local caching and versioned/architecture-specific resources. Is there a way to download additional jar files from the original code base (as specified in the application's jnlp file) using the Web Start infrastructure? Or alternatively: is there already an established way to integrate OSGi and Web Start that would relieve me of the task to install bundles from the Web Start server?
