How to call a method before the method of requested controller is executed : magento

I want to call a method before the execution of every and each controller's method. I don't want to go and call the method in every method. I just want to call it from one place and it will be called before any method of any controller in magento. And I am sure we can do this but I don't know how it can be accomplished. Please provide your suggestions. Hope we can resolve this or may some expert guys already resolved this. Thanks.
