Learning Eclipse Visual Editor Swing with Java

I am trying to create a java GUI project for school using Eclipse Visual Editor with Swing. But i am having a lot of issues learning this since this is the first time i am making a GUI. Like when i drag JPanel into my screen, it creates a function for it, but how do i call it in a separate file? I guess my question is does anyone know of any good resources that can help me learn how to use visual editor (links, books, youtube videos, examples)? Thanks =]
