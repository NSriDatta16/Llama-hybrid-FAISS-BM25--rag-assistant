Start small. Yes, some scaling headaches, but if you want to avoid them completely, use a Platform as a Service (cloud) service provider instead of hosting it all yourself. Statistically, most projects fail, and the added overhead costs are not going to improve your chances. Even very popular and large services have difficulty making money. Hosting companies largely make their money out of the gap between the dreams of a customer and the reality that follows. So, pragmatically, start hosted/shared so you can concentrate on the technology you're developing, rather than on maintaining a remote box, and ascend the tiers as the project gains users/customers. I don't speak from experience, though, except for having dreams that don't get very far.
