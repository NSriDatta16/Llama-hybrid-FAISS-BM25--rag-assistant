PHP - Memcache - HTML Caching

I would like to create a caching system that will bypass some mechanisms in order to improve the performance. I have some examples: 1-) I have a dynamic PHP page that is updated every hour. The page content is same for every user. So in this case I can either: a) create an HTML page, and that page can be generated every hour. In this case I would like to bypass PHP, so there should be a static page and if the database is updated, a new HTML file will be generated. How can I do this? I can create a crontab script that generates the HTML file, but it does not seem as an elegant way. b) cache the output in the memory, so the web server will update the content every hour. I guess I need a memory cache module for the web server. There is a unofficial memcache module for lighttpd, but it does not seem stable, I have also heard a memcache module for nginx but don't know whether is this possible or not. This way seems more elegant and possible, but how? Any ideas? (Again, I would like to bypass PHP in this case) Another example is that I have a dynamic PHP page that is updated every hour, in that page only user details part is fully dynamic (so a user logs in or out and see his/her status in that section) Again, how can I create a caching system for this page? I think, if I can find a solution for the first example, then I can use AJAX in that part with the same solution. Am I correct? edit: I guess, I could not make clear. I would like to bypass PHP completely. PHP script will be run once an hour, after that no PHP call will be made. I would like to remove its overhead. Thanks in advance,
