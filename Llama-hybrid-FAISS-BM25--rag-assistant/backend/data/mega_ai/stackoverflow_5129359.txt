You can certainly store your logic as XML. The question is, how to get it out and evaluate the conditions? A lot will depend here on what language and tools you're using. If you have an expression parser available already (e.g. if you are working in a language with eval() such as Perl, Python, Javascript, and many others), you might be able to leverage that. If you're working in .Net, you might be able to use the windows workflow rules engine (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd349785.aspx). Otherwise, you'll need to borrow some other language's parser (e.g. in .Net or Java you could find a Scheme interpreter or a Python interpreter or something), or you'll have to write a parser of your own. If you've not written a parser before, it will definitely take some time, so you might want to consider leveraging an existing one.
