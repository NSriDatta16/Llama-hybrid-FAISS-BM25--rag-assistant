Is this how you go about calling your Dao's in your service layer?

In your service layer, say you have a method that does XX, is this how you would reference your Dao classes? public class SomeServiceImpl implements SomeService public void DoSomething(int someThingId){ UserDao userDao = this.daoFactory().GetUserDao(); SalesDao salesDao = this.daoFactory().GetSalesDao(); .. .. .. } It gets a bit much to do this, and was hoping if there was a easier more elegant way?
