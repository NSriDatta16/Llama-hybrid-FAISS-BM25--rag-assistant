I think it will certainly make you a better programmer, in a subtle way. A general understanding of how it works will help you be more aware of the code you are writing. I've seen lots of experienced developers that struggle to understand some fundamental concepts when learning a new language. If you know approximately how a compiler works and (maybe more important) how the code is executed you will understand better these concepts. I'm talking about heap vs stack, pointers, etc. It may also come in handy if you need to write code to analyze or translate some text. I once wrote a program to translate some sql conditions to another custom format and writing a small parser for it was the simplest and most elegant way to do it (or so I think :) ) Also, a deep understanding of a compiler may help you to optimize specifically for it, but that can be really hard and not always recommended, as coobird said.
