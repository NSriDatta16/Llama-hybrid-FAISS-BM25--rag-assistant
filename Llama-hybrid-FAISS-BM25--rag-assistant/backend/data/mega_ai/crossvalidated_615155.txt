estimate household expenditure pattern using a multivariate regression model, or other approach?

I am working on my school project, is about the study of household expenditure pattern using regression approach. Say that I having following linear ols regression model, where y is household expenditure. $$ \begin{equation} y= ε+B_0+ ∑_1^k B_k X_k \end{equation} $$ where $y$ is the dependent variable, $X$ are the independent variables, $B_0$ is the intercept term, $B_1,...,B_K$ are the regression coefficients for the independent variables and $ε$ is the error term. And assume I have further information about household expenditure, which is expenditure pattern $(y_1,...y_k) $ such as food, transportation, and health, as denoted by equation below: $$ \begin{equation} y = y_1+y_2+...+y_k \end{equation} $$ I have code a python OLS regression and also a Random Forest regression using household expenditure as $y$ , the dependent variable, and I obtained good r2 scores, about 0.84 for both model. Then, I started to further analyse the expenditure pattern, by developing multivariate OLS and Random Forest, however, the results are very bad, for both models. Below is how I build the model (for linear one). # target_list is the list of expenditure pattern y = data[target_list] x = data.drop(columns = target_list, axis=1) x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y,train_size = 0.8, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 42) y_test = np.array(y_test) lm = LinearRegression() wrapper = MultiOutputRegressor(lm) wrapper.fit(x_train, y_train) y_pred = wrapper.predict(x_test) r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred) mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) print("r2: ",r2) -------------------------------- r2: 0.12448338493025608 I have searched some papers about householold expenditure pattern, but I cannot find a paper that use the multivariate regression approach. Anyone have similar studies or suggestion about my topic? Should I give up multivariate regression approach on analysing the expenditure pattern? Appreciate for any guidance.
