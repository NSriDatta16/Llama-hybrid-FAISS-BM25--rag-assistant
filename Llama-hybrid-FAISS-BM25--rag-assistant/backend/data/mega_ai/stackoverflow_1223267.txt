Ever thought of using Silverlight? Silverlight has Isolated Storage, I have seen several examples out there where developers use isolated storage to store expensive client-side data. http://pietschsoft.com/post/2008/10/Silverlight-Client-Side-Database-via-LINQ-and-Isolated-Storage.aspx And then using js to get the data in an out: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc221414%28VS.95%29.aspx This keeps you from needing any extra DB space because all the user's temp form entries are stored in Isolated Storage, when they return to the page you ask the user if they want to resume their editing... and then populate the form with the data in isolated storage... sounds more graceful that adding a new database? There is a down side that is a machine dependent solution. Depends on the exact goal of the saving of partial forms? Is it so that it can be brought up on other machines? if so this is not the right solution and a DB save is a better evil.
