How about you give each 10 votes a weight of 1 so 20 votes gives the item 2 weight. Then if the item has 0 weight it will loose 0.5 from the average 4.6/20 = 20/10: 2 weight 5.0/2 = 2/10: 0 weight (4.6 * 0.02) + 4.6 = 4.692 (5.0 * 0.00) + 5.0 = 5 - 0.5 = 4.5 2.5/100 = 100/10: 10 weight 4.5/2 = 2/10: 0 weight (2.5 * 0.1) + 2.5 = 2.75 (4.5 * 0.0) + 4.5 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4
