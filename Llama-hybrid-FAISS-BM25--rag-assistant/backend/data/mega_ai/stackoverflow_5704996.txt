Section 14.6 ("Name resolution") in ISO 14886:2003 seems to be the definition of how this is supposed to work. Paragraph 3 says: A qualified-id that refers to a type and in which the nested-name-specifier depends on a template-parameter (14.6.2) shall be prefixed by the keyword typename to indicate that the qualified-id denotes a type, forming an elaborated-type-specifier (7.1.5.3). No mention of the class keyword. I think this is a GCC bug.
