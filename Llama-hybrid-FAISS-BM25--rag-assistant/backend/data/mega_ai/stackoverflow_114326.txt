Converting MS Access "OLE Objects" back to plain JPEGs - best way?

Background: We have an old (but business-critical) SQL Server database with an MS Access ADP front-end; this was originally upsized to SQL Server from a series of Access databases. This database tracks hazardous materials for our customers, and stores a large number of images. These images are inserted from MS Access, and get put into the database as OLE Objects. The problems are: These are a pain to read out in anything except Access/Office There's a MASSIVE storage overhead - ~10GB of images takes up 600+ GB of storage space(!) My question is this: what way would you recommend to convert these bloated objects back into simple JPEGs? Once we do this we can finally migrate our front-end from Access and onto a simple web-based system, and our backup times will become manageable again!
