How to get php page load time statistics?

Recently we've been having problems with our LAMP setup and we started to see the number of MySQL database connections spike up every now and then. We suspect that some mysql operation is taking longer than usual and apache just started to build a backlog of connections to deal with incoming requests. Question is, is there a way to per page statistics on things like average load time? median load time? max/min load time for each php page (page1.php, page2.php, page3.php etc). So that we can narrow down where the problem is. Is there such thing included as part of apache? Maybe a separate module?
