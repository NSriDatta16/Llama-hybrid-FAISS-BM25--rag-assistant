Do multiple measurements on each patient require mixed effect methods if the number of measurements per patient is the same?

For the purposes of this question, let's acknowledge that accuracy is not the best way to measure a model's performance, and that a proper scoring rule is best. However, the decision to use accuracy as the measure of interest is was beyond my control and so we are working with what is available to us. A team of researchers is interested in evaluating a machine learning model against a gold standard. The model is a binary classification model (disease absence/presence) and will be used on 50 patients. Each of the 50 patients will be measured 4 times at 4 different locations on their body. A prediction will be made at each of the 4 locations, and the accuracy of these predictions is of interest. The researchers are interested in determining if the model's accuracy is no worse than the gold standard, suggesting a non-inferiority test for the difference in accuracy. Question There is concern that the multiple measurement may induce a bias due to within patient correlation. Is this concern valid, and if so how may the non-inferiority test be performed? I believe not. Because all patients are measured the same number of times, then the within patient correlation should not be an issue in estimating the accuracy of the model. Things would be different if, say, one patient was measured 20 times and the others were measured twice or if the individual patient accuracy was of interest. Hence, this team can go about computing the accuracy of their model (again, acknowledging there other approaches preferred over accuracy) and can perform a non-inferiority test as usual.
