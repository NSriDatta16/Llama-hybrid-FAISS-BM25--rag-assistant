how an autoencoder denoise an image

i am using denoising autoencoder to denoise the image in the unsupervised way.But still after implementation of the denoisng autoencoder i am unable to understand how an autoencoder network know which kind of noise present so that it minimize it.How it understand it is noise or signal.Are there any mathematics behind it? I hope experts may help me understing this.Thanks in advance.
