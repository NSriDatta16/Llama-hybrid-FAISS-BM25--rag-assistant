Is there a way to do pre-compression with on-the-fly-uncompression in nginx?

It's easy to use the pre-compression module to look for a pre-compressed .gz version of a page and serve it to browsers that accept gzip to avoid the overhead of on-the-fly compression, but what I would like to do is eliminate the uncompressed version from disk and store only the compressed version, which would obviously be served the same way, but then if a user-agent that does not support gzip requests the page I would like for nginx to uncompress is on the fly before transmitting it. Has anyone done this or are there other high performance web servers that provide this functionality?
