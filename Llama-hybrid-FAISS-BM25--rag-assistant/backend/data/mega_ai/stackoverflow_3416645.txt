WCF and Stored Procedure Options

I'm making my first WCF Service and I am unsure which route I should take with stored procedures and Linq to Sql. I understand that I can drag and drop stored procs to my DBML file and call them that way, or call them directly, not using the dbml. Is there a reason why i should choose one over the other? I guess I'm a little confused... Any input is greatly appreciated!
