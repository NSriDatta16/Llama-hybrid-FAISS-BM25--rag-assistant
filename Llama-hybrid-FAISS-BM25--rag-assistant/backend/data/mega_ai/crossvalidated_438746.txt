I'd go with "Rule Based" as opposed to ML-based. "Classical" is very problematic - the first connotation would be "classical ML", i.e. statistical learning without neural networks (e.g. linear regression or support vector machines). "Traditional" is very contextual, and can mean anything in the right context (e.g. "traditional neural network architectures").
