Interpreting GLM output with categorical data

I am having trouble identifying which reference level R is using for my response variable matnew. I know it sometimes chooses alphabetically, which in this case is "Fail", but I'm not sure if actually it would use "Pass" since this variable comes first with A,B,C.. I tried to set the reflevel myself but the coefficient estimates did not change whether I chose "Pass" or "Fail" when I experimented with this. Is there a way to test the baseline level? Another issue I am having is in interpreting the output. For instance, for school MS (reference level is GP) does this mean that going from school GP to MS is associated with an average change of -1.0569 in the log odds of a student passing (or failing, depending on the reference level) math? Thank you for any insight provided. Code: d3$matnew[d3$mat.grade=="A"|d3$mat.grade=="B"|d3$mat.grade=="C"] Output:
