Can a neural network learn "a == b" and "a != b" relationship, with limited data?

For example, I have the following feature set: {a:1, b:1} -> 1 {a:2, b:2} -> 1 {a:3, b:3} -> 1 {a:1, b:2} -> 0 {a:4, b:6} -> 0 {a:3, b:5} -> 0 And some more data points. I don't give features like a == b or a != b . Can a neutral network get the following logic? (a == b) -> 1 (a != b) -> 0 Assume I give inputs like {a:123, b:123} {a:666, b:668} The model never sees inputs such as 123 or 666 before.
