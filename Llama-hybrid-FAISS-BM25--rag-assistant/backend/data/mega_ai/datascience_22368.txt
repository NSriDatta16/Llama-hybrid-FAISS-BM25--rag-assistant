How to do Feature Extraction using Apache Spark

I am a newbie to Machine Learning and I have to do feature extraction for a banking application to detect / predict fraudulent transactions. I have come across few articles on Feature Extraction using Scipy / Sci-kit learn in Python but I want to know is there any way to do the same in Apache Spark using some packages or modules within Spark Any ideas that enable me to use Pyspark is also welcomed here Appreciating your thoughts on this. Thanks in advance
