Is Test coverage going down with JRebel?

it's good practice to write Unittests to be independed of the whole spring application context automate the test you are doing for continuous integration avoid dependency on the Servlet Container I guess with JRebel there's a temptation to test everything in the running application and 'forget' to write Unittests. What's your experience?
