keychains are tightly tied to the concept of User context. therefore if you need a background process that deals with a user's keychain, then you should be using the UserAgent model. because deamons are typically (if not always) root:wheel priveleged, a typical scenario where a daemon would require some kind of credentials would be covered by kerberos (file sharing on a web server, XGrid agents, things like this). by no means should a root:wheel daemon be using the credentials of a user.
