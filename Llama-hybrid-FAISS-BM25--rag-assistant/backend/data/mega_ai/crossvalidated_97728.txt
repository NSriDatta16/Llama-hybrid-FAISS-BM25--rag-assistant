Linear regression is of the form $w^T x + b$. "If we include affine operations...in the set of computational elements," then $f(x) = w^T x + b$ is an affine operation, and so linear regression only applies a single "computational element" to the input, and the graph is of depth one. Similarly, logistic regression is of the form $g(x) = \sigma(w^T x + b)$, where $\sigma(x) = 1 / (1 + e^{-x})$. This as an affine operation composed with a sigmoid, which we're including in the set of computational elements, so by definition $g$ is only applying a single operation to the input $x$ and so it's also of depth 1.
