You should not care when and how GC is called. It is inteligent enough to know when to run and what objects to free. You should also Dispose, either manualy or using "using" all objects, that implement IDisposable. You will then prevent many errors with un-managed resources, like files. And if you are running out of memory, then there is something wrong with your algorithm or code itself. Manualy calling GC.Collect is heavily discuraged, especialy in production code.
