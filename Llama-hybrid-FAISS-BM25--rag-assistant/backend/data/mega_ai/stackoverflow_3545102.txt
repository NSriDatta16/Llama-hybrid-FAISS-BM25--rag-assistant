How to enumerate volumes on Mac OS X?

I am not very proficient in Mac OS X programming, but I am working on a Qt application which needs info about the storage devices. Basically a list of hard drives and USB thumb drives. The end result should be like a vector which contains the following info for each device: string: Label string: Mount point string: Device description (aka friendly name) uint64: Size bool: Is removable? I've been doing it on Windows and the following post Get information about disk drives result on windows7 - 32 bit system have been of a great help. However, although I am very proficient in C/C++ I am not really good in Mac OS X programming, Cocoa and/or Objective-C, so any help would be much appreciated.
