cessing of information from big data sources. Unlike the broader field of data science, which involves any application and study involving the combination of computational and statistical methods, social data science mainly concerns the scientific study of digital social data and/or digital footprints from human behavior. Computational Social Science Like computational social science, social data science uses data science methods to solve social science problems. This includes the reappropriation and refinement of methods developed by data scientists to better fit the questions and data of the social sciences as well as their specialized domain knowledge and theories. Unlike computational social science, social data science also includes critical studies of how digital platforms and computational processes affect wider society and of how computational and non-computational approaches integrate and combine. Digital Methods While most social data science researchers are closely affiliated with or part of computational social science, some qualitative oriented social data scientists are influenced by the fields of digital humanities and digital methods that emerged from science and technology studies (STS). Like digital methods, the aim is here to repurpose the 'methods of the medium' to study digitally-mediated society and to engage in an ongoing discussions about bias in science and society by bringing computational social science and Digital Methods into dialogue. SDS is also related to digital sociology and digital anthropology, but to a higher degree aspires to augment qualitative data and digital methods with state of the art data science techniques. History of the field The origin of term "social data science" coincided with the emergence of a number of research centers and degree programs. In 2016, the Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science (SODAS) - the first academic institution using the SDS name - was launched at the University of Copenhagen. The plan for an interdisciplinary center working at the intersection of the social and computational sciences was rooted in the Copenhagen Networks Study from 2011 to 2016 by researchers from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and the University of Copenhagen. The University of Oxford and the University of Copenhagen were among the first research institutions to offer degree programmes in SDS. In 2018, the University of Oxford launched the one-year MSc in Social Data Science, which was followed by the two-year master's programme at the University of Copenhagen in 2020. Since then, an increasing number of universities have begun to offer graduate programs or specializations in social data science Social data science has emerged after the increasing availability of digitized social data, sometimes referred to as Big Data, and the ability to apply computational methods to this data at a low cost, which has offered novel opportunities to address questions about social phenomena and human behavior. While the origin of social data can be traced back to 1890s (when some 15 million individual records were processed by the US Census in the form of punch cards), the social data boom in the 21th century is a direct consequence of the increasing availability of consumer data resulting from the advent of e-commerce Subsequent waves of availability of unstructured social data include Amazon.com review system and Wikipedia, and more recently, social media, which has played a key role in the emergence of the digital attention economy and big tech. Criticism and debates Data scientists have played a vital role in the data revolution, both during the original tech-optimist phase where big data and the Internet was seen as the solution to many societal and scientific problems, and as participants in the tech-lash that followed in its wake as result of, among other things, the Facebookâ€“Cambridge Analytica data scandal.
