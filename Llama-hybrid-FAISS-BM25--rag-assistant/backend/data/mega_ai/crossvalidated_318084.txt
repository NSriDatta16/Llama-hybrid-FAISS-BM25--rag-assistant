Calculating a confidence interval for a weighted sample

In a nutshell, I'd like to compute a confidence interval for some weighted sample data where the final value I'm seeking is a sum of different weighted samples. Illustrated here with a toy example set of observations: item | value | weight A | 1.5 | 0.33 A | 2.1 | 0.67 B | 6.7 | 0.5 B | 5.0 | 0.5 The value I am interested in is (A + B). The sample mean is easy enough here: I just sum the weighted average of observed A with the weighted average of observed B. My question is how to calculate a confidence interval around this sample mean (A + B). If I was ONLY interested in A, I think I'd utilize the Student's T distribution along with a weighted standard error calculated as described here . I'm struggling to understand how I would propagate that to the sum (A + B), though. Any suggestions? Perhaps I'm overthinking the whole thing already? Any input appreciated.
