android application updates

Possible Duplicate: Is there a way to automatically update application on Android? I am looking to create a private android application for my organization. I do not want to publish it publicly on Google Play, since it is only being used for internal purposes. Is there a way to have the application auto-update? Or, is there a way to publish an app to Google play and make it private?
