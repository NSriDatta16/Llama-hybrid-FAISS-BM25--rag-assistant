Fixed positioning doesn't work on iOS like it does on computers. Imagine you have a sheet of paper (the webpage) under a magnifying glass(the viewport), if you move the magnifying glass and your eye, you see a different part of the page. This is how iOS works. Now there is a sheet of clear plastic with a word on it, this sheet of plastic stays stationary no matter what (the position:fixed elements). So when you move the magnifying glass the fixed element appears to move. Alternatively, instead of moving the magnifying glass, you move the paper (the webpage), keeping the sheet of plastic and magnifying glass still. In this case the word on the sheet of plastic will appear to stay fixed, and the rest of the content will appear to move (because it actually is) This is a traditional desktop browser. So in iOS the viewport moves, in a traditional browser the webpage moves. In both cases the fixed elements stay still in reality; although on iOS the fixed elements appear to move. The way to get around this, is to follow the last few paragraphs in this article (basically disable scrolling altogether, have the content in a separate scrollable div (see the blue box at the top of the linked article), and the fixed element positioned absolutely) "position:fixed" now works as you'd expect in iOS5.
