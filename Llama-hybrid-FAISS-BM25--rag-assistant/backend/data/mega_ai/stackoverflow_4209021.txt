Every time I see this discussed, I try to lobby for their inclusion, because, well, the answer is hidden in here already, although wryly winked away without further thought. When we mistakenly use a keyword as a field or table name, we can escape confusion by various methods, but only the keenly aware back-tick ` allows an even greater benefit!!! Every word in a sql statement is run through the entire keyword hash table to see if conflicts, therefore, you've done you query a great favor by telling the compiler that, hey, I know what I'm doing, you don't need to check these words because they represent table and field names. Speed and elegance. Cheers, Brad
