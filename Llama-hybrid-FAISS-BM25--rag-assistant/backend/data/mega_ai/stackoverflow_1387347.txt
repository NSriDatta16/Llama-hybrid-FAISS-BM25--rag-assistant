I worked on the Zend_Db_Adapter_Mysqli and Zend_Db_Statement_Mysqli classes quite a bit to get this to work, since we wanted to make it conform to the PDO and PDOStatement interface. It was pretty laborious, because of the confusing way MySQLi insists on making you bind variables to get results, and the variety of fetch modes supported by PDOStatement . If you want to see the code in Zend_Db , pay special attention to the functions Zend_Db_Statement_Mysqli::_execute() and fetch() . Basically, the _execute() method binds an array of variable references using call_user_func_array() . The tricky part is that you have to initialize the array so the bind_result() function gets the references. Uh, that wasn't totally clear, so go take a look at the code. Or else just use PDO's MySQL driver. That's what I would do in your shoes.
