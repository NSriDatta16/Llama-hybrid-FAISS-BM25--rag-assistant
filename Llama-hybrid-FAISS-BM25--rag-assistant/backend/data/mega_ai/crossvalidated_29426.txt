Procrastinator and Macro are clearly correct in saying that the house does not need to cheat to win on average and that a sufficiently skilled player will win enough money against amateurs to overcome the house's "rake". However, a greedy and dishonest house has lots of ways to cheat if it wants to. The house could create fake highly skilled electronic players who win often but are, in actuality, owned by the owner of the site. Those players could be given a further advantage by sometimes telling them the contents of the other players hands. And those are schemes that only took a few minutes to think up. Question: Is there any sort of regulatory commission that audits the algorithms? Even in the case of a perfectly honest game, unless your expectation is sufficiently positive and your bank account sufficiently large, a random walk will eventually wipe you out.
