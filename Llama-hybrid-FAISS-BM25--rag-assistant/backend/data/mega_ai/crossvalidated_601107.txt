t-test to check difference between means. Non-binomial metric

I’d like to run A/B test to test average revenue per user (ARPU). As far as I understood, ARPU is non-binomial metric which has a distribution form looks like a very "aggressive" form of exponential. I’ll have at least 10 000 observations in each group. So, is it possible to use t-test in this case? Is it possible to use t-test in case of non-binomial distribution or is it better to use other test?
