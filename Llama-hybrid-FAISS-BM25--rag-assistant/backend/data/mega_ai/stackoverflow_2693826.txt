The elegant way: Name[strcspn(Name, "\n")] = 0; The slightly ugly way: char *pos; if ((pos=strchr(Name, '\n')) != NULL) *pos = '\0'; else /* input too long for buffer, flag error */ The slightly strange way: strtok(Name, "\n"); Note that the strtok function doesn't work as expected if the user enters an empty string (i.e. presses only Enter). It leaves the \n character intact. There are others as well, of course.
