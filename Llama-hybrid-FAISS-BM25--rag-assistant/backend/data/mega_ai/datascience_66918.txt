I have checked/read/watched countless sources on NLP, but at the end only two really made the difference: The best book ever on NLP: Speech and Language Processing by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin. The authors are making all its content available for free on their academic website . This contains 99.999% of the NLP notions needed in a whole ML career, and they keep it constantly updated. Stanford University course on Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning , by Chris Manning et al. This is a very intense course that explains everything from basics to very advanced attention RNNs. Quite challenging at some points, but it's so dense of extremely high quality content. They put all the 2019 course on YouTube . There's so many stuff around that I found on GitHub, books, blogs, ... you name it. But at the end what really made the difference have been these two above.
