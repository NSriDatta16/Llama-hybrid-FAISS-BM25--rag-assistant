how may I do instrumental variable logistic regression?

set.seed(123) n because the variable percent is endogeneous, I cannot perform logistic regression to estimate the effect of percent on mort. We need to use instrumental variable (stage) to instrument the estimation. I know ivreg() function can perform IV analysis, but it is only for continuous outcome. How can I perform binary outcome as in the artificial example? Can anybody provide detailed R code for the analysis?
