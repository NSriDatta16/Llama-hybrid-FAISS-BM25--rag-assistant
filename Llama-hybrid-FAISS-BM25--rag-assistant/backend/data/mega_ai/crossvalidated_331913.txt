How to add a covariate to a contingency analysis?

Scenario Consider you ask kids whether or not they like guns (yes/no answer). You also ask them whether they watched an action movie in the past two days. Then, you are willing to see if there is any correlation between the two, perform a contingency analysis (eventually a Chi square test) and find a significant correlation between the two variables. You realize however that most kids that declare liking guns are boys. Luckily, you know the gender of each kid interviewed and can include gender as a covariate. Question Generally speaking, how to add a covariate in a contingency analysis? For the above example, I could imagine doing a logistic regression with "liking guns" as response variable. What if the variables can take several values. For example what if the question instead was "Who is your favourite actor?" and the question was "What type of movie have you last watch?"? Is there a standard procedure for adding a covariate in a contingency analysis?
