Url.Action uses route values to generate the actual URL's by querying the virtual path provider and attempting to match the most specific route. In the form that you are using, you are supplying values for the controller and the action, which is as deep as most simple websites go, hence the convenient form of the method. When Url.Action queries the routing system, it only has a "controller" and an "action" segment to match. If you give the method the rest of the routing information it needs, it will properly match the route that you desire, and will return the correct URL. Try this: Url.Action("User", "Create", new { token = "o", organization = "organization" })
