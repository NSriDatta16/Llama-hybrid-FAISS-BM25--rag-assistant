Bayesian updating - which distribution to use

I'd like to use Bayesian updating to form price expectations to be used in another model. I'm very new to this area, so your help would be highly appreciated. I'm not sure which distribution to use for the prior. When I use normal distribution, I do not get much variability between prior and posterior. However it would be better if there is more variability. Would it better to use beta or Gaussian distributions for the prior? If so, can I use java for coding? Again because of the model limitations, I cannot use winbugs. Many thanks! Erin
