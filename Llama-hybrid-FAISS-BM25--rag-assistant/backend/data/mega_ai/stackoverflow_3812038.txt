You should use jQuery.load() to load only a HTML fragment and not a full page with the scripts. jQuery use DOM structure of the loaded document to modify the DOM structure of the corresponding part of your page (controls). In general you can use jQuery.ajax to load a script, but I recommend you to use the simplified form jQuery.getScript() instead. jQuery.getScript() can be used to load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request and then execute it. Using success event handler you can do some action after the script are loaded.
