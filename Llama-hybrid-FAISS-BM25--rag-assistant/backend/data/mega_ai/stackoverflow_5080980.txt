Try doing this: #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wuninitialized" foo(b); /* no diagnostic for this one */ This pragma comes in three interesting and helpful flavors : warning , error , ignored . See 6.56.10 Diagnostic Pragmas for their usages. The link says, GCC allows the user to selectively enable or disable certain types of diagnostics, and change the kind of the diagnostic. For example, a project's policy might require that all sources compile with -Werror but certain files might have exceptions allowing specific types of warnings. Or, a project might selectively enable diagnostics and treat them as errors depending on which preprocessor macros are defined.
