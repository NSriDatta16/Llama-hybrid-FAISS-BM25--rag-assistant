Expected Calibration Error indeed performs the binning rather naively based on equi-spaced fragments of the probability space. This is not great for problems with class imbalance, where for example most predictions will be heavily concentrated on the lower ends of the [0,1]-output range. Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) [1] and Test-based Calibration Error (TCE) [2] are two alternative calibration metrics that among others differ in the way that the binning procedure is performed. The former simply bins by quantiles, such that each bin ends up having the same data volume. The latter defines the notion of optimal binning, under which a binning is said to be optimal when it minimises the expected estimation error weighted by the bin sizes, and propose an algorithm that can achieve such an optimal binning.
