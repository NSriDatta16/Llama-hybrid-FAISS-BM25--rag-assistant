I had the same problem with data and no transformation would give reasonable distribution. I came up with the following idea. I would appreciate if someone decide whether it is worth utilising as I am not a statistitian. We may adopt the assumption that 0 is not equal to 0. There is a hidden continuous value which we observe as zeros but, the low sensitivity of the test gives any values more than 0 only after reaching the treshold. So what we observe is more like half-normal distribution where all the left side of normal distribution is shown as one rectangle (x=0) in histogram. So maybe we can just perform following steps: Transform the variable to dychotomic values (0 are still zeros, and >0 we code as 1) We search for another continuous variable with high Spearman correlation coefficent with our original variable. We perform logistic regression which predicts 1. Dependant variable - dychotomic, independant - highly correlated variable We look at predicted values for observed zeros in logistic regression. We recode zeros in original variable for predicted in logistic regression. We leave original values higher than 0 intact (however they must be higher than 1) We rank the original variable with recoded zeros. We normalize the ranked variable with Blom - f(r) = vnormal((r+3/8)/(n+1/4); 0;1) where r is a rank; n - number of cases, or Tukey transformation.
