embed php emoji library with php to accept input and display from a mobile device

i understand this question was asked before however the other thread was not of much help to me. i have the code from Emoji php library that i found on line. the demo works just fine however im having trouble embedding it to my site. any thoughts on how to embed this library with my site so it will accept input and display from a mobile device such as an iphone? The demo is set up so it only displays a set set of icons. \n"; echo " ".sprintf('U+%04X', $unified)." \n"; echo " ".HtmlSpecialChars(emoji_get_name($unified))." \n"; echo " $bytes \n"; echo " ".emoji_unified_to_html($bytes)." \n"; echo " \n"; } ?> i would like my site to display emoji when input from a mobile device such as an iphone. how can i achieve this?
