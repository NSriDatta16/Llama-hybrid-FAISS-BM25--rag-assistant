Forecast survey response rate

I am new to Bayesian forecasting and hope you can help me get started with this problem: I need to forecast the likely survey response rate to a paid-for survey Background information: Each person is paid for participating, so we don't want to contact more people than we need to Each person has up to 30 days to take part Based on historical surveys only about 50% of people will respond but it varies from about 35% to 65% Of those who do respond, 20% do so on the same day, after which the response rate rapidly reduces Here is a graph of the typical response curve (of the 50% who do respond): One other important point: We do not contact all people on the same day! Typically we have a weekly mailshot over 4 weeks. Therefore, at any one time, we could have people from this week, last week and the week before. So here is my question: Using the prior and based on the responses we see so far for each mailshot, can we predict the final response rate?? We have the prior (50%) We have the mailshot1 response rate (now at day 22) We have the mailshot2 response rate (now at day 15) We have the mailshot3 response rate (now at day 2) We have not yet sent the 4th mailshot and I want to adjust the size of this mailshot based on the forecast I have done a ton of online reading and bought a few books but I cannot figure out where to start with this problem because I need to combine the results of each mailshot, none of which have completed the full 30 days yet. I am using jupyter, PyMC3 and scipy if that helps. If you could just get me started, that would be a huge help. Many thanks
