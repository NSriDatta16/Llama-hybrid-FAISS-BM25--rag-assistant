Absolute positioning in gmail emails

I have a client who wants to send gift certificates to people who sign up on their site. They want it all designed out, so I can't just send a text email. I'm trying to position text over the image so that it can still be dynamic. I'm trying to do this with absolute positioning. Some email systems love it. Some hate it. Gmail happens to hate it. We're using MailChimp for the campaign. Here is the full source of the email. Following that is just the snippet that isn't working. *|MC:SUBJECT|* body{background-color:#bab145;text-align:center;}#layout{border:5px solid #999999;background:#ffffff;margin:10px auto;text-align:left;}#header{background-color:#cccccc;padding:0px;color:#333333;font-size:30px;font-family:Georgia;text-align:left;}#content{font-size:13px;color:#4d4d4d;font-family:Helvetica;line-height:1.25em;padding:10px 30px;}.primary-heading{font-size:28px;font-weight:bold;color:#8b0000;font-family:Georgia;line-height:150%;margin:25px 0 0 0;}.secondary-heading{font-size:20px;font-weight:bold;color:#000000;font-style:normal;font-family:Georgia;margin:25px 0 5px 0;}#footer{background-color:#eeeeee;border-top:0px none #ffffff;padding:20px;font-size:10px;color:#333333;line-height:100%;font-family:Verdana;}#footer a{color:#800000;text-decoration:underline;font-weight:normal;}a,a:link,a:visited{color:#800000;text-decoration:underline;font-weight:normal;} *|FNAME|* *|LNAME|* GetFreePellets.com $100 *|COUPONCODE|* view email in browser | Unsubscribe *|EMAIL|* | Update your profile | Forward to a friend *|LIST:DESCRIPTION|* *|HTML:LIST_ADDRESS_HTML|* Copyright (C) *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|* All rights reserved. Sent to *|EMAIL|*. Unsubscribe | Update Profile | Forward to a Friend *|REWARDS|* And just the snippet I'm worried about: *|FNAME|* *|LNAME|* GetFreePellets.com $100 *|COUPONCODE|* Note: MailChimp merge variables are those things between | and | . Here is an image of what it looks like in Entourage. The red bar is a real name, so.. ya: Email working http://img.skitch.com/20100804-m91tny1ck75adfibga6cundcxr.jpg And here is it in gmail (I know the name isn't censored): Email not working http://img.skitch.com/20100804-rfrb1fejjubqr4id56yq1xihdp.jpg Any ideas on how to get this working in gmail?
