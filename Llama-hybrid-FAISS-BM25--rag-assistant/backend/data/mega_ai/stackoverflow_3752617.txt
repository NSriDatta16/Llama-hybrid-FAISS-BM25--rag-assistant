MKAnnotationView image property

I have an MKAnnotationView ( draggable property is set to YES ) with a custom image, set via the image property. When the annotation is added to the map it has the custom image. But the image turns back to the default pin when the annotation is dragged. I also tried to overwrite the image propery everytime the dragState changes. No luck here also.
