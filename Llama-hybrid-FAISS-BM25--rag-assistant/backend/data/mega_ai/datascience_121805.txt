Sentiment Analysis on the first 100 words of a very large essay of 500/700 words

Are there any potential issues on performing sentiment analysis using the first 100 words of a very large essay that is of 500 to 700 words. I am having to do this because since most transformer models have a upper limit of 500 words.
