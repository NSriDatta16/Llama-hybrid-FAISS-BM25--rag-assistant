ORs are not going to give you a complete answer. Rather, I think you are interested in estimating the probability of damage avoided given the spacing between a tree and the sidewalk. You can do this with a logistic regression model, for example. Denote this probability by $p(x)$ , where $x$ is the spacing in cm. The expected cost to replace a single slab is $500[1-p(x)]$ . The expected savings by moving a tree an additional $y$ cm away from the sidewalk would be the difference in expected costs, or $500[1-p(x)] - 500[1-p(x+y)] = 500[p(x+y)-p(x)]$ . Suppose $x=100$ , $y=10$ , $p(x)=0.90$ , and $p(x+y)=0.95$ , then you would expect to save $500[0.95-0.90]=25$ dollars in slab replacement costs for each tree that you plant 110cm away from the sidewalk instead of 100cm away.
