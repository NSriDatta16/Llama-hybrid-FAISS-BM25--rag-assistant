Smoothing train/test data

I am currently working on time series forecasting. I know that the first step is to divide the time series into train and test. Then I also understand that I have to normalize the test set using the training normalization parameters. However, I would like to apply a kind of smoothing by moving averages and eliminate those values that are farther away from $mean \pm 1.5*std$ (the outlier values), but I don't know how it could transfer this smoothing into test data. Can the outliers be removed based on the test data only? The smoothing of moving averages is not possible to use, so I have to use the mean and std of the whole train set to eliminate the outliers of the test data? If you have any other approach on how to eliminate outliers in the test data to improve forecasting is appreciated.
