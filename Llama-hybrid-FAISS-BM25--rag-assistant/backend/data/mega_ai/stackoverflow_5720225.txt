Xcode 4 and controllers with xibs

I have main xib with a splitview controller and ive dragged the ibactions and properties on to the AppDelegate code. So in my applicationDidFinishLaunching i would like to load a controller which uses a xib into one of the nsviews that i have linked up. The problem is that i can't use xcode to link ibactions and properties from the new xib into the controller that is going to load it. Does that have to be done programatically?
