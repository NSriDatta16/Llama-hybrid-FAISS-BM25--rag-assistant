Distance calculation for nonlinear features

Dear Data science community, Please see the attached. I plotted my data using t-SNE. In the figure, group A and B are 100% separable with random forest model. I want to calculate the distance of features in feature space. Do you know any good distance calcuation method for nonlinear data?
