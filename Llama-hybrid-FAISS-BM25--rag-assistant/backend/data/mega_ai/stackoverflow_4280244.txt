caching in asp.net and ado.net

I have a taxes table in the database which changes maybe once a year. our asp.net application has calculations that query the database for taxes based on the customer's province/state a lot. I would like to avoid those round trips. Is there a way I can use caching with Entity Framework 4? So I want the entity based on the taxes table in my edmx, but when I perform LINQ queries against it, I don't want it to go to the database unless the cache has expired. How would I accomplish this? I haven't worked with asp.net data caching before, so some details on the concept would be highly appreciated. I have read the msdn documentation on application data caching, but I'm just wondering how to make this work with EF4 in an elegant manner.
