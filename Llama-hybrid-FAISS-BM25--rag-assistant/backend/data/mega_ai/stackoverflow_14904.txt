If I knew I only had to deal with 5 cities, in a predetermined order, and that there were only 3 routes between adjacent cities, I'd brute force it. No point in being elegant. If, on the other hand, this were a homework assignment and I were supposed to produce an algorithm that could actually scale, I'd probably take a different approach.
