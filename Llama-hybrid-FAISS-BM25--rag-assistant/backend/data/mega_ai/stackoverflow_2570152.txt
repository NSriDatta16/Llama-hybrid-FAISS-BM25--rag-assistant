Nominal Attributes in LibSVM

When creating a libsvm training file, how do you differentiate between a nominal attribute verses a numeric attribute? I'm trying to encode certain nominal attributes as integers, but I want to ensure libsvm doesn't misinterpret them as numeric values. Unfortunately, libsvm's site seems to have very little documentation. Pentaho's docs seem to imply libsvm makes this distinction, but I'm still not clear how it's made.
