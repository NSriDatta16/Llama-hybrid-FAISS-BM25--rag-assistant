Probabilities in the Raven paradox

The raven paradox is roughly: "The statement All ravens are black is logically equivalent to All non-black entities are not ravens . Whenever we observe a non-black non-raven, the probability for the latter statement to be true rises. In turn, the probability for the former statement must also rise. Therefore, we can infer something about the colour of ravens without looking at them." I want to attack the paradox from a slightly different angle than the standard bayesian resolution (which states that one can in fact infer a tiny amount of information about ravens from looking at non-ravens). Let us assume, for simplicity and to increase the magnitude of the expected effect, that only frogs (which, unbeknownst to us, are always green) and ravens are interesting to us. Furthermore, we only recognise the colours black and green. So initially, we hold equally probable that an observation will reveal a green frog, a black frog, a green raven, or a black raven ( $GF, BF, GR, BR$ ). So $p(GF) = p(BF) = p(GR) = p(BR) = \frac{1}{4}$ . We now observe a number of green frogs. This updates our probabilities such that $p(GF) > \frac{1}{4}$ . Since we did not make any other sightings, by symmetry all the other probabilities must be $\frac{1 - p(GF)}{3}$ . What is now the probability of a raven being black? Before the observations, it was clearly $\frac{1}{2}$ . Now it is: $$p(B|R) = \frac{p(BR)}{p(R)} = \frac{p(BR)}{p(BR) + p(GR)} = \frac{1}{2}$$ Weird. I would have thought we learned something about black ravens. Let's double check. What's the probability of a non-black entity to be a non-raven? In other words, what's the probability of a green animal being a frog? $$p(F|G) = \frac{p(GF)}{p(G)} = \frac{p(GF)}{p(GF) + p(GR)} > \frac{1}{2}$$ So while the probability of raven-ness implying blackness did not increase, the probability of non-blackness implying non-raven-ness did increase. How can this be? Is this a known, different paradox? Is my explanation an acceptable resolution to the raven paradox? Or is the probability of a statement being true not so easily related to its conditional probability?
