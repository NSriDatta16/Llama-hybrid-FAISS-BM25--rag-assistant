Adding a separator to the Eclipse Outline view (like #pragma mark)

I know Xcode has a #pragma mark feature where it allows you to insert arbitrary labels in outline views / method lists to document how code is segmented. I haven't been able to find a similar feature for Eclipse. I can't help but feel that it's right under my nose, but searches on both SO and Google haven't been enlightening... anyone know how I might do this? Or is there some hackish workaround? That would be awesome too.
