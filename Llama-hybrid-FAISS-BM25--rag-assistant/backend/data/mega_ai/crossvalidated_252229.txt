Personal Names matching in JavaScript

According to this paper: A Comparison of Personal Name Matching: Techniques and Practical Issues several techniques are possibile in personal names matching, that is the matching of names like â€˜ Gail Vest and Gayle West , Robert and Bob , or Dave Bourget and David F. Bourget etc. Those techniques will have different results in terms of accuracy and performances. In Python there are some solutions implemented like name_tools and in perl as well like Names modules. I'm searching for a similar implementations in Javascript/Node.js
