Compiling position-independent code when not necessary is a performance drag on some platforms (most notably, the register-starved x86 architecture, because PIC takes away a register that can be used more freely when non-PIC), but there should be no detrimental effects otherwise. Going further, it is even possible to create a position-independent executable ( -fPIE ) built out of only position-independent code. That being said, libtool can automatically produce both PIC and non-PIC objects for each source file you compile, and it should be easy to do the same even in a build system without libtool integration.
