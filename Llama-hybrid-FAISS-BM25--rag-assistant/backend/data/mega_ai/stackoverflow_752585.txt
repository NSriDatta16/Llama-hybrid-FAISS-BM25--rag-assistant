You can decide yourself after reading the topic "Planning Your Repository Organization" in the SVN Book . It really depends on your needs. Since you said there'll be a lot of small components shared by many projects (i.e. they are tightly related) I think you'd better have a single repository with separate branches / tags / trunk folders: components/ component_1/ trunk/ tags/ branches/ component_2/ trunk/ tags/ branches/ ... project_1/ trunk/ tags/ branches/ project_2/ trunk/ tags/ branches/ ... That leaves open the possibility for each component to have different branches for different projects (if required). SVN externals may also be useful in your case.
