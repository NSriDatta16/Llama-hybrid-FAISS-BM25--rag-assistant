To orthogonalize a matrix with respect to a vector(?)

I'm developing a code to perform Mie scattering corrections and, while reading a paper regarding this [1], I found this sentence: Prior to approximation by PCA, the matrix $M$ is orthogonalized with respect to the reference spectrum $Z_{ref}$ where $Z_{ref}$ is a vector of data. The matrix $M$ has a spectrum of data in every row, so I thought that perhaps they mean to orthogonalize each row of $M$ with respect to $Z_{ref}$, because an orthogonal matrix is a square matrix $Q$ such that $Q^T = Q^{-1}$, and this does not depend on any vector. Even if they refer to this, I don't know what would be to orthogonalize a vector with respect to another neither (of course I know what are two orthogonal vectors but not sure about what they mean orthogonalize). Any thoughts? Sorry if this question does not fit here. Konevskikh, Tatiana, et al. "Mie scatter corrections in single cell infrared microspectroscopy." Faraday discussions 187 (2016): 235-257 .
