Tomcat is a secure server. However, it is even more secure to use Apache Web Server to proxy it. You can use mod_proxy to connect Apache with Tomcat using AJP or HTTP protocol. This is the safest configuration and you can leverage the many plug-in modules available for Apache Http Server. Some tips for a secure installation: Create a user to run Tomcat. Do not use the root user. Uninstall the example applications. Uninstall the manager application. If you use Apache to proxy Tomcat, you can safely keep the manager and make it available only through your local network.
