Qt -how to know whether content in child widgets has been changed?

In QMainWindow I have 2 QSplitters. In that splitters I have QTextEdit, QLineEdits, QTableWinget, Ragio buttons and so on... I want to know if somthing has been chaged after pressing File->New menu button. Is there any general method for doing this? Somwhere I have read that it is recomended to use isWindowModified() function of QMainWindow, but seems it doesn't work.
