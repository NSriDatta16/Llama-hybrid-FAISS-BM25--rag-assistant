Flash and PHP, live user environment: how do I use sockets?

I've been scouring Google to find out how I can make Flash bring at least two users together in an environment. What I've been trying to do is, for example: both users load http://example.com/myflashenvironment.html , and on that page is the same flashenv.swf file that they both see from two different computers. In the flashenv.swf there is a movieclip object that is draggable. I want to make it so if user 1 drags the movieclip then user 2 can see it being dragged, over the Internet in some kind of online type of deal. I've been trying to do it at runtime, like an online game. I've been searching google and I've found things about sockets, but it's very hard to just jump right in when you are me. I've tried to figure out so far that I need a PHP file that creates a connects to my server with fsockopen , and then I need to create a socket? But then I don't know how to have user 1 write the (x, y) coordinates of the movieclip when he drags it and have user 2 automatically pick up those same coordinates. And please believe me, I used this as a last resort to see if anyone knew what I am talking about. Google just isn't cutting it tonight.
