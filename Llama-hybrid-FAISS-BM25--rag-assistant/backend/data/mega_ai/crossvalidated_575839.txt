Text Extraction and Text recognition

Starting from text I'd like to be able to identify specific informations. Example : Input texts : "The invoice number is 18", "Inv : 75", "Inv N. : 84" Identified invoice numbers : "18", "75", "84" The concrete problem is I have a lot of documents containing lots of this information and I would like to use an algorithm to identify and extract various type of fields. I thought that in theory I'll use some kind of framework / algorithm, input all of my documents and train the algorithm by approving or not the results, but I don't know where to start. I looked into deep learning for unstructured text, machine learning, Stanford NER, Named Entity Recognition as a general concept etc. I would appreciate some guidance on where to start implementing such a solution. Thanks
