As you've rightly pointed out, the ACF in the first image clearly shows an annual seasonal trend wrt. peaks at yearly lag at about 12, 24, etc. The log-transformed series represents the series scaled to a logarithmic scale. This represents the size of the seasonal fluctuations and random fluctuations in the log-transformed time series which seem to be roughly constant over the yearly seasonal fluctuation and does not seem to depend on the level of the time series. Since, we observe annual seasonality, the most appropriate $d$-th order differencing for this data set seems to be the $12$-th order differencing. Then, the log-transformed series is expected to represent a randomly fluctuated log-series. The elimination of the annual cycle seems about right.
