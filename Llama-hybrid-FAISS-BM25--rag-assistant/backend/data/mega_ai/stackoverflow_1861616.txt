Reset style properties of an HTML element to stylesheet-defined defaults?

CSS code: p.myparagraph { color: yellow; } Assume that I've turned the color of elements that use the myparagraph class to red. Is there a way to reset all style properties of paragraphs using this class (not limited to color) to their CSS-defined defaults?
