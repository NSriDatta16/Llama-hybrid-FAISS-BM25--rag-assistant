Visual Studio's debugger visualisations are such a massive productivity boon, especially when working with C# or the C++ STL. It also has previewers for block text, html, xml and even DataSets. The STL support shows vectors, maps, sets and lists. In VS2010 there's also much improved support for multithreading with parallel callstacks . When I have to debug on Xcode or with gdb I feel like I'm dragged back into the dark ages (Xcode won't even show local variables reliably half the time, and getting unicode strings to display is a nightmare)
