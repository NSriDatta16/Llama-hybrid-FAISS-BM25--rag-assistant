JavaScript: Stop the selection of a draggable element

Hey there, I was just messing about in jsFiddle and attempted to make a simple drag and drop. I did not bother with getting the offset etc so as soon as you click it centers around your mouse. On mouse down I return false which I thought would stop the elements kind of 'ghost' from appearing. It did not. I focus onto the body on mouse down just in case it was that but it did not help either. So basically my question is, how can I stop elements being selected? You can find the fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/Wolfy87/HY2u4/ Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks. EDIT: I just tested it in safari and it is fine, so far it only seems to be firefox.
