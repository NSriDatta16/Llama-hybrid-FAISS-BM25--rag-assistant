Debug vs. Release performance

I've encountered the following paragraph: “Debug vs. Release setting in the IDE when you compile your code in Visual Studio makes almost no difference to performance… the generated code is almost the same. The C# compiler doesn’t really do any optimization. The C# compiler just spits out IL… and at the runtime it’s the JITer that does all the optimization. The JITer does have a Debug/Release mode and that makes a huge difference to performance. But that doesn’t key off whether you run the Debug or Release configuration of your project, that keys off whether a debugger is attached.” The source is here and the podcast is here . Can someone direct me to a Microsoft article that can actually prove this? Googling " C# debug vs release performance " mostly returns results saying " Debug has a lot of performance hit ", " release is optimized ", and " don't deploy debug to production ".
