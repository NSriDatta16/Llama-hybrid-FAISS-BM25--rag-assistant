Causal impact: noisy controls lead to strange results

I am using R causal impact to measure the effect of a campaign intervention. Doing some tests, I found some consistent but very strange results. What I did is to generate a time series with weekly seasonality, a baseline, a trend and some noise. After that, I copy the time series and added some extra noise to generate a control. I did not add any increment on post period, so the result I expect is 0 increment. Here is the code: library(CausalImpact) set.seed(1) week_aux What I found is that increasing the noise level on the control, I always obtain a positive increment (when I expect zero), up to 10-15%, even when the noise is not so high (similar level to real data I need to model). Here are the images for the generated data and predictions. The increment in this case is 7%, and 0% is not even include in the confidence interval. Any idea about why this could be happening? Thank you in advance, Javier
