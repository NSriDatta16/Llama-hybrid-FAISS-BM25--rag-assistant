How can I apply a Logistic Regression model in real life?

I just run a LR multivariate analysis to class probability check. From this analysis I could see that the combination of 4-variables would increase my test accuracy. Here is the output of this anaylsis: logit(P) = log(P / (1 - P)) = 13.458 - 0 Variable A - 0.106 Variable B - 0.004 variable C + 0.008 Variable D, where P is Pr(y=1|x). The best threshold (or Cutoff) for the predicted P is 0.15. Original Label: NTB/TB --> Labels in Logistic Regression: 0/1 Note) The class/response value is recommended as (Case:1 and Control:0) Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) Odds (Intercept ) 13.458 8.354 1.611 0.107 - Variable A 0 0 -1.046 0.296 1 Variable B -0.106 0.079 -1.338 0.181 0.9 Variable C -0.004 0.002 -1.649 0.099 1 Variable C 0.008 0.007 1.192 0.233 1.01 My question is, I want to validate this LR model in new samples, how can I them apply it ? Should I simply apply this form: 13.458 - 0 Variable A - 0.106 Variable B - 0.004 variable C + 0.008 Variable D?? I am a biologist with a very limited statistical background. Many thanks to you all
