Goodness of fit tests for quantile regression in R

What goodness of fit tests are usually used for quantile regression? Ideally I need something similar to F-test in linear regression, but something like AIC in logistic regression will suite as well. I use quantreg R package, but found only some Khmaladze test in there. To be fair I hardly understand what is does.
