Custom copy constructor and adding a field

Duplicate of this . In C++ you sometimes have to implement the copy constructor yourself (when you have pointer as a member usually). Over compiler generated copy constructor this has the disadvantage that when you add a member field and forget to add the copying line in the copy constructor, you have a problem, which is often hard to track down. I like to program defensively and this worries me a bit. One solution would be to use memcpy and then just handle the pointers properly, but this is discouraged as I understand it.
