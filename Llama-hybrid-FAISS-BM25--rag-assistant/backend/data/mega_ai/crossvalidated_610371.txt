In general, you can use the GLM as a way of doing the one-sample hypothesis test for a proportion. set.seed(1) y Gives: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.2819 0.2020 -1.395 0.163 Where the (Intercept) is the log-odds of response. In other words, if $p=0.5$ , then $\log\left(p/(1-p)\right) = 0$ . So, at the 0.05 level I would not reject the null hypothesis that my coin is fair. Note to test any proportion other than 0.5, you would need to calculate and add an offset to the model. For instance, if the null were that p=0.3, then the log odds of p is -0.84, and setting the offset to this value for each result gives a hypothesis test for p!=0.3 in the intercept term. Anyway, you could compare this result to: prop.test(sum(y), 100, correct = F) Which gives nearly the same result: 1-sample proportions test without continuity correction data: sum(y) out of 100, null probability 0.5 X-squared = 1.96, df = 1, p-value = 0.1615 alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5 95 percent confidence interval: 0.3373330 0.5278461 sample estimates: p 0.43 Of course, the important bits are a) that you have pivoted from your planned analysis due to a suspicion of non-independent data and b) a binomial analysis won't actually handle dependence in data. The interesting bit is that the analysis is essentially the same as the Poisson! The "log-linear modeling" approach has known connections to logistic regression. Consider our biased coin experiment: t gives a tabular result: y Freq 1 0 57 2 1 43 and fitting the Poisson model gives you the exact same result . > summary(glm( Freq ~ y, family=poisson, data=t)) Call: glm(formula = Freq ~ y, family = poisson, data = t) Deviance Residuals: [1] 0 0 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 4.0431 0.1325 30.524 In other words, I still have $p=0.163$ for whether I get "more heads" or "more tails" in the count model. Conditioning on the overall count of data is already handled by adjusting for the intercept in the Poisson model. In the experimental arena, the same insect was offered simultaneously two plants (A and B) and the number of eggs laid on each plant was counted. So the assumption of independence would not be fulfilled Unfortunately, this is not any description at all of dependent data! By "insect" I assume you mean several specimens of a particular species of insect, and you are thinking that if subject A lays on plant A then subject B is more likely to lay on plant B, then there is really no way to handle this in the analysis, it's a feature of the design. The preference for plant A may really be a result of there is only one other plant to lay on, and if there are more on A, you can still declare there's a preference for "A", it's just subject to the conditions of the study.
