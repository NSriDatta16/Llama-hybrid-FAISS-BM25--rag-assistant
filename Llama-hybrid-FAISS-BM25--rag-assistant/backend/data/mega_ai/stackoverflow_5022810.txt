If large data volume is your main concern, XmlWriter may be ideal. The API is perhaps not as elegant as XElement etc, but it is the most direct and efficient mechanism, and is designed for firehosing a one-way stream of data. It has a twin, XmlReader , but that is much harder to get right - due to the complexities of processing incoming xml and accounting for child trees appropriately.
