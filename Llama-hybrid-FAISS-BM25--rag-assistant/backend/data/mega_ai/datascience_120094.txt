What you assumed were thresholds appear to instead be weights on the edges from the passthrough nodes. At least, that makes the lines consistent with those in the plot. I gave some hints to the same problem at Draw(by hand) the decision boundary of an neural network ; for the shading, note the output of each hidden neuron in each region and plug those into the output neuron.
