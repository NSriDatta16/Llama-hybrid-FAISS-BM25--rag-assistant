TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len(), LogisticRegression()

I'm trying to fit my Logistic Regression model, but I'm running into an error that I don't understand. Looked around and haven't found a straight answer. Shape of independent features (X): (495,30) Shape of dependent feature (y): (495,) The dependent feature holds binary values (0,1) and the values are currently of type "int". This is probably where the problem is occurring, but I don't understand what I need to do to fix the issue. This is the error I'm getting when I try fitting to sklearn LogisticRegression(): c_param = [1,10,100,1000] rand_grid = {'kbest__k':list(range(5,10)), 'log__C':c_param, 'log__random_state':42} log_rand = RandomizedSearchCV(pipe_opt('log',LogisticRegression()),rand_grid,n_iter=100,cv=3, random_state=42,n_jobs=-1) log_rand.fit(X_train,y_train)
