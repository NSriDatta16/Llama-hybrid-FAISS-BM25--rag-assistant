MAPE and SMAPE shift invariance (bias)

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) both are sensitive when the TRUE values is 0 . Thus I've come to the conclusion to add some epsilon to all data points to eliminate having zero in determinator. But after that, I put attention that the resulting SMAPE or MAPE significantly depends on such epsilon . For example, if I choose $\epsilon=0.1$ the MAPE is much lower, than if I choose $\epsilon=0.01$ . What should be done?
