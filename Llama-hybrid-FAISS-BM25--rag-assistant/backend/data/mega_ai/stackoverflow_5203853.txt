You probably can't use the paint bucket because it is a flat image. Try dragging the image to the stage and then 'break it apart' (CTRL+B on a PC) so that it turns into an editable bitmap. You might then be able to use your paint bucket on it or at least delete areas from it. Alternatively, you could either trace over the map in flash, and then use the paint bucket to fill the areas. This solution might be easier for creating your individual state symbols.
