definitely keep it within powers of 2. also, keep the sprites within the spritesheet in containers that are powers of 2 (say, you have a 17x31 sprite... put it in a 32x32 container). the problem with your sprite sheet is both the 4.9mb and the dimensions. i would consider using adobe fireworks or pngcrusher to bring the size of your sprite sheet down considerably. mike weller's right about splitting the sprite sheet up (you simply cannot max 1024). i think the best bet would be to reorganize what you're doing with your sprite sheet into elements (though it's tough to say without knowing particulars). only things that move should have multiple frames. overlay those over a background (from the same spritesheet) by calling there location on the spritesheet and tossing them into play.
