In addition to sample size you also need to look at the number of observations. so-called " rule of 10 " . For instance if you have 8, 000 observations. the maximum number of predictors are 80. However, the rule is for linear regression. In Logistic regression it is often said that higher number of predictors bring a better stability. One study suggests that we need to user rule of 25. However, it is most common to use rule of 15. In your case having $8,070 / 15 = 538$ variables afford good stability. You may find this post useful.
