This is a famous statistical problem going back to Laplace , called the sunrise problem : Given that it has risen every day in the past, what is the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow? Laplace modelled this problem using a Bayesian analysis, where he assumed that the observable values have distribution $X_1, X_2, X_3, ... \sim \text{IID Bern}(p)$, and with a uniform prior for the unknown probability $p$. With this approach, if $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = s$ then the posterior density is: $$\pi(p | x_1, ..., x_n) = \text{Beta} (p | s+1, n-s+1 ),$$ and the posterior mean is: $$\mathbb{E}(p | x_1, ..., x_n) = \frac{s+1}{n+2}.$$ Hence, given $n$ observed times that the sun has risen (and none that it hasn't) the probability that the sun rises tomorrow is: $$\mathbb{P}(X_{n+1} = 1 | x_1 = ... = x_n = 1) = \mathbb{E}(p | s = n) = \frac{n+1}{n+2}.$$ When $n$ is large, this probability is close to unity, as we would expect. It is worth noting that this method assumes that there is no other prior information about the sun, other than the fact it has been observed to rise $n$ times out of $n$ observations. Laplace correctly noted that in reality one has other prior information that bears on this question, so that his model is not necessarily a good representation of optimal probabilistic reasoning. Application to your question: Using this same model, if you observed $x_1 = ... = x_n = 0$ then the probability that the next value is a one is $\mathbb{P}(X_{n+1} = 1 | s = 0) = 1 /(n+2)$.
