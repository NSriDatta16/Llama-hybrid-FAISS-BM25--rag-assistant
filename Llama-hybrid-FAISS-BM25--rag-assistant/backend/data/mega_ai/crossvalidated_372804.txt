My suggestion is to parameterise the function $f(t)$ and use the methodology of state space models and the Kalman filter. For example, a second order autoregressive, AR(2), process is a relatively general, yet simple, specification that can capture smooth cycles. Then, you would deal with a Gaussian linear model with an unobserved component. Once you write the state space representation of the model, the Kalman filter can be used to evaluate the likelihood function given the data. By maximising the likelihood function the parameters of the model ( $\alpha$ and variances $\sigma^2_\varepsilon$ , $\sigma^2_\eta$ ) can be estimated. In addition, an estimate of the unobserved component $f(t)$ is obtained. Some references about the methodology are given at the end of this answer. Here, I define the model in terms that would allow you to run the Kalman. The equations of the model: \begin{align} y_t =& \mu_t + \alpha f_t\\ \mu_t =& (1-\alpha)\mu_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t\,,\quad& \varepsilon_t\sim NID(0,\sigma^2_\varepsilon)\\ f_t =& \phi_1f_{t-1} + \phi_2f_{t-2} + \eta_t\,,\quad& \eta_t\sim NID(0,\sigma^2_\eta)\\ \hbox{Cov}&(\varepsilon,\eta_t)=0 \end{align} $y_t$ is the observed series, which is modeled as of an AR(1) process plus an unobserved transitory component $f(t)$ . I included two disturbance terms, $\varepsilon$ and $\eta$ , that are independent of each other; the first one can be discarded by setting $\sigma^2_\varepsilon=0$ . State space representation (input for the Kalman filter): \begin{eqnarray} y_t=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1&\alpha&0 \end{array} \right) \left( \begin{array}{c} \mu_t\\f_t\\f_{t-1} \end{array} \right)\,,\quad \left( \begin{array}{c} \mu_t\\f_t\\f_{t-1} \end{array} \right)= \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1-\alpha&0&0\\ 0&\phi_1&\phi_2\\ 0&1&0 \end{array} \right) \left( \begin{array}{c} \mu_{t-1}\\f_{t-1}\\f_{t-2} \end{array} \right)\,. \end{eqnarray} The covariance matrix of the disturbance terms is a diagonal matrix (since the disturbances are independent of each other) with diagonal $(\sigma^2_\varepsilon\,, \sigma^2_\eta\,, 0)$ . This model is essentially the model proposed by Clark to extract the business cycle from time series of the gross domestic product. I simply added the coefficient $\alpha$ in order to resemble your model. The difference with your original model is that here $f(t)$ must be specified by means of a linear model. You may need to try other specifications of $f(t)$ that may fit better the overall dynamics of the trend/cycle component in your data. You may also need to include another component to capture, for example, seasonal cycles. Searching for information about basic structural model you could find a common specification of the seasonal component. If you cannot come up with a sensible specification that fits your data, then you may need to explore non-parametric methods as I mentioned in a comment. References: [1] Clark, P. K. (1987).
