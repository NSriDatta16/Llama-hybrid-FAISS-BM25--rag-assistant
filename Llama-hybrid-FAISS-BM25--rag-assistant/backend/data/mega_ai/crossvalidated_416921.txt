Grouped 7-fold Cross Validation in R

I am searching for a grouped 7-fold cross validation function. I couldn't find it in the caret package. I got 70 subjects performing 7 trials (Outcome variable: categorical with 7 values) = 490 observations. I trained a Random Forest with reasonable accuracy in the OOB (89%) as well as in 10 fold CV. Since the data is hierarchical / dependent (7 observations belonging to one subject) a colleague suggested it would be advisable to prevent that trials from the same subject are in the train split as well as in the test split. What do you think, should I do 7 - fold CV grouped by subject? Meaning that one fold would allways include all trials of 10 participants? Thanks in advance Edit: Thanks for your comment. I missed just the documentation in caret about groupKFold. Here is a code solution which worked for me ########################## Caret Preparation ############################ k.folds = 7 df1.folds $ID, k = k.folds) df2.folds ID, k = k.folds) df1.control Edit 2 (26.11.21): Please see the answer provided by @otwtm , providing the index argument (as created by in my case groupKFold which is basically just a list of the indicies used for training) overwrites the arguments number and repeats . ########################## Caret Preparation ############################ k.folds = 7 df1.folds $ID, k = k.folds) df2.folds ID, k = k.folds) df1.control
