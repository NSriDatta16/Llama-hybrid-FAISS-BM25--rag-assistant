I have a basic problem understanding CSS positioning

Edit: Ok, this is what works. It may not be "right", but 1) it displays correctly & 2) it validates at W3C. It seems that I should make all positioning absoolute and add positioning to all divs except for those with a fieldset, where I have to add the position to the fieldset. Feel free to correct this if you think that I am wrong, but "it works for me" ! Yay! Yipee! At last! Lots of +1 all round and thanks to all who helped. Edit: the bounty goes to whomever can post the editted HTML which displays like the Delphi screenshot. I am using Borland Delphi to produce an HTML form generator. The user can drag & drop components to produce a file and when he is happy he can generate HTML (I pop a Submit button on to the end of his form). Since I have the absolute position of each control when I am generating, I want so specify absolute positions in CSS. I thought this meant that I have to use position: fixed , but that doesn't look right, and nor does absolute. What am I doing wrong? (the HTML validates at W3C) Here is a very basic basic example as seen when designing the form in the Delphi program And here it is in MSIE 8 (with fix position) And again with absolute position And, finally, here is the HTML Input data GroupBox1 Label1 CheckBox1 one two three RadioGroup1 red: white: blue: Edit: the bounty goes to whomever can post the editted HTML which displays like the Delphi screenshot.
