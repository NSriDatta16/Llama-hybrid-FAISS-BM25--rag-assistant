The thing you need to take into consideration is how the application will work if javascript is not available. You should strive to ensure that the basic functionality works without it. This is called progressive enhancement or unobtrusive javascript and is considered a best practice. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement The way you should do it is to use a form with a real submit button and then hijack that form to use ajax if the User Agent supports it. This is usually pretty trivial to do using the jquery forms plugin. In your action method, you can check to see if the incoming request is an ajax request by checking the Request.IsAjaxRequest property. This is set by MVC automatically on requests that have the X-Requested-With header set to XMLHttpRequest. Then you would return a full view or just some json based on that. Here's a short screencast demonstrating this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQsFR1rkgMU&feature=player_embedded
