The ability for Opera Dragonfly to get this information from the Opera rendering engine (Presto) should be included in Opera 11. We are currently working on implementing the client side code in Opera Dragonfly to support this and other Network Inspector features, such as editing headers and replaying requests. EDIT: As of July 2011 (Opera Dragonfly 1.1) it is possible. To see POST parameters in Opera Dragonfly click on Network tab followed by Network log subtab. NOTE: It requires reloading the page, if the page was already loaded while opening Opera Dragonfly.
