This is likely to be a duplicate of some older question(s), but I will briefly answer is nevertheless. For a non-technical explanation, I find quite helpful this figure from the Wikipedia article on Correlation and dependence : The numbers above each scatter plot show correlation coefficients between X and Y. Look at the last row: on each scatter plot the correlation is zero, i.e. X and Y are "linearly independent". However they are obviously not statistically independent: if you know the value of X, you can narrow down the possible values of Y. If X and Y were independent, it would mean that knowing X tells you nothing about Y. The purpose of ICA is to try to find independent components. In PCA you only get uncorrelated ("orthogonal") components; correlation between them is zero but they can very well be statistically dependent.
