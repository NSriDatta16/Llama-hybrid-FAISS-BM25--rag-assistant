Take a look to the Qt Main Window Demo it uses QDockWidget rather than QTabBar's. This example should be included the QTDIR/demos/ folder of your Qt installation. You will see that there are no tabs in the window, but try to drag some dock and drop it over another dock an you will see that a tabbar is created. Also the docks can be floating around the desktop. This behavior is provided by Qt and it can be enabled or disabled with just set some flags for the docks. Check the code for more details. I hope that this was what you're were looking for.
