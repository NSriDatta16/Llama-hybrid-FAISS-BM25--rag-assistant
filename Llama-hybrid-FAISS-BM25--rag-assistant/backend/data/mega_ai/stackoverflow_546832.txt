How is your table data physically structured i.e. partitioned, split across Filegroups and disk storage etc. ? Are you using table partitioning? If not you should look into using aligned partitioning. You could partition your data by date, say a partition for each year as an example. Where I to request a query spanning three years, on a multiprocessor system, I could concurrently access all three partitions at once, thereby improving query performance.
