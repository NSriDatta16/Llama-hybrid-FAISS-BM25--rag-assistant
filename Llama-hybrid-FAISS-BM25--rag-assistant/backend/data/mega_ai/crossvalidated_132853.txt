A little more information or example data may be helpful. If this is a time series, that means each X value is the residual error at a different point in time. That means as your fitted model chugged along the time series, while overall the model didn't systematically overestimate or underestimate the true values (the deviations average around zero) .... the error didn't seem to vary randomly. It means the model was pretty accurate at the beginning of the time frame ---- became much less accurate in the middle (up and down) .... then became somewhat more accurate yet again. I don't know --- doesn't seem normal for a predictive model. Might be a data cleansing issue --- or the noise variance/ inherent unpredictability of whatever you were modeling changed at one point (which doesn't happen too often in nature). More info is needed, I think.
