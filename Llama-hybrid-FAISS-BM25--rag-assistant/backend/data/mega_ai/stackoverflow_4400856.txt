How can I make certain areas of children’s book illustrations clickable?

I have a design from a client who is a children’s book illustrator. The site will be done in WordPress so they can edit certain pages etc. On some pages there will be illustrations that will also have clickable areas. I suggest using Flash to show the illustrations, but they don’t like Flash at all. I was thinking the other option was to use CSS background images with s to position as clickable, but this is cumbersome. Slicing the images into bits and pieces is also cumbersome due the the organic nature of the shapes and illustrations. Are there any other options?
