No, string concatenation does not use StringBuilder internally. However, in your particular example, there is no advantage to using StringBuilder. This is fine for a few strings (you're only creating one new string): myString = myString + myString2 + myString3 + myString4 + mySt... This is not (you're creating and allocating 4 strings, etc): myString = myString + myString2; myString = myString + myString3; myString = myString + myString4; myString = myString + myString5; Out of all the stackoverflow questions about this matter, this has one of the best answers: String vs. StringBuilder Look for two answers, the one by Jay Bazuzi and the one by James Curran. Also, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, Jeff Atwood uses actual testing to compare these and other scenarios of string concatenation/building, here: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/01/the-sad-tragedy-of-micro-optimization-theater.html
