From the graph It is very clear that a non-linear model will perform well to distinguish between Class A and Class B . A Linear model ( Logistic Regression) give an accuracy around 50% for such datasets . A non-linear model (For example -SVM ) with a kernel trick can give you a very good accuracy . Follow this link to see the practical difference between Logistic Regression and SVM for Non-linear Dataset
