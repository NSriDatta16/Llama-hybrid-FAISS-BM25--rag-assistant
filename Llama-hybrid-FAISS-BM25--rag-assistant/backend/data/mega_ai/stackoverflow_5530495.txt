Do I need to store session state when using AspProviders, MVC and Azure

My application uses MVC3 connected to a back end Azure table storage. I use AspProviders for login and logout. There are times when I can confuse the AspProviders such that I will see the problems listed here What I would like to know is why does my application even need to store session state. The way my application works is that every page call is independent and it could be sent to any running instance. With this in mind am I adding additional overhead by storing session data and is it really needed? I hope someone out there can give me some advice. Thanks, Jon Wiley
