Lets see if I understand Harlan's (and Srikant's) formulation correctly. $$\pi_1 \sim beta(\alpha_1,\beta_1)$$ $$\pi_2 \sim beta(\alpha_2,\beta_2)$$ Say, $\pi_1$ corresponds to the set of data for which you have less information apriori and $\pi_2$ is for the more precise data set. Using Srikant's formulation: $$\pi(p) \propto \pi_1(p) \alpha + \pi_2(p) (1-\alpha)$$ Therefore, the complete hierarchical formulation will be: $$\alpha \sim beta(\alpha_0,\beta_0)$$ $$p|\alpha \sim \pi(p)$$ $$y_i | p \sim B(n_i,p) $$ I assume here that $y_i|p$ are iid. I don't know if this is a valid assumption in your case. Am I correct? You can choose $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ in such a way that mean of this beta distribution is 0.8 (or 0.2) acc. to your formulation. Now the MCMC sampling can be done, by using OpenBUGS or JAGS (untested). I will add more to this (and recheck formulation) as soon as I get more time. But please point out if you see a fallacy in my argument.
