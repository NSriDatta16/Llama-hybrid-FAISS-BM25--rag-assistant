I still dont have the formula to convert FBAppAuth-ed or SafariAuth-ed access_token fragments to session_id. However, the following description will help in getting an access_token in described formula which can then be easily fragmented to derive session_id. Hope this helps. In iOS SDK Version 2, login is handled by following API in Facebook class: - (void)authorize:(NSArray *)permissions delegate:(id )delegate; In the implementation of same API, if we turn off the FBAppAuth and SafariAuth, then it will invoke login dialog box and the returned access_token will be of format APP_ID | SESSION_KEY | DIGEST - (void)authorize:(NSArray *)permissions delegate:(id )delegate { [_permissions release]; _permissions = [permissions retain]; _sessionDelegate = delegate; //[self authorizeWithFBAppAuth:YES safariAuth:YES]; [self authorizeWithFBAppAuth:NO safariAuth:NO]; // Turned off FBApp and Safari auth } The returned access_token can be captured in following call back method in Facebook class (please put a NSLog to print the token) : - (void)fbDialogLogin:(NSString *)token expirationDate:(NSDate *)expirationDate
