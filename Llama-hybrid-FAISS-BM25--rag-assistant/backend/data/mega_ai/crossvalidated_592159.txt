Variance stabilizing transformation for logistic regression

Question: Are there (known) variance stabilizing transformations for logistic regression? Backgound: As an M-estimator, logistic regression is asymptotically normal, under suitable regularity conditions. The asymptotic variance, however, depends on the unknown parameter $\theta^*$ . Say, $$ \sqrt{n}\left(\hat{\theta}_n-\theta^*\right)\rightarrow \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma_{\theta^*}). $$ The dependence of the asymptotic variance on the unknown parameter $\theta^*$ is undesirable, for example to find approximated confidence intervals. There are examples, where one can use a variance-stabilizing transformation to free the asymptotic variance of unknown parameters. For estimating a one-dimensional parameter $\theta$ with $T_n$ , there may exist a mapping $\phi$ , such that: $$ \sqrt{n}\left(\phi(T_n)-\phi(\theta^*)\right)\rightarrow \mathcal{N}(0,\phi'(\theta^*)^2\sigma(\theta^*)^2)=\mathcal{N}(0,c^2). $$ To find $\phi$ , one can solve: $$ \phi(\theta)=\int\frac{1}{\sigma(\theta)}d\theta $$ I don't see why this wouldn't work for logistic regression. However, I could not find variance-stabilizing transformations for logistic regression in the literature. I tried to do some calculations myself, but they got messy quite quickly. Example: (Edit) The commenters pointed out that my question is not clear enough. I'll give an example where the variance stabilizing tarnsformation works. Hopefully this clarifies what I'm looking for. Suppose that we have $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ following a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda>0$ . We try to estimate $\lambda$ using the mean $\hat{\lambda}_n:=n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$ . Then, by the CLT, $$ \sqrt{n}(\hat{\lambda}_n-\lambda)\rightarrow\mathcal{N}(0,\lambda) $$ It is undesirable that the asymptotic variance depends on the unknown parameter, since this makes the construction of confidence intervals more difficult. To give another example, consider esimating the mean of a normal distribution. If the variance is unknown, we can still perform a T-test. However, if the variance were known, we could perform a Z-test, which has more power. In the case of the Poisson distribution, we can use a variance stabilizing transformation, namely the square root. By the delta-method: $$ \sqrt{n}\left(2\sqrt{\hat{\lambda}_n}-2\sqrt{\lambda}\right)\rightarrow \mathcal{N}(0,1) $$ With this trick, we can easily construct asymptotic confidence intervals, without further complications. At least this is the case for the given example. My question is, whether such a transformation can be done in logistic regression.
