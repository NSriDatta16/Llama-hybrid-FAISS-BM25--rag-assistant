Can local storage databases be cross-accessed between separate Chrome extensions?

Question I think is self explanatory, but if you need more, here it is: Chrome Extension A saves an email address in localstorage. Chrome Extension B wants to see that email address. Is this permitted? (This might be more of an HTML5 thing than a Chrome-specific thing, but my knowledge is limited so I'll frame it within the context of my desire to know the answer).
