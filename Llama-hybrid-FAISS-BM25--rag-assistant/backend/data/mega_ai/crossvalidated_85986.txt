How does the squared residual of a high leverage sample observation differ from the population's variance?

Is the high leverage sample observation considered a subset of the population, forcing its squared residual to be less than or equal to the population variance? Or am I misinterpreting the question? I'm trying to determine why the answer is false to the below question.
