Reverse forecasting in time series

we have a given time series includes a specific type of data for example from year 1980 to 2016. Also we know that we should achieve to a predefined goal(a fixed value) in year 2025. But we don't know how to reach it. In other words We have a time series $T = \left\{T_1,\ldots, T_n\right\}$ from time $1$ to time $n$ and we want to reach a time series $T'=\left\{T_{n+k+1},\ldots, T_{n+k+m}\right\}$ from time $n+k+1$ to $t+k+m$. But we do not have the time series between the time $n+1$ to $n+k$: $T"=\left\{T_{n+1},\ldots,T_{n+k}\right\}$. What's the solution for this problem? what algorithms can I use? what's the keywords for searching about them?
