The integrals you described are not frequentist likelihood ratios , which involve maximizing over the unknown parameters given the constraints in the two models, but rather are akin to the Bayesian marginal likelihood $$P(x|\mathcal{M}_i) = \int P(x|\theta,\mathcal{M}_i) \pi(\theta|\mathcal{M}_i) d\theta$$ where $\mathcal{M}_i$, $i=0,1$ are the null and alternative models In the null case, implicitly there is a prior $\pi(\theta|\mathcal{M_0}) = 1$ hidden in the integral, which does indeed integrate to 1 over the unit hypercube $[0,1]^4$. In the alternate case, the same implicit prior is at work, now there is a normalization constant missing , equal to the integral over the polytope defined by the inequality constraints, the value of which is less than 1. Once that has been included, you could compare the two marginal likelihoods via the Bayes factor .
