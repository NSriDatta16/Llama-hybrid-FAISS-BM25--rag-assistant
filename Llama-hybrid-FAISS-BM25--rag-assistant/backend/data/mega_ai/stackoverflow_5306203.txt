Very simple: you declare Base2() but never define it. You must, even if it's empty... or don't declare it at all and an empty one will be generated for you. Perhaps Base1::Base1() in base2.cpp should read Base2::Base2() ? child.cpp shouldn't have definitions for any of them. Edit You've said you're still having problems. I'm going to assume that you paid attention to the above and removed the extraneous definition of Base1::Base1() from child.cpp. How are you building your project? It should be like: g++ base1.cpp base2.cpp child.cpp -o myProgram or like: g++ base1.cpp -o base1.o g++ base2.cpp -o base2.o g++ child.cpp -o child.o g++ base1.o base2.o child.o -o myProgram (which is often the result of working with a makefile or other automated build processes).
