how to the report the confidence on a string of odds ratios

I implement n permutations into a regression analysis, to test the model for stability. Thus I obtain n odds ratios (ORs) and n associated 95% CI intervals. Each permutation represents a matched-pair study. We pair similar case 's with control 's and then run a conditional logistic regression to obtain a measure of association between the outcome of interest and exposure variable (treatment status). Taking the following example I have implemented into a R script. In short what I have done is: Take a portion of the a given population We assign at dummy variable to the population (1/0) to indicate treatment status based on a set of parameters we pair those with treatment status==1 to equivalent treatment status==0 we define an outcome of interest that we wish to measure if treatment had an effect on the outcome We conduct a logistic regression to determine the ORs associated with treatment status we repeat this n time, each time obtaining an ORs and associated 95% confidence interval But what I am not sure, is how I can report on the spread of my data. I generate a different odds ratio and 95% CI for each permutation. Taking the following hypothetical example, we run a simulation 100 times. It only takes a minute to simulate. We take an worked exampled from the Matching package in R. set.seed(123) # preamble, prepare the data for the simulation #1. library(Matching) library(survival) #2. require(doParallel) cl 8125, 1, 0)) # lets take a portion of the original population, say only 395 n To summarise the script: we take 420 people from the original population (of 445) we define the outcome of interest is. That is if the person had re78 > 8125 yes or no for each treat==1, we find an equivalent treat==0 based on age, educ, black, hisp, married, nodegr. We only want exact 1-1 matching we assign an unique indicator variable for each pair 1,2,3.....x We then develop a regression model to determine the OR for our outcome of interest ( re78 > 8125 ) associated with the treatment status (=1 relative to =0). we save the ORs and 95%CI We can then plot the ORs and shade the 95%CI plot(Result[1,], ylim=c(0,2.5)) polygon(c(1:m,m:1), c(Result[3,],Result[2,]),col=adjustcolor("grey", alpha=0.4), border = NA) But how can I summarise the several ORs I obtained, the spread of it and/or an associated confidence level? EDIT Am I able to assess my study as if it was a meta-analysis. If so, one could implement the solution proposed by @Bernd Weiss here ? For this we need to obtain the natural log of the ORs and the std. err.? We update the last part of the command to: ....... model_1 Using we can then call upon the metagen() , command library(meta) or.fem Where as.numeric(Result[2,]) is the log(OR) and as.numeric(Result[3,]) is the std. err. Thus we obtain a 95% CI ...... But have we introduced a bias in the CI by the imputations. We see our 95% range is significant (greater than 1), however for each permutation, we only get a lower 95% CI > 1 sum(as.numeric(Result[5,])>1.00) times. Therefore I think the large n and thus degrees of freedom in the meta-analysis are giving us a significant result
