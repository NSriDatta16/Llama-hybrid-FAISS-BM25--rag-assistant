Looks like the best fit for your needs would be TTIWHTMLEdit or TTIWDBHTMLEdit, part of the TMS Component Pack Pro for IntraWeb (125 Euros currently). Here's an online demo , though it seems they have not hooked up all of the formatting buttons. Since TinyMCE is Javascript-based, it should be usable embedded in an Intraweb page. Have you looked at the TIWForm.JavaScript property and similar? The Intraweb online help has a section on embedding Javascript . I strongly encourage you to ask on the Intraweb newsgroup if you don't get satisfaction here (or in parallel...). It's likely that someone has a ready solution. Even the original author of Intraweb, Chad Hower, pipes in on the peer-support group, and Jackson Gomes is often very responsive. While developing in Intraweb, the AtoZed priority support is worth considering - particularly if you're already prepared to get something third- (or fourth?) party - the AtoZed team really work to help you find solutions and fix issues. Paid for itself many times over when I had an Intraweb project in the works. The peer-support NNTP group is atozedsoftware.intraweb on news.atozed.com
