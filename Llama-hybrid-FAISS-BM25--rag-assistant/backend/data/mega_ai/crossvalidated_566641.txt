Convolutional neural network architecture calculation question

I'm attempting to understand the neural network architecture used in this paper: Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks . Here's an image of the network achitecture from the paper that is bothering me: So in the first layer, a (224 x 224 x 3) image is convolved by 96 (7 x 7) kernels with a stride of 2. There is no mention of padding in the architecture description. Plugging these parameter values in the algorithm for the spatial size of the output volume from the Wikipedia article on CONVs , I have: W = 224 K = 7 P = 0 S = 2 This gives (W - K + 2P) / S + 1 = 109.5 According to commenters from a StackOverflow question , we simply round down to 109 when the output of the formula is not an integer. I tested this out in Tensorflow and confirmed this. However, in this paper, the output size is not 109, but 110. So I guess they rounded up, but I don't understand why. This method of rounding up repeats itself throughout the network architecture. Am I incorrectly applying this formula, were things done differently back in 2014 when the paper came out? Can anybody explain why they round up as opposed to down, and perhaps how I can do the same in Tensorflow?
