e may be many ad-ons that could raise the price, making it inaccessible to many. Base models may be less effective compared to higher end models, which may lead to a digital divide. Overall, VR healthcare solutions are not meant to be a competitor to traditional therapies, as research shows that when coupled together physical therapy is more effective. Research into VR rehabilitation continues to expand with new research into haptic developing, which would allow the user to feel their environments and to incorporate their hands and feet into their recovery plan. Additionally, there are more sophisticated VR systems being developed which allow the user to use their entire body in their recovery. It also has sophisticated sensors that would allow medical professionals to collect data on muscle engagement and tension. It uses electrical impedance tomography, a form of noninvasive imaging to view muscle usage. Another concern is the lack of major funding by big companies and the government into the field. Many of these VR sets are off the shelf items, and not properly made for medical use. External add-ones are usually 3D printed or made from spare parts from other electronics. this lack of support means that patients who want to try this method have to be technically savvy, which is unlikely as many ailments only appear later in life. Additionally, certain parts of VR like haptic feedback and tracking are still not advanced enough to be used reliably in a medical setting. Another issue is the amount of VR devices that are available for purchase. While this does increase the options available, the differences between VR systems could impact patient recovery. The vast number of VR devices also makes it difficult for medical professionals to give and interpret information, as they might not have had practice with the specific model, which could lead to faulty advice being given out. Applications Currently other applications within healthcare are being explored, such as: Applications for monitoring of glucose, alcohol, and lactate or blood oxygen, breath monitoring, heartbeat, heart rate and its variability, electromyography (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG), body temperature, pressure (e.g. in shoes), sweat rate or sweat loss, levels of uric acid and ions â€“ e.g. for preventing fatigue or injuries or for optimizing training patterns, including via "human-integrated electronics" Forecasting changes in mood, stress, and health Measuring blood alcohol content Measuring athletic performance Monitoring how sick the user is Detecting early signs of infection Long-term monitoring of patients with heart and circulatory problems that records an electrocardiogram and is self-moistening Health risk assessment applications, including measures of frailty and risks of age-dependent diseases Automatic documentation of care activities Days-long continuous imaging of diverse organs via a wearable bioadhesive stretchable high-resolution ultrasound imaging patch or e.g. a wearable continuous heart ultrasound imager. (potential novel diagnostic and monitoring tools) Sleep tracking Cortisol monitoring for measuring stress Measuring relaxation or alertness, e.g. to adjust their modulation or to measure efficacy of modulation techniques Proposed applications Proposed applications, including applications without functional wearable prototypes, include: Tracking physiological changes such as stress levels and heartbeat of "experiencers" or "contactees" of the UFO-sighting, anomalous physiological effects and alien abduction/contact/sighting phenomena, including "experiencer group research" Pathogen detection and detection of hazardous substances Improving sleep via sleeping caps Applications to COVID-19 Various wearable technologies have been developed in order to help with the diagnosis of COVID-19. Oxygen levels, antibody detection, blood pressure, heart rate, and so much more are monitored by small sensors within these devices.
