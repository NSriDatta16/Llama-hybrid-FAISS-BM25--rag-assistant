Because it has been nine months, I want to start by answering, "No." But I want to hear about it if there's a great survey paper or book! Then I want to point out two papers that introduce methods for parametric Bayesian modeling in high dimensions. First, Expectation Propagation can help by using a distributed system for doing parametric Bayesian inference on "big data", including high dimensionality ("hundreds of dimensions"). "Expectation Propagation as a Way of Life". Gelman et al., 2017 http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/ep_arxiv.pdf Also, Stochastic Variational Inference can handle high dimensional data. "Stochastic Variational Inference". Hoffman, Blei, Wang, and Paisley, 2013 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.7051.pdf
