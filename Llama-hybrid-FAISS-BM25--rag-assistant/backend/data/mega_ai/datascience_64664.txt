Curve fitting through cloud of daily values using machine learning

I want to plot laboratory values (SCr_v) over time and find the best fitting regression curves (see plot 1 and 2). I don't want to restrict myself to a specific model if possible. Is there a function in python which I can use to solve my problem? Or any good article that would help? I'd like to solve my problem in Python.
