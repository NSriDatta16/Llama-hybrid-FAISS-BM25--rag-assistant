How to turn off setting for visible special characters In outlook new email message?

Somehow I turned on the display paragraph marks, spaces, and other special characters in my outlook 2007 new email messages and I can't find a way to turn it off. I am looking for the outlook equivalent of the Word 2007 Show/Hide command that is in the paragraph section of the toolbar ribbon, whose icon in the toolbar is a paragraph mark.
