Another solution for your original problem: find other ways to get faster url retrieval. httplib2 might already be a good solution: no problem to get it working as it's just a python library, but support for Keep-Alive connections can speed up things a lot, plus the caching support will help too (but only if you are often requesting the same url of course). And it's very easy to use. If that doesn't get you far enought: PyCurl , the python binding for libcurl is probably the most obvious choice (there are also wrappers to make PyCurl easier to use, as PyCurl is apparently a bit low-level). Anyway, just to say there are options that do not require java, that are easier to get working (and that will be probably end up faster as well)
