The only solution I could come up with is to generate the columns of some numeric patterns, and to use the symbolic regression with the programs such as Eureqa, to train to R and R^2 up to 0.95, and then to use those patterns and (sequence of Eureqa) formulas with another data-set to do another training/predicting. If you do not use any functions such as smart-moving averages, instead of generating the patterns, simply enable the option to use integers and consants with Eureqa and have your original data as input columns. The problem is, symbolic regression takes a lot of time to complete, and the end-result might give solutions that take a lot of time to compute. As a side-note, taking the neural-net approach and overtraining the sample-data did nothing! I am not sure if I am explaining this well, so if you want more details, just contact me any-time! PS I am still waiting for someone else's solution for this post.
