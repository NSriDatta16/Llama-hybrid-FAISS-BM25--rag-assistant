That's called "distributed queries", and require database engine support. In MySQL, this can help you: http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/mysql-federated-storage.html (available from 5.0 onwards). In Oracle that's called "database links" and as Shiv Kumar said as "linked servers" in MS SQL. One of the drawbacks of the federate engine is it requires you to create a table that mirrors the "remote" one, while other databases simply let you access the remote table once a link to the remote server is established, without having to keep declarations in sync. Also the remote database must be another MySQL database (other engines support distributed queries against etherogenous servers).
