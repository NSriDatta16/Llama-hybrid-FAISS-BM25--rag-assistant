There is a variety of statistical ideas being bandied around here, but no science! Surely there is some science that can inform expectations and guide analyses? What I can discern here is as follows. (You refer to $y$ and $x$ but only the R code makes a guess possible at what they are for you.) Grade (of what?) runs from 0 to 5 and your model statements imply that it is the outcome or response of interest you want to predict or explain. There is no information on whether it is counted or an ordered (graded) scale. Is there any precise measurement behind the values? Is 5 an upper limit in principle or is it just an observed maximum? None of the models implied by the code is obviously applicable to a discrete response that is bounded (if it is). There is, in my view, no helpful sense in which grade can be thought as normally distributed, even when transformed, as its six spikes in a distribution will remain six spikes with any one-to-one transformation. Concentration (of what?) clearly is highly skewed, as is common across many sciences that measure concentrations. The occurrence of several exact zeros requires more comment. Sometimes reports of zero are to be taken literally, while often there is just a detection limit that prohibits or inhibits report of a precise low concentration. The appearance of 0.0001 as a fudge/nudge/kludge constant is evidently a device to avoid dividing by zero when taking reciprocals. The problem with that is the lack of any evident rationale other than that dividing by zero cannot be contemplated. It is very rare that concentrations can be thought of as normally distributed, although many other distributions might be more plausible. Trial of (say) a lognormal is once again complicated by the exact zeros. Type is just A, B, C and can't be discussed without more detail. Despite this fairly lengthy commentary, my stance is that none of the procedures suggested to you, or any other, can be honestly recommended without further information. Presumably all the people you consulted -- despite disagreeing with each other -- were privy to the scientific (chemical, physical, biological, geological, whatever) context we aren't given here. To try to see what is going on, I plotted quantiles (ordered values) versus an estimate of cumulative probability -- precisely, (rank $-$ 0.5) / subsample size -- separately by grade, with some indication of type, although that is not prominent in the design. The use of cube root scale is no more than pragmatic, although some fairly strong transformation is needed, and cube root has the small advantage that zeros map to zeros without fudging. The plot doesn't respect the convention that response is plotted vertically -- but it allows more scrutiny of whether and how grade and concentration are related than does a table. Although it is not news to you, presumably, the simple but also fundamental fact that this is a very small dataset, and so the subsets are even smaller, does make it especially hard to see whether there are any predictable patterns. How to transform to nearer normal distributions seems a red herring here. What is it that you think should be normally distributed and why? It is, however, a little helpful if each distribution is less skewed than the original data. PS Thanks for giving the data. Any readers wanting to try analyses might find this listing a little easier to import into their favourite software. The variables are type, grade and concentration in that order.

Far from dealing with the exact zeros, it has converted them all to massive outliers. Someone's intuition was that adding a small constant to zeros was a conservative nudge, but that nudge was not thought through in terms of what it implies on reciprocal scale. Often I see the related fallacy that log(value $+$ very tiny number) is a way to cope with zero values, but the problem is the same. Another approach is to shrug our shoulders and omit the exact zeros as bad news that we don't know how to handle (8 out of 44 observations). That done, log scale is more than natural, but it is hard for me to see any relationships whatsoever.
