Discretization of Multiple Time Series

I'm working on discretizing multiple time series for a project. Here's what I've done so far: I concatenated the train signals like this: [1,2,3,5] and [7,3,6,7] into [1,2,3,5,7,3,6,7]. Then, I trained a K-means ML model with the single, combined signal. Finally, I clustered all the signals with the trained model. I'm not sure if this is the right approach. I chose to concatenate the signals because the k-mean (from scikit-learn) allows inserting only a single dataset, so I didn't know how to feed it with multiple time series. Has anyone done something similar, or does anyone have suggestions for a better discretization method?
