Measuring the influence on the variance of a dependent variable (OLS Model)

Assuming, I have constructed a simple linear regression model (Time Series) with a dependent and two independent variables. Measuring the effect concerning the value of the dependent variable is pretty straight forward. Now, I am wondering wether there is a method of estimating the effect of each independent variable individually on the variance of the dependent variable. Thanks in advance
