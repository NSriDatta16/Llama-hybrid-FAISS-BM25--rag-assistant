Faster RCNN - Pyramid of Filters vs Pyramid of Anchors (Reference Boxes)

I'm reading faster RCNN paper now and trying to understand what is the difference between Pyramid of Filters and Pyramid of Anchors methods from the scale point of view. I mean if I use only one aspect ratio (1:1) with Pyramid of Anchors how it will be different from Pyramid of Filters ? I found this a bit related question.
