How many endogenous variables in a VAR model with 120 observations?

I am doing time series forecasting in R using the VAR model implementation in the "vars" package. I have a default of six lags for my model, and my time series all have 120+ observations. I'm doing a method of testing different combinations of series and back-testing them using VAR in order to decide which set of variables to choose. How many variables can I expect to fit in to my VAR model (including the variable I am interested in forecasting)?
