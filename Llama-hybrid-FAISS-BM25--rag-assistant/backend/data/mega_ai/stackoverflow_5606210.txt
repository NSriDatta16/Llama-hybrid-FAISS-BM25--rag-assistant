A database is probably overkill for the type of data you need to track. I would suggest using Android's SharedPreferences APIs. See here for a tutorial . Here's an official overview of Android data persistence methods including SharedPreferences and SQLite. Check out the getStringSet API for storage of arrays/collections. For non-existent vals for the string set: Returns the preference values if they exist, or defValues. Throws ClassCastException if there is a preference with this name that is not a Set. For non-existent value data such as string, bool, float etc.: Returns the preference value if it exists, or defValue. Throws ClassCastException if there is a preference with this name that is not a String.
