The model you seem to be talking about is mixture distribution . Finite mixture model defines the distribution of the data as $$ f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^m \pi_k \, f_k(x,\, \vartheta_k) $$ where $m$ is the number of components, $\pi_k \ge 0$ and $\sum_{k=1}^m \pi_k = 1$ are mixing weights, and $f_k$ are the components, the distributions with their own parameters $\vartheta_k$ , in your example they are all Gaussian. There are finite and infinite mixtures, in the second case the number of components is unlimited rather than fixed. You can use Bayesian approach to fitting them, with using priors for the parameters. See also other threads tagged as mixture , or gaussian-mixture .
