For Loop alternatives for progressive operations

I have to apply regression function progressively to a time series data (vector "time" and "tm" and I'm using a For Loop as follow: top But for vectors' length of about 10k it becomes very slow. Is there a faster alternative (maybe using apply function)? In a more easy problem: if I have a vector like x x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 y 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55
