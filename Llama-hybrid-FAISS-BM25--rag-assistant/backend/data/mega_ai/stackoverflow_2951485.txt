I think you should double-check your dbml file. Sounds like Linq doesn't know that employeeid is a nullable column. Or look at your .cs file. The attributes for this column should look like this: [Column(Storage="_employeeid", DbType="Int")] and not: [Column(Storage="_employeeid", DbType="Int NOT NULL")]
