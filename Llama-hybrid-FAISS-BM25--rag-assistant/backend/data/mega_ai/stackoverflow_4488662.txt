I suppose it'd look like this $(document).bind("dragstart", function(event, ui){ event.preventDefault(); //return false;//edited }); I'm not sure if it should be document or just 'body' EDIT I don't know where you took that code sample from, but it seems to always block any dragging. Try if this helps - it should prevent bubbling up, so if scrolling works with the document node - the event shouldn't get there. [I still can't try it on apples] $(document).ready(function() { $(".draggable").draggable(); $('body>div').bind("dragstart", function(event, ui){ event.stopPropagation(); }); });
