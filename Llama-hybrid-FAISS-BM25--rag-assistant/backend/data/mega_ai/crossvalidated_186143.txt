Covariance of parameter estimates in Method of Moments

I have a $3\times1$ vector function $f(x_i;\theta)$ where $X$ is a rv and $\theta$ is $3 \times 1$ parameter vector, such that \begin{equation} E \, f(X;\theta) = {\bf 0}.\end{equation} If I have a sample $x_1,\dots,x_N$ from $X$ my understanding is that estimating the LHS in the equation above with the sample average and solving for $\theta$ is the "method of moments" for estimating $\theta$. I.e $$ f_N(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum f(x_i;\theta) = {\bf0} \qquad \implies \qquad \hat{\theta} = f_N^{-1}({\bf0}).$$ However I'm not sure how I can estimate the covariance of $\hat{\theta}$. To obtain the estimates I used fsolve on the function $f_N$ in matlab. Any help is appreciated. EDIT: Doing some trial and error testing I found that estimating the covariance matrix as $$ Cov \, (\hat{\theta})= \frac{1}{N}(G_N^T G_N)^{-1}$$ where $$ G_N = \nabla_\theta \, f_N(\theta)$$ is an estimate of $ E\,[\nabla_\theta \, f(X;\theta)]$ gives a feasible result. Does this make sense?
