Meta-Analyzing Dependent Effect Sizes (Log Response Ratios)--Is Averaging Effects An Acceptable Solution?

Given k studies, for each computing a log response ratio $L$ and variance $v$ following the Hegdes et al., 1999 equations: $$L = ln(R) = ln(\bar{X}_{E})- ln(\bar{X}_{C})$$ $$v = \frac{(SD_{E})^2}{n_{E}\bar{X}_{E}^2}+\frac{(SD_{C})^2}{n_{C}\bar{X}_{C}^2}$$ one obtains a vector of log response ratios $L_1 ... L_k$ and corresponding variances $v_1 ... v_k$. There is the need to aggregate some studies as they are considered to belong together as one main study. Say, studies 1, 2 and 3, each having currently an $L$ and a $v$ need to be considered actually as one study with one $L$ and one $v$. A) How to proceed in such cases? B) Is it ok to simply average $L_1, L_2, L_3$ and $v_1, v_2, v_3$ and get $\bar{L}_{123}$ and $\bar{v}_{123}$ that can be further used with other unaggregated $L$-s and $v$-s in the meta-analysis?
