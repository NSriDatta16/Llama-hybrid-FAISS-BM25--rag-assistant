Contrast for hourly counts between 4 groups

I am studying the incidence of different types of stroke in a hospital. I have the information about the time of arrival of each patient and the type of stroke. I divided the whole day into 6 time slots (00-04, 04-08, 08-12, 12-16, 16-20, 20-00) and counted the number of each type of stroke (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, transient stroke and mimic) in each time slot. I obtained the following table: Time slot Ischemic stroke Hemorraghic stroke TIA Mimic 00-4 32 5 1 5 4-8 50 18 2 15 8-12 271 58 22 86 12-16 259 32 28 92 16-20 191 32 15 60 20-00 205 49 9 100 The hypothesis I want to test is whether the frequency of each type of stroke is constant over time. I performed a Chi-squared test, obtaining a p value = 0.00175. However a revisor of a journal says the test is not appropriate to test. He says: "The chi squared test tells you about the correlation of stroke types with each other, but not with the time of day." As far as I know chi squared test could be appropriate for this data. What do you think? Do you think I could perform another type of analysis to improve it? (I also have the raw data)
