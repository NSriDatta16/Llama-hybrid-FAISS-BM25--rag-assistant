Graphing correlations - dependent variable against two factors

I want to find the relationship between two variables and a third. For example, in the graph below I have the total number of questions a student has completed on the x axis, the number of questions they have completed in a particular subtopic on the y-axis and the average score displayed using color. I can't post company data without permission, so I have posted random data instead. But I have found that these kind of graphs don't really help that much. Are there any other kinds of graphs that will visually represent the dependence between two factors in terms of their effective on the third
