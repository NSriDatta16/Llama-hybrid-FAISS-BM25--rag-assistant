overfitting of random forest in r

I am running a random forest classifier in R and during 10-fold cross-validation, I discovered that the model is overfitting. I am using a grid search to find the best hyperparameters and used the best model to predict the same training set again. The random Forest model classified every data point of the train set perfectly. I ran the same model on the test set and got an accuracy of 0.6976. Does this mean that the model is overfitting? I thought random forest models don't overfit? My data is slightly imbalanced with 110 positive samples and 95 negative samples.
