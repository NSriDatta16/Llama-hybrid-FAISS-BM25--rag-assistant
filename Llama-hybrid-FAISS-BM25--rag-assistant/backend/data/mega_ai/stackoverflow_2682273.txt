How Can I Add a New Command to a Control's Event

thanks for taking a look at this question. I have been building an application (VB/WPF) following Josh Smith's example of an MVVM pattern: Click here to view My Views have Controls which trigger a Command upon an event, such as a button click and these are bound to properties in the ViewModel. My ViewModel exposes properties of type ICommand which invoke the appropriate methods. This has worked well, until now! I now want to use a Thumb Control to allow a user to move an object within a Canvas. I don't believe that the Thumb has a Command capability 'out of the box'. A Thumb raises a 'DragDelta' event when being moved. So my question is as follows: How do I extend a Control's capability to issue a Command upon an event please? I wish to issue a new Command, let's say 'onDragDelta' so that I can bind it to a property in my ViewModel just like my Buttons. Thank you very much
