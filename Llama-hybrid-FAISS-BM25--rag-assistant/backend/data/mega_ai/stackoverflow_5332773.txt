Is it a good idea to wrap a data migration into a single transaction scope?

I'm doing a data migration at the moment of a subset of data from one database into another. I'm writing a .net application that is going to communicate with our in house ORM which will drag data from the source database to the target database. I was wondering, is it feasible, or is it even a good idea to put the entire process into a transaction scope and then if there are no problems to commit it. I'd say I'd be moving possibly about 1Gig of data across. Performance is not a problem but is there a limit on how much modified or new data that can be inside a transaction scope?
