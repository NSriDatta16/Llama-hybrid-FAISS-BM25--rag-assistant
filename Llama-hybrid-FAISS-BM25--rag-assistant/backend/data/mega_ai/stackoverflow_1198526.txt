In C# .NET, what is the reason for array.Length vs. list.Count?

Possible Duplicate: count vs length vs size in a collection Am I overlooking a semantic difference between "Length" and "Count", or did perhaps some implementation detail in the .NET Framework require different names for these similar concepts? Given the close attention that was paid to naming and everything else in the framework, there must be a good explanation.
