Doing this kind of thing using regexes is unreliable. The syntax of Java is sufficiently complex that there are bound to be tricky corner cases that will cause your regexes to miscount. Similarly using a bytecode analyser is liable to give you incorrect results because there isn't necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between source code operators / operands and bytecode instructions. The Java compiler may reorganize and rewrite the code in non-obvious ways. The best way to do this sort of thing is to find a decent Java AST library, use that to parse your source code, and then traverse the AST to extract the information you need. (In this case, you need to count the operator and operand nodes.)
