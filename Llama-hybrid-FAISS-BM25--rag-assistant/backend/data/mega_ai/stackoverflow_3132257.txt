convert breaks and paragraph breaks into new line in java

Basically I have an HTML fragment with and inside. I was able to remove all the HTML tags but doing so leaves the text in a bad format. I want something like nl2br() in PHP except reverse the input and output and also takes into account tags. is there a library for it in Java?
