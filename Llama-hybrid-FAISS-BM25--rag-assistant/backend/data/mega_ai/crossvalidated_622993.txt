An excellent question. As @Glen_b implied, the signed rank test, unlike the Wilcoxon unpaired 2-sample test, is metric-dependent. A better test is the Kornbrot rank difference test discussed here . It has slight problems with discrete data (which create a lot of ties in the data) but is invariant to any monotonic transformation of the scale. Here you'll find a section on using regression models for paired data. This generalizes paired tests and opens the way for repeated measures. You'll see an example there where an ordinal random effects model is attempted, with unsatisfactory results (because of the large number of parameters) if one uses the standard frequentist statistics approximation to handle random effects. A Bayesian hierarchical model worked very well, with subjects as random effects (intercepts). Since you are are accounting for within-subject correlation you could extend this approach to joint analysis of all the individual items without summing them. Models generalize tests in many ways, and often lead to better analyses. Plus with models you can estimate secondary parameters such as means and quantiles.
