Apple ZoomingPDFViewer won't allow dragging until after first zoom

I'm using this sample code to view a PDF in my iPhone app: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/ZoomingPDFViewer/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010281-Intro-DontLinkElementID_2 However, the problem is I can't seem to get it to be drag initially. I can pinch and zoom initially, and after I've zoomed once, then I can drag the view around just fine. I just can't drag when the view first loads. Any ideas?
