I think fragment 5 is O(n^3), and similarly fragment 7 is O(n^5)*. It also looks like O(log(n)) for fragment 8. For the n * n problems, you have to execute the body of the loop n * n times, so it would be O(n^2), then you compound that with the order of the other code. Fragment 8 actually doubles the counter instead of incrementing it, so the larger the problem, the less additional work you have to do, so it's O(log(n)) *edit: Fragment 7 is O(n^5), not O(n^4) as I previously thought. This is because both j and k go from 1 to n * n. Sorry I didn't catch this earlier.
