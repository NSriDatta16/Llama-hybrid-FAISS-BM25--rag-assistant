Your notation is quite nonstandard, but your idea is correct as long as you don't mean the last statement as written. The correct conclusion is that "a person who is left-handed is more likely to be homosexual than a right-handed person is," not that a majority of people who are left-handed are homosexual. You are writing $P(A,R)$ for "the probability of $R$ given $A$." Usually that is written $P(R|A)$. The usual interpretation of the symbols $P(A,R)$ would be the probability that both $A$ and $R$ occur. Another way to derive the same implication is Bayes' Theorem. This says $P(R|A) = \frac{P(A|R)P(R)}{P(A)}$, which is equivalent to $\frac{P(R|A)}{P(R)} = \frac{P(A|R)}{P(A)}$. That the left hand side is greater than $1$ means $P(R|A) \gt P(R)$. In words, if you are given $A$ then $R$ is more likely. The left hand side is greater than $1$ means that the right hand side is greater than $1$, which means that if you are given $R$ then $A$ is more likely than without that information. To connect this with $P(A|L)$, note that $P(A)$ is a weighted average of $P(A|L)$ and $P(A|R)$. $P(A) = P(A \cap L) + P(A \cap R) =P(A|L)P(L) + P(A|R)P(R)$. So, if $P(A|R) \gt P(A)$, then $P(A|L) \lt P(A)$, and $P(A|L) \lt P(A|R)$.
