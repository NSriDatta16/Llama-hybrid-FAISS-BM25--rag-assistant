I think jQuery (core) and ExtJS are very compatible. I prefer to start new projects using both; in fact, flot.js demands jQuery - and flot.js is very nice - so in nearly every project I use both jQuery and ExtJS. Go for it! Though ExtJS has made strides in their DOM manipulation and traversal utilities (core), nothing beats the elegance of jQuery (core). However, I prefer ExtJS (UI) to jQuery UI; I find it is much more homogeneous (and capable) than jQuery UI.
