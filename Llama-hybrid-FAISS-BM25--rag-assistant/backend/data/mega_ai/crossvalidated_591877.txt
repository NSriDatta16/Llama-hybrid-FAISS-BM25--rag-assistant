Survival: treat censoring as a competing risk and use multinomial logit

Suppose I am modeling survival with the hazard rate specified using logistic regression, and the model is adequate for the data. Now add censoring, and the model formulation becomes a bit more cumbersome and the implementation a bit more involved. That holds if we assume censoring to be independent of the survival process, but I guess gets even worse if we relax that assumption. On the other hand, could we perhaps treat censoring as a competing risk and go for a multinomial logit model? Both interpretation and implementation would be pleasantly easy again. Moreover, I think we would not have to assume the survival and censoring processes to be independent. Is it an OK approach, or am I missing something (perhaps some implicit assumptions that can be problematic)?
