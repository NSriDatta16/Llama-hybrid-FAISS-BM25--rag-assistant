If you have sufficiently few items to do an exhaustive search of all orderings, decide on a criterion for what a "best guess" means for the overall ordering, and report the ordering that maximizes your criterion. For example, a simple "best-guess" criterion could be the number of A:B pairs that were called in the correct order (A>B vs B>A) by the neural network, regardless of the probability values. (The proportion of correct pairwise rankings is the basis of the area under the curve, AUC, criterion for evaluating receiver-operating-characteristic curves.) Or you might want to add a criterion that more strongly weights the neural-network calls made with high probability. But you would have to choose such weights, depending on what you mean by "best guess."
