there's no 'good' answer here, but I think there should be a distinction made between SVN repos that contain 1 or 2 projects, and others that contain 100. I maintain a SVN repo that was migrated from VSS, it has several hundred "projects" in it, none of them have been organised along the trunk/branch/tag structure (in fact I think that structure is really unnecessary and unhelpful after I've used SVN for a while, it certainly doesn't help when you have to tag 2 or 3 projects as a single change). We maintain a project directory for all our maintained software, under that we have subdirs for configuration and another for source. Under those we have product version numbers - so effectively we are throwing away the concept of trunk, we only have tag directories - the highest number being the trunk (we have to do this as we have to support several versions of the projects simultaneously). Merging happens as needed, so if I update a bug in project A, version 3.0; I'll merge those changes to version 4.0 and v5.0. If I were to do a repo with just 1 or 2 projects, I may be tempted to keep the branch/tag structure, but on the other hand - I'd probably keep the directories explicit in the main tree (assuming I didn't release often enough to tag regularly)(I use the revision number as a 'tag' BTW, and I store binaries in there. So if I need to get a particular old revision, I can grab the right binary from looking at the log) Its surprisingly easy to manage considering I have a 10Gb repo with a revnum currently up past 300,000 with lots of old code in there as well as newer. I would recommend the structure to others and will use it again. Incidentally, one other reason tags dir wouldn't work for us is because we release every time there is a bug or change request, no matter how tiny. Our tags directory would be unmanageable after a while, this is why we use the revnum as a tag - we can associate it with the bug tracker to keep it more human readable too. So to summarise in rough, we have a directory structure like this where v1 and v2 are product versions: maint/source/v1.0/projectA maint/source/v1.0/projectB maint/source/v2.0/projectA maint/source/v2.0/projectB etc obviously, we could put a branch dir under 'source', and a branch/tag under each subproject too but that would become tricky if we needed to release 2 subprojects as a single change request (as we do quite often). Putting a tag subdir under the source dir would mean we tag everything, when only a single subproject got changed (doesn't fit with our requirement to track each subproject individually)
