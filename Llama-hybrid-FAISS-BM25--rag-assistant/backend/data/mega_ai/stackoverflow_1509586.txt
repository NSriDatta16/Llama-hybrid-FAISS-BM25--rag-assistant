Ugly WPF text rendering - can't disable hardware acceleration on Vista

I'm experimenting problems with text rendering in WPF (third party applications and mine too). Labels and other text don't display correctly, look a little blurred and are rendered with some random colored pixels around. I'm working on a low end crap machine (SiS Mirage 3 graphics) with Vista SP1, .NET 3.5 SP1 and graphics driver updated. Another poor souls having similar problems were answered to try disabling hardware acceleration for WPF using Microsoft instructions to change the registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Avalon.Graphics\DisableHWAcceleration The ultimate issue to me is: I can't find "Avalon.Graphics" in the registry at all. It's not there. Someone have a clue? Thanks.
