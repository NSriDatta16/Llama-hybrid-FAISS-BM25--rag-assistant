Merge Microsoft Word documents with TortoiseSVN

TortoiseSVN has a nice VBA script that allows to merge Microsoft Word documents using Word builtin change tracking functionality. This way, when I merge changes from a branch into the trunk I can resolve the conflicts in Word documents. However, the feature is not as useful as it could because it doesn't track revision changes; it just compares the two documents as a whole. This way, when I merge a revision where one paragraph was added to the document I'm not offered to review this paragraph. Instead, I have to review all the differences between the source and target documents (including stuff like TOC bookmark names). Is it an inherent limitation I cannot override? Or is it due to the fact that my Word version is pretty old? (I'm using Word 2002). Also, if you know about a magic tool or plugin... ;-)
