Common strategies to deal with rounding errors in currency-intensive soft?

What is your advice on: compensation of accumulated error in bulk math operations on collections of Money objects. How is this implemented in your production code for your locale? theory behind rounding in accountancy. any literature on topic. I currently read Fowler . He mentions Money type, it's typcal structure (int, long, BigDecimal), but says nothing on strategies. Older posts on money-rounding ( here , and here ) do not provide a details and formality I need. Thoughts I found in the inet relate to "Round half even" as the best way to balance error. Thanks for help.
