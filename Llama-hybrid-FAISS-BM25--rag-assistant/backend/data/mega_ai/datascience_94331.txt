Multivariate time series forecast with VAR confusion

I am new to time-series forecasting. I am working now on a task in which I have a data set, containing samples of approx. 15 variables for every hour for several years. Then, I have a test data set (continues at the next time step where training data ended) containing values for all the variables except one . My task is to build a model using training data that can predict that one variable in the test data set. From reading online, I understood I could use vector autoregression (VAR). I have read many tutorials such as this one . I understand most of it except one thing. When it comes to predicting, they (in the tutorials) predict all the variables . However, I would like to do something different: I would like to predict just the one target variable . And of course take into account values of the other variables in the test data set. To illustrate this, let's say Var Z is my target variable and this is my training set: Var X Var Y Var Z Day 1 11 20 30 Day 2 22 40 60 Day 3 33 60 90 Then this is my test set for which I want to predict Var Z : Var X Var Y Var Z Day 4 44 80 ?? Day 5 55 84 ?? Day 6 66 88 ?? But in the tutorials I have seen so far, they always predict all variables! Question: How to specify I want to forecast only a single variable for certain timestamps and take into account values of other variables at those timestamps? Is VAR not the right tool to use? I would be most grateful if someone could point me in the right direction. I use Python.
