Logistic regression plot out of 1 and 0 limit?

I'm plotting the interaction in logistic regression. Group is binary numeric variable = 1-0 Levz is standardized numeric variable corresponding to scores of a questionnaires. quest is a 3 level character variable with level "low, average, high" I am using this code: plsmo(df$Levz, df$groupnum, datadensity = T, group = df$quest_3lvls, col=c('black', 'red','green'), xlab = 'Lev', ylab ='Group', ylim= c(0,1)) However this is the results and it seems a bit odd to me as it looks as if it is outside the 1 and 0 boundaries. I honestly am quite new to logistic regression, but this looks a bit odd to me. Am I right in doubting?
