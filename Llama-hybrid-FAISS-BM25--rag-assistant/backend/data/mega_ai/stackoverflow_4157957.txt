Which would be faster in retriving data from a mysql database?

Which would be faster in retrieving data from a mysql database? Data split across two columns, or the same size data from a single column? Edit: Just to give an idea, I have a table for a question and five answers it will receive. These answers are quite big about 1500 words each. When it comes to data retrieval speed, should I use a column for each answer, or should I just make one column with the 5 answers separated by a delimiter then use a script to separate them?
