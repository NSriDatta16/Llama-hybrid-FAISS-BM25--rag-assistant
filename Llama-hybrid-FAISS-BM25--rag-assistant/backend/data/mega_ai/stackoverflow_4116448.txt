Subversion display custom message to client upon update

Let an svn repository be shared among many users. let the svn repository be used to store versions of a database creation script and some other non-code objects. is there a way to display a custom message (ie:that can be read from a file) upon update? example: i am working on $project i change the class encapsulating database queries so that i am also adding a single attribute in a database table -> i need to change the test-database creation script so that it contains the new value i modify the file post-update-msg (called, i suppose, by the post-update svn hook) by writing in it: WARNING: the some_db_script changed, you need to generate the test db again and each client, upon performing an svn update command, gets something like: user@box:~/code/svn-working-copy$ svn update U many other stuff U scripts/some_db_script Updated to revision n+1 WARNING: the some_db_script changed, you need to generate the test db again user@box:~/code/svn-working-copy$ can it be done via svn hooks? is there another more elegant/better way of doing it? thanks in advance
