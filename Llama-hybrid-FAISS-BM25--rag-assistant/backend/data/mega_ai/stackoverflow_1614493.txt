I would take a look at the NSTextStorage delegate method -textStorageDidProcessEditing:, which should be called each time a change is made to the underlying text storage. You can then use the -editedRange, -editedMask, and -changeInLength methods to determine what section of the text storage was changed, and look in that range for any attachments that might be of interest to you.
