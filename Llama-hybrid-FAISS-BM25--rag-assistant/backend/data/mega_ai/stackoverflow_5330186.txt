WebRequest/POST question on extracting specific data from a website

I am trying to gather data on specific events from a company website: http://pipeline.kindermorgan.com/infoposting/notices.aspx?type=CRIT I have worked a lot of similar websites but so far they have been pretty simple and it’s just a matter of going to the website and working with the response stream. In this case the website requires you to select a value from the first combo box (TSP/TSP Name). Without any info being passed, the URL will return the data associated with the first item in the list. I really need to be able to get the data associated with any of the items in the list. Here is the code I have been using thus far but it fails with a Server Error 500 so I am guessing that either I did not form the POST properly or am missing some data in the post data): For the page I have listed above I just want to get a response stream with the table of the notices for a particular TSP from the combo box (starting with Trailblazer). I know the control is “ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$ddlpipeline” and the value I want to send is 24. When I navigate via IE, I also have to press the “Retrieve” button. When I look at the POST request using FireBug, I notice that there are a lot of other target/values included. I’m not sure if I need to send all of those as well and (having never done a POST before) I am not sure how to format the data in the POST to do that. Bear with me if this request seems odd. I am more of a database person and am looking to automate a lot of the stuff we are required to look at manually every day. Any help would be greatly appreciated! var encoding = new ASCIIEncoding(); var postData = "ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$ddlpipeline=24"; byte[] data = encoding.GetBytes(postData); string RemoteURI = "http://pipeline.kindermorgan.com/infoposting/notices.aspx?type=CRIT"; var myRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(RemoteURI); myRequest.Method = "POST"; myRequest.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"; myRequest.ContentLength = data.Length; var newStream = myRequest.GetRequestStream(); newStream.Write(data, 0, data.Length); newStream.Close(); var response = myRequest.GetResponse(); var responseStream = response.GetResponseStream(); var responseReader = new StreamReader(responseStream);
