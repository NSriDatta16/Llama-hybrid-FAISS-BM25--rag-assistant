Restore running Async Task in Activity

I'm looking for a complete example of an activity which uses async task and implements a way to refer to a running async task after the activity is paused (onPause). I searched the web for an example which I could use but didn't find a complete one, only code fragments. I'm using async task to ping servers in my app, but a way to save a reference to running async tasks is missing so after onPause, the running tasks get lost. thanks in advance :-)
