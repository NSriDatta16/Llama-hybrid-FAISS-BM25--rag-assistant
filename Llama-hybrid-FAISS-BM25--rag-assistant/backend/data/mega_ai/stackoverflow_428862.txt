Floating Too Far Right

I've got a record management web application which displays a master record on one screen and AJAXes dynamically built editors into an editor div, which I've used JQuery to make draggable. That works. Even though the div isn't a window, I thought it might be a nice idea to make it act a bit more like one, so I coded in a "close" button. The structure looks like this: Editorbody is variable-dimension depending on what people are trying to enter. Draghandle's width is set at 100% of editor. Closebutton is set up in CSS as float:right . My problem is that, in IE6 and IE7, the close button floats too far right. It's always against the right edge of the window, no matter where I drag the editor div around to. In Firefox and Safari it looks like I expected it to - the window is as wide as editorbody and closebutton sits in the top right corner. I'm not particularly attached to float:right, just looking for a way to set up the CSS that'll give me the same result across all browsers. Any ideas? "Screenshots" Here's a mockup of what I'd like to do on jsbin (thanks, redsquare) sample code I'm working with legally sensitive information so I can't provide screenshots of the app. I have, however, taken some shots and blocked out the text and interface, leaving only the window structure. how it looks in IE7 how it looks in firefox 3
