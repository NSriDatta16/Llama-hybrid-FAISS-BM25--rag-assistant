c# code efficency

I have to caculate the number of business days between a given time period which is simple enough, however taking into account public holidays adds in a dimension of complexity. My solution is not what I would call elegant nor efficient as it retrieves public holidays and puts them in a list, checks to see if a date in the list matches a date within the given time period to be checked by incrementing the date from the start date. ALthough this works fine I'd rather have a more efficient algorithm has anyone got any tips or recommend a different data strucuture to hold the public holidays?
