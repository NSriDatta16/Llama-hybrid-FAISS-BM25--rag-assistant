You have to use a SSH-agent that will store the deciphered key in memory. This is really easy under unix, just launch ssh-agent and then ssh-add this will ask you for your password and then store the key. For windows, you can follow this tutorial for using an ssh-agent with TortoiseSVN on windows : http://matttrent.com/articles/how-use-ssh-agent-windows-tortoisesvn . If you already have a key pair, only the part about Pageant is useful for you.
