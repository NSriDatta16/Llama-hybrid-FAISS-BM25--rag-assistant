Font embedding using CSS is not supposed to work in modern web browsers. More precisely, font embedding using CSS was part of CSS2 and was supported by some browsers, but retracted in CSS2.1 (and actually also removed from the CSS2 current specification). Expect a comeback of font support with CSS3 when browsers start supporting that. Firefox 3.5, Opera 10 and Safari are expected to support CSS3 style font-embedding using TTF fonts, Chrome does not feature Safari's support for CSS3 font embedding for some reason. Your problem in rendering your font on IE8 may be related to the fact that the second font-face declaration defines the same font-family as the first - and thus overrides it - but does not declare any eot fonts that IE can use. I suggest you use a single font-face definition such as; @font-face { font-family: 'Kingthings Italique'; src: local('Kingthings Italique Regular'), local('KingthingsItalique-Regular'), url('Kingthings_Italique.eot'), url('Kingthings_Italique.ttf') format('truetype'); } Then IE can try to use the eot font first. Other browsers (but not Chrome apparently) will try to use the eot, then fall back to the ttf rendering. This of course assumes that IE can handle the "alternative sources" definition, which I'm not sure it does - the @font-face documentation in MSDN does not make a reference to that.
