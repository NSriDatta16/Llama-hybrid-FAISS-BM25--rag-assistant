How and How often do you refactor your code?

My question vaguely relates to this one . However, it doesn't address the techniques or practices. I am reading The Pragmatic Programmer and it strongly advocates refactoring code as often as you can. However, it doesn't go into detail about how to do that and how often. How do you guys go about refactoring your code, and how often do you refactor?
