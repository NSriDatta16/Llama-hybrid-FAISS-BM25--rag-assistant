How to interpret the "standardized pair distances" (Std. Pair Dist.) in MatchIt output?

I would like to know how to interpret the Std. Pair Dist. (standardized pair distances) of summary() output of R's MatchIt package. The maintainer @Noha said here that "The average difference between pairs is in the Std. pair dist. column.". Of course I assume he is correct. But I misinterpret it. See the last column in that following example output was generated with method="nearest", distance="glm" : Means Treated Means Control Std. Mean Diff. Var. Ratio eCDF Mean eCDF Max Std. Pair Dist. distance 0.011647 0.011643 0.000624 1.009227 0.000007 0.004008 0.000678 geschlechtm 0.304609 0.312625 -0.017417 NaN 0.008016 0.008016 0.113211 geschlechtw 0.695391 0.687375 0.017417 NaN 0.008016 0.008016 0.113211 alter 69.082164 69.058116 0.002490 0.952987 0.005572 0.014028 0.164750 pflege 0.280561 0.262525 0.024109 1.077771 0.003674 0.010020 0.120543 OK, let's see. Isn't the average just the mean() ? But calculating the mean() on the matched data gives me results different from the summary table (btw: It is Python code because I use MatchIt via Pythons rpy2 package): >>> df.Vm001.distance.mean() 0.011644758037430517 >>> df.Vm001.alter.mean() 69.07014028056112 Question's How is this value computed? What does this value mean? Or how should it be interpreted?
