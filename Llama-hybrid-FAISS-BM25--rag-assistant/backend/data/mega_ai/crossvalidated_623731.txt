Is ARMA fit well-defined?

My question is whether unique time series has a unique set of ARMA parameters that fit it best, once order of AR and MA have been chosen. For simplicity, I will ask only about ARMA(1,1) process. Lets say I have time series $\{x_t\}_{t=0\dots N-1}$ . I can define the lag operator as a matrix: $$ L=\left(\begin{array}\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0\\ \dots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\ \end{array}\right) $$ where $L^k=0$ for all $k\ge N$ . Then $$ L\left(\begin{array}\\x_{N-1} \\ x_{N-2}\\ \dots\\ x_1 \\ x_0 \end{array}\right)= \left(\begin{array}\\ x_{N-2} \\ x_{N-3} \\ \dots\\ x_0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right). $$ With this, I can describe ARMA process as one that fits $$ \left(1-\alpha\cdot L\right)\left(\begin{array}\\x_{N-1} \\ x_{N-2}\\ \dots\\ x_1 \\ x_0 \end{array}\right)=\left(1-\theta\cdot L\right)\left(\begin{array}\\n_{N-1} \\ n_{N-2}\\ \dots\\ n_1 \\ n_0 \end{array}\right) $$ with $-1 and $n_{\dots}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,\,1\right)$ being iid normal variables. Under these conditions $\left(1-\alpha\cdot L\right)$ and $\left(1-\theta\cdot L\right)$ are invertible so I can also write: $$ \left(1-\theta\cdot L\right)^{-1}\cdot\left(1-\alpha\cdot L\right)\left(\begin{array}\\x_{N-1} \\ x_{N-2}\\ \dots\\ x_1 \\ x_0 \end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}\\n_{N-1} \\ n_{N-2}\\ \dots\\ n_1 \\ n_0 \end{array}\right). $$ It would therefore seem that if time series $x_{t}$ is normally distributed already, i.e. $x_t\sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\,1\right)$ irrespective of time, then any combination of $\theta=\alpha$ parameters will fit the solution. If I tried to fit $\alpha,\theta$ using maximum likelihood in such case, it would seem that optimizer would have an infinite number of equally valid solutions (though some may behave better numerically). I am guessing this problem will only become more obvious as the order of the time-series grows. How is this problem normally solved? Is there expectation for ARMA constants to be well-defined given the time-series?
