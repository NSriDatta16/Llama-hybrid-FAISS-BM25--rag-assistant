What does inconsistent test results mean?

I'm doing some research on CNN for text classification using tensorflow. When I run my model I get a very high training accuracy (arround 100%). However, on test split I get an inconsistent accuracy results (sometimes 11% and sometimes 90%). Moreover, I noticed also that the loss in training is decreasing until it reaches small numbers like 0.000499564048368, while in testing it is not and sometimes it gets high values like 70. What does this mean? Any ideas?
