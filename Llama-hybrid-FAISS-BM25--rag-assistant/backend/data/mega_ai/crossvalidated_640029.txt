How to choose the order of differencing?

I have a time series that looks like this I was asked to display the autocorrelation function and perform ADF test and based on that suggest a d for further analysis. I get plots like this and can decide how to choose d, The ADF test is something like this Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: Yt_diff1 Dickey-Fuller = -3.0757, Lag order = 4, p-value = 0.1312 alternative hypothesis: stationary Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: Yt_diff2 Dickey-Fuller = -2.2484, Lag order = 4, p-value = 0.4738 alternative hypothesis: stationary
