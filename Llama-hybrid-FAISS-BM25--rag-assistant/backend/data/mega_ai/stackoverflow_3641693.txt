This: event.preventDefault(); is what is preventing the address bar from updating. I don't believe there is a way to change the URL ( document.location.href ) itself without causing a browser redirect. Even changing the fragment ( document.location.hash ) will cause a "scroll" (depending on whether or not the browser window is small enough to scroll). EDIT: Well, it'll cause a scroll to the respective anchor only if such an anchor exists in your page, as Pekka notes. So I guess you could try that. If you want your page to be indexable by Google despite the Ajax and the Ajax-modified URLs, start your fragments with ! to allow Google to crawl your Ajax pages.
