Formula for marginal density of multivariate normal (Bayesian)?

I would like to ask if anyone knows the formula for the marginal density of a multivariate normal. I could not find it anywhere. Say, $x | \mu \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ and $\pi(\mu) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_0, \Sigma_0).$ What is $p(x)$ ?
