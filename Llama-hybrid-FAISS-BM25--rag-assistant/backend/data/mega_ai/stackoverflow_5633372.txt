My reasoning is multimap is based on the Key lookup/insertion and not on the value. So whether the value on duplicate keys is the same or not does not play a part when elements are being inserted. 23.3.2 Class template multimap 1 A multimap is a kind of associative container that supports equivalent keys (possibly containing multiple copies of the same key value) and provides for fast retrieval of values of another type T based on the keys.
