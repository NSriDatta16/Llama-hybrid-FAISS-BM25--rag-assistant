Its probably not appropriate for me to add this an answer but since there is no way for newbies to comment, I'll just say it here. I agree with karl regarding learning about objects. when we learned about c and c++ at college we started out with structs and then moved on to classes and its really important to learn this stuff if you're serious about programming. a class is just a way of describing an object in the real world. it has attributes and behaviours. For example you could have an employee class that could store all their earnings per month and it could have a function within it that allows you to calculate their recent earnings. These small additions to your code will make it easier to read, organise and reuse. I seriously suggest you spend a few hours googling object oriented concepts and try some c++ examples. they're very easy.
