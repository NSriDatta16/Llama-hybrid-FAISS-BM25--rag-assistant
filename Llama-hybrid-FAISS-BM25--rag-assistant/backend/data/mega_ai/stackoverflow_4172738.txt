I suppose you don't use fragment shader yet. From glprogramming.com : vertex color = the material emission at that vertex + the global ambient light scaled by the materials ambient property at that vertex + the ambient, diffuse, and specular contributions from all the light sources, properly attenuated So yes, vertex color is not used. Edit: You can also look for GL lightning equation in GL specification (you have one nearby, do you? ^^)
