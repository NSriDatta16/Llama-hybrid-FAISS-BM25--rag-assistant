I am assuming the data is labeled +1 and -1 and the underlying model is linear logistic regression for classification. It looks like 7 features are extracted from data (as listed in the "weights" table). During the training, 7 model coefficients will be learned. I assume that it is standard L2-norm regularization with some parameter set by user or set by default. The regularization parameter deserves a special discussion and will be left out of scope. The learned model (the coefficients) are completely dependent on feature values and the labels. I am expressing my guess here. It appears from almost all the learned model coefficients (except SimilarityToTitle and EsharePhrase) has more weight toward predicting the negative class. The only feature "SimilarityToTitle" relatively little contributes to decision in favor for the class +1. The feature "EsharePhrase" has no impact at all as it is 0.
