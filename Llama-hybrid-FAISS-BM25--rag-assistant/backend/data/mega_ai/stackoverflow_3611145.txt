I started learning to develop for iPhone last week, and I've been using both Head First iPhone Development and iPhone SDK Development . They are both great in conjunction with each other. I've been using the head first book when running through exercises hands-on at the computer, and the pragmatic book as more of a reference book to read on-the-go.
