I can't answer your question for Visual Studio 2008, but I know that Netbeans has a few integrated tools for you to use. The code coverage two allows for you to see which paths have been checked, and how much of the code is actually covered by the unit tests. It has the support for the unit tests built in. As far as quality of tests I'm borrowing a bit from the " Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java with JUnit " by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas: Unit testing should check for BICEP : B oundary, I nverse relationships, C ross-checking, E rror conditions, and P erformance. Also quality of the tests are determined by A-TRIP : A utomatic, T horough, R epeatable, I ndependent, and P rofessional.
