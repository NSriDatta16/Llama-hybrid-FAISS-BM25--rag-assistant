How to constrain one type parameter by another

Is there a way to constrain one type parameter to be derived from another? type Foo 'T> = member x.Bar() : 'T = upcast Unchecked.defaultof This code produces the following errors: Error 1 Invalid constraint: the type used for the constraint is sealed, which means the constraint could only be satisfied by at most one solution Error 2 This type parameter has been used in a way that constrains it to always be ''T' Error 3 The static coercion from type 'T to 'T0 involves an indeterminate type based on information prior to this program point. Static coercions are not allowed on some types. Further type annotations are needed. Warning 4 This construct causes code to be less generic than indicated by the type annotations. The type variable 'U has been constrained to be type ''T'.
