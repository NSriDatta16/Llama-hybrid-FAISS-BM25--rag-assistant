I would first look at the properties available in the current HttpRequest class such as: HttpMethod Path PathInfo QueryString RawUrl UrlReferrer UserAgent You may also want to record, if applicable: HttpSessionState.SessionID You could then log the information you need into a database for every request for later analysis. How you analyse the data depends on what you want to know.
