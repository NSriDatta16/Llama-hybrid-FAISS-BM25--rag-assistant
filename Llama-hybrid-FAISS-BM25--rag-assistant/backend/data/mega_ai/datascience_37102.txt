Cannot comment on this particular case without looking at data. But what makes a classifier better or worse for a particular situation is the model fitting curve. Please check this example. If the relationship between dependent and independent variables is best expressed by a line then a SVM model with radial kernel will perform worse than the linear kernel. Similarly based on the algorithm, additional variables may cause model to fit poorly (or produce amazing results) So one of the best ways to validate is to plot the points and see if you can justify the model results (at least partially).
