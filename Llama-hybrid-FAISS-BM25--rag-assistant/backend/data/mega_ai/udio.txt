Udio is a generative artificial intelligence model that produces music based on simple text prompts. It can generate vocals and instrumentation. Its free beta version was released publicly on April 10, 2024. Users can pay to subscribe monthly or annually to unlock more capabilities such as audio inpainting. Founded in December 2023 by a team of former researchers for Google DeepMind headed by Udio's CEO, David Ding, the program received financial backing from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and musicians will.i.am and Common, among others. Critics praised its ability to create realistic-sounding vocals while others raised concerns over the possibility that its training data contained copyrighted music. History Udio was created in December 2023 by a team of four former researchers for Google DeepMind, including Udio's CEO David Ding, Conor Durkan, Charlie Nash, Yaroslav Ganin, as well as Andrew Sanchez under the name of Uncharted Labs. The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz; the music distributor UnitedMasters; musicians will.i.am, Tay Keith, and Common; investor Kevin Wall; Instagram cofounder Mike Krieger; and DeepMind researcher Oriol Vinyals all provided financial backing for Udio, and it was valued at $10 million in seed funding (plus the original $8.5 million raised previously). It spent several months in a closed beta phase before being publicly released in its beta phase on April 10, 2024 on the Udio website. As of April 2024, it allows users to generate 600 songs per month for free. Sanchez described it as "enabl[ing musicians] to create great music and ... to make money off of that music in the future". Udio's release followed the releases of other text-to-music generators such as Suno and Stable Audio. Udio was used to create "BBL Drizzy" by Willonius Hatcher, a parody song that went viral in the context of the Drakeâ€“Kendrick Lamar feud, with over 23 million views on Twitter and 3.3 million streams on SoundCloud the first week. In August 2024, Verknallt in einen Talahon (In Love with a Talahon) a song generated with Udio by Austrian producer Butterbro became the first AI-generated song in the German Top 50. Capabilities Udio bases the songs it creates on text prompts, which can include their genre (including barbershop quartet, country, classical, hip hop, German pop, and hard rock, among others), lyrics, story direction, and other artists to base their sound on. Its lyrics are created with a large language model (LLM), while the process used to generate the music itself, as of April 2024, has not been disclosed. The program generates two songs based on the prompts and users can "remix" their songs with further text prompts. Songs are first generated as roughly 30 second-long pieces, and can be extended by additional 30 second increments. Paying subscribers can access advanced functionality such as audio inpainting. Reception Mark Hachman, the senior editor of PC World, compared Udio to AI art generators and praised its ability to turn "a few rather poor lyrics" into a "rather catchy" song, also calling the vocals it generated "incredibly realistic and even emotional". Sabrina Ortiz of ZDNET described the songs it generated as being "impressive" and sounding "as though they were produced professionally". She also called them "fuller and richer" than those of other text-to-music generators, which she said it had "more personalization options" than. Tom's Guide's Ryan Morrison wrote that Udio had "an uncanny ability to capture emotion in synthetic vocals" and was the only AI music generator "to have captured the passion, pain and spirit of a vocal performance". He added that the program was geared toward "people with no or minimal musical ability". Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone wrote that Udio was "more customizable but also perhaps less intuitive to use" than Suno and added that "some early users have suggested that on average, Udio's output may sound crisper than Suno's".
