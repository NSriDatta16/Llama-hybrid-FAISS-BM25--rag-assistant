Every organization/group has it's own standard. The important thing is that you stick to whatever notation you choose otherwise your customers will be confused. Having said that I've used normally 3 numbers: x.yz.bbbbb. Where: x: is the major version (major new features) y: is the minor version number (small new features, small improvements without UI changes) z: is the service pack (basically the same as x.y but with some bug fixes bbbb: is the build number and only really visible from the "about box" with other details for customer support. bbbb is free format and every product can use it's own.
