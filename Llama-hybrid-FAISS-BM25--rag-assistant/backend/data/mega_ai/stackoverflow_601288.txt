Well, here's what you can go if you want to do it purely by examining the bavhiour of the browser w/ javascript instead of user agent sniffing: Set up a test scenario, and a control scenario. With, say, the following structure: div div w/ content "test" div w/ content "test2" Insert one copy into the document with the two internal divs set to inline-block, and insert another copy into the document with the two internal divs set to block. If the browser supports inline-block, then the containing divs will have different heights. Alternate answer: You can also use getComputedStyle to see how the browser is treating a given element's css. So, in theory, you could add an element with "display: inline-block," and then check the computedStyle to see if it survived. Only problem: IE doesn't support getComputedStyle. Instead, it has currentStyle. I don't know if currentStyle functions identically (presumably it functions similarly to the behaviour we want: disregarding "invalid" values).
