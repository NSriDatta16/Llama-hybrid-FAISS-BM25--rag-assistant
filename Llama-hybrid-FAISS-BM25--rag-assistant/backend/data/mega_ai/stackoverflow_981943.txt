I agree with the general statements that Readability and Maintainability are most important when it comes to optimizing boolean expressions these days. Therefore, DeMorgan's theorem is generally very useful. There is one exception to this rule. If the boolean expression changes a Demorgan's Theorem-optimized expression it might be more difficult to maintain. Consider an expression with several inputs that has been optimized to only show a few boolean conditions. One change to the required boolean logic might force someone to again list out all the possible boolean combinations and then reoptimize. Had the expression been left in an unoptimized format, a change would have taken less steps to complete. More from an anecdotal perspective, I wonder if educating a team about DeMorgan's Theorem and Karnaugh Maps, etc would reduce unnecessary/inefficient boolean expressions. Perhaps if someone has a good understanding of these methods, he/she will tend to produce better expressions. For example, I recently came across this boolean expression in the code of the software I maintain: if ({boolean variable} != true && false)
