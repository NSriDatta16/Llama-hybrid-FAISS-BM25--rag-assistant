Is it reasonable to integrate python with c for performance?

I like to use python for almost everything and always had clear in my mind that if for some reason I was to find a bottleneck in my python code(due to python's limitations), I could always use a C script integrated to my code. But, as I started to read a guide on how to integrate python. In the article the author says: There are several reasons why one might wish to extend Python in C or C++, such as: Calling functions in an existing library. Adding a new builtin type to Python Optimising inner loops in code Exposing a C++ class library to Python Embedding Python inside a C/C++ application Nothing about performance. So I ask again, is it reasonable to integrate python with c for performance?
