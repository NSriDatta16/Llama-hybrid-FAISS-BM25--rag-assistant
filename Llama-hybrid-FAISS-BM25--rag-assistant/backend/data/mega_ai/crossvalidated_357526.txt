Meaning of "differentiable model of the environment dynamics" in RL

Does anyone know what the term "differentiable model of the environment dynamics" means exactly? I read the paper Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments where it is stated for example on page 4: "we do not assume a differentiable model of the environment dynamics, unlike in [24] ...". Even after reading [24] it is not clear to me. Does it mean that the information about the environment (which is incorporated in the state $\mathcal{S}$) changes with the agents actions $\mathcal{A}$?
