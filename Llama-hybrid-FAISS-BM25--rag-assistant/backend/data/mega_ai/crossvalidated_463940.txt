What is a better way to inference on chained machine learning models?

I'm trying to figure out a better way to make inference for my audio gender classification models. I have created 2 models: (1) model1 predicts adult/child, (2) model2 predicts male/female. My current approach is: predict using model1 , if "child", done, else continue predict using model2 , get "male" or "female" If my model1 has an accuracy (on validation) of 85% and my model2 has an accuracy of 93%, then this is the expected accuracyfor my approach: child: $$P(model1\_correct) = 0.85 = 85\%$$ male/female $$P(model2\_correct | model1\_correct) = \frac{0.93\times0.85}{0.85} = 0.93$$ since two models are independent though chained $$P(model2\_correct) = P(model2\_correct | model1\_correct)P(model1\_correct)=0.93 * 0.85 = 0.79$$ Is the calculation above reasonable? However, in this way, my male/female confidence is much lower after adding child. Is there a better way I can use those 2 models for the 3-class classification?
