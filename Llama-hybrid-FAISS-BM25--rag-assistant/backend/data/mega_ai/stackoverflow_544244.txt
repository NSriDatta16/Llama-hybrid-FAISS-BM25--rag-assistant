I use TFSDeployer for the push to production as well, as you can set TFSDeployer up to push so you don't have to install it on the production boxes (it just means that you need to configure permissions for you build account/machine to access production). One useful tip is to restrict permissions on who can change build qualities and only allow the push to production script to fire once the build quality is at the UAT passed level (or whatever the equivalent is for your organistion).
