You could use the webkit rendering of AIR to show the website in an AIR window. You wouldn't need much other code, but then could take advantage of the downloadable/badge installer. Otherwise I imagine you could create a native installer for windows that installs Prism on their machines and then creates the app? Then again it seems Prism and Fluid (on the mac) aren't aimed at the average user, and typically require them to understand the concept of a SSB (site specific browser). When so many people don't even understand what a browser is, it's a tough ask, and one of the reasons I love AIR's install process.
