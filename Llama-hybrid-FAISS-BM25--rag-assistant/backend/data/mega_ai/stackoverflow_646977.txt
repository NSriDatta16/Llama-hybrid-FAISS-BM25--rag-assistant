This can be a pain, and there are many things it could be. The first thing you should make sure of is that there is not a "stuck" transaction. If you have a transaction that never closes, you cannot ever shrink the log. Run "DBCC OPENTRAN" to find the longest running transaction. Also, make sure you reorganize (I think that's the proper term) and move everything to the beginning of the file before shrinking.
