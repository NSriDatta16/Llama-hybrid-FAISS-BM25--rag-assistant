If you have a Service that it active you can catch these events with registerReceiver(new BroadcastReceiver() { @Override public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) { // do something } }, new IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_SCREEN_ON)); However this relies on having a perpetually running service which I have recently learned is discouraged because it is brittle (the OS likes to close them) and uses resources permanently. Disappointingly, it seems it is not possible to have a receiver in your manifest that intercepts SCREEN_ON events. This has come up very recently: android.intent.action.SCREEN_ON doesn't work as a receiver intent filter also Android - how to receive broadcast intents ACTION_SCREEN_ON/OFF?
