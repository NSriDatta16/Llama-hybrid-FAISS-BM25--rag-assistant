Ok, here is a possible work around to this problem. Needless to say it's inelegant but it works nevertheless without going through the pains of writing a custom source control addin for VS2008... Steps: 1. Open MySolution.sln in visual studio and then say add to source control then check in the first version. 2. Goto File->Source Control->Change Source control and unbind the solution from the source control. 3. Close the MySolution.sln 4. Open MySolution_CE.sln 5. Goto File->Source Control->Change Source control and bind the solution from the source control by clicking on Bind VS2008 should pick up the correct bindings automatically if the dir structure mentioned in the question was adhered to. 6. Add CE specific files to the solutions/projects and do an initial checkin. 7. Repeat this bind/unbind operation each time you wish to do a checkin from the other solution (I know this is a pain). Hope this helps.
