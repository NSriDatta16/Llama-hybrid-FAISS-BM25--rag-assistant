Which data mining or machine learning algorithm would be appropriate for learning ordered frequent patterns?

I have a dataset as (var1, var2, out) , where the ordered pair gives out . Most of the frequent pattern mining algorithms like the Apriori and FP growth algorithms do not preserve the order of var1 and var2 . Which are some of the available pattern mining algorithms (maybe also a NN trick), to find association rules between ordered pair and output variable out ?
