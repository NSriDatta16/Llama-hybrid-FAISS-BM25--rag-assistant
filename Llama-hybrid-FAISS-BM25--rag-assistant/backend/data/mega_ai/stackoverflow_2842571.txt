FileMaker Pro vs CiviCRM

I would like some input about these two softwares since we are trying to change our current Access database, which has brought many problems and is completely outdated (it was built 10 years ago). These are the 2 options we have in mind and being a non-profit organization (20 employees), it's quite a big decision in particular in terms of costs. Due to the type of business, we will need several hours of development too. Any feedback will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much in advance, Silvana
