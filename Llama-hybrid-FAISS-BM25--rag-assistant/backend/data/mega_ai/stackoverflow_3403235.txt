I didn't get the embedded jetty/tomcat part. You want the desktop app to run an embedded server that talks to the database? So each desktop app would open a DB connection? Why not have a Java desktop app that sends HTTP requests to a JavaEE server that connects to the DB and processes the requests? So basically, a Java client (which could be as rich as your developers can make it) replacing a browser. This gives you a lot more scalability, etc. We have a similar (albeit much more complex) product developed using - Swing + Apache Commons HttpClient on the desktop. This makes an HTTP POST request with serialized binary data to the server. - A dispatcher servlet running in a web container that recreates the Java object on the server and executes the request.
