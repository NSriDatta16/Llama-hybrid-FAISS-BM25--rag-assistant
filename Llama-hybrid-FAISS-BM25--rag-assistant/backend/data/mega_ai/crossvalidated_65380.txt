Translating that paragraph: Let there be a set of features that describe a data point. Maybe you're looking at the weather. That set of features might include things like temperature, humidity, time of day, etc. So each data point might have one feature (if you're only looking at temperature) or it might have 2 features (if you're looking at temperature and humidity) and so on. What this paragraph is saying is that based on the number of dimensions your data has (how many features it has), the more difficult it is to make an estimator. This is because if you simply have one feature of data, or 1-dimensional data, then when you go to graph this data, you get a line graph, and imagining a line graph between let's say 0-50 degrees C, it only takes 50 random points before each data point is about 1 degree from any other data point. Now let's think about 2 dimensions, talking about humidity and temperature, now it's trickier to find that d such that all the points are within "d" units of each other. Imagine temperature is still between 0-50 but now humidity is also between 0-100%. How many random points does it take to get all the points within 1 or 2 of each other? Now it's 100 * 50 or ~5,000! Now imagine 3 dimensions, etc etc. You start needing way more points to ensure that every point is within d of some other point. To make your life easier try assuming "d" is 1 and see what happens. Hope that helps!
