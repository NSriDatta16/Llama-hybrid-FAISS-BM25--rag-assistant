What you seem to want is an (average) marginal effect. I am not an R person, so I cannot tell you what to type, but I would be very surprised (dare I say dissapointed) if there wasn't a package to do that for you. Edit The marginal effect is $\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\beta$ . So to compute the average marginal effect, you compute the predicted proportion for each individual in your data, compute the marginal effect for each individual using the equation above, and than compute the average of these individual marginal effects.
