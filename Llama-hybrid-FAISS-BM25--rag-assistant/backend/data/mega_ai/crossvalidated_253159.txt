You may find it more useful to think of "central tendency" as giving a sense of the distribution's location. This is in contrast to measures of spread (variance, range, etc.), which don't communicate location. From the wikipedia entry for central tendency : In statistics, a central tendency (or, more commonly, a measure of central tendency) is a central or typical value for a probability distribution. It may also be called a center or location of the distribution. For many examples, the mean, median or mode will communicate the location of the distribution well. If you want to know how much it costs to buy a houseboat in Amsterdam, for example, knowing the average price, the 50th percentile price, or the most common price will all give you a sense of what a houseboat there costs. Of course, there will be plenty of variability in that distribution, and knowing the mean (or median or mode) won't tell you how much any individual houseboat would cost. But it does give you an idea of the location of the distribution of prices of houseboats on the scale of \$0 to \$infinity (e.g. you'll have the sense that it costs more than a cup of coffee and less than buying a restaurant in Tokyo). Even for many discrete variables, the mean can be interesting and useful (for example, you may be curious about the average number of rooms per houseboat even though it's nonsensical to talk about a fraction of a room). Because the mean is so useful and so widely applicable, I think many people conflate "central tendency" with "average value", but there's no real reason to do that. As you point out, there are plenty of situations where the mean (or median) is an unusual value (multimodal or nonsymmetric distributions) or even an impossible value (in the case of discrete distributions). Happily, there are plenty of ways to communicate location / central tendency. Just pick one that makes sense for your data.
