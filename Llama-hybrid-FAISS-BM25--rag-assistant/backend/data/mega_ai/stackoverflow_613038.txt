Rolling Your Own Plaintext Wiki (Wiki inside a DB)

Anyone know of an API (php preferable but I'd be interested in any language) for creating wiki-like data storage? How about any resources on rolling your own plaintext wiki? How do other plaintext wikis handle the format of the text file? I understand I can use Markdown or Textile for the formatting. But what I'm most interested in is how to approach the plaintext storage of multi-user edits. I'm writing a web application that is primarily database driven. I want at least one text field of this database to be in a wiki-like format. Specifically, this text can be edited by multiple users with the ability to roll back to any version. Think the wiki/bio section of Last.FM (almost the entire site is strictly structured by a database except for this one section per artist). So far, my approach of taking apart MediaWiki and wedging it into a database seems like overkill. I'm thinking it would be much easier to roll my own plaintext wiki, and store this file in the database's appropriate text field.
