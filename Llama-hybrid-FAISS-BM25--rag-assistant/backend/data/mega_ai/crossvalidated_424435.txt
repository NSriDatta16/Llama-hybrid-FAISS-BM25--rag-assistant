Is different sample size okey for a Repeated measure-between Subject experiment?

I have data from a between-subject experiment (Repeated measures, two conditions). Condition A has 15 participants while condition B is with 19. The difference is due to missing data. My aim is to use this data to compare the frequentist( lme4 ) approach to the Bayesian approach ( brms ). What can I do about the difference in sample size between A & B?
