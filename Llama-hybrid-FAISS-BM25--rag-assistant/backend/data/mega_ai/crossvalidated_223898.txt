One-to-many matching of propensity scores and average treatment effect on the treated

I've been working on a propensity score matching project, but having no stats classes under my belt I'm struggling to calculate the so called "average treatment effect on the treated" (ATT) so that it will be statistically valid. It seems straight-forward enough when looking at the following formula: $ATT = E[y1 - y0 | p(x)] = E[y | t = 1,p(x)] - E[y | t = 0, p(x)]$ That is, the average treatment effect on the treated is equal to the expected value ($E$ = average in this case) of the difference between the outcome variable (for example, $y$ = income) for treated and untreated individuals (where, for example, treated individuals ($t=1$) received some sort of training and untreated individuals ($t=0$) did not), conditional on their propensity scores, $p(x)$ (i.e. when their propensity scores match "well enough"). With one-to-one matching of treated and control individuals using nearest neighbour or exact matching, calculating ATT manually in a spreadsheet is fine, but when matching more than one control to each treated individual things seem to get a little tricky. As such, I'm hoping someone may be able to help me figure out what the generally accepted methods for calculating ATT are when dealing with one-to-many matching between treated and control individuals.
