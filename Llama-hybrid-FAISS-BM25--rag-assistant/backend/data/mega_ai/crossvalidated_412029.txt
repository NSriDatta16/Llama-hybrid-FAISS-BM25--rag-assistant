If I'm reading the question correctly, it seems that you want to use logistic regression, which a form of generalized linear model. You could of course still use a logistic GAM to incorporate non-linear effects in the x_value and y_value. pyGAM is one package you could try, or you could call R which has more mature packages available. You may also want to treat Person as a random effect.
