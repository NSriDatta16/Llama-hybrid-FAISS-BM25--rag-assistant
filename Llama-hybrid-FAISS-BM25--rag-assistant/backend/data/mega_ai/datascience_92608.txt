How to use random forest with large number of categorical features and categories?

I have 2 features productName and productCategory , both of them are strings. I have a category named supplier . There are 4000 suppliers and 500,000 items in test data. I don't think one hot encoding will be a good approach to deal with such a big data. How should i handle these using random forest ?
