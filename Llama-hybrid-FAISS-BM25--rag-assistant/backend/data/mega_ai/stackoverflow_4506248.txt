I suggest that you use a DTPicker control, instead. This is the date/time picker that is available for VB 6 applications, and it essentially forces the user (but much more gently than that makes it sound) to enter a valid time in the proper format. Trying to do this validation yourself is a giant pain in the rear, and not worth the effort since using a built-in control makes it so much simpler. You can start using this in your project by following these steps: In the VB 6 IDE, open the "Project" menu, and then click "Components" (or press Ctrl + T ). Scroll down nearly to the bottom of the list and select "Microsoft Windows Common Controls-2" (preferably version 6.0, if available, rather than version 5.0). Once you click OK, you will find a handful of new controls added to your toolbox. Find and click on the one called DTPicker . It will look something like this: Drag the DTPicker control to your form. Make sure that the control you just added is selected, then in the "Properties" window, scroll down to the "Format" property and set it to "2 - dtpTime". This specifies that you want to accept a time value in the DTPicker control, rather than a date.
