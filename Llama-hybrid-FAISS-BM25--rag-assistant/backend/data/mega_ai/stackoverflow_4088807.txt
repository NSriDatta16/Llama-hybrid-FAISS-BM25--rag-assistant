JDB could be used, it wouldn't be my first choice though. Here is a good explanation how to use it: http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2000-06/04-qa-0623-jdb.html You need to remember to include debug information when you compile your files and set up the Tomcat so you are able to connect to it, this is the string, as mentioned by other post: -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE-Xrunjdwp:server=y, transport=dt_socket,address=8000,suspend=y 8000 can be replaced by any other numerical value. It basicaly tells jvm to listen on that port for a debugger. What will happen now, is tomcat will start but suspend itself and wait for a debugger to attach before proceeding. Start JDB and attach: jdb -attach localhost:8000 in here, localhost can be replaced by where tomcat is running if it's running on a different machine and 8000 can be replaced with whatever port you set jvm in tomcat. Now you can debug, you can see the debug instructions if you type help in jdb.
