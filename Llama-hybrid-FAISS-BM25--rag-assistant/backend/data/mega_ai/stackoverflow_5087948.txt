How to remove specific Cobertura warning?

When i am running my ANT build script, Cobertura is complaining with the following warning. With that, i am wondering what it means really and how can i turn it off. [ cobertura-instrument] WARN visitEnd, No line number information found for class com.x.y.z.A. Perhaps you need to compile with debug=true? ANT sample below: Please advise.
