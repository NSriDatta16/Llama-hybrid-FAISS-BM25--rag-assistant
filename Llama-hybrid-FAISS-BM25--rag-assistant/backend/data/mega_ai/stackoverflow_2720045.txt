Unfortunately, MATLAB will never display the behavior that you claim for the code fragment you show, since this particular fragment will ALWAYS do the proper thing. You are doing something wrong here, but we cannot know what it is, and your code is too long for us to find the error anyway. I would bet the answer lies in one of these common problems: An issue with global variables. A namespace conflict, where you have named a variable the same name as a function. A class problem, where a test is made comparing variables of different classes, perhaps uint8 and doubles. A precision problem, where a test for exact equality is done with floating point numbers. In order to resolve the issue, I would strongly recommend the debugger. Track through your code, watching this variable to see when it changes.
