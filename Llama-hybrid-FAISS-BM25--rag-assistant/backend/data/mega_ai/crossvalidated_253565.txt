Seasonal component in daily time series remains after stl?

I'm following the procedure in this post ( Adjusting daily time series data for the seasonal component ) on R 3.2.3 (linux). The de-seasoning process in the above post works fine. But with my data, a weather time series with 32,000+ observations, the same process leaves behind a noticeable seasonal trend, as shown below. > ZI_Index ZI_Trends plot(ZI_Trends) > ZI_Detrend monthplot(ZI_Detrend) > ZI_Detrend_Trends plot(ZI_Detrend_Trends)
