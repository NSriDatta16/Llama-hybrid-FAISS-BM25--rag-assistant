Facebook Pages — Authoritative List of Categories

I'm trying to find out about a Facebook user's interests based on pages they like, etc. It would be useful to have the list of possible page categories. I have made a rough list based on the dropdown menus from the page creation form, but the values in this are slightly different to those returned by the Graph API (e.g. "Sports_teams" as opposed to "Sports team"). So, what I'd like to know is: Where can I find a complete list of available categories, in the form that I'll see them when I query the Graph API? Are these strings localised? If so, where can I find the en_GB ones? Thanks in advance for your help. Ross BTW, my list of categories is: 19,Band 19,Musician 68,Restaurant 88,Film 89,TV Programme 91,Technology product/service 92,Financial Service 94,Fashion 108,Museum/attraction 109,Park 110,Travel 111,Hotel/B&amp;B/Hostel 112,Hotel/B&amp;B/Hostel 113,Travel service 114,Airline/Ship/Train Station 115,Convention or sports centre 116,Car Hire 117,Home living 121,Café 123,Health and beauty 124,Education 125,Event planning service 126,Banking and financial service 127,Technology and telecommunications service 129,Medical service 130,Home service 131,Car Dealer/Vehicle Service 132,Local business 133,Pharmaceutical 134,Pets 135,Professional service 136,Professional service 137,Property 138,Food &amp; drink 139,Supermarket 140,Automotive 141,Consumer product 142,Sports/athletics 143,Retail 144,Shop 145,Online shop 147,Religious organisation 148,Religious centre 149,Library/Public Building 150,Government 151,Politician 152,Non-profit 154,Game 156,Sports team 157,Actor 158,Model 159,Comedian 160,Visual artist 161,Writer 162,Critic 163,Public figure 164,Club 165,Pub/bar 167,Website 169,Athlete 170,Communications 176,Products 349,Government Official
