Maybe this: ASP.NET MVC - Is there a way to simulate a ViewState? http://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2009/10/08/Leveraging-ASPNET-MVC-2-futures-ViewState.aspx http://forums.asp.net/t/1285163.aspx and this might help too http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:y26JBxHjbBUJ:www.beansoftware.com/ASP.NET-Tutorials/Intro-ASP.NET-MVC.aspx+how+does+mvc+save+view+state&cd=8&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us There are a lot of articles about view states in MVC and since you're new to this perhaps some pre-reading would be handy and may even answer your upcoming questions! Good luck!
