Recurrent neural networks with loss of data

I want to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) for making predictions of some data. I have 8 variable inputs and with them I have to make predictions of other two variables (outputs). I need RNN to capture the dynamics because past inputs continue affecting the outputs. The problem is that I only have data 10 hours a day and the rest of the time there is a gap in my data. How could I train a RNN using data from e.g. one week?
