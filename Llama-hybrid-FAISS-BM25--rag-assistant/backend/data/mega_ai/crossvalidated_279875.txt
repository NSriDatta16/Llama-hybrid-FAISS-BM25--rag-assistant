If you consider logistic regression to be learning parameters $\beta_i$ for the function $$ f(\beta_0+\sum_{i=1}^{10}\beta_ix_i) $$ were $f$ transforms the linear sum to a probability range between 0 and 1. I think you may be failing to consider the $\beta_0$ term. When x_test = [0,0..] therefore $x_i=0$ $$x_i = 0$$ $$y = f(\beta_0) = 0.43$$ In your case with the $\beta_0$ learning by the algorithm.
