The choice between one multinomial and a series of logistic regressions is in most cases relatively artificial. Since in both approaches you select one baseline category (reference) with regard to which the odds ratios of all other categories are expressed, it usually does not matter if you have the one or the other if the reference category remains equal. The biggest disadavantage is that you cannot test simultanous parameter restrictions across the logistic models, which is rather straight forward in the multinomial case. Nevertheless I would advise not to use random effects with 13 countries (level 2 units), see e.g. https://www.statmodel.com/download/SRM2012.pdf . The alternative is to use a fixed effects model, where you include one dummy per country (minus 1). The biggest disadvantage of this prcedure that testing macro-level effects is not feasible. if you don't have any hypotheses in this regard I would go for the fixed effects multinomial model.
