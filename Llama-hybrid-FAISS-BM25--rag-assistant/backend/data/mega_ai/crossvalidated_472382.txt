I believe what you are describing is typically referred to as the highest density interval or HDI. You can calculate the interval in R using the ‘HDInterval’ package. The documentation does a good job of describing the interval: The HDI is the interval that contains the required mass such that all points within the interval have a higher probability density than points outside the interval. However, I think the best explanation is given by the following set of graphs which I have lifted from John K. Kruschke's book, Doing Bayesian Data Analysis . Notice how in the second example, the interval is not symmetric, and how in the third example with bimodal data, it is not even continuous! The HDI is most often used and discussed in applications related to Bayesian statistics. However, it applies to any probability distribution.
