confusion related to maximum a posteriori estimation

I was reading this article in wikipedia related to MAP http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation . However, I had this confusion when it says MAP estimation is a limit of Bayes estimators (under the 0-1 loss function), it is not very representative of Bayesian methods in general. What does it mean MAP estimation is a limit and it has presented a criticism of MAP stating that the mean/median estimates will be better. I didn't get why it is so? Any guidance will be appreciated.
