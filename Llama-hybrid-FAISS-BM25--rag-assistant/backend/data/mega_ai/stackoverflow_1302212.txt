Draggable div issue in IE7

This example uses mootools but I see the same behavior with scriptaculous. I have a div with some content, in this case a single X and there's plenty of white space around the content. I make the div draggable but I find it's difficult to drag the div in IE. In IE I need to click and drag directly on the content of the div, the single X. If I click in the div, but away from the X, the div just sits there. It behaves as expected in FF, Chrome and Safari. Here is a complete working example with mootools. You'll have to update the script tags to reflect what you named your mootools libraries. (on edit I added a scriptaculous example as well) Mootools problem #my-drag{ width: 100px; height: 100px; border: solid 1px black; } #my-drag p{ text-align: center; } function start() { var e = $('my-drag'); e.makeDraggable(); } X Here's the same example using prototype scriptaculous - same issue IE Drag problem #my-drag{ width: 100px; height: 100px; border: solid 1px black; } #my-drag p{ text-align: center; } function start() { new Draggable('my-drag', { starteffect: null, endeffect: null }); ; } X
