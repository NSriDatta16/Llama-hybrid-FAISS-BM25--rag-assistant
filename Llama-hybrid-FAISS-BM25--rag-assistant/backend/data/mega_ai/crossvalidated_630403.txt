Combining two distance matrices (cosine and gower) for clustering

I have two distance matrices: one produced based on cosine distances and another produced with Gower distance. I have used these separately for clustering, but I would like to combine them somehow to feed into a single clustering model. I have read about two options to combine distance matrices: do a weighted sum (w*D1+(1-w)*D2) or superimpose (like a 3D object) and average them point by point. I am inclined towards the first, but I don't know if these 2 distances have the correct properties for the weighted sum. Can you clarify what is the common practice? Is there any R package to handle such cases?
