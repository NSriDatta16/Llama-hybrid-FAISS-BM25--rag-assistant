Fastest LSTM training in CPU-only (no-GPU) setting

Training more or less sophisticated RNNs (e.g. LSTM) takes ages in CPU-only setting. I've tried Lasagne-over-Theano, Keras-over-TF and torch-rnn implementations of character-level language models (shakespeare.txt / nietzsche.txt) and they are terribly slow. Are there better solutions?
