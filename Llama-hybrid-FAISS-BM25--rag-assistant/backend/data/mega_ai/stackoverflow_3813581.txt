I saw this problem in an earlier version of Magento with regards to Paypal. The issue was that the processor was expecting a negative value (-5.00) and Magento was passing a positive one (5.00) or vice versa. I'd check the redirect page from Magento and see if the discount is applied with the opposite sign.
