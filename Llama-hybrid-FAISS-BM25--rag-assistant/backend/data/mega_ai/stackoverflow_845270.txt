By reading "Purple Dragon Book" (sic) it seems that modern compilers and interpreters actively using "look ahead" buffer and accumulate recent text, so they can easily check few next symbols and few previous symbols in order to get exact lexem type. So, in my example event() need to look at next and previous symbols in order to decide type of lexem that might be accumulated.
