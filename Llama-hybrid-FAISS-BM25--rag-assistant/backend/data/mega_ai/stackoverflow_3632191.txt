When and how should one use project roles instead of groups within JIRA?

I am having a little difficulty understanding when a person should configure JIRA permissions using groups and when they should use project roles. I have read the online documentation, however, the difference between the two seems subtle. A group seems simple enough. Group users into a named bucket. Assign the group to one or more permissions within a permission scheme to enable access to functionality for any users within the group. Assign the permission scheme to a project to apply the permissions to that project . A project role seems very similar. It does all of the above except that you can also add groups to project roles . It seems that a project role also allows a project administrator to add their own users to a project instead of requiring a system administrator. However, I am not sure how I can leverage this. Here is an example of what I want to achieve. Have multiple projects created in JIRA. All of our managers, developers, etc. have the same permissions across all projects. Our clients have access only to their projects. I think that the best way to accomplish this is to: Create an employees group to which I add all of our employees. Create one or more project roles to which I add the appropriate clients. Assign permissions to the Default Permissions Scheme using the employees group . Copy the Default Permission Scheme to a new project specific scheme, e.g., client-scheme Assign the client-scheme to the client specific project. However, it seems that I am not leveraging project role membership . How does this come into play? What is the best practice for using JIRA groups and project roles ? What is the different between the two?
