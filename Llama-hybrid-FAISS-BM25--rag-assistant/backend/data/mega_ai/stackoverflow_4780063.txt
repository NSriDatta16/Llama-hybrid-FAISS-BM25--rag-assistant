Drupal Go to ends in infinite redirects

I am using drupal go to in page.tpl.php if anonymous user tries to access /node/edit ,so that its redirected to /home page, this is how i am checking global $user; if( $user->uid !=1 ){ if($_REQUEST[q] =='node/edit'){ echo "IN IF"; drupal_goto('/', '', $fragment, 301); }else if($_REQUEST[q] =='node/edit/'){ drupal_goto('/', '', $fragment, 301); } } But i will get this error Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete.
