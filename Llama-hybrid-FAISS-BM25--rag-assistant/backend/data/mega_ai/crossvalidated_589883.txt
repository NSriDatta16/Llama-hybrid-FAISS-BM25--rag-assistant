Random forests in low-dimensional vs high-dimensional datasets

Summary: Is random forest naturally more robust to bad features in high vs low dimensional datasets? I've made a number of text classifiers with Scikit's Random Forest, with thousands of features from text tokenization, and have been happy with them. They're easy to work with, even with mostly out-of-the-box hyperparameters, and I get to decent classification performance relatively quickly. Dimensionality reduction like T-SVD has never helped these for me I've assumed this means RF is talented at feature selection and ignoring features that don't aid prediction. Now I'm working on a much lower-dimensional problem (2-50 features, N=2000 samples), and I've been surprised that RF is very sensitive to adding bad features . Very often adding one feature decreases the classification performance (AUC from CV). I've tried some hyperparameter tuning, but not sure how to optimize its "robustness to trying bad features". It's much harder to try features than in past experiences...more manual trial and error, even single levels of categorical variables at a time. I know RFs were "designed" for high-dimensional situations. But I assumed they would be relatively robust to trying noise features -- which is why you can throw a lot of text tokens at it. I figured even in low-dimensional situations, with RF I could throw 100 ideas at it and it would sift through em. (Then after I could find a parsimonious set of features that's carrying the weight.) I seem to be wrong. Would love to improve my intuition here. Is my experience (adding bad features degrades RF performance more in my lower-dimensional problem than higher-dimensional ones) because of... A known behavior of RF, being easier to work with when there are very high dimensions? I've got improper hyperparameters in my lower-dimensional situation, not adding enough "randomness" to the forest like you get in higher-dimensional situations? Not a universal experience, but related to unique characteristics of datasets, sample size, etc? Something else? Thank you so much for any guidance!
