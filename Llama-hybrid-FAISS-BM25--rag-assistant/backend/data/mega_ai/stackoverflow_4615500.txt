How to start a new list, continuing the numbering from the previous list?

I'm trying to do something that used to be really easy before the start attribute on ol tags was deprecated. I'd just like to have a pair of ordered lists in my page, but start the numbering of the second list where the first one finished. Something like: 1. do stuff 2. do stuff Here's a paragraph 3. do stuff I've seen that the counter-reset and counter-increment CSS properties should be able to achieve this, but I can't get it working. Here's my code so far: ol li { counter-increment: mycounter; } ol.start { counter-reset: mycounter; } ol.continue { counter-reset: mycounter 2; } You can't touch this You can't touch this STOP! Hammer time. You can't touch this To be honest, even if that worked, it wouldn't be ideal. I don't want to have to specify the number reached by the first list in my ol.continue selector. What am I doing wrong? What's the minimal HTML/CSS combination required to achieve the desired effect?
