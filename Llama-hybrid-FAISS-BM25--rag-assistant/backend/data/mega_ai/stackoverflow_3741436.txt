It does seem to be a regression with some part of the reporting code not respecting timezone issues. The output is tagged as ending before it began, so gets very confused and chokes. One work-around, that I found somewhere on Google, is to change the Run Script stage of the target. Change "${SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_DIR}/Tools/RunUnitTests" to "${SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_DIR}/Tools/RunUnitTests" 1> /tmp/RunUnitTests.out Itâ€™s working round the issue, rather than solving it, but does work.
