Detailed balance for a continuous Markov chain with transition kernel $K(\cdot,\cdot)$ and stationary density $f(\cdot)$ writes as $$f(x)K(x,y)=f(y)K(y,x)$$ It means that, in a stationary regime, the joint distribution of $(x_t,x_{t+1})$ is the same as the joint distribution of $(x_{t+1},x_{t})$ . This implies that the chain $(x_t)$ is (time-)reversible.
