PHP - SELECT * FROM ... but view last element in database first

Hey, first of all thanks for helping me out with this (probably stupid) question :) I did my research but can't find any solutions on google. Is it possible to start viewing the last element in my database? for example: DATABASE (comments): name | comment jan | Test bert | Test2 sam | Test3 PHP: $sql="SELECT * FROM comments"; $result=mysql_query($sql); while($rows=mysql_fetch_array($result)){ echo $rows['name']; echo $rows['comment']; } THE RESULT: jan Test bert Test2 sam Test3 MY PURPOSE: sam Test3 bert Test2 jan Test Thanks in advance for your help :)
