Using sax writer to create line feeds in a xml 2003 workbook

Hi stackoverflow comunity, using a sax writer with the progress-4gl language i succeeded in creating an a xml 2003 workbook. My problem began when i wanted to add a linefeed to a cell. The normal linefeed for excel (in xml) is made using " ", this is a problem because the sax-writer converts & to &amp. I did find a workaround by using hSax#:write-entity-ref() but this is not ideal because linefeeds are usualy not in the beginning of the string. example: this is a new line. In this case u need to write this is a, then use hSax#:write-entity-ref() and then write new line. I'd say there has to be a better way to fix this ?
