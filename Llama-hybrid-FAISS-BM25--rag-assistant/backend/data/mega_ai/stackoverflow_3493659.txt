How do you add a relationship in a dataset that contains three tables : e.g. users, roles and user_roles

My problem is like this, I have 3 tables: - users (user_id, name) - roles (role_id, role_name) - user_roles(user_id, role_id); I load them all in a dataset. The challenge is to build a relation (or more?) in this dataset, that when given to a ultragrid (infragistics) they would display right - for each user his roles (name, description).
