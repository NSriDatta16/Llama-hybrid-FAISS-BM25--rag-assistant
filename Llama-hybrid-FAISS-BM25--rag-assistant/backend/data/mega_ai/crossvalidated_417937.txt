High peaks at same fixed lag in both acf and pacf of residuals of model from auto.arima and tbats output. Really stuck with this one

I have data for every 15 mins for 4 years. ADF test shows that my data is stationary. I tried fitting model using auto.arima and seasonal=F,and I get the output as ARIMA(3,1,2) but the residual acf and pacf both have significant peaks at lag=96. I tried differencing my time series at lag=96 and fitted auto.arima again to get an output of ARIMA(3,0,6) but now the peaks became much more significant. I have become clueless how to get rid of these peaks P.S. auto.arima with seasonal=TRUE parameter hangs my R session. Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance
