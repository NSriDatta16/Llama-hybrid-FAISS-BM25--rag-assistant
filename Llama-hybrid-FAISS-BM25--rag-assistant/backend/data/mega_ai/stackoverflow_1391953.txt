To me, there are as many pros as there are cons to using maven vs ant for in-house projects. For open source projects however, I think Maven has had a great impact in making many projects much easier to build. It wasn't too long ago that it took hours get the average OSS Java (ant based) project to compile, having to set a ton of variables, downloading dependent projects, etc. You can do anything with Maven you can do with Ant, but where Ant doesn't encourage any standards, Maven strongly suggests you to follow it's structure, or it'll be more work. True, some things are a pain to set up with Maven that would be easy to do with Ant, but the end result is almost always something that is easier to build from the perspective of people who just want to check out a project and go.
