v2 of the Google Maps API is deprecated, so you should ideally use v3. v3 does not need an API key as mentioned in the documentation . Since v3 is the official version now, I assume the links given in google maps are for the version. You can always just try and see if embedding the iframe works for you. Though as noted, you can't really customize the map, so you should use the API. It's very simple to set up a basic map (read the tutorial).
