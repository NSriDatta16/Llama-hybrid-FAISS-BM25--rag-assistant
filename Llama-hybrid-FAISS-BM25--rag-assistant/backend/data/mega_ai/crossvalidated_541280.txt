The second example in this thread compares a frequentist confidence interval to two different posterior intervals based on two different non-informative priors. Despite using all the information in the likelihood, both credible intervals can be considered inferior because: i) neither credible interval provides a long-run guarantee of covering the unknown fixed true parameter; ii) it is not obvious which non-informative prior one should choose when constructing the posterior if the experimenter truly has no prior knowledge; iii) the posterior probability statements are not verifiable statements about the actual fixed parameter, the hypothesis, nor the experiment. Both the credible interval and the confidence interval attempt to address the request, "Give me a set of plausible true values of the parameter , given the observed data." In his answer to the original post, Dikran Marsupial provides the following: (a) "Give me an interval where the true value of the statistic lies with probability p", then it appears a frequentist cannot actually answer that question directly (and this introduces the kind of problems that Jaynes discusses in his paper), but a Bayesian can, which is why a Bayesian credible interval is superior to the frequentist confidence interval in the examples given by Jaynes. But this is only becuase it is the "wrong question" for the frequentist. (b) "Give me an interval where, were the experiment repeated a large number of times, the true value of the statistic would lie within p*100% of such intervals" then the frequentist answer is just what you want. The Bayesian may also be able to give a direct answer to this question (although it may not simply be the obvious credible interval). Whuber's comment on the question suggests this is the case. Dikran Marsupial 's response is wrong for two reasons. The first is that neither the credible interval nor the confidence interval is a set of statistic values. Each is a set in the parameter space. Secondly, if we ignore this mistake and consider both the confidence and credible interval as residing in the parameter space, it is misleading in (a) to suggest a Bayesian approach can provide "an interval where the true parameter lies with 100p% probability." Under a Bayesian approach it is more transparent to say "a set of values that has 100p% belief units (Bayesian probability)." We must make it clear this is not a verifiable statement about the actual fixed parameter, the hypothesis, nor the experiment. The confidence interval for a single observed experimental result is considered plausible due to its long-run performance over repeated experiments. This coverage probability is a statement about the experiment in relation to the unknown fixed true parameter. If the prior distribution is chosen in such a way that the posterior is dominated by the likelihood, Bayesian belief is more objectively viewed as a type of confidence based on frequency probability of the experiment.
