You can use LINQ to Objects or LINQ to Datasets to run LINQ queries with no database whatsoever. You can't use a bi-dimensional array, but you can use a List<> of objects with properties as a LINQ context. From your question it sounds like your application, like most applications, may need to store the data for later use: that's where a database will come in handy. .NET Datasets have built in support for persistence to an XML file if your data storage requirements are simple enough to use that. .NET also supports persistence for objects, but you may find that using a database is the simplest solution, especially if you require multi-user access and editing.
