iPhone App Google Analytics

I am having issues setting up Google Analytics for my iPhone Application. I have a website that I have sucesfully been using Google Analytics on, and so I am pretty familiar with how it works. I set up a new fake domain with the following formation: myapp.mysite.com. I got the UA ID that was made and used that as shown below. In my iPhone application's "didfinishlaunching" method, I have the following code: [[GANTracker sharedTracker] startTrackerWithAccountID:@"UA-XXXXXXXX-X" dispatchPeriod:kGANDispatchPeriodSec delegate:nil]; NSError *error; if (![[GANTracker sharedTracker] trackEvent:@"test" action:@"my_action" label:@"my_label" value:-1 withError:&error]) { NSLog(@"error ocurred"); } where UA-XXXXXXXX-X is filled in with my ID. I install the application on my phone, run the app for over 20 minutes, and google analytics still states that "tracking is not installed." What is wrong here? Thanks!
