What are the available solutions for embedding chat functionality into website?

We want to implement chat on our website so that users can communicate with each other. Our general requirements are: It should be rendered on our web pages, but it could be rendered in an IFrame or something like that. The users of our website are part of the general public, not internal teams, so we don't want them to have to install a separate app. Users should be able to use their existing account with our website and not have to create a new account for the chat tool. If we partner with someone, like Meebo, we don't want to have to share a significant amount of our user information for partner. Code under an public license, but preferably not an open-source project using the GPL license, but BSD or MIT license (and probably others) is okay. An inexpensive product with a non-public license may be okay as well. We want to get this implemented pretty quickly, and we don't really want to build our own solution. Has anyone worked with or familiar with a solution that would satisfy some or all of these these requirements? Any other ideas/suggestions? Thanks.
