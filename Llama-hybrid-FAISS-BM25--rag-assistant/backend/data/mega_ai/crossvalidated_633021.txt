Association between Sedentary Time and Hypoglycemic Events in a 7-Day Analysis

I am conducting a study aiming to determine whether repetitive sedentary time over 7 consecutive days is associated with hypoglycemic events during the same period. Here are my variables: Independent Variable: Sedentary time (measured over 7 days using accelerometry) Dependent Variable: Hypoglycemic events, daily average blood glucose levels (measured over the same 7 days using continuous glucose monitoring) Covariates: Daily insulin dosage, daily carbohydrate intake I would like to gather opinions or suggestions on the most appropriate statistical approach to analyze these associations. Any advice on specific statistical models or additional considerations I should take into account would be highly appreciated.
