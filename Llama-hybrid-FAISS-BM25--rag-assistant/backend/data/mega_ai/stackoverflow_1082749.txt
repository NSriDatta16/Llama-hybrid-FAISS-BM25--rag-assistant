Couple of online solutions: Amazon SQS . Google appengine queue system I guess the google solution is much cheaper (Could even be free if not using much). I have also been thinking about implementing queue in PHP/MYSQL and thought of using: mysql get_lock to implement some sort of lock. Put the queue in MYSQL memory heap datastorage, because in memory queue is much faster then on disc queue. But you have the risk of losing data when computer crashes. Use named pipes to communicate with processes.
