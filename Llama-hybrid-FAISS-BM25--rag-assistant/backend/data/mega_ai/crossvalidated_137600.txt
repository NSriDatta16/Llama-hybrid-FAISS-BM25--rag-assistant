Do you need a statistical test to group them? If the sizes are as divergent as your 3 example points seem, perhaps just plot them all together to look for two groups. In R, if you like: library(ggplot2) set.seed(1066) eggs Then visually assess where a good cut-point would be, which in that data set would be around 35. If you're set on using an algorithmic threshold however, you could use cut-point analysis, but that comes with several caveats (overfitting, inflation of Type I, etc). They are detailed in this paper . In short, it details a method of finding a dividing line between two (imposed) categories given a continuous covariate. For your case, a logistic regression would be a likely way to do it. However, using cutpoint on this might be like trying to kill a fly with a sledgehammer. I'd plot it and see what it looks like.
