As an alternative to the other methods mentioned, if you're willing to exclude IE6 (it's about that time), you can use DOM storage (i.e. the globalStorage , sessionStorage and localStorage objects) to store your JSON string. These objects are key value stores, so if the browsers you're targeting support this feature (part of the HTML5 specs), then this is probably easier than storing data in arbitrary HTML elements. See here for more info.
