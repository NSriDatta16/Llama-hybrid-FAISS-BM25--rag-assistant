Index page in Magento is way too slow, what can I do?

Weirdly, the index page of my Magento commerce is very slow. While you navigate the products, brands, searches etc is very fast, but every time you click on the banner to go to homepage or enter the website, it take ages to load. I wonder what I can do about this? I don't know where to start, since I am new to Magento. I thought I could go on and read the code, but that would take ages too, since Magento is very complex. Maybe I can analyze it somehow?
