PCA is nothing but a new system of orthogonal coordinates, which happens to be a linear transformation of an old system of coordinates. You take the old coordinates $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ in an original Euclidian system $(e_1,e_2,\dots,e_n)$ and linearly transform it into a new system of coordinates (factors) $(f_1,f_2,\dots,f_n)=Ae$ . The scores are coordinates in new system $(s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n)$ .
