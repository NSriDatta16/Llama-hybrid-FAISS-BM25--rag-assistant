Averaging angles... Again

I want to calculate the average of a set of angles, which represents source bearing (0 to 360 deg) - (similar to wind-direction) I know it has been discussed before (several times). The accepted answer was Compute unit vectors from the angles and take the angle of their average . However this answer defines the average in a non intuitive way. The average of 0, 0 and 90 will be atan( (sin(0)+sin(0)+sin(90)) / (cos(0)+cos(0)+cos(90)) ) = atan(1/2)= 26.56 deg I would expect the average of 0, 0 and 90 to be 30 degrees. So I think it is fair to ask the question again: How would you calculate the average, so such examples will give the intuitive expected answer. Edit 2014: After asking this question, I've posted an article on CodeProject which offers a thorough analysis. The article examines the following reference problems: Given time-of-day [00:00-24:00) for each birth occurred in US in the year 2000 - Calculate the mean birth time-of-day Given a multiset of direction measurements from a stationary transmitter to a stationary receiver, using a measurement technique with a wrapped normal distributed error – Estimate the direction. Given a multiset of azimuth estimates between two points, made by “ordinary” humans (assuming to subject to a wrapped truncated normal distributed error) – Estimate the direction.
