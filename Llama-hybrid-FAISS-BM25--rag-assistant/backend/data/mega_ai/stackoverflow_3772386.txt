ptr = (MyRect*)bytes; "bytes" is the address of the array in memory. ptr gets assigned that address in this code. The cast tells the compiler to ignore the difference in data types. If you understand in detail what the compiler is doing under the covers this can certainly work just fine. The only problem is changing compilers or compiler settings might cause this code to fail. It can be a bit fragile.
