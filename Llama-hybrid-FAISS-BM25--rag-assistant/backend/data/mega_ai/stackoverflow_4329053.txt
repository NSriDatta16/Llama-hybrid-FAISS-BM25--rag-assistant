What is the best practice for sharing objects between threads for a real time game

I want to create a real time game. The game will have a model which will be updated periodically... - (void) timerTicks { [model iterate]; } Like all games, I will revive user input events, touches. In response I will need to update the model.... - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [model updateVariableInModel]; } So there are two threads: From a timer. Frequently iterates the model From the UI thread. Updates the the model based on user input Both threads will be sharing variables in the model. What is the best practice for sharing the objects between the threads and avoiding multi threading issues?
