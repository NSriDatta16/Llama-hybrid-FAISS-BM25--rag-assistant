J2ME, LWUIT (V. 1.2) - Menu bar from bottom to the right of the screen!

I'm working with the mobile graphic framework LWUIT (V. 1.2) to develop an application for Nokia N97. Results are striking and elegant but I have a problem: when I rotate mobile screen, menu bar doesn't switch from bottom to the right of screen. Commands remain on the bottom while correspondent mobile buttons are now on the right... Is there an event that I can intercept when the user open or rotate mobile screen? Or I have to extend some library class to make this behaviour automatic? Or anithing else? Anyone of you can describe a solution? Thanks in advance
