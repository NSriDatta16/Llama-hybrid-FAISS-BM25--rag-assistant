How do I filter a block view by taxonomy argument in URL?

I have some block views in my sidebar that show events marked as a highlight happening in certain cities. Nodes are organized into cities using taxonomy. When I load a node directly I have an URL like www.host.com/events/new-york/name-of-my-nice-event I have some other page views that show teasers for all events in a certain city: www.host.com/events/new-york Also I have some static pages that are valid for all cities, e.g. www.host.com/about-us The sidebar blocks showing the highlights are available throughout the whole website. Now I want to make sure that the blocks in my sidebar only show those nodes for the selected city based on the taxonomy provided in the URL. (except for the static pages as there is no taxonomy in the URL, but those are not that important) So far I tried to pass my view the taxonomy term as an argument using PHP as standard argument: if (arg(1)) { $term = arg(1); return $term; } This works fine on the above mentioned page views (e.g. www.host.com/events/new-york ). But when I load a node directly www.host.com/events/new-york/name-of-my-nice-event my block only shows the empty text. I thought that arguments are indexed like this: events/new-york/name-of-my-nice-event ^0 ^1 ^2 So I don't understand why arg(1) does not return new-york when I am viewing the node detail.
