In a large environment you may want to have parents that define common behaviour for classes of projects (e.g. a servlet parent, a portlet parent, a war parent etc). Because there is no multiple inheritance in Maven, you either have to have a gigantic parent POM with all this content in and some complicated profile conventions, or several parents, one for each type of project. Similar projects are not necessarily built together (in fact usually not). To build your projects for a single release you therefore want an aggregator that defines the relevant modules to be built. There is a section of the Maven book that describes the distinction between aggregation and inheritance. This may help your understanding.
