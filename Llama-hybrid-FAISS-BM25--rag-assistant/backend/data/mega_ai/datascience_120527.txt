Why use tanh (or any other activation function)?

In machine learning, it is common to use activation functions like tanh, sigmoid, or ReLU to introduce non-linearity into a neural network. These non-linearities help the network learn complex relationships between input features and output labels. Can anyone give a specific example that clearly shows an activation function provides benefits?
