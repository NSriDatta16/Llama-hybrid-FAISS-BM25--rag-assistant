What exactly is meant by "constant autocorrelation structure" in the definition of stationarity of a time series?

I have come across the term "constant autocorrelation structure" in every definition of stationarity but I have not been able to find an explanation of this phrase. I know that autocorrelation refers to present values being dependent on past values but can anyone please elaborate on what a "constant" autocorrelation structure looks like? Secondly, can I say that seasonality and trends are all conceptually subsets of autocorrelation? Can there be a situation where there is a trend and seasonality but zero autocorrelation?
