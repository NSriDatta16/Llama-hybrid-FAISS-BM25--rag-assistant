Different powers of coefficient - solvable within GLM?

I have model where coefficient is of different powers: $$\mbox{log} ( \mu_{i} ) = \alpha + \beta x_1 + \beta^2x_2 + \beta^3x_3 + ... + \beta^nx_n \\ \\ N_{i} \sim \mbox{Poiss} ( \mu_{i} ) $$ $N_i$ and $x_i$ is the data, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are model coefficients. Can this problem be somehow transformed so that it can be solved using GLM model? I.e. so that I can use the glm() function in R. If not, how can I solve this problem using some frequentist package in R? I can write model in WinBUGS but prefer to have "frequentist" solution in R, because it is much faster and inference is easier (one has p-values, t-tests, F-tests...). But which function or package use to fit it? If you are interested how this problem was created: actually taking model from this question and adding coefficient $\beta$ for $\mbox{log} ( \mu_{i,j} )$ on the predictor side of the equation. While the transformation of the original model for use in GLM was elegant and without problem , adding $\beta$ coefficient complicated things and leads to the model presented here.
