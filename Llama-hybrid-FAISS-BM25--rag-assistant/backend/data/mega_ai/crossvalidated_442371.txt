Deal with imbalanced data

Building machine learning models to do forecast, sometimes the dataset was used is imbalanced, and there are some methods to deal with this issue such as the resample method and choose other metrics(for example, recall rate) rather than accuracy. So can these two methods be used at the same time? Or just one method would be fine to solve this imbalanced data issue. Are there any pros and cons of each method?
