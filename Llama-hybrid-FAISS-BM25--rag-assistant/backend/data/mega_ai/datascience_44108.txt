Difference between a target and a label in machine learning

If I have a supervised learning system (for example for the MNIST dataset) I have features (pixel values of MNIST data) and labels (correct digit-value). However sometimes people use the word target (instead of label). Are target and label interchangeable? Is label just used for classification? Target both for classification and regression?
