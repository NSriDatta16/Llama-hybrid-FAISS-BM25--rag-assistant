slideme slidelock

I'm trying to add SlideLock to my app for a version that I am putting on SlideMe. I am getting an error at mainActivityInstance for some reason and I don't know why. Any ideas what is wrong? Thanks. public void onCreate(Bundle icicle) { super.onCreate(icicle); setContentView(R.layout.home); com.slideme.slidelock.License myLicense = new com.slideme.slidelock.License("My first license", "4839206850342", mainActivityInstance); // There are other constructors available also. // This one is just the most comfortable. try{ /* * You can store the fetched data in a persistent storage and retrieve * it from there on the next application startup, just in case you * want to save the end-user's networking traffic and reduce startup * delays. We strongly recommend you to refresh the license from * time to time, just in case the end-user claims a refund, or any * other corner case scenario */ myLicense.digest(myLicense.fetch()); } catch(IOException ioe){ // license couldn't initialize. Handle this } Rights someRights = myLicense.getFullRights(); // Works even if you already reserved the SlideLock Key in the past. if(someRights != null){ // you have granted rights. } else { // You don't have any rights for the feature in cause. Try // some features. (Currently not supporting multiple 'features') }
