Is it logical to look for a correlation between average and percentage?

I have a simple question. Can one look for correlations between percentage and average ? For example, percentage of unemployment and average salary. Or shoul I use total numbers instead ? If I look for a relation between percentages and average I get significant correlation, but between totals data is not significant.
