AIPMM and PMI , two professional organizations in these fields, have both defined unique knowledge areas (KA) associated with their professions that can answer this question. Both product and program managers must master their unique KAs and manage the activities and deliverables associated with them in order to successfully complete their products or programs. PMI has defined 9 unique project management KAs required to manage projects and programs. They are: Integration, Scope, Time, Cost, Quality, Resources, Communication, Risk and Procurement. Programs are collections of related projects but still require mastery of the 9 unique project management KAs. AIPMM has defined 6 unique product management KAs as part of a universal, cross-industry Product Management Framework (PMF) required to manage products. They are: Customer, Strategy, Product, Market, Business, and Program. The Program KA involves the management those cross-functional projects required to bring products to market. (and very often the Program Manager is a member of the cross functional product management core team). Hopefully this explanation has introduced some clarity and consistency into the discussion. For more information on the AIPMM unique KAs and the PMF, go to the www.AIPMM.com web site and download the APMF whitepaper.
