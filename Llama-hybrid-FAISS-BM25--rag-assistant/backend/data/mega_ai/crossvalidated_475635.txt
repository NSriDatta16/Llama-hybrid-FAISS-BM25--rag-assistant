In my opinion, yes you can use the variables that are most significant in constructing the respective factor scores, especially if you data is data-centered (minus the respective mean). The most obvious advantage is, unlike factor analysis produced constructs, your explanatory variable is readily understandable. However, the standard regression derived beta coefficient may not be intuitively explainable (as in wrong sign,...). There is also a question do you actually get a better model specification as you may be missing variables that are, at least partially captured, in say a Factor Analysis approach. The main issue in PCA/Factor Analysis is that do the factor constructs may any sense? However, a potential advantage of a factor analysis relates to a possible conceptual discovery of driving factors themselves. This may suggest other variables to improve the modeling process. Also, the impact of missing important variables may be mitigated in a factor analysis as witness in a better fit.
