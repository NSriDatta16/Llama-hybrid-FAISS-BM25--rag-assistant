sub create_glob_var { my ($glob_var_str) = @_; no strict 'refs'; $$glob_var_str = undef; # or whatever you want to set it to } The no strict 'refs' is only necessary if use strict is in effect, which it always should be. Addendum: If you're asking if there's a way to write a subroutine create_glob_var such that the following code will succeed: use strict; create_glob_var("bar"); $bar = "whatever"; ...then the answer is "No." However, Perl's vars pragma will do what you want: use strict; use vars qw($bar); $bar = "whatever"; But this is kind of old-style Perl coding. Nowadays, one would typically do this: use strict; our $bar = "blah"; our can also just declare global variables that can be freely used later: our ($foo, @bar, %baz); # ... $foo = 5; @bar = (1, 2, 3); %baz = (this => 'that');
