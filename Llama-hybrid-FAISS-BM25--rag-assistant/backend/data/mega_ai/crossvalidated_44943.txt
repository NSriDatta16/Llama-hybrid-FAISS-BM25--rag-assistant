The original suggestion for displaying an interaction via box-plot does not quite make sense in this instance, since both of your variables that define the interaction are continuous. You could dichotomize either G or P , but you do not have much data to work with. Because of this, I would suggest coplots (a description of what they are can be found in; Cleveland, William. 1994. Coplots, nonparametric regression, and conditionally parametric fits . IMS Lecture Notes Monograph Series 24: 21-36. PDF available in link from Project Euclid. Below is a coplot of the election2012 data generated by the code coplot(VP ~ P | G, data = election2012) . So this is assessing the effect of P on VP conditional on varying values of G . Although your description makes it sound like this is a fishing expedition, we may entertain the possibility that an interaction between these two variables exist. The coplot seems to show that for lower values of G the effect of P is positive, and for higher values of G the effect of P is negative. After assessing marginal histograms and bivariate scatterplots of VP, P, G and the interaction between P and G , it seemed to me that 1932 was likely a high leverage value for the interaction effect. Below are four scatterplots, showing the marginal relationships between VP and the mean centered V , G and the interaction of V and G (what I named int_gpcent ). I have highlighted 1932 as a red dot. The last plot on the lower right is the residuals of the linear model lm(VP ~ g_cent + p_cent, data = election2012) against int_gpcent . Below I provide code that shows when removing 1932 from the linear model lm(VP ~ g_cent + p_cent + int_gpcent, data = election2012) the interaction of G and P fail to reach statistical significance. Of course this is all just exploratory (one would also want to assess if any temporal correlation occurs in the series, but hopefully this is a good start. Save ggplot for when you have a better idea of what you exactly want to plot! #data and directory stuff mydir $g_cent G - mean(election2012 $G) election2012$ p_cent $P - mean(election2012$ P) election2012 $int_gpcent g_cent * election2012$p_cent summary(election2012) View(election2012) par(mfrow= c(2, 2)) hist(election2012 $VP) hist(election2012$ G) hist(election2012 $P) hist(election2012$ int_gpcent) #scatterplot & correlation matrix cor(election2012[c("VP", "g_cent", "p_cent", "int_gpcent")]) pairs(election2012[c("VP", "g_cent", "p_cent", "int_gpcent")]) #lets just check out a coplot for interactions #coplot(VP ~ G | P, data = election2012) coplot(VP ~ P | G, data = election2012) #example of coplot - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5857726/how-to-delete-the-given-in-a-coplot-using-r #onto models model1 $color color[14]
