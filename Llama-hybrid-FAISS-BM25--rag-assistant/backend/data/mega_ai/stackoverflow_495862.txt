CRAN shows a package that is actively updated called "chron" that handles dates. You might want to check that and some of the other modules found here: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html xts and zoo handle irregular time series data on top of that. I'm not familiar with these packages, but a quick look over indicates you should be able to use them fairly easily by splitting on the hyphen and loading into the structures they provide.
