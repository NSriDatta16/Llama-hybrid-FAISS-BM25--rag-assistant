Obtaining the probability of exceedance corresponding a given return period

I have a time series of data (15 years). Following plots show the fitted PDF (generalized extreme value distribution) and corresponding CDF (i.e. 1 minus CDF). The data used here is not the total data, but for a single month only. Sampling rate is 1 per hour, but some data is corrupt. Thus, I have less than 8766 datapoints per year. My question is: How can I determine the value corresponding to a return period of $x$ years from the CDF? Or: What is the probability of exceedance for a given return period? Edit: Is the following correct for my case? $\text{Probability of exceedance} = ({\text{Return period} \cdot \frac{8766 \, \text{hours}/\text{year} }{12\, \text{month}/ \text{year}}})^{-1}$
