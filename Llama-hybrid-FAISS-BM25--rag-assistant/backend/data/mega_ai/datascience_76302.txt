It looks like there are very few loan defaults in your dataset, so xgboost is learning to predict 0 for all inputs regardless of the hyperparameters you choose. Try sampling from your data so that the classes are more balanced (e.g. >10% of your data points are defaults) and see what happens. Other options for dealing with highly imbalanced classes can be found here: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/imbalanced-data-classification/
