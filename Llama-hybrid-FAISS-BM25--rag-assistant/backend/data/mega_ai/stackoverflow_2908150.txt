A strictly informational but impractical answer: Though there's almost certainly a more elegant way of going about this depending on the exact details of what you're trying to do, if you absolutely must have dup2() , its Perl equivalent is present in the POSIX module. However, in this case you're dealing with actual file descriptors and not Perl filehandles, and correspondingly you're restricted to using the other provided functions in the POSIX module, all of which are analogous to what you would be using in C. To some extent, you would be writing C in very un-Perlish Perl. http://perldoc.perl.org/POSIX.html
