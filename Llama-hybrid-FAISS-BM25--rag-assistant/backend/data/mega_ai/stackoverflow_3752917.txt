google analytics creates broken links for IE8

We have been successfully running a Django site for a couple of years. We use the following (standard) google analytics code for most of our pages. var _gaq = _gaq || []; _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-XXXXXXX-X']); _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']); (function() { var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl' : 'http://www') + '.google-analytics.com/ga.js'; var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s); })(); In Django the settings are such that we get an email every time there is a broken link. Recently, one of our users has been generating a lot of broken links that are related to google analytics. The error messages look similar to this (where apage is any url): Referrer: http://ourwebsite.com/apage/ Requested URL: /apage/.google-analytics.com/ga.js User agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322) IP address: 127.0.0.1 Based on the error message, I suspect the problem is related to IE8 and some security settings or modes. I have tried running the Utilu IE Collection version of IE8 to reproduce the problem, but had no luck. Any help would be appreciated.
