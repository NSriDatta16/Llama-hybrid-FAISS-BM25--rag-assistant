What type of data structure should I use for mimicking a file-system?

The title might be worded strange, but it's probably because I don't even know if I'm asking the right question. So essentially what I'm trying to build is a "breadcrumbish" categoricalization type system (like a file directory) where each node has a parent (except for root) and each node can contain either data or another node. This will be used for organizing email addresses in a database. I have a system right now where you can create a "group" and add email addresses to that group, but it would be very nice to add an organizational system to it. This (in my head) is in a tree format, but I don't know what tree. The issue I'm having is building it using MySQL. It's easy to traverse trees that are in memory, but on database, it's a bit trickier. Image of tree: http://j.imagehost.org/0917/asdf.png SELECT * FROM Businesses: Tim's Hardware Store, 7-11, Kwik-E-Mart, Cub Foods, Bob's Grocery Store, CONGLOM-O SELECT * FROM Grocery Stores: Cub Foods, Bob's Grocery Store, CONGLOM-O SELECT * FROM Big Grocery Stores: CONGLOM-O SELECT * FROM Churches: St. Peter's Church, St. John's Church I think this should be enough information so I can accurately describe what my goal is.
