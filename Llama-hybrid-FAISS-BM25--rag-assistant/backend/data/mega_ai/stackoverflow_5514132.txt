Ok I found the problem. $delimiter value comes from a having 3 values "," ";" and "\t" which browsers display "\t" as spaces in and I didn't pay attention to it. Seems firefox is doing something to \t so PHP doesn't understand that it's tab. But other browsers sends \t as expected. If I hardcode "\t" like fgetcsv($handle, 1000, "\t", '"') works fine also with firefox.
