It is difficult to give the right answer without looking at the data. Here are some points that may help you in your modelling. The coefficient of MA(1) very close to 1 indicates the sign of overdifferencing. This means unit root in Moving averages. My suggestion would be: Check the original series is stationary (visually) or check the presence of unit root. If you observe deterministic trend (eg: linear), add the trend part with time series model. If the original series is stationary build the time series without differencing.
