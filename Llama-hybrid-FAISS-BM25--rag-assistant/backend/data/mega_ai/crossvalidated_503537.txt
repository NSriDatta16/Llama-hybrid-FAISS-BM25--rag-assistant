Components of Poisson Distribution mean

Suppose that we have a game between Team A and Team B. Team A has a 75% probability of winning and Team B has a 25% probability of winning. Draw cannot occur. I also know, that there is calculated average of points scored in this game and it is 3.5. This average consists of average of points scored by Team A and average of points scored by Team B. How can I calculate those averages per team?
