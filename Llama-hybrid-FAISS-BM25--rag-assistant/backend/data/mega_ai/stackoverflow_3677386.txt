you are missing the erb tag: $("#posts").prepend(" 'posts')%>"); It appears that you are trying to render the full set of posts again, and I assume that you really want to render a single post. This would result in duplicate posts showing up. No @posts variable was set in your create method resulting in that nil error. You should create another partial called _post and render a single post within there. Notice that the create method sets @post, but not @posts. That is where your error is coming from, because @posts is nil. The error is a bit misleading b/c you are using: for post in @posts I would recommend using the following syntax that is more widely using in Ruby (which has the same effect as "for"): @posts.each do |post| I think this railscast may help you. Based on what you are showing here, I think Ryan is doing almost the exact same thing, but using a polling method instead of submitting a form. Pay special attention to the part where he creates _comment.html.erb to render a single comment. http://railscasts.com/episodes/229-polling-for-changes
