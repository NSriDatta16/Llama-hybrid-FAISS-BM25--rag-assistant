Intraspecific variation in MCMCglmm

I want to use MCMCglmm to account for phylogenetic autocorrelation on my GLMM. However I have more than one trait measurement for certain species. Is there a way to account for intraspecific variation using MCMCglmm such as it can be done in geiger's fitContinuous including a vector of standard errors in SE ?
