I've created a project based on your code and I've managed to recreate the issue. When I initially run it and click on the Add control A button the Main control will load Control A and note this in the viewstate. Control A's button to add Control X will now appear with an id of Main1_ctl00_Button1 . When clicking on this button Main's page load will add Control A back to it's placeholder and Control A's button click event will fire. If you now click Main's Control A button again the problem arises. Main's page load method will look at the Viewstate and add control A to the placeholder. Then Main's button click event will then fire clearing the placeholder and re-adding control A. When the form is displayed Control A's button to add Control X will now have an id of Main1_ctl01_Button1 as it was the second control to be generated in the code behind. Now when you click on the button to add control x Main's page load will add Control A again but as it's id will be Main1_ctl00_Button1 and the click event came from a button with an id of Main1_ctl01_Button1 the event will not fire. To fix this you will have to avoid the duplication of control creation the second time around. You could do this by checking the requests form collection during the page load to see which button was pressed although this is not a very elegant solution. You will need to ensure that the buttons on the Main control have a unique text value for this to work. Hopefully someone else may be able to come up with a more elegant solution: Dim mainButtonClick = False For index As Integer = 0 To Request.Form.Count If Request.Form(index) = "Button A" Or Request.Form(index) = "Button B" Then mainButtonClick = True End If Next If Not IsPostBack And Not mainButtonClick And ViewState("name") <> String.Empty Then AddControl(ViewState("name").ToString()) End If Please excuse any errors in this code as I am not a VB.NET programmer.
