We are not currently using the Archive storage engine, but have done some research on it. One requirement of our application is that it stores lots of historical information for long periods of time. That data is never updated, but needs to be selected occasionally. So ... with that in mind: PROs Very small footprint. Uses zlib for data compression. More efficient/quicker backups due to small data file size. CONs Does not allow column indexes. Selects require a full table scan. Does not support spatial data. -- It is likely that we will not use this storage engine due to the indexing limitations.
