Is it possible to control the destination folder when checking out a project from VSS 2005?

We are currently using VSS 2005 for source control - and please let me start by saying, I've read a lot of posts on Stackoverflow and I realize VSS is the devil. That being said... its what we have to work with now and I have a question about the checkout process. We have the code organized in a certain hierarchy on the vss server, but when we do a checkout we don't need that same hierarchy on our machines. Is there a way to control how visual studio 2008 and vss 2005 create the checkout destination folder so that I don't end up with the code being 9 folders deep on MY machine?
