when placing your data for storage, and not using prepared queries, you need to escape your data exactly once as denoted above. When using prepared queries for the string literal portion of the query, you should not escape your data and doing so will result in your issue. $db = new mysqli('localhost', 'my_user', 'my_password', 'world'); $sql = 'INSERT INTO `blah` (field1,field2) VALUES (?,?)'; $query = $db->prepare($sql); $query->bind_parms('ss',$no_escaping,$needed_here); $query->execute(); EDIT: Are you using prepared queries? If you are, I've cobbled together a class for this here. .
