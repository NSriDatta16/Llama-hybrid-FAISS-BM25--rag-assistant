About the question if case 1 is a vulnerability, of course it is. Why? Because its a flaw or weakness in your system's design, implementation, or operation that could get exploited to violate the system's security policy, which is the exact definition of vulnerability. To solve it, what I usually do is ro record the user agent sent by the succesful login. I encript it and then everytime a user wants anything from the server I check if the current user agent matches the one sent at login. You could combine this with the IP address and check if these two parameters change betwen requests, if they do then its very probable someone hijacked the cookie. if ( ($_SESSION['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] != md5($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) ) die( "{ 'succes': false , 'text' : 'Please re-log in.' );
