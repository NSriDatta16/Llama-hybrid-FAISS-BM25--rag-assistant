How do I fix the CRT dependency causing a FileLoadException with my vc2005 mixed-mode DLL on XP?

I have a mixed-mode DLL built in visual studio 2005. In dependency walker, my DLL is showing a dependency of the following CRT Dlls. Note this is on my Windows 7 developement machine. c:\windows\winsxs\x86_microsoft.vc80.crt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_8.0.50727.4927_none_d08a205e442db5b5\MSVCP80.DLL "\MSVCR80.DLL "\MSVCM80.DLL 8.0.50727.4927 On my Windows 7 dev machine using Visual Studio 2005 this compiles and runs just fine. the problem is it wont run on my Windows XP test machine with the latest CRT installed. When I drag the DLL into depenency walker on the XP machine it seems to be searching for the DLLs in \System32... (I went to show full path and there was no paths for them, just a yellow exclamation mark) The problem is that this version (build 4927) of the crt in WinSxS is not installed on the XP test machine. it has Visual Studio 2005 with the latest CRT installed (sp1?). 8.0.50727.4053 is the latest version I could find on MSDN. I realize this is not the most exciting question posted on SO, but does anyone know what is up with this 4927 runtime? * EDIT * The manifest generated by MT.exe: So, there is 3 different versions it is targeting...
