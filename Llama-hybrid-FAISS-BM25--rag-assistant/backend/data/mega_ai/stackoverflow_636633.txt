I am a great fan of Qt but I have not had an opportunity yet to use a QTextEdit. I would like to help though so I took a look through the documentation. If you are using a sufficiently recent version of Qt you should find that a QTextEdit has an associated QTextDocument and it would seem that the functionality you seek may be there. A QTextDocument is a hierarchy of frames and blocks. A block is equivalent to a paragraph as you mention above. The documentation seems to indicate that you could specify that your blocks be wrapped in a frame. Then, you should be able to set a format for the frame using QTextFrame::setFrameFormat. This format will allow you to specify a page break policy using some flags. The flags that are specified are PageBreak_Auto, PageBreak_AlwaysBefore and PageBreak_AlwaysAfter. It would seem to me that if you set both the PageBreak_AlwaysBefore and PageBreak_AlwaysAfter flags for the frame, then your blocks should stay together. I realize this is a fairly complex series. I hope that it helps and would really like to hear if it works.
