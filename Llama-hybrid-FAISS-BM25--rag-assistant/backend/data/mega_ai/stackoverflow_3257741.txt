CSS List Spacing After Paragraph

If I have user-generated content, such as: my paragraph item1 item2 This outputs with a paragraph gap between the end of the paragraph and the list like so: My paragraph: item1 item2 I know I can get rid of the gap in my CSS by setting margin-top on the UL tag and margin-bottom on the p tag, but is there a way to do it without affecting the margins between actual paragraphs? The content is user-generated with a limited set of tags available and no fonts, sizes... available so all formatting should be done in CSS, if possible without having to put classes in the tags. I know, because of the way margin collapsing works in CSS, I could usually set p { margin-bottom:0; } li { margin-top:0; } The separation would be correct in both cases as the margin-top property on the p tag would still be 1, but I already set margin-top to 0.2em for a smaller gap between h2 and p tags.
