How do I interpret this PCA plot?

I have to equally scaled variables that I want to combine into one PCA component measuring standards of living: slvpen: Standard of living of pensioners: 0 = Extremely bad, 10 = Extremely good. slvuemp: Standard of living of unemployed: 0 = Extremely bad, 10 = Extremely good. Using R and the psych package, I have performed the PCA analysis: Now, I want to visualise it using the factoextra package and get the following plot: I have a hard time interpreting this plot. What does the axes really show? Is Dim1 equal to PC1? How do I interpret from the lengths of the arrows and the angle between them? Lastly, can I say something about whether PC1 actually measures the latent concept in a good way using the plot?
