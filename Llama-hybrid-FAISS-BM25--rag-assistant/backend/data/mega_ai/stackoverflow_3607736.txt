R Programming Language R is a free, open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing , bioinformatics , information graphics , and general computing. It is a multi-paradigm language and dynamically typed. R is an implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical scoping semantics inspired by Scheme . R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman and is now developed by the R Development Core Team . The R environment is easily extended through a packaging system on CRAN , the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Scope of questions This tag should be used for programming-related questions about R. Including a minimal reproducible example in your question will increase your chances of getting a timely, useful answer. Questions should not use the rstudio tag unless they relate specifically to the RStudio interface and not just the R language. If your question is more focused on statistics or data science, use Cross Validated or Data Science , respectively. Bioinformatics-specific questions may be better received on Bioconductor Support or Biostars . General questions about R (such as requests for off-site resources or discussion questions) are unsuitable for Stack Overflow and may be appropriate for one of the general, or special-interest, R mailing lists . Please do not cross-post across multiple venues . Do research (read tag wikis, look at existing questions, or search online) to determine the most appropriate venue so that you have a better chance of receiving solutions to your question. Your question may be automatically migrated to a more appropriate Stack Exchange site. If you receive no response to your questions after a few days, or if your question is put on hold for being off-topic, it is then OK to post to another venue, giving a link to your Stack Overflow question - but don't cross-post just because your question is down-voted or put on hold for being unclear. Instead, work on improving your question . Stack Overflow resources How to make a great R reproducible example What is the most useful R trick?

Here is a list of tags that mistagged R questions might be re-tagged to r.java-file for questions related to the file R.java on android r.js "A command line tool for running JavaScript scripts that use the Asynchronous Module Definition API (AMD) for declaring and using JavaScript modules and regular JavaScript script files. It is part of the RequireJS project, and works with the RequireJS implementation of AMD." (from the r.js wiki summary) rstudio for questions related to RStudio use the rstudio tag. Don't use this tag just because you are working with RStudio.
