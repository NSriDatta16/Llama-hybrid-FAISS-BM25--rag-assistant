Clarifying the applications of Bayesian networks

I have been looking at Bayesian networks, using the book by Koller, Probabilistic Graphical Models . The book is very large, so I might have missed the answer to my question ;). But I was trying to understand what the applications or outputs of a Bayesian network are. I understand that we can factor the joint probability of some system of measurements and outcomes into a more limited set of conditional probabilities. And I understand how different flows of influence arise as we observe certain variables in the network versus other unknown quantities in the network. What I am not clear about, is what the network is actually giving as output. It seems like the basic idea is to provide some classification of a particular state given the data. Take the simplest case where we see that the grass is wet and we want to know whether it rained or whether the sprinklers were used earlier. In this case, the network just indicates the probability of each possible state--given a list of states. But beyond this, what else do Bayesian networks do? Do they provide predictions such as the value of some output variable given some data. I keep hearing about object tracking applications of Bayesian networks, but I wanted to understand what is actually provided. So there are noisy sensors that give an indication of some object's location. Now using a Bayesian network, does the network tell you the adjusted location of the object--similar to a Kalman filter might do. I mean does it tell you the adjusted coordinates, or does it simply tell you the probability of being in some discrete range of states? I guess I am just trying to understand the forest for the tree, when it comes to Bayesian networks. Any help is appreciated.
