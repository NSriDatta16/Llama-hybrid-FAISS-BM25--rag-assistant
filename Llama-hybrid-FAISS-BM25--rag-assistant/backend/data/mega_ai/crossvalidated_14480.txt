How to plot a learning curve based on a sequence of date stamped successes and failures?

I have data on results of surgical operations: date of operation (in YYYY-MM-DD format) result of operation (0 for successful operation, 1 for unsuccessful operation) Date is usually used only for case ordering. I need to plot a learning curve. (I had found that the resulting curve called cumulative average .) x should be the number of cases y - probability of failure (usually decreases). get the data on current performance quality The question is: What is the way to achieve this in R (with ggplot2 if possible)? Is $\dfrac{successful}{total}*100\%$ will be sufficient statistic for this case or something more advanced is usually required?
