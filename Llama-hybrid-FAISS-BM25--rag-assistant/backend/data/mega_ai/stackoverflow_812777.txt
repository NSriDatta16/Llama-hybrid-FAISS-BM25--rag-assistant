Normally while using Sessions we also need to be aware of -: Session Hijacking , Session Fixation I suggest in your code after user logged in store the username in session variable also store one more unique value such as USER AGENT in a session variable. so that every page the user visit we can check for whether the same USER AGENT and SESSION ID exist this would make it much secure. To make it much more secure do the encryption like MD% on User AGENT so that hackers cant reproduce it.
