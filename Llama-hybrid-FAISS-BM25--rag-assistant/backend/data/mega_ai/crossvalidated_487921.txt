Logistic regression coefficient interpretation

There is one binary dependent variable (Winner/Loser) and there are three independent variables which are also categorical in nature: Age (Below 31, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61 and above while retaining 61 and above as a reference category), Gender (Male, Female while retaining Female as the reference category), and Education (Literate, Below matric, Matric, Graduate, Postgraduate, Above postgraduate while retaining Above postgraduate as the reference category). While interpreting the odds-ratio results against the reference category , it becomes difficult to understand the individual contribution of the variables involved in the equation. Please advise what should I do for this problem. Kind regards, Stuti
