Is urlencode() good enough to stop all SQL injection attacks in the year 2011

I'm passing some simple user data into a mysql database. PHP's urlencode() Returns a string in which all non-alphanumeric characters except -_. have been replaced with a percent (%) sign followed by two hex digits. I'm not worried about the spaces turning into plus's, or other formatting issues. Neither am I worried about XSS and other HTML hacks. I believe I should be safe from ' and ) style attacks. QUESTION: Are there other kinds of sql attacks that could be used with - or _ or . ? EXAMPLE: mysql_query("UPDATE cars SET color = '".urlencode($c)."' WHERE garage = 29"); Thankyou in advance
