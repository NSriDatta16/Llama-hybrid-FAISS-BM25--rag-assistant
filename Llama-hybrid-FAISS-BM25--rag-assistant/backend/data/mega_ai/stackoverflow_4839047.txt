Dragging an object in as3

I have an object that i want to drag in as3 but because its an object and not a movieClip or Sprite i cant drag it. Does anyone know why this is and how i can solve it? I tried to cast it as a Sprite but it doesnt work. var order:Sprite = e.currentTarget as Sprite; order.startDrag(); So e.currentTarget gives me [object Order] and i cast it as a Sprite. Anyone help how i could solve it?
