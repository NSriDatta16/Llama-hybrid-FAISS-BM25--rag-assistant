Error CS0051 (Inconsistent accessibility: parameter type 'Job' is less accessible than method 'AddJobs.TotalPay(Job)')

I compiled and ran the source code below successfully by omitting the totalFee field. How do I write totalFee into this program so that it will accurately calculate the total fee for each job (rate * time)? Below, you'll see I tried using a method; which generated the error CS0051 (Inconsistent accessibility: parameter type 'Job' is less accessible than method 'AddJobs.TotalPay(Job)'). This source code is in response to the following assignment: "Design a Job class for Harold’s Home Services. The class contains four data fields—Job description (for example, “wash windows”), time in hours to complete the Job (for example, 3.5), per-hour rate charged for the Job (for example, $25.00), and total fee for the Job (hourly rate times hours). Include properties to get and set each field except the total fee—that field will be read-only, and its value is calculated each time either the hourly fee or the number of hours is set. Overload the + operator so that two Jobs can be added. The sum of two Jobs is a new Job containing the descriptions of both original Jobs ( joined by “and”), the sum of the time in hours for the original Jobs, and the average of the hourly rate for the original Jobs. Write a Main()function that demonstrates all the methods work correctly. Save the file as DemoJobs.cs." Microsoft® Visual C#® 2008, An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, 3e, Joyce Farrell Here is the source code: using System; public class AddJobs { private double totalFee; public AddJobs(double totalFee) { TotalFee = totalFee; } public static void Main() { Job job1 = new Job("washing windows", 5.00, 25.00); Job job2 = new Job("walking a dog", 3.00, 11.00); Job job3; job3 = job1 + job2; Console.WriteLine("The first job's description: {0} \nTotal time needed to complete the job: {1} hours \nHourly fee: {2} per hour", job1.Description, job1.Time, job1.Rate.ToString("C")); TotalPay(job1); Console.WriteLine("The second job's description: {0} \nTotal time needed to complete the job: {1} hours \nHourly fee: {2} per hour", job2.Description, job2.Time, job2.Rate.ToString("C")); TotalPay(job2); Console.WriteLine("The third job's description: {0} \nTotal time needed to complete the job: {1} hours \nHourly fee: {2} per hour", job3.Description, job3.Time, job3.Rate.ToString("C")); TotalPay(job3); } public static void TotalPay(Job method) { double totalFee = Job.rate * Job.time; Console.WriteLine("The total fee is: {0}", TotalFee.ToString("C")); } } class Job { public Job(string description, double time, double rate) { Description = description; Time = time; Rate = rate; } public static Job operator+(Job first, Job second) { string newDescription = first.Description + " and " + second.Description; double newTime = first.Time + second.Time; double newRate = (first.Rate + second.Rate) / 2; double newTotalFee = newRate * newTime; return(new Job(newDescription, newTime, newRate)); } public string Description {get; set;} public double Time {get; set;} public double Rate {get; set;} }
