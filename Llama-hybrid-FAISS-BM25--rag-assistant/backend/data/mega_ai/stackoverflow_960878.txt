I take the liberty to assume that you're using the container for status messages, and then creating error/success messages on the fly to go inside the container div. If so, I'd suggest going with the following approach instead: Html: Javascript: function showError(msg) { $('#status').html(msg).addClass('error'); } function showStatus(msg) { $('#status').html(msg).removeClass('error'); } Note the following: As Paolo mentions in his comment, it is much more effective to reference the by an id - that goes directly on the javascript document.getElementById() method, which is way faster than going over the entire DOM tree in search for one element... As you were clearing the contents of the for each call, I saw no reason to keep it. You could just as well just manipulate the html contents and the css classes of a single div. Faster, and looks nicer in your markup =) You obviously don't need your show status/error message logic in separate methods - I only did so for clarity.
