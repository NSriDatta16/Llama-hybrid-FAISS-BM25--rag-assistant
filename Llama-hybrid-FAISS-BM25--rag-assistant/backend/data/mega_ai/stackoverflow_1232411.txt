Dependent Drop Downs in ASP.NET

I must be having brainfade but I can't get two dependent drop-downs to work. In the Page load event I am setting the values in my first dropdown if this is not a postback. In the selectedindexchanged event of this drop down I am clearing a second drop-down and adding items based upon the value in the first drop-down. The items are added manually with no use of data-binding. If I step through the code I can see that the second drop-down is cleared and items are added to it correclty. However, they don't appear in the web page - the second drop-down remains empty. Help UPDATE Thanks for all the suggestions. I found the problem. The page used an Infragistics asynch panel for ajax postbacks. This was causing the issue.
