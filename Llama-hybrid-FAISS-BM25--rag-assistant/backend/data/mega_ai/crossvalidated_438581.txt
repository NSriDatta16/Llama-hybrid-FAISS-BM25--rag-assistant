How to determine the general boundary in candidate elimination algorithm?

I am learning the Candidate-Elimination algorithm by reading Tom M. Mitchell. Machine Learning (free) TABLE 2.1 in that book gives this set of training examples based on this dataset figure 2.3 in that book gives the general boundary G and the specific boundary S. I understood the whole thing except the general boundary part. why the general boundary is represented as $G_3=\{ , \}$ rather than $G_3=\{ , , \}$ ? Note: this question is different to this post , which is discussing $G_3$ rather than G.
