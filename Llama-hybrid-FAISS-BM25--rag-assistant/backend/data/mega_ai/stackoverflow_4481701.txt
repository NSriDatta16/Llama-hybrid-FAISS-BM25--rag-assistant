Running a bookmarklet on an iFrame that is coming from a different domain

Is there any way to run a bookmarklet on an iFrame which is from a different domain? For example, I have a page loaded from http://example.com , which has an iFrame whose source is set to http://example2.com . When I run the bookmarklet, it is always run on http://example.com , since that is the main page. I want to run it on the other iFrame though. When I attempt to interact with the iFrame (e.g. by changing its source attribute to javascript:alert('test') ), Chrome shows the following error: Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL http://example.com from frame with URL http://example2.com . Domains, protocols and ports must match. I tried dragging and dropping the bookmarklet into the frame, but it says: Failed to load resource Is there any way for me to interact with an iFrame using a bookmarklet in Chrome?
