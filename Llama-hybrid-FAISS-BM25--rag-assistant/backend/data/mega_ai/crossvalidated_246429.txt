I cannot comment, therefore I am putting my thoughts as an answer. I remember Andrew Ng said in this course that he learnt, over the time, not to trust his own gut when it comes to data analysis/machine learning. I would say that I would definitely trust Professor Andrew in this context. My personal experience (which is not very substantial) showed there are people who have a "gut" feeling about the data, mostly developed by working on same dataset (these data changes over time e.g. number of pageviews for a website) over a long period of time. However, even they are not right in many (and I repeat, MANY) cases. In research, I don't think anyone works for years over same dataset and therefore, going with gut feeling is very unreasonable in my mind. In addition, he is not even doing any scatter plot (disclaimer: I inferred that from your description) and therefore, judging importance of a feature subjectively is defnitely not logical. As for the last part of the question, I am quite confident that if the predictors are not strongly correlated, adding one additional predictor would NOT signficantly change the statistical significance. It may slightly change the coefficient, but not by a large margin. You can see page 122 of this book by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman where the authors showed a nonsignficant effect can be caused by correlated features (which mean, in the presence of other features, one feature which is important by itself can be dropped).
