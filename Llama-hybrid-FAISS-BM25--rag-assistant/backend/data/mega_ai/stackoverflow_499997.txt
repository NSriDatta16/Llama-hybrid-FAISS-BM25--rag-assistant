Is Request.IsAjaxRequest() broken in the MVC RC1 refresh?

This MVC stuff is fun but every step along the way theres another little hurdle. I'm just using Request.IsAjaxRequest for the first time today in conjunction with Microsoft's AJAX library. I am NOT yet using jQuery (I had to mention that since I just hyperlinked to a question about jQuery!). Unfortunately I installed RC1 refresh BEFORE I tested this code. I am using Ajax.BeginForm . When my controller action executes these are my headers : Connection Pragma, Content-Length, Content-Type, Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Host, Referer, User-Agent, UA-CPU In addition the FORM contains this Param Request["__MVCASYNCPOST"] = "true" And the end effect is that this returns false! Request.IsAjaxRequest() I get the issue with Chrome and Internet Explorer. Please tell me if I'm doin something silly - or if something just broke. Final thought: Hmm - perhaps I need a new futures DLL. I'll update if that turns out to be the issue
