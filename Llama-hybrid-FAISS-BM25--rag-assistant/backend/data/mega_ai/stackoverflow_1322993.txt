http://www.fabforce.net/dbdesigner4/ DBDesigner 4 - Features DBDesigner 4 provides powerful features to create a visual model of any database. Starting from a reverse engineering engine to automatically retrieve a model from existing databases, extensive modeling tools and editors to a syncronisation function which will apply model changes automatically to the underlying database - it is all part of DBDesigner 4. Design Mode vs. Query Mode DBDesigner 4 supports two switchable userinterfaces. The Design Mode is used to create and maintain the visual databases model. The Query Mode is used to work with table data and build complex SQL query statements for the use in PHP, Kylix or another programming language. Plugins and Open Source The models created in DBDesigner 4 are stored in XML. They can be modified by third party plugins which are direcly launched from within DBDesigner 4 and other third party products. Because DBDesigner 4 is an Open Source project it is easy for programmes to develop new plugins or expand DBDesigner 4 to adapt specific needs.
