WebSphere MQ FTE Agent Directory does not exist?

When I tried to start an FTE agent in the command prompt , it displays the error message as "An internal error has occurred. Unable to complete the command because the agent directory does not exist". What would be the reason for this? It was working fine until yesterday. And is there any way to start an agent in MQ FTE itself? I use fteStartAgent in command prompt each time to start an agent. Kindly advise me on this....
