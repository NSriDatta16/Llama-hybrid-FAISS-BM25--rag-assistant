Multiple regression: Strength measure changes by student but is constant over time

Disclaimer: This is the first time I use this forum, so please let me know if my question is not clear or if you need more information. I have data which looks like this: I want to run the regression: lm(formula = SCORE ~ STRENGTH, data = mydata) , in order to find out if higher STRENGTH of the student (NAME) leads to a higher test score. Note that the STRENGTH score changes by student but is constant over time. I was wondering if this regression setup is valid, or if the fact that I have no time variation is a problem in a time series regression? Would this allow me to test whether or not higher strength explains higher test scores? Thank you very much for your help and suggestions. Glenn
