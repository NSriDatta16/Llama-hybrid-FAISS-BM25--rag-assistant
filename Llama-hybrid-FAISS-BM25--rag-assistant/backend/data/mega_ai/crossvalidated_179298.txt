Does the intercept in a logistic regression capture the unobserved effects?

Theoretically, does the intercept term in a logistic regression model capture all unobserved effects? In other words, in a logistic regression model with a perfect fit (i.e. all relevant variables are included), the intercept term should be zero right?
