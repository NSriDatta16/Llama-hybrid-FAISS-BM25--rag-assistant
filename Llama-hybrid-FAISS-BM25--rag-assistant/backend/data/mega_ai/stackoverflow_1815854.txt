How do I register a font only for an English version?

My client has given me a custom TTF font only for English. So my intention is to load that TTF only for English and for other languages it should fallback to the available System font. I am doing the following steps: Registering fonts with my app. Copying into Resources folder and add to my project. Loading the font with name. NSMutableDictionary * aTitleAttributes = [[[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys: [NSFont fontWithName:CP_FONT_NAME size:[NSFont systemFontSize]], NSFontAttributeName, aParagraphStyle, NSParagraphStyleAttributeName, nil] autorelease]; But this results into another problem, since I am loading the fonts in this way for all the languages, my localization text looks english. Hence I think I should have some condition like NSFont *font = nil; If (currentLocaleIsEnglish()) { /// font to load my custom TTF } Then use [NSFont fontwithName:font ...] So can anybody help me to realize whatever I am doing is right with registering the font with App. If so how can I register my font only for English version. Because for other locales this font is not available then NSFont::fontWithName will return nil and automatically falls back to the SystemFont and hence my locale shall be shown properly. Otherwise I have to have a condition like what I mentioned above, which is a crude way of doing. If so how can I write such an API for finding currentLocale Is English?
