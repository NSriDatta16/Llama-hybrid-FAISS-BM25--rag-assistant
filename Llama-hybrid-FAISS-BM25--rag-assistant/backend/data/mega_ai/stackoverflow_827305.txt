How to handle variables in templates inheritance

I just want to define id attribute of body tag in child template. First solution works perfectly: base.html: [body{% block bodyid %}{% endblock %}] child.html: {% block bodyid %} id="myId"{% endblock %} It's simple and cool! But I don't like to point id="myId" in every child template. I want just send value 'myId' to parent template, where it put to id="....". So, I invent this method: base.html: [body{% block bodyid %} id={{ bodyid }}{% endblock %}] child.html: {% block bodyid %} {% with 'myId' as bodyid %} {{ block.super }} {% endwith %} {% endblock %} But it's terrible and tedious to compare first solution. Is there any good method to do this? This problem is deeper, than managing bodyId. I think, I try to find and organize subtemplate system through standard django template's inheritance.
