If you have a system with $n$ different (ordered) states, the binary encoding of a given state is simply it's $\text{rank number} - 1$ in binary format (e.g. for the $k$ th state the binary $k - 1$ ). The one hot encoding of this $k$ th state will be a vector/series of length $n$ with a single high bit (1) at the $k$ th place, and all the other bits are low (0). As an example encodings for the next system (levels of education): Level "Decimal encoding" Binary encoding One hot encoding No 0 000 000001 Primary 1 001 000010 Secondary 2 010 000100 BSc/BA 3 011 001000 MSc/MA 4 100 010000 PhD 5 101 100000 References: One hot encoding at Wikipedia And a 2017 paper on the comparison on the effects of different encodings to neural networks in the International Journal of Computer Applications could be a good starting point: A Comparative Study of Categorical Variable Encoding Techniques for Neural Network Classifiers
