Password Storage Implementation - AES 256 is enough?

I want implement a password storage system, the problem is... i need to store the db (sqlite) somewhere. So I evaluated to use AES 256, but I'm wandering, in the cloud-computing-era is that enough ? (the algorithm must be 2-way) Additional question: should I encrypt the entire db or the data inside it ? what is more secure and why ?
