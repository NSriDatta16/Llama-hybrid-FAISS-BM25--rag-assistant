If you are using a continuous integration server such as Hudson, you can delegate this requirement to a new job which is dependent on the build (which runs during each commit, say). Create a script which runs your code coverage profile, and fails based on a metric. Include a wget or cURL retrieval of the previous build's code coverage percent, parsed out, if you want to use an automatic metric.
