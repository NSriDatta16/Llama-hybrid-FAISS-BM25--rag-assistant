No. Cointegration is a property of nonstationary series. Let's call the variables $y_t$ and $x_t$. Your best bet is to fit models with both lags of $y_t$ and $x_t$: $$y_t = b_0 + b_1 y_{t-1} + ... + b_n y_{t-n} + b_{n+1} x_{t-1} + ... + b_{2n} x_{t-n} + \varepsilon_t$$ and then do likelihood ratio test on the various models, or look at adjusted $R^2$, AIC or hold out forecast performance to pick a set of plausible models. You could then pick the 'best' model, or just average the results from the top models.
