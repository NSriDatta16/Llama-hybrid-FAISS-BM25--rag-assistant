If nobody understands the game yet, there's no way you can get a decent evaluation function. Don't tell me that standard alpha-beta with material count is good or even decent for chess or its variants (maybe losers' chess is an exception). You could try neural networks with feedback or similar machine learning algorithms but they usually suck until they have tons of training, which in this case is probably not available. And even then, if they don't suck, you can't gain knowledge from them. I think there's no way short of understanding the game the best you can and, for starters, leave the unknowns as random on the evaluation function (or just out of the picture until the unknowns become better known). Of course, if you'd share more info about the game you could get better ideas from the community.
