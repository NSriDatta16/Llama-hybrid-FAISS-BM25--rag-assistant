Not sure if this is the most elegant solution (this is what I used), but you could scale your data to the range between 0 to 1 and then modify the colorbar: import matplotlib as mpl ... ax, _ = mpl.colorbar.make_axes(plt.gca(), shrink=0.5) cbar = mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase(ax, cmap=cm, norm=mpl.colors.Normalize(vmin=-0.5, vmax=1.5)) cbar.set_clim(-2.0, 2.0) With the two different limits you can control the range and legend of the colorbar. In this example only the range between -0.5 to 1.5 is show in the bar, while the colormap covers -2 to 2 (so this could be your data range, which you record before the scaling). So instead of scaling the colormap you scale your data and fit the colorbar to that.
