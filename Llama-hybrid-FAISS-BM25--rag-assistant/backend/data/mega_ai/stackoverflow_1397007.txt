The naive way to implement stock price movements is to use a normal (Gaussian) distribution but that doesn't generate realistic data. Gaussian distributions understate the risk of massive drops in price (called the "fat tail" phenomenon). Back in the 60s, Mandelbrot (yes the fractal guy) showed that cotton price movements fit a Levy distribution . Take a look at: Monte Carlo simulated stock price time series and random number generator ; The Generation of Random Variables Having a Levy-Stable Distribution ; The GNU maths library has a method for creating a Levy alpha stable distribution ; Another thing to consider is that over time, the adjusted (for splits and so forth) price of stocks tends to go up. In statistics terms this is called Heterodasticity, which tends to be undesirable from a modelling point of view. This is factored out typically in two ways: Instead of generating a random series of prices, you generate a random series of price changes (deltas); and You model the logarithm of the series rather than the actual series. Hope that helps.
