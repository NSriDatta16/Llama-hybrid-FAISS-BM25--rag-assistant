For me, the important thing about Bayesianism is that it regards probability as having the same meaning we apply intuitively in everyday life, namely the degree of plausibility of the truth of a proposition. Very few of us really use probability to mean strictly a long run frequency in everyday use, if only because we are often interested in particular events that have no long run frequency, for example what is the probability that fossil fuel emissions are causing significant climate change? For this reason, Bayesian statistics are much less prone to misinterpretation than frequentist statistics. Bayesianism also has marginalisation, priors, maxent, transformation groups etc. that all have their uses, but for me the key benefit is that the definition of probability is more appropriate for the kinds of problems I want to address. That doesn't make Bayesian statistcs better than frequentist statistics. It seems to me that frequentist statistics are well suited to problems in quality control (where you do have repeated sampling from populations) or where you have designed experiments, rather than analysis of pre-collected data (although that lies rather beyond my expertise, so it is just intuition). As an engineer, it is a matter of "horses for courses" and I have both sets of tools in my toolbox and I use both on a regular basis.
