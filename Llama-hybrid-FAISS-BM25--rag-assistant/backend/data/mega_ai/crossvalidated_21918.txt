Yes, this is a problem. Yes, it is inappropriate even though at least it is transparent about what it is doing (it gets points for transparency, but still is not satisfactory). I doubt there is an "easy way" to fix this. I don't know much about the approaches taken to meta analysis but if there is specific meta-analysis software and research like this is produced using it and gets published, this may well be the common approach. Either of your proposed responses loses some granularity of information from each study (ie the opposite problem of what the publishers have done). The obvious solution is a mixed-effects (ie multilevel) model with study as a random factor. I would suggest using a specialist statistical package for this if meta-analysis software cannot do it. You could still use the meta-analysis software for data storage and processing, and just export data to R, Stata or SAS for the analysis.
