Creating an array and passing that is probably the simplest/most elegant way to accomplish this in the current version of C#. You can take advantage of implicit array typing (i.e. new[] { ... } , but that's as far as it goes. I suspect you're really looking for the C# equivalent of this F# syntax: let foo = seq [ o1; o2; o3 ] which generates an IEnumerable that will iterate over the specified elements. ('Seq' is actually the F# alias for 'IEnumerable`, though F# has built-in support for them.) Unfortunately, since this is a largely functional notion, there is no C# equivalent - though who knows when it will be added, as C# becomes more and more functional.
