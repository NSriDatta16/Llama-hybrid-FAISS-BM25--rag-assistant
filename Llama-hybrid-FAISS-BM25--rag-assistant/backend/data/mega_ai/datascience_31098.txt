Classifier with a single 1 value per year

Let's say I want to find the probabilities of winning the best movie category in the Oscars. I know to following rules: There is only 1 winner per year. Logically, the sum of the predicted probabilities for each year should add up to be 1. I can have a year feature in my classifier but that does not mean that 1 and 2 are enforced. If I use a simple classifier like logistic regression I also don't see how having the year as a feature is going to help. My questions are: Is there a way to enforce those rules in a model? Does it matter? Should I just use a model without those rules and normalize the probabilities to 1 when I try to predict for a given year?
