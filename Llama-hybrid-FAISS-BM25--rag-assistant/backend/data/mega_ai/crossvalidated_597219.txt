This really will happen always with this specific design – or if I understood your design correctly: you did not have a reproducible example. I understood that for each "Site" you have only two units, one Control, another Treatment. You have only one constrained axis and the second axis is unconstrained PC. So the first axis will separate Control and Treatment. The effect of Condition(Site) is to make the mean of sites equal which in this multivariate setting means that their mean will be at the origin of the constrained axis (RDA1). Second axis, PC1, is unconstrained, and it shows how the observed values of your SUs differ from that mean, and Control and Treatment are equally far away from their mean or the origin. If you draw a line from Control and Treatment point of a Site, the line must go through their mean – or the origin - and distance from the origin is equal for Control and Treatment because this is how mean (average) is defined for two observations. Was so long that I try to summarize: by the definition of partial RDA, the mean of each Site is at the RDA1 axis value 0, and by the definition of mean, the distance to origin is equal to the mean for both points of a Site. I think that it may make sense to show only the RDA1 axis. EDIT: To clarify, the reason for symmetry is that you Condition on mean of pairs of points. That mean will be at the origin (0,0), and the two points will be at equal distances and opposite directions from the origin. This concerns in particular unconstrained axes, or residual PC's. You can produce this with any random seed using: x
