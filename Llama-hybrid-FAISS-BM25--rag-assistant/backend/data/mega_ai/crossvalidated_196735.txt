Using trees after variable selection using Lasso/Random

I am new into Machine Learning so please excuse me if my question is naive. My question is, is it possible to use trees for example rpart or ctree after variable selection procedures such as Lasso/Random Forest to study the interactions amongst the variables? Are there any published academic articles on this? Thank you
