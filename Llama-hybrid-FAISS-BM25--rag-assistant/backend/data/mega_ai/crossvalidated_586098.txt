Persistence models assume the condition of the current situation are the same as the one in the target future, i.e. the conditions, and therefore the values of the time series, persist between the current and future time instants: $$\hat x_{t+h}=x_t$$ where $h$ is your prediction horizon. This can be as simple as amount of sales tomorrow will be the same as today, i.e. $\hat x_t=x_{t-1}$ amount of sales will be the same as the same day of the last week, i.e. $\hat x_t = x_{t-7}$ amount of sales will be the same as the same day of last month, i.e. $\hat x_{t} = x_{t-f(t)}$ , where $f(t)$ finds the correct offset depending on your month I hope it helps.
