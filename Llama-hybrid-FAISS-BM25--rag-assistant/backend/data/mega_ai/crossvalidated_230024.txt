(Note: I do not have enough reputation to comment, so am posting this as an answer.) For the particular question posed, the answer by fcop is correct: fitting the average is the same as averaging the fits (at least for linear least squares). However it is worth mentioning that either of these na√Øve " online " approaches can give biased results, compared to fitting all the data at once. As the two are equivalent, I will focus on the "fit the average" approach. Essentially, fitting the averaged curves $\bar{y}[x]=\langle y[x]\rangle$ ignores the relative uncertainty in $y$ values between different $x$ points. For example if $y_1[x_1]=y_2[x_1]=2$, $y_1[x_2]=1$, and $y_1[x_2]=3$, then $\bar{y}[x_1]=\bar{y}[x_2]=2$, but any curve fit should care much more about misfit at $x_1$ compared to $x_2$. Note that most scientific software platforms should have tools to compute/update a true "online" least squares fit (known as recursive least squares ). So all the data can be used (if this is desirable).
