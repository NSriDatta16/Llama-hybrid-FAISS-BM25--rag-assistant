As your question is rather broad I can only provide you with a starting point. Depending how you intend for this to work as well as the mix of Lotus Clients you must develop any solution for Lotus Notes web-services in java. If you're using Lotus Notes 8.5+ then you can design a side-bar widget for this. Unfortunately it's a very complex process if you want to create it, (typical of IBM). If your users are on a mix of versions from 6.5+ you should consider writing the webservice in java via Eclipse as a Java agent. Domino's webservices can support providing/consuming of webservices in version 7. There is some support in 6.5 but I do not recommend it. Once you're in java and coding with Eclipse I find that dealing with Domino alot easier and robust. Also the java integration with Domino is be pretty good and actually very fast and efficient. As mentioned before, depending on your environment I would look at implementing this as a java agent that can be called from any version of Lotus Notes from version 6.5+. As an agent you can easily run it from within Notes mail as a custom action button or from the "Actions" menu list. Check here for a guide to JDK compatibility. But I think the best approach is to use Eclipse, as the Domino IDE is woefully inadequate for java development. A starting guide for Java agents, they can be found here , here , and here . There are some experts in the field of Java development and integration with Domino like Mikkel Heisterberg and Bob Balaban . Bob is the guru, and Mikkel is one of the best java guys for development and integration of java with the Notes side-bar widget. Reviewing those sites will provide you with more pointers at what you may need to do. Finally search for "Redbooks" there are many that IBM produce for Domino and can be a good guide into Java development for Domino (including servlets). Here is one, although quite old is still relevant for today. Hope this helps...
