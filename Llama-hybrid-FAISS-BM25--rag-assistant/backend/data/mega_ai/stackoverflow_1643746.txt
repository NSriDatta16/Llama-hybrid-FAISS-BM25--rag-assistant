LINQ to SQL and LINQ to XML have similarities, but they aren't identical. The LINQ queries could probably be written so that they could be used in the same way, but the code of the queries themselves would probably need to change. Could you give some examples of what your current LINQ to SQL code looks like? Including examples of what kind of data you're using and how you want to format the XML would probably help people here give more specific pointers. Edit: Your first query appears to return an object. If your LINQ to SQL and your LINQ to XML both return the same type, then you could swap them out without changing the code that consumes the result. Your second query appears to return a bool, so the same concept applies to that one. Code elsewhere in your solution won't care how that bool was set. Mike's suggestion of using an Interface for your data access layer is the way to go. For your 2 examples, you'd have an interface that contains an Organization object and a bool. Your SQL and XML implementations would be different, but every other part of your code would only need to know how to use the interface.
