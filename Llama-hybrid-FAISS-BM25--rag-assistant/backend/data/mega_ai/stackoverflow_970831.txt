If you want your app to keep running after the user has logged off (e.g. to maintain state for as long as the computer is running), you need a service. However, services are strongly discouraged from displaying UI. If you need both long-running and UI, consider writing a service to store your data, and an application that runs each time a user logs in that shows UI and interacts with the service.
