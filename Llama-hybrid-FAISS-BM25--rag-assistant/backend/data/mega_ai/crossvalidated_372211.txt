The best model is really going to depend on your data. I'd suggest using something like the caret package in R to build and compare several models. For a three-tiered risk stratification scheme, you might want to look at multinomial logistic regression (e.g., used for three levels of behavioral risk in https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228972467_Using_Multinomial_Logistic_Models_To_Predict_Adolescent_Behavioral_Risk ).
