Distribution of a Mean and Variance

Say we have observations $x_1 \dots x_n$ and we have some sort of Bayesian framework where we would like to estimate a distribution for the mean $\mu$ of our observations and the variance $\sigma^2$ of our observations (these distributions will then be updated based on further observations). I have 2 questions: 1) By the central limit theorem, for large $n$, $\hat{\mu} \sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n})$. I was therefore thinking of using this as my prior distribution for $\mu$. If I was going to do the same thing for the variance, what would the limiting distribution be? 2) Would it perhaps be better to choose many different size $k$ subsamples of my observations, calculate the sample mean in each case and use this as an empirical prior distribution for $\mu$ (and do the same thing for the variance)? P.S. Any links to further information on the topic would be appreciated.
