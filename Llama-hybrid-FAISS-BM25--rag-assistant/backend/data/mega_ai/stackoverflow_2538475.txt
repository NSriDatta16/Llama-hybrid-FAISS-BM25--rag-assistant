I would say that, strictly speaking, sanitizing your data should occur in the controller, but sanitizing also generally refers to cleaning user input to avoid many issues, such as SQL injection. Since you're using the term "sanitize" in a different context, we have to pay more attention to what that context is. You're not cleaning up user input, which means it doesn't really need to happen in the controller. You're changing the result of this action depending on whether or not the item you're saving already exists in the database. Therefore, in my mind, it should be happening in the model (or, as MunkiPhD specified, have a method in some sort of helper class that you can call from anywhere - but I say call it in the model). Edit: Usually, in MVC, the model knows whether it's supposed to save a new row into the database or update an existing one based on whether or not your model instance has a valid ID. If it has an ID, the model should save to the row indexed by that ID. If it does not, the model creates a new one. It's my understanding that all you want to do is know where to make it decide whether to create a new one or update an existing one, and that happens in the model.
