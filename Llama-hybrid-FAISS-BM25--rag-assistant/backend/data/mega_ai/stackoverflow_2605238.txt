I see that you are explicitly casting MyMiniDumpCallback to be a PMINIDUMP_CALLBACK_INFORMATION type. That looks fishy, as if you had a compiler error that you were getting around because the types didn't match. That, and PMINIDUMP_CALLBACK_INFORMATION is a struct, not a function pointer. The direct cast of function pointer to PMINIDUMP_CALLBACK_INFORMATION might be valid since the first parameter of that struct is the callback function. But again, it looks real fishy. Perhaps you misdeclared your callback function (like forgetting the CALLBACK/__stdcall modifier). Get your code to compile without casting those formal params first, then I'll be more inclined to help you. Also, did you even check that your callback function is even getting called at all?
