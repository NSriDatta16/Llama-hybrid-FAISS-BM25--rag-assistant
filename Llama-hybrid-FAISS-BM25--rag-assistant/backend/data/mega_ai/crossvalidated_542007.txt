How does VAE generate the value of mean and sd for the latent space?

I am just trying to understand the detailed mechanisms of VAE (variational autoencoder), and even new to Deep Learning. I was wondering, how does the encoder part of the VAE can make sure to generate the value of Gaussian mean and sd? I checked the code from Keras, it seems they used the same function to generate this two values? Then how do you know which is which? Thanks for any replies.
