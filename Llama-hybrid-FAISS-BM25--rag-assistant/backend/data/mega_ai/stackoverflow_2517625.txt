Can I ask what you mean by "sort java files into the correct directories (after creating them)" ? In Java if package structure and directory structure or not same, it wont allow you to compile. In effect, if you want to organize classes, you use Eclipse IDE (or any other IDE for that matter) select a bunch of classes and say "Move" specificy the package names and it will automatically move them to the appropriate packages (and physical directories)
