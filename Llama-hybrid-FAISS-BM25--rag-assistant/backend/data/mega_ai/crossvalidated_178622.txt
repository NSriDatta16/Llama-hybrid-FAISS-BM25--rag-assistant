Accounting for spatial dependency (pseudoreplication) using lmer

I have different planting containers (known as styroblocks). These containers contain cavities in which seedlings were planted. Cavity volume is constant within a container but varies between containers. Within in each container 15 seedlings were considered for analysis. I want to know whether container has an effect on growth parameters. In order to avoid pseudoreplication, I can either average across these 15 trees and get one value per container, or I can specify the spatial dependence in an lmer model. 5 different container sizes are replicated 3 times with 3 different plant varieties at 2 nurseries (5*3*3*2* 15 trees = 1350 seedlings). Here's an example dataset: xx Here's the model I think is most appropriate in this case: require(lme4) m1 I am not interested in 3-way interaction based on my objectives. My questions are: Q1: Is this model correctly specified? Q2: Is there are way to figure out from the model output if the correct sample size was used (45 vs. 3 for each nursery, container and clone combination)?
