Different number of images in classes

I am working on a deep learning CNN project. The dataset contains more than 500 classes and the classes have different numbers of items (images). For example, some of the classes have 5 images and some of the classes have 10 and some of the classes have 20 images and some of the classes have more then 20 images. Can I use this dataset to create the CNN model? Should the number of the images in each class be the same number? Note: I will use VGG to train the model.
