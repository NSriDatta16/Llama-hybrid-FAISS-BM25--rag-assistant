Why I cannot find suitable ARIMA model for the dataset?

I have a monthly dataset. I applied ADF test and saw that this dataset is stationary. Also, Canova-Hansen test is applied to see if there is stochastic or deterministic seasonality. As you see below the dataset is stationary and it shows deterministic seasonality. Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: rainfall Dickey-Fuller = -5.1491, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary Canova and Hansen test for seasonal stability data: rainfall statistic pvalue Jan 0.1378 0.4886 Feb 0.3668 0.092 .

I runned auto.arima function with xreg=seasonaldummy(dataset) in RStudio suggested ARIMA(0,0,0) as a best model. I tried alternative models by looking ACF and PACF plots but alternative models has very low R^2 values. Seasonality cannot be detected from time series plots and ACF plots, but Canova-Hansen test validated the existence of seasonality. Also, I think there is an indication o seasonality because dataset has lower values for summer season. Is there any recommendation about how to find suitable ARIMA model?
