This is an interesting design! One thing before getting to your question. You have diagnosis as both a fixed and then a nested random intercept. That does not make a lot of sense. My initial thought, without knowing a lot about your data, is that diagnosis would be better left in the fixed part of the model and not included as a random intercept. I would encourage you to treat stimulationValue in a way that is consistent with your research question(s) and theory. Theoretically, what is its role in a patient's painRating? Do you expect the effect of stimulationValue on painRating to be the same across individuals? If not, then you may consider a third alternative model in which you treat stimulationValue as a continuous predictor that has a varying effect on painRating depending on the participant . That model would be as follows: m3 Since diagnosis is presumably a participant-level variable, you might further be interested in whether diagnosis at all shifts the strength of the association between stimulationValue and painRating . That would involve you interacting the two variables. This is just to show that you have lots of options for how to treat stimulationValue and the option you choose should be based on theory and other considerations as much as possible and less on purely statistical considerations.
