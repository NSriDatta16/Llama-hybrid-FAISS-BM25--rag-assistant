You could use the GNAT Project file package Naming : an extract from a real example, where I wanted to choose between two versions of a package in the same directory, one with debug additions, is ... type Debug_Code is ("no", "yes"); Debug : Debug_Code := External ("DEBUG", "no"); ... package Naming is case Debug is when "yes" => for Spec ("BC.Support.Managed_Storage") use "bc-support-managed_storage.ads-debug"; for Body ("BC.Support.Managed_Storage") use "bc-support-managed_storage.adb-debug"; when "no" => null; end case; end Naming; To select the special naming, either set the environment variable DEBUG to yes or build with gnatmake -XDEBUG=yes .
