What do you think of the Managed Contract Tools library

I recently saw this video http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL51/ about the managed Contract tools library which certainly looks very interesting. Sadly it seems they won't include this into the language itself which would have been more elegant as in Spec#. It would be nice to have is as both options in C#4.0 in fact as the Contracts adds a lot of noise to the business code. Have anybody here used it and have some real world feedback? Could you also add contracts to class Properties and even variables? Something like decimal Percentage (min 0, max 1) string NotNullString (not null, regex("??")) would maybe been nice.
