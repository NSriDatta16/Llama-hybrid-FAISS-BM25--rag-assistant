What area are we talking about? Oncology or non-Oncology? non-Oncology: There's often two different types: Phase 2a: Often "proof of concept" type of trials that try to give enough efficacy evidence to make the decision to continue further development sensible. If one simulates these things out with realistic assumptions (e.g. many drugs do not work all that well, realistic costs, discounted value of potential future drug far in the future) and assumes that one also has other promising options to invest money/effort and allocate patients to trials, it often turns out that makes sense to have such an early hurdle, in part of efforts involved in subsequent stages. The powering of such studies is usually a decision theoretic trade-off between their cost vs. the value for (potentially) avoiding future cost or making future investment more certain . Phase 2b: Dose finding (often parallel group or sometimes cross-over studies) to identify doses that provide the right trade-off between efficacy and safety. Often involving extensive modeling (e.g. using MCP-Mod or similar approaches). Again, there's huge costs in only determining your final dose in Phase 3 (including longer-term studies in Ph3, required size of the safety database for the dose to be approved, if not already done developing a final market image of a drug etc.) so that it makes sense to find a single dose that is promising to take forward . These types of studies are usually pretty well powered (at least for an analysis that uses modeling of dose-response and potentially tries to exploit things like patterns over time etc., and possibly uses shorter-term or different outcomes than Phase 3). Oncology: Traditionally dose finding has not been as much of a focus in Oncology, but that may be changing due to regulatory changes . You seem to be referencing a particular type of (often) single arm nature, where one looks at something like an outcome such as "objective response" (=tumor shrinking sufficiently based on specific criteria). There are several complications here. * Firstly, is this a surrogate outcome for what we really care about (in Oncology usually people surviving longer), which may not be the same between different cancer types. * Secondly, are we sure there's a causal effect of the drug? That is not always clear if there's no control group. Formally, one could do a Bayesian comparison with historical controls (e.g. using robust meta-analytic predictive priors or any of the many alternatives). Often it's rather looked at in terms of threshold crossing , which in the end may be justified on a Bayesian basis or in other ways. Lots of issues play into this like sampling variation, changes in medical practice, other differences between current patients and historical controls etc. On a whole, the ICH E10 guidance is rather sensible on this topic, which is rather thoroughly debated with lots of references to whether medical interventions are parachutes or not . * If the assumptions are done sensibly, such studies can be well powered. And, of course, their interpretation may be affected by the knowledge that underpowered studies are more likely to produce false positive "significant" results . * Depending on how regulators judge the previous points in combination with the unmet need, the results of such trials might lead to accelerated/conditional approval (or not), but then there's usually still a Phase 3 trial that looks at progression free survival/overall survival. In the end, a lot may just come down to eNPV optimization .
