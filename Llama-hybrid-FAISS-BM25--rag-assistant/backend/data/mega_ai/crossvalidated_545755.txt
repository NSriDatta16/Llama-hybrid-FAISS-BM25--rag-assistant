I think @olooney is correct, but IIRC (it is a long time since I read it) Vapnik's book makes a distinction between support vectors and essential support vectors. Especially for linear classifiers in low dimensions, the optimal decision boundary can be defined using a subset of the support vectors. SVM solvers don't necessarily give you all of the support vectors, just a set of support vectors that is sufficient to define the discriminant. Not sure if that is the case here. Try retraining the model with point E left out, if the outcome is the same, it is, at most, a non-essential support vector. BTW I don't really understand the use of colours in the diagram.
