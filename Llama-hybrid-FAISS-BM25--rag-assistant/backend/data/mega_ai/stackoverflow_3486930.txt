Could you perhaps set a variable such as "justDragged = true" when starting the drag and then on the mouseUp event check this variable and if true, set it to false and then do a event.preventDefault + return w/o doing anything. This way it skips the first click after the drag. Seems kind of hackish, perhaps others will have a more elegant solution.
