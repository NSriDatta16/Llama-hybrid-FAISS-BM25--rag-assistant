I have not read the paper but the variance reduction provided by an iid sample is obvious from the variance Pythagorean decomposition and less obvious for a two-stage Gibbs sampler ( Liu, Wong & Kong, 1994 ). For a general MCMC chain there is no reason to see variance reduction due to the correlation between the elements of the chain ( Liu, Wong & Kong, 1995 ).
