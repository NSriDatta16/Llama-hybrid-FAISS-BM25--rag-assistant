The tensorflow.keras.layers.GRU uses the following formula to calculate the new state h = z * h_old + (1 - z) * hnew ,which is based on " Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoderâ€“Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation " by Kyunghyun Cho et al. On the other hand the formula in wiki but also on " Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate " by Dzmitry Bahdanau et al. is as follows: h = (1 - z) * h_old + z * hnew The difference in the order of the terms does not affect the performance of the GRU cell, since the sigmoid activation function used to compute the update gate, z, produces a value between 0 and 1, making both formulas symmetric.
