I had a problem compiling on Snow Leopard too, but was able to get it to work by following the instructions at: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Mac_OS_X_OpenCV_Port The only modification I had to make was also to disable ffmpeg inside of ccmake The GNU autotools methods (make && make install) are being outdated. Volunteers to edit this section? mkdir opencv/build cd opencv/build cmake .. ccmake . If you are on Snow Leopard, hit 't' to toggle advanced mode. Set CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="/usr/bin/g++-4.0" and CMAKE_C_COMPILER="/usr/bin/gcc-4.0" and then continue with the following steps. Hit 'c' to configure. Hit 'g' to generate the config file and exit ccmake. make -j8 sudo make install If you hit the following build error: /Users/awagner/Developer/opencv2/src/highgui/grfmt_tiff.cpp:292: error: ‘fmtSignTiffII’ was not declared in this scope make[2]: * [src/highgui/CMakeFiles/highgui.dir/grfmt_tiff.o] Error 1 make 1 : * [src/highgui/CMakeFiles/highgui.dir/all] Error 2 you can get the build to complete by commenting out line 292 of src/highgui/grfmt_tiff.cpp and running make again. (This probably breaks something in TIFF export, but the build at least completes)
