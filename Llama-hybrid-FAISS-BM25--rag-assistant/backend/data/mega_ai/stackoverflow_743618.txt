What is the roadmap for VSS 2005/ 6.0?

Microsoft has been aggresively pitching for usage of Team Foundation Server. The VSS population in our organization is pretty huge. I am trying to find the absolute must reasons for the transition. And nothing scares more from the fact that VSS 6.0/ 2005 would go bust in 20XX. THe MSDN site still runs the 2004 update on the roadmap ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302175.aspx ) Can anyone share any pointers on the out of support date for VSS? Thanks Paritosh
