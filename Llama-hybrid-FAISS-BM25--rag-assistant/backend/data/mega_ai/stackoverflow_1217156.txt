How do I rank nodes based on user-rating, number of comments etc. in Drupal 6

I wish all nodes of a certain type to have a rank (or at least be sortable in Views by this rank). This rank is a score based on different criteria: Voting API (5-star rating) average, Voting API number of votes, number of comments etc. Any suggestions on how to achive this?
