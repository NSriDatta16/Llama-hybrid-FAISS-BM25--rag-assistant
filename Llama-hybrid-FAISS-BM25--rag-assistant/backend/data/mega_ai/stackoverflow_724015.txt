Here's a quick, admittedly butchered response, but in a sentence: 1NF : Your table is organized as an unordered set of data, and there are no repeating columns. 2NF: You don't repeat data in one column of your table because of another column. 3NF: Every column in your table relates only to your table's key -- you wouldn't have a column in a table that describes another column in your table which isn't the key. For more detail, see wikipedia...
