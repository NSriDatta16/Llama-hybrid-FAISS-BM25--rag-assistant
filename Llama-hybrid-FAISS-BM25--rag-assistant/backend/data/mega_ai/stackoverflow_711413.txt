LINQ to SQL: union on constant values

I want to populate a dropdown with values from database and constant hard-coded literals using linq. For example, assuming I already have northwind datacontext, i want to populate the dropdown with category table and some constants so that the dropdown will have something like below. value text 0 [All] -1 [None] 1 Beverages 2 Condiments 3 Confections : : 8 Seafood and so on. First two items are hard-coded constants and the rest are from database using linq. I tried this, but did not work. Please help. Thanks. Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load Dim db As New NorthwindDataContext Dim q = From c In db.Categories _ Select c.CategoryID, c.CategoryName Dim q2 = From c In db.Categories _ Select CategoryID = 0, CategoryName = "All" DropDownList1.DataTextField = "CategoryName" DropDownList1.DataValueField = "CategoryID" DropDownList1.DataSource = q.Union(q2) DropDownList1.DataBind() End Sub I want to use LINQ to accomplish this. Yes, you can add to DropdownList but...
