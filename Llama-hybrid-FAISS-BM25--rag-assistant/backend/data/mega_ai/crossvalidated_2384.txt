Testing prediction time series against real data

Say I have a series of forecasts and observations like this: EntityF EntityO 2004 120 125 2006 166 173 2008 150 167 2010 152 - And assume that the (i) entity is the same and (ii) the forecasting methodology is constant. I'd like to Produce a meaningful metric of the forecasting error. Be able to predict the current forecast (2010) error based on 1.
