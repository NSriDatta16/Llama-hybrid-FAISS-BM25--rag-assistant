Here is a little Monte Carlo simulation that illustrates that you will reject the null of a mean of zero way too often if you neglect the AR(1) autocorrelation in the time series generated , i.e., if you estimate the variance of the mean as $s^2/n$. GLS produces rejection rates closer to the nominal level. (I am not so familiar with the nlme package, so I hope I have used it wisely.) library(nlme) reps The result: > mean(ols.rejections) [1] 0.264 > mean(gls.rejections) [1] 0.046
