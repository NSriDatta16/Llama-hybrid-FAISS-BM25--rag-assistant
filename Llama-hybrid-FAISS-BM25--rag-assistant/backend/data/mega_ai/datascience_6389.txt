ConLL is a format optimised for processing efficiency (both speed and memory usage). XML formats for NLP often have the annotation layers one after the other; therefore you have to hold the whole file in memory for processing it. A drawback of ConLL is that you have to put in fillers (e.g., 0 ) for sparse annotations.
