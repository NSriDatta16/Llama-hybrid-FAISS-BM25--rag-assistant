Pros and Cons: LDA vs Neural Networks

LDA is an older approach for word representations, there are newer methods now like CBOW and Skip-gram. But what are the improvements of these models? Do they improve in every way or does LDA still have some advantages over the newer methods? I have trouble finding a good source that compares the older vs newer methods for word representations. Thank you.
