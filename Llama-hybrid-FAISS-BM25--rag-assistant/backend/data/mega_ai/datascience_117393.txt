If you have good results on the validation set and very poor results on the test data, i.e. data that has not been seen during training the model, it is a clear sign of over-fitting. Have you tried using other algorithms? Since you are dealing with mainly continuous variables you can try using Quantile Transformer which will scale your data into a normal gaussian distribution. Also, in the data preparation steps check for data quality and remove outliers.
