Type of Sampling

I am conducting a research project, and have recruited participants through the organisation that has come on board with the project. What kind of sampling is this? At first I thought it was convenience sampling because the organisation is participating, but now I am not so sure. Participants will be recruited via email (through the organisation's email base) and invited to participate. If anyone could help me out would be much appreciated.
