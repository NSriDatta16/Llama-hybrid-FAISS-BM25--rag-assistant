Contradictory result from adf.test and ndiffs in R

I want to check if a time series is stationary in R. For ndiffs , > ndiffs(GDPlst_t$GDP110000, test="adf") [1] 0 the result is 0. However for adf.test > adf.test(GDPlst_t$GDP110000) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: GDPlst_t$GDP110000 Dickey-Fuller = -2.2519, Lag order = 3, p-value = 0.4729 alternative hypothesis: stationary Why do they differ? And what is the detailed ADF test in ndiffs ? How are the lag order and type of ADF (3 types) determined?
