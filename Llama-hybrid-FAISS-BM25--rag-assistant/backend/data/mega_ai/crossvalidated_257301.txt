Repeating from machine learning techniques for longitudinal data : the cross-validation sklearn documentation has cross-validation iterators for grouped data! See GroupKFold , LeaveOneGroupOut , and LeavePGroupsOut . If you're interested in pure prediction, the best option is probably to use Recurrent Neural Networks . Another option is Hidden Markov Models .
