Tackling the second part of the question, yes GAs can be used in machine learning but are not the commonly used method. Mainly, to optimize parameters on (parametric) models, it is common to use either a closed solution (like in least squares) or Gradient Descent (and it's variants) but the choice of Hyper-parameters are usually open to taste, GA's could be used in here, but people usually try things like Random Search, Grid Search and so on.
