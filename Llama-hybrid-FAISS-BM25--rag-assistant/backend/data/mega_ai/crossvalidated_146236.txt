While there is definitely some educational value of re-implementing GLM framework (or any other statistical framework, for that matter), I question the feasibility of this approach due to complexity and, consequently, time and efforts involved. Having said that, if you indeed want to go this route and review existing open source GLM implementations, you have, at least, the following options: Standard GLM implementation by R package stats . See the corresponding source code here on GitHub or by typing the function name (without parentheses) in R 's command line. Alternative and specific GLM implementations for R include the following packages: glm2 , glmnet and some others. Additionally, GLM-releated R packages are listed in this blog post . Excellent GLM Notes webpage (by Michael Kane and Bryan W. Lewis) offers a wealth of interesting and useful details on standard and alternative R GLM implementations aspects. For Julia GLM implementations, check similar to R 's GLM and GLMNet packages. For Python GLM implementations, check the one in statsmodels library and the one in scikit-learn library (implements Ridge, OLS and Lasso - find corresponding modules). For .NET GLM implementations, check IMHO very interesting Accord.NET framework - the GLM source code is here on GitHub . For C/C++ GLM implementations, check apophenia C library ( this source code seems to be relevant) and, perhaps, C++ GNU Scientific Library (GSL) (see this GitHub repo , but I was unable to find the relevant source code). Also of interest could be: this C++ IRLS GLM implementation (which uses GSL) as well as the Bayesian Object Oriented Modeling (BOOM) C++ library (GLM-focused source code is here on GitHub ).
