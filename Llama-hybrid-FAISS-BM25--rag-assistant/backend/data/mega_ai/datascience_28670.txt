What I would do to optimise the performance of linear regression One Hot encode the categorical features Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data Scale the data (subtract the mean, divide by the standard deviation) Train the regression model on the reduced scaled dataset If you have enough data (>10k examples), you could even train a neural network on the data to capture the complex relationships between features which linear regression wouldnâ€™t capture.
