Appropriate Statistical Test for Likert Data?

I am having trouble deciding the appropriate statistical test to use for a given experiment. In the study, participants first recorded various feelings on a 4 point Likert scale. Ex: How much do you agree with the statement "I feel calm"? 1 - Not at all 2 - Somewhat 3 - Moderately so 4 - Very much so Then after participating in a given event, the users then recorded their responses to the questions again. I want to test whether or not the feelings before the experience are different from the feelings after the experience. The two tests that came to mind were a Chi-Squared test and a paired t test. The Chi squared test would determine whether or not the distribution of before answers is different from the distribution of after answers. The paired t test would find the difference between each participant's before and after answer, and then test whether or not the average of these differences was equal to 0. The detail that is throwing me off is the fact that this study included multiple participants who went through this experience multiple times. For example a given participant could have 3 observations in the data and therefore represent three observations in the data. This leads me to believe that the observations are not independent from each other as someone's difference in pre-activity and post-activity responses are most likely similar between the multiple times they participated in the activity. Would it be better to take the mean difference of a participant's pre-activity and post-activity response to use as each observation, or to keep each individual difference in the data? For example if one of the participants saw differences of 0, 2, and 1 on different days, would it be better to have this be represented by a single observation of 1 for the mean difference, or to leave 0, 2, and 1 as separate observations. Any help in picking the appropriate statistical test to use in this situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
