To get the built product of one Xcode target to be included in the resources directory of another Xcode target's product, you should find the product in the groups and files tree and drag the product into the copy "bundle resources phase" of the other target. You should also add a target dependency between the two targets with the get info panel for the target. If you're seeing the built plug-in in the build products directory that does not mean that it wasn't also copied into the framework's resources directory. Xcode builds all targets into the build directory, and then copies (not moves) them into their final destination - which in this case is the framework's resources directory. One reason for this is that a product can have multiple final destinations.
