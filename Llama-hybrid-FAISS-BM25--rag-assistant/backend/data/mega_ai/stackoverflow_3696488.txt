Considering your time constraints Linq to SQL (despite being deprecated) would have been ideal. While NH or EF4 are more complete and flexible ORM solutions they do require more consideration of mappings than does a simple drag and drop from the Server Explorer connection mapping onto LINQ to SQL designer and simple instantiation of a DataContext object. If you don't have the time to get everyone up to speed on an ORM with a future why eliminate the typed datasets at all? Performance wise they are probably close to identical to what you would be able to get out of an ORM. The benefit of replacement would be maintainability and developer pleasure, both of which would be accompanied by a C# rewrite at the same time...
