Interpreting PCA Output

I have 40 columns (variables); my PCA output (from Minitab) says PC1-PC14 account for 75% of my variation. How do I pick/determine which of the (original) variables in each PC column are most important? I see 5 (original) variables in the PC1 column with high positive values. So, those five are the most influential in that linear combination. Do I then look at the PC2 column (and so on through PC14) and pick out the (original) variables with the highest values and say they, too, are important? I am trying to get the 40 original variables down to their most impactful subset to then do a regression analysis and then use that subset to see the impactful variables' influence on a dependent variable.
