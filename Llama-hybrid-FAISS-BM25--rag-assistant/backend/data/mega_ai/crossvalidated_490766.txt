One place where Bayesian approach meets large datasets is Bayesian deep learning. When using Bayesian approach to neural networks people usually use rather simplistic priors (Gaussians, centered at zero), this is mostly for computational reasons, but also because there is not much prior knowledge (neural network parameters are black-boxish). The reason why Bayesian approach is used, is because out-of-the-box it gives us uncertainty estimates.
