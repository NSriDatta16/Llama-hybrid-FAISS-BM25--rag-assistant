A combination of MCMC proposals can only improve upon each of the Markov operators used, if you do not take computing time into account. There is for instance an early result by Tierney (1994) about the benefits of mixing two MCMC kernels. (One can also argue that Gibbs sampling is nothing but a combination of kernels. While each of those kernels is not even irreducible, since it only generates a subset of the variables, the combination is a valid MCMC generator. Furthermore, it can be shown that a random combination does better than a sequential generation of $\theta_1$, then $\theta_2$, etc.)
