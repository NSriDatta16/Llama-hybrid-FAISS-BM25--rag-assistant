Make Predictions with an RNN Using a Multi-dimensional Training Set

I have a 2D matrix TD of training data that is a collection of N non-linear signals that are functions of time (hence the specification of training set in the title of this post). Let M denote the number of timesteps for each signal. Each signal shares the same M . Therefore, TD is an MxN matrix. I would like to train my neural network on the entire training set to compute my output weight matrix Wout. I would then like to make a prediction on an separate non-linear signal, yTest , that is not one of the N signals already in TD using the trained Wout . I would then like to compare the predicted output, yNN , with dimensions of 1xM , to yTest with dimensions of 1xM to see how accurate the prediction is. My issue is that my current yTest and yNN both have dimensions of NxM instead of 1xM . My goal is to train the neural network on all N training set signals and make a singular 1xM prediction using a Wout that accounts for all N nonlinear signals. As a side note, the dimensions of Wout are DxN where D is the number of nodes in my neural network. I'm not sure if what I am asking is even possible. Is there a way to somehow flatten or reshape TD from an MxN matrix to a Mx1 matrix before computing Wout ? That way Wout would be a Dx1 matrix and the predicted output yNN would be a 1xM matrix like I want it to be?
