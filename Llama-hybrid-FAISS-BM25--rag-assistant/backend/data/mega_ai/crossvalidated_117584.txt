SVM's advantages over ANN: "A significant advantage of SVMs is that whilst ANNs can suffer from multiple local minima, the solution to an SVM is global and unique. Two more advantages of SVMs are that that have a simple geometric interpretation and give a sparse solution. Unlike ANNs, the computational complexity of SVMs does not depend on the dimensionality of the input space. ANNs use empirical risk minimization, whilst SVMs use structural risk minimization. The reason that SVMs often outperform ANNs in practice is that they deal with the biggest problem with ANNs, SVMs are less prone to overfitting." for more, please look at http://www.svms.org/anns.html I have not got much information about LR. However, as far as I know, it is the mostly used and well-known and one of the easiest methods. Linear SVM and LR are classification methods with linear decision boundaries, but they're motivated completely differently. Applications in articles show that SVM gives significant results and shows better performances.
