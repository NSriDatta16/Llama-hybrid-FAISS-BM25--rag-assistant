What I found works best is to really learn CSS. I mean really learn CSS. It can be a confusing language to learn, but if you read enough about it and practice, eventually you'll learn the best way to do things. The key is to do it enough that it comes natural. CSS can be very elegant if you know what you want to do before you start and you have enough experience to do it. Granted, it is also a major PITA to do sometimes, but even cross-browser issues aren't so bad if you really practice at it and learn what works and what doesn't, and how to get around problems. All it takes is practice and in time you can become good at it.
