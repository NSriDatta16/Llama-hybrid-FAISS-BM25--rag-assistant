Is logistic regression an alternative to t-test?

The analysis I am dealing with consists in determining whether some gene is differentially expressed between two groups of people. To this end, 20 people from each group were sampled and the expression of the gene was measured on each person. Let's assume that the expression follows a normal distribution within each group. Analysis 1 : t-test with gene expression as response; Analysis 2 : Logistic regression with group as binary response and gene expression as explanatory variable. Are both analyses valid? Is one of them more appropriate?
