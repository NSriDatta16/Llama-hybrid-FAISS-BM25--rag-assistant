Yes Yes - but you incorrectly assume ARIMA is the 'standard". There are no standard models. I'd highly recommend reading a time series book (of which there are a number of excellent free books online). They typically will cover using ARIMA models with external regressors, dynamic regression, ETS models, etc. NA Maybe; depends on what your data looks like. Depending on what you're using the data for and how important forecast accuracy is, there are a number of approaches you'll want to test using time series cross validation and/or test set holdouts. But essentially, you should look at ARIMA models that include external regressor variables for Easter. Holidays do not always fall on the same index day/week due to leap years. Ideas for approaches to take: Use daily data and include seasonal regressors for holidays and specify multiple seasonal periods (daily, yearly). Since we know information the model doesn't (holidays) it would be a pretty bad idea not to at least test using them. You could aggregate the data at a weekly or monthly level, forecast those and then use a distribution pattern by month based on moving average for that month's volume from previous years. For example, day 1 December historically has averaged 3% of the total volume in that month, day 2 gets 2.3%, etc. The value of this method is monthly forecasting is typically more accurate than daily due to the noise to signal level at the daily resolution. I am really impressed with the recent advances via Temporal Hierarchical Forecasting. There is an implementation of this methodology in the R thief package. This methodology can work really well on high frequency data (daily, weekly data). Still, you'll want to include holidays as external regressors even to this model framework since hotel usage is likely highly impacted by holidays. Seasonal naive using a linear adjustment up/down based on your year-over-year trend (usually decent to stick with a naive approach to the trend). You'll still need to account for leap years and holidays, as they may not align using this method. Reading a good practical forecasting book will likely be the best place to start.
