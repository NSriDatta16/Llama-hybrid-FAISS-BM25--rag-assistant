Average ROC for repeated 10-fold cross validation with probability estimates

I am planning to use repeated (10 times) stratified 10-fold cross validation on about 10,000 cases using machine learning algorithm. Each time the repetition will be done with different random seed. In this process I create 10 instances of probability estimates for each case. 1 instance of probability estimate for in each of the 10 repetitions of the 10-fold cross validation Can I average 10 probabilities for each case and then create a new average ROC curve (representing results of repeated 10-fold CV), which can be compared to other ROC curves by paired comparisons ?
