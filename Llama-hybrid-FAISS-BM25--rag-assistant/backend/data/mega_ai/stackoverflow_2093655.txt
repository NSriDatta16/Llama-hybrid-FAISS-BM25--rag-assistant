Is there an inverse of `setEditing` for when editing is complete?

I'm working on a traditional iPhone UINavigationController app, with automatic back buttons etc. I am working on when an 'edit' button is pressed. The LHS back icon dims, my new one comes in, and then once I tap the 'edit' button again, the back button comes back. So far, the back button goes away, and my new one comes in, but I can't put it back! I know what the code should be, but I don't know where to call it. Here is what I have so far: (void)setEditing:(BOOL)editing animated:(BOOL)animated { [self.navigationItem setHidesBackButton:editing animated:animated]; //fades back button //de 006 - Load in Move section button here. UIBarButtonItem *saveButton = [[[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemOrganize target:self action:@selector(altersection:)] autorelease]; self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = saveButton; Basically I want the inverse of (void)setEditing:(BOOL)editing animated:(BOOL)animated { , where I can do: self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = nil; //custom button hide self.navigationItem.hidesBackButton = NO; //replace back button Is there an inverse of (void)setEditing:(BOOL)editing ?
