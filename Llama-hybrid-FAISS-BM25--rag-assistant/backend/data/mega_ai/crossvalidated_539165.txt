Do I need to convert my time series to a stationary process when conducting a t-test on it?

I have two time series, $X_{t}$ and $Y_{t}$ . I want to know if there's a significant difference between them. Step 1: get the differences between them $\textbf{d} = X_{t}-Y_{t}$ Step 2: calculate mean $\bar{d} = \frac{1}{n}\sum\textbf{d}_{i}$ . Step 3: Perform t-test on $\textbf{d}$ : $H_{0}: \mu_{X-Y} = 0; H_{A}: \mu_{X-Y} \neq 0$ . In step 1, would I need to convert X and Y to stationary processes? Why am I asking this? I have no background in time series, I think I am in essence treating the data as cross-sectional. But I don't know if I can do that because I have seen that time series values are correlated which violates the independence assumptions of the t-test. I do see that in time series analysis, the signals are often converted to stationary processes prior to analysis. I do not know why this is beyond having a sequence for which there can be a meaningful mean and variance, so I cannot determine if it is appropriate for me to convert to stationary process here.
