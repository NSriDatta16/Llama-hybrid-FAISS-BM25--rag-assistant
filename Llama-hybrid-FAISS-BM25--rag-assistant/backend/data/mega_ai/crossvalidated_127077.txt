Random Forest Probabilistic Prediction vs majority vote

Scikit learn seems to use probabilistic prediction instead of majority vote for the model aggregation technique without an explanation as to why (1.9.2.1. Random Forests). Is there a clear explanation for why? Further is there a good paper or review article for the various model aggregation techniques that can be used for Random Forest bagging? Thanks!
