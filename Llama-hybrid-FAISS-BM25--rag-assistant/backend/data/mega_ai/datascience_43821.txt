Does running the script of train_test_split several times with varying test size in sklearn cause data leakage?

I ran a script of ridge and lasso regression twice with and without pca. Both times i got an okay R^2. but when i changed the train_test_split test size from 20 to 30%. My model started to over fit. So i was wondering whether this is because of changing the test size or something else. Thank you in advance,
