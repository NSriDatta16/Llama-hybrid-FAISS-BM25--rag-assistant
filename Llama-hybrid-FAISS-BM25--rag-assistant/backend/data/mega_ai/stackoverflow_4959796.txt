Is it possible to access my machine hard disk with android SDK?

I'm trying to develop a server-client application for Android mobile devices. Here I need to test my client application with a server application which is dealing with the database. As I'm developing this application using the Eclips-ganymede SR2 with Android SDK plugins, I'm confusing how I can test my application with a server. Is it possible to use my hard disk as the server? I mean will the Android emulator can access my hard disk?? Please give any idea related this Thanks on Regards..
