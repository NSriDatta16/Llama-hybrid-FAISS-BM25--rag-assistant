Characters are easy to count. Paragraphs are usually easy to count too. Whenever you see two consecutive newlines you probably have a paragraph. You might say that an enumeration or an unordered list is a paragraph, even though their entries can be delimited by two newlines each. A heading or a title too can be followed by two newlines, even-though they're clearly not paragraphs. Also consider the case of a single paragraph in a file, with one or no newlines following. Sentences are tricky. You might settle for a period, exclamation-mark or question-mark followed by whitespace or end-of-file. It's tricky because sometimes colon marks an end of sentence and sometimes it doesn't. Usually when it does the next none-whitespace character would be capital, in the case of English. But sometimes not; for example if it's a digit. And sometimes an open parenthesis marks end of sentence (but that is arguable, as in this case). Words too are tricky. Usually words are delimited by whitespace or punctuation marks. Sometimes a dash delimits a word, sometimes not. That is the case with a hyphen, for example. For words and sentences you will probably need to clearly state your definition of a sentence and a word and program for that.
