Use of Change of Variables (in probability distributions) in Machine Learning

I am learning about machine learning from a probabilistic perspective via Kevin Murphy's so far fantastic Textbook (2021) Machine Learning - Probabilistic Machine Learning - An Introduction . I'm in the beginning, where he explains important concepts in probability and statistics used throughout the book. Currently, I am learning about the change of variables - how to find the new Probability Distribution Function after transforming your old probability distribution by some monotonic function. It's quite fascinating and took me an embarrassingly long time to understand, but I was wondering: Does anyone know any concrete scenarios where an understanding of this, or this method directly, is used in machine learning? Just out of curiosity. Thanks! A
