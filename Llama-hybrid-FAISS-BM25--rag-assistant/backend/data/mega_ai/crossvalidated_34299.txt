MCMC Geweke diagnostic

I'm running a Metropolis sampler (C++) and want to use the previous samples to estimate the convergence rate. One easy to implement diagnostic I found is the Geweke diagnostic , which computes the difference between the two sample means divided by itsestimated standard error. The standard error is estimated from the spectral density at zero. $$Z_n=\frac{\bar{\theta}_A-\bar{\theta}_B}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_A}\hat{S_{\theta}^A}(0)+\frac{1}{n_B}\hat{S_{\theta}^B}(0)}},$$ where $A$, $B$ are two windows within the Markov chain. I did some research on what are $\hat{S_{\theta}^A}(0)$ and $\hat{S_{\theta}^B}(0)$ but get into a mess of literature on energy spectral density and power spectral density but I'm not an expert on these topics; I just need a quick answer: are these quantities the same as sample variance? If not, what's the formula for computing them? Another doubt on this Geweke diagnostic is how to pick $\theta$? The above literature said that it is some functional $\theta(X)$ and should imply an existence of a spectral density $\hat{S_{\theta}^A}(0)$, but for convenience I guess the simplest way is to use the identity function (use samples themselves). Is this correct? The R coda package has a description but neither does it specify how to compute the $S$ values.
