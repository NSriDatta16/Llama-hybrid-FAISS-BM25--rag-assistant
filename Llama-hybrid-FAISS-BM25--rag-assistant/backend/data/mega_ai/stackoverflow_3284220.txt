No. Each linked/target server will have it's own state of fragmentation, index state and number of rows will can affect performance. Also, is each linked server identical (eg collation compatible?) which can affect the queries. Finally (until I edit with more stuff), you have network traffic, server load, local indexs/stats etc. Simply, you'll almost never get consistent results... if I ever did, I'd start to wonder what I'd done wrong for a 3 hour package...
