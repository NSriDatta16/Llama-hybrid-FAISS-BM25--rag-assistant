Haven't heard of one. But do you really need online learning? I'm using SVMs for quite some time and never encountered a problem where i had to use online learning. Usually i set a threshold on the number of changes of training examples (maybe 100 or 1000) and then just batch-retrain all. If your problem is at a scale, where you absolutely have to use online learning, then you might want to take a look at vowpal wabbit . Reedited below, after comment: Olivier Grisel suggested to use a ctypes wrapper around LaSVM . Since i didn't know about LaSVM before and it looks pretty cool, i'm intrigued to try it on my own problems :). If you're limited to use the Python-VM only (embedded device, robot), i'd suggest to use voted/averaged perceptron, which performs close to a SVM, but is easy to implement and "online" by default. Just saw that Elefant has some online-SVM code.
