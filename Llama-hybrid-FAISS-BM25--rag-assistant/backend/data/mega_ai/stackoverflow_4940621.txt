I'll be honest here... I'm not able to replicate your problem. It works fine for me when I run this program multiple times in a for loop. Are you sure you didn't accidentally open the result file, thus locking it, before running your program? If you are concerned of having multiple threads running your program at the same time, perhaps you can apply a synchronized block to prevent two threads trying to write the same file, like this:- ... synchronized (XMLCreater.class) { StreamResult result = new StreamResult(new File(dir + "\\XML\\" + name + ".xml")); transformer.transform(source, result); }
