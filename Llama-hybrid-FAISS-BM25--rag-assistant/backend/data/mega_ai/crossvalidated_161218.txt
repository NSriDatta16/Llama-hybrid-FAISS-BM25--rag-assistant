Use Linear Regression to Estimate Conditional Probability for Bayes Net?

When reading and watching video regarding building and using Bayes Nets, the examples typically use binary outcomes for the nodes. 'Probability of it raining', 'Probability of x disease', ect... With those types of nodes it is easy to derive the conditional probability table. However, what do you do when you have continuous variables with many conditional variables or a more complicated binary model? Would you use standard regression techniques like OLS and Logistic regression to estimated the nodes of a Bayes Net? Or what other methods might one use?
