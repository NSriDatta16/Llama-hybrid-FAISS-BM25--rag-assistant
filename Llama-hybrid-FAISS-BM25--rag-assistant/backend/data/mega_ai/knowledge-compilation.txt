Knowledge compilation is a family of approaches for addressing the intractability of a number of artificial intelligence problems. A propositional model is compiled in an off-line phase in order to support some queries in polynomial time. Many ways of compiling a propositional model exist. Different compiled representations have different properties. The three main properties are: The compactness of the representation The queries that are supported in polynomial time The transformations of the representations that can be performed in polynomial time Classes of representations Some examples of diagram classes include OBDDs, FBDDs, and non-deterministic OBDDs, as well as MDD. Some examples of formula classes include DNF and CNF. Examples of circuit classes include NNF, DNNF, d-DNNF, and SDD. Knowledge compilers c2d: supports compilation to d-DNNF d4: supports compilation to d-DNNF miniC2D: supports compilation to SDD KCBox: supports compilation to OBDD, OBDD[AND], and CCDD == References ==
