HTML and CSS in URLs causing 404 errors (User Agent = Trident/4.0)

I've been getting some 404s with snippets of code (CSS, HTML and JavaScript) in the URL. As best as I can tell the user is progressing through the site just fine during their session - its an ecommerce site and the affected users are putting stuff in their basket and checking out OK etc. On certain pages I'm see 404 errors adjacent to a seemingly successful page display. I get the same 404 error every time that page is displayed (within that session). Example of a logged 404 error: 404;http://www.example.com/rrepeat: repeat-y; There is a single matching instance on the page in question (apart from the first "r"): I've checked the included CSS files and none have matches (and presumably if they did I would get a 404 on all the pages which include the CSS file) My thought was that maybe its a PlugIn for IE8 that is spidering the page whilst the user is viewing it to cache something - or possibly for more malevolent purposes. The user-agent for pages and the 404 (within that session) is the same [don't know if a PlugIn would show differently to the browser itself?] Other examples: /r/table&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width= /r width= /r alt= /rurn pair[1]; --&gt; --&gt; --&gt; function Set_Cookie( name, value, expires, path, domain, secure ) &lt;!--/ set time, it's in millisecondsvar today = new Date();today.setTime( today.getTime() );/*if the expires variable is set, make the correct expires time, the current script below will set it for x number of days, to make it for hours, delete * 24, for minutes, delete * 60 * 24if ( expires ) &lt;!--expires = expires * 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;--&gt; */expires = (3650) * 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;var expires_date = new Date( today.getTime() + (expires) );document.cookie = name + All seem to start with an "r" that is not part of the code, then a snippet direct from the code for the page. The page passes w3c.org HTML validation (so I don't think it is, say, an unlcosed quote, unless I have some goofy javascript breaking the HTML!!) User Agent is always MSIE 8.0 or MSIE 7.0 and Trident/4.0. (I assume the MSIE 7.0 with Trident is IE8 in compatiblity mode) I'm only seeing a few instances of this a day (less than 10 sessions), whereas I am getting hundreds sessions a day with User Agent including IE8 and Trident. Thanks.
