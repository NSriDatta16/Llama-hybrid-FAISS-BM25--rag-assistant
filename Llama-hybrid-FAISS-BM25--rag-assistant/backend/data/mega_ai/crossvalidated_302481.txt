I am not sure it will work better but you could try optimization methods based on second-order derivatives: L-BFGS or Newton's method . It depends on the model structure and dataset, but I think back propagation will work better in most cases. But it could be worth trying! If you want a reference regarding optimization methods for neural networks, refer to here .
