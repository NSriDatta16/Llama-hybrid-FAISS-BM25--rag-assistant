Ok, this looks like deep learning related stuff, maybe an exercise. $N(\mu,\sigma)|_{x_j}$ is not the probability of a point $x_j$, this is the density of point $x_j$ given the parameters $\mu, \sigma$. The total integral is not the probability either, it is the likelihood of sorts or a density function. The whole thing is in fact never a zero, because the density $N$ of normal distribution is never zero, it can be very small of course.
