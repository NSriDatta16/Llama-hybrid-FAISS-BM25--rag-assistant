Can a TeamCity build agent be configured to only run builds with a particular parameter dependency?

I have a TeamCity build agent installed on a machine which in theory is dedicated to running dynamic security scans and I don't want it doing anything else (i.e. running the duplicates finder). Short of either creating custom agent configuration properties then customising each build's agent dependencies (which perhaps strictly speaking I should be doing anyway) or configuring the agent to only run selected configurations, is there any way to avoid this? Both of these approaches require additional configuration on a per-build basis either on every single build. In a perfect world, I'd like to be able to tell the agent to only ever run builds which match a particular agent dependency. Is this possible or am I coming at it from the wrong direction?
