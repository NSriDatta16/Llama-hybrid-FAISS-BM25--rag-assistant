How can I test whether two logistic regression coefficients are identical?

3 variables (1 continuous ( X ) and 2 categorical ( A & B )) predict 1 dichotomous variable in logistic regression. Both variables A and B are dichotomous and are coded with 1 (reference category) and 2. Criterion is coded with 0 & 1. We have the following results: Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.47384 0.04094 35.997 Now, the slopes for different conditions are: A1 A2 B1 X X+X:A2 B2 X+X:B2 X+X:A2+X:B2+X:A2:B2 How can I test the following hypothesis X+X:B2 = X+X:A2 + X:B2 + X:A2:B2 which equals to 0 = X:A2 + X:A2:B2 and finally X:A2 = -X:A2:B2
