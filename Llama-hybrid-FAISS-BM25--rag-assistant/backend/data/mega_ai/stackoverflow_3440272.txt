why break this up javascript fragment?

Possible Duplicate: Why split the tag when writing it with document.write()? I don't really do Javascript programming and was hard to google this but have seen something like this in a couple of different places (by good developers): document.writeln(' '); With the split always between the r and the i. What does this achieve?
