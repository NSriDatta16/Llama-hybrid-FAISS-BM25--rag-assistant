Converting Multiple Activites into a Single Fragment

I've recently decided to update my app to support the new fragments feature in honeycomb 3.0. My Application currently works on a list view that opens different activities depending on which list item is clicked. Using an adaptation of the code in this tutorial I have created an app that consists of only two activities, but depending on which list item is clicked the second "viewer" activity launches using a different layout xml. Unfortunately I haven't been able to figure out how to call the old methods that had all the functionality. Should I Import all of my old activities and then call the methods into the viewer activity (I may need some advice on how exactly to do this) or should I just put all the methods directly into the same viewer activity (please consider the size of these methods(which is very large by the way)). Once everything is working with two activities upfront then it will be a pretty simple task of "fragmenting" the app as demonstrated here Although I haven't considered that there might be a way to allow multiple fragments to occupy the same space in an activity(If this is the case then please let me know how it's done) Thanks
