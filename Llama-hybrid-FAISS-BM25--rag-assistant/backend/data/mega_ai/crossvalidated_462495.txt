Which test to use when comparing two variables of which one has multiple levels?

Here's some example data: data_ex I want to run a statistical test to check for the differences between variable 1 and 2, while I'm also interested in knowing the difference between the different levels of variables 2 (a,b,c). I could run two analyses: first a simple t-test between variable 1 and the average of the 3 variable 2's. Then run an anova to compare between the three levels of variable 2. However, I believe there must be a way to answer my questions with one (more sophisticated) test, would anyone have a suggestion on how to do this?
