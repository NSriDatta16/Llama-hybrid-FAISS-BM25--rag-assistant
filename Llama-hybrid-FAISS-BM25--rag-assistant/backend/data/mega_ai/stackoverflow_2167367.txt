I usually write my own, but via Jack Ganssle's Embedded Muse newsletter No. 184 I came across http://srecord.sourceforge.net/ which will do just about anything with almost any type of binary image file (despite its name it handles far more formats than just Motorola S-Records, including raw binaries). It may save you some time.
