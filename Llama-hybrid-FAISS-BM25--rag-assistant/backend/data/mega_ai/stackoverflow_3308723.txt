Is there a difference between an F5 browser refresh and postback??(asp.NET)

I am dynamically creating dragrids in different rows of an existing datagrid in asp.NET My generated datagrids have a column which is TemplateColumn (a CheckBox Column). In my parent datagrid, I have a template column with checkboxes. when I check or uncheck the value of the check box, the check_change method is called (autopostback is set to true), the dynamically generated datagrids lose the checked checkboxes (the checkboxes are all unchecked again). However, if i check any of the checkboxes of the child (dynamically generated) grids and press F5, it refreshes the page but still I have my checked checkboxes. What's happening ?? how is post-back different from refresh F5??? understanding this might help me fix my problem here : DataGrid not being altered!
