Using JavaScript within a JSP tag

I've seen this question regading the importing of js-files related to the tag content itself. I have a similar problem, here I have a jsp tag that generates some HTML and has a generic js-implementation that handles the behavior of this HTML. Furthermore I need to write some initialization statements, so I can use it afterwards through JavaScript. To be possible to use this "handler" within my JavaScript, it should be somehow accessible. The question is... Is it Ok to write inline tags along with my HTML for instantiation and initialization purposes (personally I don't think its very elegant)? And about being accessible to the JS world, should I leave a global var referencing my handler object (not very elegant aswell I think), are there better ways to do it?
