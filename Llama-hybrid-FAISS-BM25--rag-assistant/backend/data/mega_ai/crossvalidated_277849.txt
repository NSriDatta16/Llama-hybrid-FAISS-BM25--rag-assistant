I have an answer on how to read learning curve here. I think it may be helpful. How to know if a learning curve from SVM model suffers from bias or variance? I would suggest you to use more data, instead of 1 to 27 data points. The reason is in your plot, the numbers are easily get very small after passing $n=3$ and the $y$ axis is in a larger scale. In sum, Try to use more data Try to make y axis scale smaller to clearly see two lines.
