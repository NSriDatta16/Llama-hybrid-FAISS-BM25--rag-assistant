Difference between modifying a structure by reference versus other pointers

I am wondering why a structure pointer seems to be behave differently than a char pointer. typedef struct person_struct { char *name; } person; changeStructName(person * name1) { name1->name = "Robert"; } changeCharName(char * name2) { name2 = "Jose"; } int main() { person * name1; char * name2; name1 = malloc(1 * sizeof(person)); changeStructName(name1); changeCharName(name2); printf("First name is %s\n",name1->name); printf("Second name is %s\n",name2); } I know that using this code will work: changeCharName(char ** name2) { *name2 = "Jose"; } changeCharName(&name2); I am just curious why I do not need to do the same pointer to pointer setup to the structure for it to be modified by reference?
