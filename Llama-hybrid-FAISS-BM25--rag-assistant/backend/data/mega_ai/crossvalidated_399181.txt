What is rolling mean and standard deviation in terms of stationarity?

I would like to know what a rolling mean and rolling S.D means in terms of achieving stationairty concerning a time series? I ran an ADF test and it told me my time series was stationary however, by having a rolling mean and rolling S.D on my differences series, despite ADF telling me it’s stationary I DON’T have a constant rolling means or rolling S.D.
