This is a very nice example/application of cGAN, conditional generative adversarial network... you have a dataset made of mouse tracking, so you set as labels initial and final point, and you feed those 2 points to a generator (plus some gaussian noise), and all 3 informations to a discriminator. When the discriminator won't be anymore able to classify the generator outputs, you will have a generator that takes in input start and end fo the mouse track, and outputs a sequence of intermediate points, which you can interpolate though NOTE: you will probably have to look for recurrent cGAN, as you generator outputs a sequence, and the discriminator takes in input a sequence
