I would say decision tree may not learn ratios, but random forest (taking the average from many trees) can definitely learn ratios. In the case you have only two variables, it should be quite easy for random forest to catch Y=X1/X2. In the case where you have many variables, it will be hard to easy which ratio to use, so if you think X1/X2 is useful and meaningful, you should manually add this feature. Remember that tree models (random forest or XGBoost, they have parameters to random pick features, so if that ratio is really useful, it may not be picked by the algorithm simply due to randomness.)
