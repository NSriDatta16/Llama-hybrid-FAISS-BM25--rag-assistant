jQuery draggable outside of browser

Currently, without using jQuery it is possible to drag an image from your browser onto your desktop (firefox, chrome, safari). I'd like to achieve the same thing using jQuery draggable. Currently, if I try dragging a 'draggable' element, the element disappears when it leaves the browser window. Any ideas if this is possible, if so how? Thanks.
