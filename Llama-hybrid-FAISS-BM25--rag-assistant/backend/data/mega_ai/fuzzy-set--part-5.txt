 = ( Supp ⁡ ( A i ) ) i ∈ I {\displaystyle \operatorname {Supp} \circ A=(\operatorname {Supp} (A_{i}))_{i\in I}} is disjoint in the standard sense for families of crisp sets. Independent of the t/s-norm pair, intersection of a disjoint family of fuzzy sets will give ∅ again, while the union has no ambiguity: ⋃ i ∈ I ˙ A i = ⋃ i ∈ I A i {\displaystyle {\dot {\bigcup \limits _{i\in I}}}\,A_{i}=\bigcup _{i\in I}A_{i}} with its membership function given by ∀ x ∈ U : μ ⋃ i ∈ I ˙ A i ( x ) = ∑ i ∈ I μ A i ( x ) {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{{\dot {\bigcup \limits _{i\in I}}}A_{i}}(x)=\sum _{i\in I}\mu _{A_{i}}(x)} Again only one of the summands is greater than zero. For disjoint families of fuzzy sets A = ( A i ) i ∈ I {\displaystyle A=(A_{i})_{i\in I}} the following holds true: Supp ⁡ ( ⋃ i ∈ I ˙ A i ) = ⋃ i ∈ I Supp ⁡ ( A i ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Supp} \left({\dot {\bigcup \limits _{i\in I}}}\,A_{i}\right)=\bigcup \limits _{i\in I}\operatorname {Supp} (A_{i})} Scalar cardinality For a fuzzy set A {\displaystyle A} with finite support Supp ⁡ ( A ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Supp} (A)} (i.e. a "finite fuzzy set"), its cardinality (aka scalar cardinality or sigma-count) is given by Card ⁡ ( A ) = sc ⁡ ( A ) = | A | = ∑ x ∈ U μ A ( x ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Card} (A)=\operatorname {sc} (A)=|A|=\sum _{x\in U}\mu _{A}(x)} . In the case that U itself is a finite set, the relative cardinality is given by RelCard ⁡ ( A ) = ‖ A ‖ = sc ⁡ ( A ) / | U | = | A | / | U | {\displaystyle \operatorname {RelCard} (A)=\|A\|=\operatorname {sc} (A)/|U|=|A|/|U|} . This can be generalized for the divisor to be a non-empty fuzzy set: For fuzzy sets A , G {\displaystyle A,G} with G ≠ ∅, we can define the relative cardinality by: RelCard ⁡ ( A , G ) = sc ⁡ ( A | G ) = sc ⁡ ( A ∩ G ) / sc ⁡ ( G ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {RelCard} (A,G)=\operatorname {sc} (A|G)=\operatorname {sc} (A\cap {G})/\operatorname {sc} (G)} , which looks very similar to the expression for conditional probability. Note: sc ⁡ ( G ) > 0 {\displaystyle \operatorname {sc} (G)>0} here. The result may depend on the specific intersection (t-norm) chosen. For G = U {\displaystyle G=U} the result is unambiguous and resembles the prior definition. Distance and similarity For any fuzzy set A {\displaystyle A} the membership function μ A : U → [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \mu _{A}:U\to [0,1]} can be regarded as a family μ A = ( μ A ( x ) ) x ∈ U ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] U {\displaystyle \mu _{A}=(\mu _{A}(x))_{x\in U}\in [0,1]^{U}} . The latter is a metric space with several metrics d {\displaystyle d} known. A metric can be derived from a norm (vector norm) ‖ ‖ {\displaystyle \|\,\|} via d ( α , β ) = ‖ α − β ‖ {\displaystyle d(\alpha ,\beta )=\|\alpha -\beta \|} . For instance, if U {\displaystyle U} is finite, i.e. U = { x 1 , x 2 , . . . x n } {\displaystyle U=\{x_{1},x_{2},...x_{n}\}} , such a metric may be defined by: d ( α , β ) := max { | α ( x i ) − β ( x i ) | : i = 1 , . . . , n } {\displaystyle d(\alpha ,\beta ):=\max\{|\alpha (x_{i})-\beta (x_{i})|:i=1,...,n\}} where α {\displaystyle \alpha } and β {\displaystyle \beta } are sequences of real numbers between 0 and 1. For infinite U {\displaystyle U} , the maximum can be replaced by a supremum. Because fuzzy sets are unambiguously defined by their membership function, this metric can be used to measure distances between fuzzy sets on the same universe: d ( A , B ) := d ( μ A , μ B ) {\displaystyle d(A,B):=d(\mu _{A},\mu _{B})} , which becomes in the above sample: d ( A , B ) = max { | μ A ( x i ) − μ B ( x i ) | : i = 1 , . . . , n } {\displaystyle d(A,B)=\max\{|\mu _{A}(x_{i})-\mu _{B}(x_{i})|:i=1,...,n\}} . Again for infinite U {\displaystyle U} the maximum must be replaced by a supremum. Other distances (like the canonical 2-norm) may diverge, if infinite fuzzy sets are too different, e.g., ∅ {\displaystyle \varnothing } and U {\displaystyle U} . Similarity measures (here denoted by S {\displaystyle S} ) may then be de
