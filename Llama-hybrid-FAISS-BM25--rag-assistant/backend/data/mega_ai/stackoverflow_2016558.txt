I would change your idea from a type of click to a specific mode in the chart. The problem with a special type of click is that there is no affordance for the capability that you want to provide. There is no apparent thing in the user interface that says, "The user is able to add meta-data to data points." Users would only be able to learn about this through trial-and-error or training. Or, perhaps, a note on your app that says, "Ctrl-click to add meta-data." But that is not elegant. A better approach might be to have a mode button. I'm picturing a toolbar. Think about Microsoft Word, where selecting the Highlight tool turns your pointer into a highlighter. In highlight mode, you can click and drag to highlight text. You can then switch to other modes, like the default text mode. Perhaps you should have an "Add Metadata" mode. In general for UI design, if you're trying to do something that seems non-standard, think about how existing products have solved the problem . How does Microsoft Excel let you add information to a data point in a chart, for example? Maybe it doesn't. But are there other products that do?
