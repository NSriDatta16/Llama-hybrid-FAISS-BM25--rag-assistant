Wikitionary defines a "forest" as A dense collection of trees covering a relatively large area. Larger than woods. Therefore, random forests would necessarily be two or more large collections of trees. Perhaps this could be the averaging of random forest fit more than once, using different hyperparameters or data. We also have a new term: when doing exploratory analysis with ntree = small , we have a random wood In case the above is insufficiently pedantic: library(randomForest) random_wood
