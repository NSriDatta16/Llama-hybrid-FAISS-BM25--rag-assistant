For a simpler summary: Logistic regression: The simplest form of Neural Network, that results in decision boundaries that are a straight line Neural Networks: A superset that includes Logistic regression and also other classifiers that can generate more complex decision boundaries. (note: I'm referring to "plain" logistic regression, without the assistance of integral kernels) (reference: deeplearning.ai courses by Andrew Ng, "Logistic regression as a neural network" and "Planar data classification with one hidden layer")
