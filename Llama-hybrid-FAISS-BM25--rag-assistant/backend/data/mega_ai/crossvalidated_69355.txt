Like other hypothesis tests, the Ljung–Box test doesn't tell us the null hypothesis is true, or even likely to be true; but calibrates a test statistic measuring departure from the null hypothesis in a direction of interest by telling us how probable it is that it would exceed (or equal) the value observed under hypothetical repetitions of the experiment or study, if the null hypothesis were true. The L–B test statistic uses the sum of squared sample autocorrelations up to a given lag to investigate autocorrelation in the time series, given a null hypothesis of no autocorrelation at any lag. In your case the spike at $x=500$ gets averaged out in the sample autocorrelations & hardly affects the test statistic at all (check the auto-correlation plot with acf ). This time series isn't white noise because its mean is far from zero (do a $t$-test if you like). † (It's also not Gaussian noise, clearly.) The moral of the story is that there's no single test for every way the null hypothesis can be wrong. Use an outlier test when you want to test for outliers, a location test to test for zero mean, & the L–B test to test for non-zero auto-correlations. † Or if you define white noise as having constant mean, there's no reason to say this time series evidently isn't WN.
