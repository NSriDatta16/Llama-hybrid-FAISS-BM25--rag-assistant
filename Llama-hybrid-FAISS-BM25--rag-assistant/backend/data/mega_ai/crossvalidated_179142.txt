The first term (i): $E[\operatorname{cov}(X,Y|Z)]$ Think of $\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)$ as a function of $Z$. As you examine different values of $Z$, you will correspondingly get a value for $\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)$. The expectation simply averages these different covariances with respect to $Z$. The second term (ii): $\operatorname{cov}([E[X|Z],E[Y|Z])$ Think of $E[X|Z]$ and $E[Y|Z]$ as functions of $Z$. As you examine different values of $Z$, you will correspondingly get a value of $E[X|Z]$ and a value of $E[Y|Z]$ realized simultaneously. Therefore, for every value of $Z$, you will get an $(X, Y)$ coordinate. This term is simply the covariance of all these coordinate points.
