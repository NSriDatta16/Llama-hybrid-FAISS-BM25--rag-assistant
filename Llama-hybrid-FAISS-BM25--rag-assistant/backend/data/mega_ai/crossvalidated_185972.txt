One approach would be to fit a regression model and examine points where the observed values depart from predicted values. A common regression model for time series data with strong periodicity is ARIMA . Given high degree of granularity in your time variable, I suspect an ARIMA model would work very well. These models have been implemented in most statistical packages. Here's an example using R: # load necessary package install.packages('stats') library(stats) # display example data plot(USAccDeaths) points(USAccDeaths) # fit arima model fit quantile(fit$residuals, .9) | fit$residuals This produces the following graph, with unexpected observations highlighted in red:
