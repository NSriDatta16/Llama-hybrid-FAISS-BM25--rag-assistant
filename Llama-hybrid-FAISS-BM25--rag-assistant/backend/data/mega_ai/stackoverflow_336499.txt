After reading http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-13.html#node_sec_12.3 my take is as follows: If mac is a syntax transformer (mac foo (bar baz)) would replace the entire s-expr with the result of the transformation this could result in anything say (SOMETHING) , while (foo mac bar) would replace only mac resulting in (foo SOMETHING bar) . Normally (set! mac 'foo) would signal an error it seems that the transformer can not appear on the left of a set expression, but if mac is a variable transformer (set! mac 'foo) would instead call mac with the whole s-expr. My intuition tells me this would be useful if you start implementing datatypes with macros.
