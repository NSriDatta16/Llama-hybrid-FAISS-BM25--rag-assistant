I'd never used Eclipse or Java but just followed the official google android developer information to install and set up Eclipse with the extra plugins for Android and then just compilied the Hello World. I then downloaded the code for an existing app that was close to what I wanted to try out (speed alerts using database of signs and built in GPS) and began modifying it. Basic Java syntax is similiar to C - all you need to do is then understand all the OOP bits :) I then decided I needed a program to do something so I decided to write that as a standard Java (non-android) app to get more into understanding Java. I used this tutorial for that - it might be a bit slow for you :) regards Simon
