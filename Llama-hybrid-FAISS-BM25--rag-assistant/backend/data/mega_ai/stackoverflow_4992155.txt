Personaly we use VS 2010 Premium with TFS 2010 and it works very well for us. This answer is based on the assumption that your not looking to VSTS because you believe it is prohibitvley expensive. Whilst this used to be the case in the VS 2008 era is is no longer a tool for the rich only, and its intallation and maintenance is much simpler too boot. Assuming your using VS as your IDE and further assuming you get this via an MSDN subscription then I would strongly recommend you consider TFS 2010 as an ALM tool (its free with the Visual Studio Pro with MSDN subscription). VS 2010 with TFS 2010 gets you the source control, unit testing, automated build, work item tracking (bugs, user stories, etc...) for any VS verion from Pro upwards. If you can affort to push the boat out (add about £900 per developer) for the Premium edition you get code coverage, coded UI tests, code metrics, code contracts and a number of other handy tools. If you have a big budget (add about £2500 per dev) then the Ultimate version brings a huge swath of testing and test lab managment tools as well.
