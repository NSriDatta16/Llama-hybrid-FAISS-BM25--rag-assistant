To turn a list-of-lists into a single list containing the elements of every sub-list, you want apply concat as nickik suggests. However, there's usually a better solution: don't produce the list-of-lists to begin with! For example, let's imagine you have a function called get-names-for which takes a symbol and returns a list of all the cool things you could call that symbol: (get-names-for '+) => (plus add cross junction) If you want to get all the names for some list of symbols, you might try (map get-names-for '[+ /]) => ((plus add cross junction) (slash divide stroke)) But this leads to the problem you were having. You could glue them together with an apply concat , but better would be to use mapcat instead of map to begin with: (mapcat get-names-for '[+ /]) => (plus add cross junction slash divide stroke)
