When I do the following, it simply fires the function: ip.onblur = stopCalcUpInt(this,10); When I do the following, I have success: ip.onblur = function onblur(event){stopCalcUpInt(this,10);} Unfortunately, the whole point of this is to be able to dynamically set the second parameter for stopCalcUpInt().
