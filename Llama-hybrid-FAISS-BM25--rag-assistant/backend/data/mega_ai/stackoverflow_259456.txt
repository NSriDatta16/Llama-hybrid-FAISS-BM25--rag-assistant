How to Use Same Models in Different Modules in Zend Framework?

I am working on implementing Zend Framework within an existing project that has a public marketing area, a private members area, an administration site, and a marketing campaign management site. Currently these are poorly organized with the controller scripts for the marketing area and the members area all being under the root of the site and then a separate folder for admin and another folder for the marketing campaign site. In implementing the Zend Framework, I would like to create be able to split the controllers and views into modules (one for the members area, one for the public marketing area, one for the admin site, and one for the marketing campaign admin site) but I need to be able to point each module to the same model's since all three components work on the same database and on the same business objects. However, I haven't been able to find any information on how to do this in the documentation. Can anyone help with either a link on how to do this or some simple instructions on how to accomplish it?
