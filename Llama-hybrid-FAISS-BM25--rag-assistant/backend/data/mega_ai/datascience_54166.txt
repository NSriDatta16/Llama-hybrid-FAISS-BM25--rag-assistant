I have a word2vec embedding - now what?

I've always relied on the Keras embedding layer for my NLP work. But for my latest project I want to use a custom embedding layer. I have gone through the steps to create a word2vec file but now what? Can someone provide an example of how I can replace the Keras embedding layer with my own layer when constructing a model?
