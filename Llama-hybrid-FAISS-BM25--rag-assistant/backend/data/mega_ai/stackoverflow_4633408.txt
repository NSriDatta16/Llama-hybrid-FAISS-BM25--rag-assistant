Ronnis, Foo, you're right. It really works. :-) The thing I was doing wrong was putting "0" for the first parent via my PHP application. Of course, if I put "0" (there's no parent with the id "0"), then I'm violating the foreign key rules. So, all I had to do was to edit my INSERT statement a little bit. Thank you a lot for bringing this to my attention. Thanks everybody!
