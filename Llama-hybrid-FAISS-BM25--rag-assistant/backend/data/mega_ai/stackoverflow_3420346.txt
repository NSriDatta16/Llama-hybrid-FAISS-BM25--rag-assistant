I have actually found something that will work in both UTF-8 and cp1252 encoding (so that it will pass most (all?) text editors): the non breaking space! Registered at position 160 (00A0, 10100000) in cp1252 and apparently UTF-8 (wikipedia notes it in the range of "Second, third, or fourth byte of a multi-byte sequence"), it provides a character that will "just work" Note : This has been tested to work on windows when copied out of a text file/skype into code editor. A Wordpress web page did not fare so well (but then it probably changed the character anyhow). Thankfully, our organisation did not pursue the "problems" pre-interview tactic, so I have not tested this definitively on a web page.
