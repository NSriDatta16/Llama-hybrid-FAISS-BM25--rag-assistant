The problem is $view->getViewArray()['title'] . PHP doesn't support this yet ( it will be included in the next PHP version .) For now you need to create a temporary variable: getViewArray(); echo htmlspecialchars($data['title']); ?> (But maybe you shouldn't put that in one line, it's hard to read. Maybe put a $viewData = $view->getViewArray() at the top of that script ;) Another way (which is way more elegant) is to implement the ArrayAccess interface in the class, so you could directly use $view['title'] . Or, alternatively, if you prefer using object access over array access you could implement the magic __get method (and __set , __unset and __isset methods, if you need them.)
