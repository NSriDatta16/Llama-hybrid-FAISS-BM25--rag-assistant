You don't require a loop. Even if a loop is used, always same value gets printed. WHY ? The program has 10 instances of BankAccount , meaning each having it's own copy of class members. const int MAX_ACCOUNTS = 10; const int MONTHS_IN_YEAR = 12; // Both of these declared global And in main() , if you need to display all the accounts information - for(int i = 0; i And if in the BankAccount::ComputeInterest() , need to display the account information - void BankAccount::ComputeInterest() { // ...... std::cout BankAccount::ComputeInterest() doesn't take any argument that has reference to other instances. So, it has object information on which it is called only. And the program can be even better organized. There are unnecessary repetitions of variables ( i.e., MAX_ACCOUNTS etc.,) And double BankAccount::enterAccountData(int number, double balance) return type is double . double BankAccount::enterAccountData(int number, double balance) { // .... return balance,number; } return can never return more than one value. The last most variable's value is returned. So, number is only returned.
