Optimal sampling strategy for EFA, CFA and SEM

I'm wondering what should be the optimal sampling strategy for my dissertation research. I have four data sources (two open source software projects meta-repositories and two global startup databases). I'd like to perform EFA to discover (or, rather, confirm my theory-based assumptions) the factor structure of the study's constructs. Then I plan to perform CFA to determine validity and reliability of the measurement model. Finally, I plan to perform SEM analysis to test the study's structural model and hypotheses. Having said that, I plan to perform data analysis (at least, SEM - not sure about EFA/CFA) on two data sets: pilot and main. I believe that pilot analysis will allow me to modify model, if fit indices will be inadequate. Then I plan to perform main SEM analysis of the modified model (and, possibly, alternative models) on the main data set. In addition, I plan to perform both covariance-based (CB) and partial least squares (PLS) SEM analysis to compare them for my study. What should be the optimal approach and its steps in terms of the following: Sampling technique. I was thinking about randomized sampling of data from each OSS meta-repo or from a merged data set; then selecting corresponding data from startup databases. Strategy on dividing the sample data set into pilot and main data sets. Any special steps for sampling due to multiple methods (EFA/CFA/SEM). Any special steps for sampling due to alternative models. Any special steps for sampling due to analyzing via both CB-SEM and PLS-SEM. Bonus question: :-) I plan my study as cross-sectional, but the data in meta-repositories do not exist for exactly the same time frames. For example, data from seven OSS repositories are within range from September 2012 to December 2013. I think that for OSS world the variance within projects' characteristics should not be dramatic, as OSS ecosystem is not very dynamic on average. The question is whether using this semi-cross-sectional approach will allow me to retain statistical validity and what statistical tests exist to confirm that? You help and advice on this is greatly appreciated!
