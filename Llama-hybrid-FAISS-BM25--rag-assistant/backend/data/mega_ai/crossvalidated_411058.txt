cov.reduce only affects how numeric predictors (in your case, BMI and Age ) are handled. If you don't specify cov.reduce at all (which I recommend, because you don't want to examine these further), predictions are made at the averages of those predictors. So cov.reduce is not an issue in your analysis at all, in my opinion. If you will look at the "basics" vignette -- vignette("basics") or on the CRAN page , you will read that estimates are based on a regular grid (called the reference grid ) consisting of all possible combinations of the levels of the factors. If more than one value of any covariate is specified, then those come into play too; but we're not doing that; so in your example, we get a grid with 16 nodes, 8 conditions and 2 sexes. If you ask for EMMs for Condition , then Sex is averaged over. Your model has only linear terms forf BMI and Age , so holding values of those predictors fixed, the predictions for Condition and Age will be exactly the same relative to one another -- they'll just be shifted up or down by a fixed amount, the same at all 16 nodes of the grid. So you don't need to account for any more than the means of those variables. One concern I'll mention, though, is if the model is adequate. Have you tried fitting a model with the interaction of Condition and Age ? And have you looked at residual plots? It's important to have the model right before going into emmeans or other post hoc analyses. I invite you to read some of the vignettes associated with the package. There is also an index of topics.
