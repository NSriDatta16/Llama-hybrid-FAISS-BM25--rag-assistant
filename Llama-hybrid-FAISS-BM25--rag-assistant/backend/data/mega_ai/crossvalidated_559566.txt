"My confusion lies in the fact that a new regression equation (hence a new model) is estimated each time a data point is dropped" This usually isn't the case, at least for standard [ridge-] regression models; you don't actually create a new model each time, but instead can work out what the output of that model would be by looking at the "hat matrix" $\matrix{H} = \matrix{X}[\matrix{X}^T\matrix{X}]^{-1}\matrix{X}^T$ You can think of the hat matrix as providing information about the stability of the model to each datapoint (" leverage "), so you can view this as being a representation of the quality of the model. If the model is highly sensitive to the particular sample of data to which it has been fitted (points have high leverage), it's PRESS statistic will be much higher than the resubstitution MSE (the MSE on the training data). However, cross-validation (including PRESS) is best thought of as a means of evaluating the performance of a method of constructing a model, rather than directly of the model itself. So PRESS is an estimate of the generalisation performance of a model trained using that procedure on the entire dataset.
