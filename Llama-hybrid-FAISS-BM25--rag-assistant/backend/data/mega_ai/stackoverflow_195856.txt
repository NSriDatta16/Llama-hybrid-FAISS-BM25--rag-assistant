Writing Quality Tests

We know that code coverage is a poor metric to use when gauging the quality of test code. We also know that testing the language/framework is a waste of time. On the other hand, what metrics can we use to identify quality tests? Are there any best practices or rules of thumbs that you've learned to help you identify and write higher quality tests?
