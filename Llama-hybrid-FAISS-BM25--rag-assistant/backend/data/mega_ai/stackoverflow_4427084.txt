To find out which image has to be touch ,use touchBegan method: Note: First of all you need to confirm about image view should be userIntrectionEnabled=YES; Now use this method: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event{ // get touch event UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint touchLocation = [touch locationInView:self.view]; if ([touch view].tag == 800) { //if image tag mated then perform this action } } You can use switch statement inside touchBegan .
