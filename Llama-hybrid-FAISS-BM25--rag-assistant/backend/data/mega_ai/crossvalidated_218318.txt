I don't know whether standard errors or confidence intervals are more liable to misinterpretation & suspect there's not much in it. If pairwise differences in parameter estimates are of particular interest you should report them together with their SEs/CIs, & thus forestall readers' drawing wrong conclusions from overlapping, or non-overlapping, SEs/CIs of individual parameter estimates. Reporting CIs is usually preferable for estimates whose sampling distribution is highly skewed: reporting SEs is rather an invitation to imagine a corresponding (symmetric) normal confidence distribution around the point estimate; & the intervals implied, as well as having incorrect coverage, will do a poor job of separating parameter values better supported by the observed data from those worse supported. (When the sampling distribution is not skewed, but otherwise not well approximated by the normal, e.g. a Student's t distribution with few degrees of freedom, incorrect coverage is usually the only concern.)
