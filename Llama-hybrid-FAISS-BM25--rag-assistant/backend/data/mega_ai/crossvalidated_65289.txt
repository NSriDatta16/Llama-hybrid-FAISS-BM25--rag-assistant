Your distinction sounds reasonable. There was a similar discussion at the analyticbridge website, where several people make various distinctions but none of them seem to agree. The closest one was, "Forecasting would be a subset of prediction. Any time you predict into the future it is a forecast. All forecasts are predictions, but not all predictions are forecasts, as when you would use regression to explain the relationship between two variables." So as you say, "forecast" implies time series and future, while "prediction" does not. Note that there is also a term "projection" which is distinct from forecast or prediction, in some disciplines.
