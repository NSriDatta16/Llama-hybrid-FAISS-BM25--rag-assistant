How to enable JMX on Weblogic 10.x

I have an application that is JMX enabled. It has its own JMX Agent and some MBeans. When I launch the application in WebLogic, I am able to connect to the JMX agent via the RMI url and perform the operations on MBeans via " JConsole ". But when I get into the Weblogic console, I can not see any JMX consoles! How can I enable the JMX console in Weblogic ?
