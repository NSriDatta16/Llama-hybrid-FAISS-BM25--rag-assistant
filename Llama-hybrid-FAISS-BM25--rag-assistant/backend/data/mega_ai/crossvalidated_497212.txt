Bayesian factor BF10 and normal distribution

IÂ´m trying to understand whether it is possible to use Bayesian Factors for contrasting data whose distribution is not normal. Should I apply any correction, or BF10 does not care about the distribution of the data? My data are reaction time (RT) data, collected by the same group in 4 different conditions. I want to check if comparing the 4 conditions (A vs B, B vs C, C vs D) H0 is more likely than H1, H1 being that the means are significantly different.
