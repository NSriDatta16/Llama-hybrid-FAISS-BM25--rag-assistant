Build a model to classify given string/text input

I need to build ML/NN model to classify/predict a given string pattern. Sample training data looks as shown in the image. Input will be the string in the column "Id Number", i need to tell to which class it belongs to in column "Id Type". How do i move forward in building a model for text classification? How to convert string to digit for using embedding in keras?
