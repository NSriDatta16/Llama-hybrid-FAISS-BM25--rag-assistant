Embedding google maps - how to eliminate unwanted marker?

If I embed a google map with the following (this is the src attribute on an iframe): http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.421770,-122.08448&output=embed There are two markers on the map - one with the lat/long I passed in (the green arrow), and a second regular marker. Is there a way to eliminate the 2nd marker?
