The analysis is not a case-control analysis, but neither is it exactly a retrospective cohort study. I am in a very similar situation with a study I have in hand and I will try to explain my thoughts on the subject. The point is that the distribution of your outcome is not the real one in the population, and that makes your estimators may be biased. I understand that the first idea is to think that this does not have to be true, since the only thing we know for sure is that the distribution of your exposure, brain cancer , is not the one in the general population, as cases are over represented. The truth is that if we assume that there really is a relationship between brain cancer and the outcome, school grades , by taking a subset of the population that has a different distribution in the brain cancer variable, the distribution of school grades will not be the real one either, therefore your population is not representative, since you are over representing the population with bad grades. If I understood correctly, you took 5 controls randomly from all the children free of brain cancer of the same age, sex and residency. If this is the case I believe the best option for you is to use a Weighted Logistic Regression , i.e., to do a logistic regression but using inverse probability weighting to balance the sample. The general idea is to use a weight on each observation. For the brain cancer cases this weight would be $1$ , as you have observed all. For people without brain cancer this weight will be $1/p_i$ with $p_i$ being the probability of the subject $i$ of having been selected for the study. This $p_i$ could be easily calculated using the matching variables if you have the real population information. For example, imagine that you had $1$ case from residency $X$ who was $10$ years old and who is a male. You have taken $5$ controls with these characteristics. Imagine that the real population with these characteristics is $2000$ children. To each of these $5$ controls you would have to put a weight of $2000/5 = 400$ , and to your control $1$ . Weighting all your controls would solve your problem, since you would have a "complete cohort". In this Chapter of the book Modeling Binary Correlated Responses using SAS, SPSS and R you can find more information about Weighted Logistic Regression . Another reference that could help you is Logistic Regression in Rare Events Data by King, G., & Zeng, L. (2001). Find it here .
