Nonlinear forecasting

I'm working with time series data (which fluctuates constantly) and currently have 27 data points to forecast with. Would anyone be able to recommend a nonlinear forecasting method using formulas to help me predict the next 12 months? I have looked at y=(c*LN(x))+b where c = =INDEX(LINEST(known_y's,LN(known_x's)),1) and b = =INDEX(LINEST(known_y's,LN(known_x's)),1,2) - Is this method appropriate? It seems to produce a linear forecast which I don't think is correct. Also, what validation methods can I use to ensure my forecast is reliable?
