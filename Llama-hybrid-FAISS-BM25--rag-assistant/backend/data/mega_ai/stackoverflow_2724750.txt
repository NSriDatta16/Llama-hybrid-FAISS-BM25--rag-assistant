iPhone dev: Recurse all project resoureces and collect paths

I have a bunch of HTML resources in my app organized in a hierarchy like so: dirA |---> index.html |---> a1.html |---> a2.html |---> dirB |---> b1.html |---> b2.html |---> dirC |---> c5.html |---> c19.html I'm trying to collect the absolute paths of all HTML resources however deep down, but can't seem to figure out how. So far I've tried: NSArray myPaths = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathsForResourcesOfType:@"html" inDirectory:nil]; This returns an empty array, because I have no HTML files at the root of my project. Then there is: NSArray myPaths = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathsForResourcesOfType:@"html" inDirectory:@"dirA"]; This returns an array containing only the paths for the three HTML resources directly below dirA. If I read the doc correctly, I guess this is to be expected; pathsForResourcesOfType does not traverse subdirectories. But is there a (preferably nice) way to do it?
