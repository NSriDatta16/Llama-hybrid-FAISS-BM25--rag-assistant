I'm not 100% sure I know what you mean by the levels: according to the usual way I've seen this terminology used, level 1 would be "above" level 2, meaning the level of the whole population, so I'm not sure how we can have a "level-1 predictor". Anyway, I'm not sure I need to know, since you can set the fixed effects however you like within newdata . I think the answer to your question is in the help: ReForm: formula for random effects to condition on. If ‘NULL’, include all random effects; if ‘NA’ or ‘~0’, include no random effects so ReForm=NA gives population-level predictions (i.e. predictions based on not knowing what ID is being predicted); since you have only a single random effect, using either ReForm=~ID or ReForm=NULL will give predictions conditional on specified ID s. (I see you have set allow.new.levels=TRUE ; I'm not sure how that will work with predicting at the ID level ...) With the development version of lme4 : d (I'm not sure, but the capitalization of ReForm may have changed in the development version -- be careful.) update : OK, you want to know the average probability of a student at school $j$ repeating a class. I think your approach is reasonable (the answer should be similar to the observed value, although in general it should be a shrinkage estimator [i.e. closer to the overall average). You might also want to consider calculating the probability that an average student at school $j$ would repeat, in which case you would first average the predictors ...
