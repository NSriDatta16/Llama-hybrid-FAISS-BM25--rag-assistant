It is a little bit hard to answer withouth further information : why would you like to impose box constraints after the PCA ? Did you impose them before the PCA or is it something you observed in the data ? Indeed, there is no guarantee that the output of the PCA (i.e. the coordinates of the points on the principal axis) will follow the initial box constraints. So you will have to rescale the output of your PCA to match the box constraints, just as you would do (did?) it before the PCA.
