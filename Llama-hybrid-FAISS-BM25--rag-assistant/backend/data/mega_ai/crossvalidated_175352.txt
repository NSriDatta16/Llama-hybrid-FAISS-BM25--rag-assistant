Time offsets can usually be viewed as your model estimating the rate an event occurs per unit time, with the offset controlling for how long you observed different subjects. In poisson models you are always estimating a rate that something happens, but you never get to observe this rate directly. You do get to observe the number of times that an event happens over some amount of time. The offset makes the connection between the two concepts. For example, you observed subjects shooting baskets for varying amounts of time, and you counted the number of successful baskets for each subject. What you are really interested in in how often each subject sinks a basket, i.e. the number of successful baskets each subject expects to sink each minute, as that is a somewhat objective measure of their skill. The number of baskets you actually observed sunk would then be this estimated rate times how long you observed the subject attempting. So you can think in terms of the units of the response, the number of baskets per minute . Its difficult to think of a situation where you would use time observed as a covariate in a poisson regression, since by its very nature you are estimating a rate. For example, if I want to asses the effect of being american vs european (very silly example) on the number of basket, adding time as a covariate would allow me to assess that effect "independently" from the time passed shoting, isn't it? Furthermore it would also give me an estimate of the effect of time on the outcome. Here's an example that hopefully highlights the danger of this. Assume that Americans and Europeans, in truth, sink the same number of baskets each minute. But say that we have observed each European for twice as long as each American, so, on average, we have observed twice as many baskets for each European. If we set up a model including parameters for both time observed and an indicator for "is European", then both of these models explain the data: $$ E(\text{baskets}) = 2 c t + 0 x_{\text{Eropean}}$$ $$ E(\text{baskets}) = 0 t + 2 c x_{\text{Eropean}} $$ (where $c$ is some constant, which is the true rate that both types of players make baskets). As a statistician, we really want, in this situation, our model to inform us that there is no statistical difference between the rate that Europeans make baskets and the rate Americans make baskets. But our model has failed to do so, and we are left confused. The issue is that we know something that our model does not know. That is, we know that if we observe the same individual for twice as much time, that, in expectation, they will make twice as many baskets. Since we know this, we need to tell our model about it. This is what the offset accomplishes. Maybe using the offset method is appropriate when we know that the events happen uniformily along time! Yes, but this is an assumption of the poisson model itself . From the wikipedia page on the poisson distribution the Poisson distribution, named after French mathematician Sim√©on Denis Poisson, is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time and/or space if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event .
