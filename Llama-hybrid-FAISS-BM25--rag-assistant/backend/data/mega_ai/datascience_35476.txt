Inference of root mean square value in terms of house prediction

The objective of the task is to predict the housing prices. A model is created based on California housing dataset to predict housing prices and is subjected to evaluation using the below code. from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error housing_predictions = lin_reg.predict(housing_prepared) error = mean_squared_error(housing_labels,housing_predictions) rmse = np.sqrt(error) --> prediction error // value I got for rmse was - 68628.1981 The average housing prices range from 120,000 - 265,000. But the rmse value is 68628.1981. Questions By looking at rmse value, What should I infer?. I know the model is underfitting. I wanted to know the intuition behind the rmse value.
