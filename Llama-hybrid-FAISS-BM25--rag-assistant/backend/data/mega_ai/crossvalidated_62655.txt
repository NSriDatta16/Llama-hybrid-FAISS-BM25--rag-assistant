Comparing different step functions

I measured the appearance of certain events over time in different conditions and I would like to know whether there is a difference between the happening of these events. I thought of plotting the events as cumulative curves, such as: # The times at which events occurr times.1 This gives me this nice graph: How would analyse whether there are differences between the two conditions, knowing that I have 5-10 measurements for each group? Also, I would like to represent an average curve for each condition, but the events do not always happen at the same time, so I find myself a little bit stuck as I cannot think of some sensible way of "averaging" discrete non uniform data. I am interested both in changes in the number of events and in the timing (e.g.: a certain condition may reach the same number of events but slower than the other)
