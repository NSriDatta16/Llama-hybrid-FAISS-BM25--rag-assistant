You should write it like this: class Foo(object): @classmethod def func1(cls, x): print x def func2(self, afunc=None): if afunc is None: afunc = self.func1 afunc(4) Though it would be helpful if you gave a little more info on what you are trying to do. There is probably a more elegant way to do this without classmethods.
