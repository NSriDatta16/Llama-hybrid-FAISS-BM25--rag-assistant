We're using Visual Studio 2010 for application and database development. We have tried having the database as a project within the application solution and having independent solutions. We ended up keeping them separated. We deploy the database to our development environments directly from visual studio using the "Deploy Solution" option. The database project properties has "Create a deployment script (.sql) and deploy to the database" option on the Deploy tab. This will deploy the database to which ever environment is configured. It's a manual step. When the database project is part of the solution with application project(s) it gets deployed as part of the rest of the project. The real work was in getting continuous integration working so that any time either project has a check-in they will be built, tested and deployed to the CI environment. We decided to go ahead and unit test our stored procedures in the database project. The build agent calls the command line vsdbcmd with our particular set of parameters to deploy the databse to the CI environment.
