Since I don't have enough points to comment yet, I'm going to post this as an answer. Regression with nonlinear functions are performed all the time! In Bishop's pattern recognition book, he talks about them as "basis" functions. This is a common way of talking about them, such as in this tutorial . Also, in a more machine-learning/engineering-for-results perspective as opposed to a theoretically-justified perspective, basis functions are just feature engineering on your data. Feature engineering is a major cornerstone of machine learning. In fact, intelligent features will often take the cake in competitions, rather than better algorithms.
