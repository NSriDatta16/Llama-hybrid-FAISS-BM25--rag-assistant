How to project a new vector onto PCA space?

After performing principal component analysis (PCA), I want to project a new vector onto PCA space (i.e. find its coordinates in the PCA coordinate system). I have calculated PCA in R language using prcomp . Now I should be able to multiply my vector by the PCA rotation matrix. Should principal components in this matrix be arranged in rows or columns?
