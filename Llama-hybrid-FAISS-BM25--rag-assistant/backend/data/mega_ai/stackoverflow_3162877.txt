The PIN does expire under OAuth 1.0a . Using the verification code returned requires use of the temporary request token in the initial authorization request. OAuth 2.0 defines more flows - one of which uses a direct login/password mechanism. It's up to Twitter to determine which flows they decide to implement. You can also embed a user-agent in the app. Desktop apps suffered from a really bad user-experience with OAuth 1.0 which led to 2.0. It's doable, but painful. You can request XAuth access if you need to from Twitter as well. It's almost the same as basic auth.
