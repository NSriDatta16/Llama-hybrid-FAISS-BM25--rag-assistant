What you are proposing to do is similar to walking into a Ferrari showroom and asking to buy a new car, and then promptly throwing the engine out and replacing it with an old heap from a 10 year old banger with 100,000 miles on the clock. This is (in my opinion) further exacerbated by the fact that you seem to prefer creating recordsets in classic ASP to perform a simple update. This practice was discouraged years ago even within classic ASP. Working with Access in ASP.NET is actually quite easy if you forget about the RecordSet concept, and actually get the SQL to use "UPDATE MyTable SET x = etc...". Some clear examples of simple operations using ADO.NET and Access appear here: http://www.mikesdotnetting.com/Article/26/Parameter-Queries-in-ASP.NET-with-MS-Access ASP.NET MVC is a great choice for you, given your background. I urge you to put the little bit of extra effort in to learn ADO.NET and use that too instead of classic ADO. You've put your big toe in the new waters. Time to hold you breath and go in all the way ;o)
