This can be done using Lambert W x F random variables / distributions. A Lambert W x F random variable (RV) is a non-linearly transformed (RV) X with distribution F. For F being the Normal distribution and $\alpha = 1$, they reduce to Tukey's h distribution. The nice property of Lambert W x F distributions is that you can also go back from non-normal to Normal again; i.e., you can estimate parameters and Gaussianize() your data. They are implemented in the Lambert W x F transformations come in 3 flavors: skewed ( type = 's' ) with skewness parameter $\gamma \in R$ heavy-tailed ( type = 'h' ) with tail parameter $\delta \geq 0$ (and optional $\alpha$) skewed and heavy tailed ( type = 'hh' ) with left/right tail parameter $\delta_l, \delta_r \geq 0$ See References on skewed and heavy-tail(s) (Disclaimer: I am the author.) In R you can simulate, estimate, plot, etc. several Lambert W x F distributionswith the LambertW package. library(LambertW) library(RColorBrewer) # several heavy-tail parameters delta.v It works similarly for a sequence of $\gamma$ to add skewness. And if you want to add skewness and heavy-tails then generate a sequence of $\delta_l$ and $\delta_r$.
