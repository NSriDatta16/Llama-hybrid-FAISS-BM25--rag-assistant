I have completed all three so can suggest on this. after completing ML specialization Deep Learning Specialization Deep Learning specialization is better path to explore first because it has some foundation knowledge also for DL models and everything in this course is in Tensorflow so you will be covering many of the knowledge of tensorflow also; taking "Tensorflow Developer Professional Certificate" after that will be easy and fast paced. However you can Jump directly to Tensorflow with Prof. Moroney if your goal is to start doing some experiment in tensorflow quickly.
