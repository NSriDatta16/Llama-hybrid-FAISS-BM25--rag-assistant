Just a quick solution: Supposing your numbers are on the cells A2:A10, put in B10 the following formula: =IF(COUNT(A8:A10)=3,AVERAGE(A8:A10),IF(COUNT(A7:A10)=3,AVERAGE(A7:A10),"too many blanks")) Dragging up the formula you get the moving average If there is the possibility of two consecutive blank you could nest another if, more than that and this solution became too complicated
