If regular code optimization gets you stuck, you could try OpenMP , which is an API for parallel programming made for C and Fortran. There are some instructions you insert in your code before loops, "pre-compiler" style, and it will split heavy loops across different processes. You have several instructions you might want to try. For instance : #pragma omp parallel for /* Loop here */ This is a very complete API, and you can split everything according to a lot of parameters, shared variables and with different parallel splitting techniques. You can also specify the number of processes you want OpenMP to create, number of cores etc. With a bit of tuning you'll end up finding a solution increasing your computation speed.
