SVM gives worse success rate than KNN - Matlab

I am using PCA with a SVM classifier to classify the image. SVMModel = fitcecoc(projectimg', train_label); I have 40 subjects, each with 5 features (= total of 200 images). I therefore have the "train_label" matrix as [1;1;1;1;1;2;2;2;2;2;3;3;3;3;3;4;4;4;4;4;5...40;40;40;40;40] I got the projected images down to a 200 x 200 matrix using the PCA analysis - "projectimg" . I then used the following command to "Train" the SVM classifier: SVMModel = fitcecoc(projectimg', train_label); I then generated the projected test image, - "projtestimg" . I now wanted to classify this test image, so I use the following command: [label score] = predict(SVMModel,projtestimg'); After running this classify for different test images in the data base, I get a success rate of 82.5% compared to 87.5% with the PCA-KNN test. I am not sure what I am doing wrong? I am using the value from the "label" to be used as the classified image. Is this correct? Thanks for your time.
