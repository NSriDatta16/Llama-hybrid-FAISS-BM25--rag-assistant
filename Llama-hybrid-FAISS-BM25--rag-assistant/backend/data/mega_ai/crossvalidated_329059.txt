Rebuild logistic regression model without regularisation sklearn

favorite I built a logistic regression model using sklearn on 80+ features. After regularisation (L1) there were 10 non-zero features left. I want to turn this model into a production model but I don't want to do all the variable modifications I done for the 80+ variables. I took the variables left in from the regularised model, done all the feature transformations (on the 10 variables) and then build a un-regularised logistic regression using sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression(penalty='l2', C = 1e10) . However, I am getting very different coefficients and as a result, the model doesn't perform as well. How can I replicate the original model but without having to recode 80+ variables but just use the ones that were left over after regularisation?
