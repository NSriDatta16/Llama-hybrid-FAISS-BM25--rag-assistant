You have engaged in dichotomania. Categorizing age, education, knowledge, and other continuous or ordinal variables will result in a host of problems. What is the rawest form of your variables? Neither forwards selection nor backward elimination work as advertised, and you did not provide any motivation for the use of variable selection. It doesn't solve any problem for you and creates new problems such as meaningless $P$-values and confidence intervals. There is nothing wrong with having "insignificant" variables in a model. What do you mean by "progressing to binary logistic regression"? Did the $\chi^2$ analysis inform model specification? This would be even worse than forward variable selection.
