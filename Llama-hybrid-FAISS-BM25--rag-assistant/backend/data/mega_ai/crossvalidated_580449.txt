What distinguishes time series data from other types of data is that data are collected over time (e.g. hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) and there is correlation between adjacent observations so the order of the data matters. If you're arbitrarily shuffling time series, you're breaking the correlation structure inherent in the data, and whatever model you fit won't generalize well to your series in the future regardless of how good your error metrics look using an arbitrary split of the data. You may wish to consider validation methods designed for time series, such as time series cross-validation which evaluates your model on a rolling basis: If you're a Python user, you may also wish to consult the documentation for sklearn or prophet ).
