OpenGL + gtkglextmm + glade

when I am programming with "gtkmm", there is a widget "Gtk::DrawingArea" . I can program that widget "by hand" (so write the code) or more elegant way is to use "glade" user interface designer, where I can do the same "graphically" . Now I am trying to connect OpenGL with gtkmm through "gtkglextmm" library. In that library, there is a widget "Gtk::GL::DrawingArea" - but this widget "IS NOT" available in glade. So is there any way to program with "OpenGL + gtkglextmm" using "glade" (for the "graphical user interface" part)? Thanks.
