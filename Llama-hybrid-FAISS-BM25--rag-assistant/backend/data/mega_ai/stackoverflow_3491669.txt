I believe that if the div already has a paragraph tag inside it, and the user presses return while focus is inside that paragraph tag, then Firefox will insert another one. So, if you have this: &nbsp; &nbsp; and you focus, the press return, Firefox will insert a third paragraph. You might be able to get around having the & nbsp ; in the paragraph tags by giving them minimum heights, and you might be able to get away with having only one. I never got to the bottom of the behaviour to my satisfaction the last time I looked at this. You'll probably need some JavaScript to enforce a minimum of one paragraph tag inside the div.
