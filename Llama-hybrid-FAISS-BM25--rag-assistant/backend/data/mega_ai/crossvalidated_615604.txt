This an old question, but I want to add what I think other answers lack. Graphical Models : They describe how a probability distribution over some $N$ variables factorizes using a parent-child relationship. Given parents, the distribution of the random variable is independent of its non-descendants. Example: This graph describes a distribution $f$ over $X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4,X_5,X_6$ which factorizes as, \begin{equation} f(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4,X_5,X_6) = p(X_1)\cdot p(X_3)\cdot p(X_2 | X_1,X_3)\cdot p(X_5| X_1)\cdot p(X_4|X_5,X_3)\cdot p(X_6 | X_1,X_3) \end{equation} Markov Chains : A discrete-time Markov chain defines a sequence of random variables that can take several discrete values called "states." A graph for a Markov chain usually represents how these states evolve into each other. Example: Here a random variable, say $X_0$ can take 4 values $\{A,B,C,D\}$ . Given we know the value $X_0$ takes, we describe a probability distribution over states for the random variable $X_1$ , where the corresponding weighted edges give the probability of each state. However, we can draw a different graph for Markov Chains, one which describes a probability distribution over $\{X_t\}, t\geq 0$ So, the distribution factorizes as \begin{equation} f(X_0,X_1,\dots,X_{t-1},X_t,\dots) = p(X_0)\cdot \prod_{t>0}p(X_t | X_{t-1}) \end{equation}
