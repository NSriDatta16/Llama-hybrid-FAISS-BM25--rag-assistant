How to receive drop events in a wxTextCtrl?

I have a wxTextCtrl-derived class that overrides OnDropFiles. However, dragging something over the control does nothing. (The cursor changes to the 'not allowed' cursor.) I tried DragAcceptFiles(true) but that only enabled the built-in drop handler. (Which just loads the file into the control.) How can I get my own handler to be invoked? I also tried SetDropTarget, but that never got invoked either. It worked in a wxFrame, though. Any ideas?
