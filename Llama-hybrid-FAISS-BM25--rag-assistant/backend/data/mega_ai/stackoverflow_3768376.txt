NSRunLoops in Cocoa?

Let's say I have 2 threads, one is the main thread and another one, a secondary thread. The main thread is being used the most, but sometimes (rarely) I want the secondary thread to do some work based on calls from the main thread. Most of the time the secondary thread should sleep. Now after some searching I understand the way to do this is to use runLoops. So I tried to read apple's docs ( http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/RunLoopManagement/RunLoopManagement.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000057i-CH16-SW5 ) but it looks to me very complex and I'm having some hard time there. Is there an elegant and simple way to achieve what I described? Any similar runLoop code examples out there that I can run and play with? Thanks
