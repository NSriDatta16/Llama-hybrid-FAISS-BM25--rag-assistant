How can I programatically determine which control to use in my EditItemTemplate? (ASP.NET)

In my ASP.NET application, I have a GridView. For a particular field in this GridView, I've added an EditItemTemplate with a DropDownList. However, if the value of the field is "X", then I want to just display a label instead of the DropDownList. So how can I programatically check the field value, then decide which control to display? Here is my EditItemTemplate: '> If the value of Level_ID is "X", then I want to use: '> instead of the DropDownList. I tried embedding an if statement before the DropDownList to check Eval("Level_ID"), but that doesn't seem to work. Any thoughts?
