Whatever kind of resampling (CV or bootstrap) verification/validation scheme you use, when you know or suspect that your data is clustered such as by organization in your case, you need to split at the cluster level, otherwise the clusters create data leaks/lead to dependence. More generally speaking, you need to split so that also the highest-level confounding factors are independent for the splits. In your case this basically means leave one organization out cross validation (or a similar subset of bootstrapped models) due to there being only 3 organizations. So splitting strategy and model setup both follow from the data structure (cl you have/set up. Everything Frank Harrell comments about predicting probabilities and using a proper scoring rule applies - these are modeling decisions/choices which are completely independent of the resampling scheme/data plan for verification.
