Winform memory spike

I have the following issue. I have deployed a smart client application to several users. Memory usage is adequate for all of them except one. For this particular user the memory usage is 2 to 2 1/2 times the usage than for any other user. The desktop specs are the same as for the other users. The computer was defragged not long ago. I was wondering If anyone had any insights on why would this be happening. Any thoughts are appreciated!
