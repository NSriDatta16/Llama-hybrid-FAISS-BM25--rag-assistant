On the USB level, there is no way to differentiate between a conventional Disk on Key and a USB-Floppy. Which means windows itself, cannot tell reliably what is what. There are a few hints that you can gather: Floppies should: a. Have mass-storage protocol CBI/CB b. SCSI UFI BUT, in the world of USB devices, everyone does whatever they want. The only test is: "Does it work on windows". And Windows just checks the size, if its a USB device with removable-media set and with conventional floppy sizes, it will consider it to be a floppy. Can't say about "real" floppy, but with the USB attached, there is no definite way.
