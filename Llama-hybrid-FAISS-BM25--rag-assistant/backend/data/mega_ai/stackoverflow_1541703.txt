You are correct. There are two aspects that you have to handle. First, when someone submits a post, you have a generate a html-friendly URL for adding to each of the links. Realistically, this isn't too hard. You need to replace spaces, special characters, etc. Basically, whatever escaping that you're doing for database storage is a good starting point. You'll also need to make sure these are unique . Second, when someone hits your site with the link, you need to resolve it properly. This one is a bit more complex but can effectively work the same if you think of each uniquely generated URL as an id because that's essentially what it becomes... if you query on it ( escaped of course!). For a solid implementation, most of the CMS's - WordPress and Drupal come to mind - handle this pretty effectively. Coming from a Drupal background, I would suggest that you look at the "path" and "pathauto" modules for how this is done with a focus on "path"... it covers both halves of the problem.
