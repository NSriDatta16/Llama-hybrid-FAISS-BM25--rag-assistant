Understanding confidence interval

I've made a little questionnaire where participants can rate an answer between 1 and 5. I calculated the mean value, the average value and the standard deviation. Now I was asking myself if it is possible to calculated a confidence interval for these results and if yes, if this would tell me anything. So I just tested it and used excel to calculate a 95% confidence interval. Here are the values: Arithmetic average: 4.60 Median: 5.00 Max: 5.00 Min: 3.00 Standard deviation: 0.63 95% Confidence interval: 0.32 But what is this value telling me? I can be sure by 32% that the values aren't random values? Or is a confidence interval for those kinds of questions useless?
