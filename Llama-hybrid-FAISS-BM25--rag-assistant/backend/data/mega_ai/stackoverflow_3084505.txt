drop event doesn't fire

I'm working on a calendar. I have multiple droppables besides each other (upside down). On top of those droppables I have two draggable elements which are also resizable. Each droppable is 25px in height and 200px in width. The first draggable is 60px in height (element 1) and the other (element 2) is 20px in height. My problem is when I drag element 2 over element 1 and drop it between two droppables, the drop event doesn't fire. In all other drag and drop situations it works perfectly, the drop event fires. HTML (snippet off because there are a lot of these droppables): Kl 8:00 Kl 8:15 jQuery (Here I'm creating my appointments (draggables)): appointment1 = $(" Drag "); appointment1.appendTo("#gage1"); appointment2 = $(" Drag "); appointment2.appendTo("#gage2"); And here I have my drop event: $(".droppable").droppable({ drop: function (event, ui) { alert("drop"); } });
