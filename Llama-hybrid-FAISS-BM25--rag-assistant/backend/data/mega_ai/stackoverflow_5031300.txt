I figured it out myself. Using the Sql Server Agent, along with the very cool tablediff.exe utility, I was able to keep the view and table in sync using the upsert/delete statements generated by the tablediff util. It required a temp table and a unique column in the view (which I created by concatenating 2 column ids into one (which I knew would make it unique)). This was a much better solution because I didn't have to truncate the live table or drop it and rename the temp table. Plus it runs in it's own thread/environment so it's ok if it takes a minute to run (vs using a trigger which always needs to be fast). If anyone wants more details let me know and I'll update this article.
