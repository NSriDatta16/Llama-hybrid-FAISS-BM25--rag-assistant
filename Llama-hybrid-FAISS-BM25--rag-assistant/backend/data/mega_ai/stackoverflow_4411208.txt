iPhone - Creating custom objects for Interface Builder?

I am currently subclassing UIView to create custom objects, they work perfectly fine In interface builder i drag and drop a uiview and I set the class name to my custom view, and in runtime the view will populate according to my code. QUESTION: Is it possible to make it so that my custom view DRAWS in interface builder, And maybe drag and drop my custom view ?
