Your model estimate would be a useful prior. I have applied the following approach in LeBauer et al 2013 , and have adapted code from priors_demo.Rmd below. To parameterize this prior using simulation, consider your model $$ \textrm{logLC}_{50} = b_0 X+b_1$$ Assume $b_0 \sim N(0.94, 0.03)$ and $b_1 \sim N(1.33, 0.1)$; $\textrm{Lkow}$ is known (a fixed parameter; for example physical constants are often known very precisely relative to other parameters). In addition, there is some model uncertainty, I'll make this $\epsilon \sim N(0,1)$, but should be an accurate representation of your information, for example the model's RMSE could be used to inform the scale of the standard deviation. I am intentionally making this an 'informative' prior. b0 Now imagine theprior is your prior and thedata is your data: library(ggplot2) ggplot() + geom_density(aes(theprior)) + theme_bw() + geom_rug(aes(thedata)) The easiest way to use the prior is going to be to parameterize a distribution that JAGS will recognize. This can be done in many ways. Since the data don't have to be normal, you might consider finding a distribution using the package fitdistrplus . For simplicity, lets just assume that your prior is N(mean(theprior), sd(theprior)) , or approximately $N(-4.9, 1.04)$. If you want to inflate the variance (to give the data more strength) you could use $N(-4.9, 2)$ Then we can fit a model using JAGS writeLines(con = "mymodel.bug", text = " model{ for(k in 1:length(Y)) { Y[k] ~ dnorm(mu, tau) } # informative prior on mu mu ~ dnorm(-4.9, 0.25) # precision tau = 1/variance # weak prior tau ~ dgamma(0.01, 0.01) sd Finally, a plot: ggplot() + theme_bw() + xlab("mu") + geom_density(aes(theprior), color = "grey") + geom_rug(aes(thedata)) + geom_density(aes(unlist(mcmc.o[,"mu"])), color = "pink") + geom_density(aes(unlist(mcmc.o[,"pred"])), color = "red") And you can consider mu=5.08 to be your estimate of the mean parameter value (pink), and sd = 0.8 its standard deviation; the posterior predictive estimate of the logLC_50 (where you are getting your samples from) is in red.
