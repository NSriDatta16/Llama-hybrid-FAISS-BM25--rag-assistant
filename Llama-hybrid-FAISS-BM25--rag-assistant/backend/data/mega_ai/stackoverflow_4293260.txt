slideToggle jQuery function

i'm trying to display a paragraph of text and then underneath is a "read more" link, when i click the link, more text is supposed to slide down and the text of the link is supposed to read "Read Less", then when they click that, the text is supposed to slide back up and the link text to be "Read More" again.. $('#more').click(function() { $('#the_more').slideToggle("slow", function () { $('#more').html("Read Less"); }); }); Anyone spot any problems?
