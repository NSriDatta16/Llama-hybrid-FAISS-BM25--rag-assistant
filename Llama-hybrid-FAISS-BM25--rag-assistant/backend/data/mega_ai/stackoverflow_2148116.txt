And what does it mean by the parameter root within the File(). Do I need to specify the root path to save the file? if it is the case then how do we specify the root path in android? The code snippet from the question you linked doesn't define the variable, but if the code is downloading a file to the device, I would assume that it's a path on the SD card. Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() will give you the root path to the SD card. You'll also need to specify the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission in your manifest. If you're working on the emulator, you can create a virtual SD card when you create the emulator image.
