Getting synonyms for a word based on context

I want to get synonyms for a word based on it's use in sentence. for example in the sentence I will book the hotel , book is synonymous with reserve but this is not the case in the sentence i was reading a book one way is to check POS of the word in a given sentence but this is not always useful as multiple meanings of a word can share the same POS. The problem of returning both antonyms and synonyms in word embedding would be solved by checking against a list of verified synonyms for the word.
