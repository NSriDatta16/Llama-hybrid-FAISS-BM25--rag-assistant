Optimize rendering in ActionScript 3

I am working on parallax animation(something like - flordearagua.com) which consist 7-10 layers of quite large(1500x800) bitmaps and MovieClips. To archieve parallax, I wrote code to move all layer at different speed which again depends on some parameters like mouse position and acceleration. All upto this working fine. I want to make this animation really smoother. I want to achieve minimum 24 FPS with this. currently I am able to achieve only 15-17 FPS with all optimization I've done. Please note. All component I am using is Library Component. I enabled bitmap catching for some layers but for some I just can't. Enabling bitmap catching for some layers result in jerkiness while performing parallax movement. Please suggest any optimization. Thanks.
