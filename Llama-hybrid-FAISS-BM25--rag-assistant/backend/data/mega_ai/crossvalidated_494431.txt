A short and very simplified literal explanation: Aleatoric: uncertainty about the result of an experiment that we can repeat, e.g. dice roll. What is the probability of rolling a 6? - the view of frequency statistics Epistemic: uncertainty stemming from insufficient knowledge, e.g. one-time experiment (no repeating). What is the probability that - as a result of global warming - the average temperature will be 2 degrees higher in 2050? I hope it helped :-)
