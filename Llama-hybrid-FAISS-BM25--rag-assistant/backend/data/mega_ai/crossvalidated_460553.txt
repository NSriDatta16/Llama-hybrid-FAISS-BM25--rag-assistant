Are the parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ in (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) SIR model probability number? Can they larger than 1.0?

I am learning SIR model from this blog post . We also had a very good discussion in CV post The key parameters of the model are $\beta$ and $\gamma$ , people usually describe them as the "infection rate" and "recover rate". When I do some agent based simulation, I also used some parameter to describe the probability of one person being infected or recovered after unit time. My question is, are they the same thing? i.e., $\beta$ , and $\gamma$ needs to be in the range of 0 to 1.0?, If yes, why I am seeing some one (fitting with covid19 data), and got two parameters ~20? what does that mean? If no, why the two links above use BFGS with bounds 0 to 1?
