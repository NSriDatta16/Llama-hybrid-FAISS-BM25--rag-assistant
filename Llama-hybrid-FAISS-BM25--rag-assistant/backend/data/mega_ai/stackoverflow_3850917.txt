Dropbox API - Dropbox ruby gem (Tim Morgan): How to authorize

I want to write a ruby app for personal use that access my personal dropbox through their API. I'm using Tim Morgan gem 'dropbox' version 1.1.1 What I don't understand is the difference between a developer_key and a consumer_key. The gem docs say that I have to use the consumer_key, but when I registered my app on dropbox.com I received only a developer key secret pair (and that's what I put in Dropbox::Session.new) Anyway the error I get from ruby at every API call is: Dropbox::UnsuccessfulResponseError: HTTP status Net::HTTPBadRequest any idea??
