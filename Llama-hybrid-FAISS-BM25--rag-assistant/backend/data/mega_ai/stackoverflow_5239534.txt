Tooltip adorner

I am using a third party charting library (Infragistics xamChart). I am not satisfied with how tooltips are displayed on a line charts datapoints so I was thinking of using an adorner to make a better looking/interactive tooltip. What I want to do is have the adorner popup whenever one of the datapoints is hovered over. Does anyone have any pointers on how I can do this? Most of the adorner samples I found are pretty simple ones that just alter the entire control they are adorning. My main questions are: Is it possible for an adorner to appear only when certain elements are hovered over (and have it appear at the current cursor position)? Does anyone have a simple sample they can share? Are adorners the right way to go here? I think the only other option was to use the popup control but I though adorners were a nicer solution. Thank you.
