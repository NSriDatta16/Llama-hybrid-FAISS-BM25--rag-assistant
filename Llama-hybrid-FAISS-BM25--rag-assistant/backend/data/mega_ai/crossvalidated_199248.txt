This is an excellent opportunity to bootstrap the regression coefficient. This will get you from A to B more directly than if you were to use cross-validation. Think of bootstrapping as the following: Take a random sample (this could be of transactions or of people: you should make this judgement call after considering both) Estimate the regression coefficient associated with the logistic regression At the end of this process you will have a distribution of beta values. From this you can calculate a confidence/credible interval. Programmatically, this can be accomplished using the boot package in R, or you could merely perform the sampling in a for loop.
