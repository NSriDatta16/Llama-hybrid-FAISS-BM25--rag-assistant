Problem on Normal Distribution

My homework problem is as follows: I start with a string of 0's of length $n$. Then, with probability $p$, I change each bit to 1 identically and independently. After that, I count the number of 1's in the string (which, on average, will be $np$). Let the number of 1's be $P_1$. Continue this process 100 times, get integers $P_1, P_2,\ldots, P_{100}$. I want to estimate maximum in the set $\{P_1, P_2, .., P_{100}\}$.
