This problem is a bit more convoluted than the average list comprehension because of the nested dictionaries. However if you can create the right iterable then a list comprehension is the way to go. Try: tofruits = [ {'name':n, 'color':c} for n,c in zip(fromfruits['names'], fromfruits['colors']) ] Here the zip function is used to produce tuples which match the correct name and color . This is a good way to go here because both are stored in basic lists within the fromfruits dict. These tuples (from zip ) are then unpacked into n and c , which are then used as in a typical list comprehension.
