Using SQLite or MS Access, how should the tables be organized to model the logic of this 3D structure?

Here is an explanation of how the elements are related. tl;dr: Intensity is strongest at the center of the diagram. The basic emotions (in the arms) combine to form secondary emotions in the outer circle. (i.e., Anticipation + Joy = Optimism) What is the best way to design a database to model this set of relationships?
