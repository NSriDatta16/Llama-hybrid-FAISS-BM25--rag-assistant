MVC has a much stronger focus on semantic HTML code and HTML is built for layouts that flow. Well designed and styled controls should not pose a problem, especially with a data driven design. For example look at this site, the main content is any number of answers to a question (with and without comments), the question itself, ads, buttons, etc. Also consider sites like iGoogle that let you layout the page dynamically (really you are switching the order and containers of elements in a flow layout). Future Drag and Drop and other Eye candy can be implemented with CSS, JavaScript and JQuery or other Web2.0/Ajax UI/UX frameworks. To put it simply, ASP.net MVC was designed to fill this kind of need; dynamic, data driven web apps that don't benefit from replicating WinForms on the Web.
