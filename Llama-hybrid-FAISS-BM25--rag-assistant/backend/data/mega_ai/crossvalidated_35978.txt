In the libsvm FAQ is mentioned that the labels used "inside" the algorithm can be different from yours. This will sometimes reverse the sign of the "coefs" of the model. For instance, if you had labels $y=[-1,+1,+1,-1,...]$, then the first label in $y$, which is "-1", will be classified as $+1$ for running libsvm and, obviously, your "+1" will be classified as $-1$ inside the algorithm. And recall that the coefs in the returned svm model are indeed $\alpha_n\,y_n$ and so your calculated $w$ vector will be affected due to reversion of the sign of the $y$'s. See the question "Why the sign of predicted labels and decision values are sometimes reversed?" here .
