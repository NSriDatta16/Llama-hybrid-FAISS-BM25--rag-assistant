Organising dates in PHP

Im wanting to organize a series of dates in the following format. As a bit of context, the dates are the dates of upcoming events that can be added by my users. The format: January 2011 date - event date - event date - event February 2011 date - event date - event date - event with all events in a given month, arranged by the date on which they occur. All of my event dates are stored in my database as unix timestamps. Problem is, i dotn know where id start to develop a function that would order all of my events in this way. Can anyone help me out? Cheers
