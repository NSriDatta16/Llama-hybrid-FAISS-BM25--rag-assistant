You will find that the size of your structure changes based on compiler optimization settings. I'd predict anywhere between 2 and 12 bytes for this structure. Even when using bit-fields like you do, you can't always predict what the size of a struct is going to be. The compiler may have every bit-field take up the full space of an int, or possibly just the 1 or 4 bits that you specify. Using bit-fields, while it is great on memory storage space, is often bad for running time and executable size.
