If you have only some zeros and frequent high counts, then you may be able to use models for continuous data, even though your data are count. For instance, consider ARIMAX or regression with ARIMA errors ( the two are not the same ). Best approach for count prediction in time-series? is related. However, I essentially write that I have not seen any count data models that include autoregression or similar "TS" structure. You may be able to "roll your own" negative binomial regression model with a mean that depends both on predictors and autoregressively on previous values. Negative Binomial Regression by Hilbe might be useful, but he doesn't consider time series models. Shameless self-promotion: I wrote a little article ( Kolassa, 2016, IJF ) on forecasting sales count data with regressors which may be useful. However, for all the reasons above, I didn't model any autoregression. Then again, it's probably not necessary for my application, which is supermarkets and drug stores that serve a couple thousand households - even if each household has an autoregressive demand for toilet paper, I would expect the autoregression to disappear in the aggregate data generating process. Your problem may be similar, or different. Finally, if you are unsatisfied with the quality of your predictions, How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? may be helpful.
