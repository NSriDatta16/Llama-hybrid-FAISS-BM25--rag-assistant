TinyMCE and Viewstate verification failed. Reason: Viewstate was invalid

Visual Studio 2008 .NET 3.5 I'm using the built in web server to test, and everything works fine. My TinyMCE code is the following: tinyMCE.init({ // General options mode: "textareas", theme: "advanced", plugins: "paste", relative_urls: false, remove_script_host: false, // Theme options theme_advanced_buttons1: "bold,italic,link,unlink,image", theme_advanced_buttons2: "", theme_advanced_buttons3: "", theme_advanced_toolbar_location: "top", theme_advanced_toolbar_align: "left", theme_advanced_statusbar_location: "bottom", theme_advanced_resizing: false, // Example word content CSS (should be your site CSS) this one removes paragraph margins content_css: "includes/tinyMCEword.css", // Drop lists for link/image/media/template dialogs external_image_list_url: "lists/image_list.js" }); Now, the issue I'm having, is on any pages that I have this code, I'll intermittently get ViewState errors, namely: Event code: 4009 Event message: Viewstate verification failed. Reason: Viewstate was invalid. I noticed when this happens, on top of my page, it looks like I have ViewState data (encrypted) being outputted. Only on pages with TinyMCE. I have no idea why it's occuring. Everything works perfectly fine locally, but when deployed to a Win2K3 server (IIS6), I'm getting this issue. I really am lost. Any ideas fellas? Thanks, -Steve
