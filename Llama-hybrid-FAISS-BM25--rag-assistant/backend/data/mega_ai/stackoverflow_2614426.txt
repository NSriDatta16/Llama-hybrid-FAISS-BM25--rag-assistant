drawRect : is for custom drawing. You won't often need to do that. Your button won't be drawn until it gets sent drawRect :, probably in the next iteration of the run loop (ie, when you click on the view). If you want a button on your view, either drag it there using IB, or move the code from drawRect: to viewDidLoad . You present a modal view from a view controller by: [self presentModalViewController:viewController animated:YES]; Do this in the action method your button sends to your view controller. This should indicate to you that you need to take a look at your application design.
