Can reinforcement learning directly work with advantage function?

When we are at a state s , we only need to determine the relative performance among different actions in order to choose the optimal action. In other words, we only need the advantage function A(s, a) that describes the relative future reward for these actions, instead of the Q-function Q(s, a) . Then is it possible to write Q-learning in such a way that it only involves the advantage function? By reading the paper on double DQN my impression is we need to compute both advantage function A(s, a) and value function V(s) explicitly instead of just the advantage function, but I don't see why that is the case.
