I would recommend consolidating your images in a single root level directory. If you want to organize them under that then you can add subfolders. If you really need to keep the image sin the individual folders youre including from then you can always symlink those folders into the top level images folder. This way you can always use absolute URLs to reference images, js, css. The other way would be to write a helper function you can call that will determine the proper path based on $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] and the path to the file youre including ( realpath(dirname(__FILE__) ). That way you can just call the function instead of reqriting the code to figure it out in every file.
