Geometric vs. Arithmetic mean to determine diameter of object

I want to estimate the volume of irregular objects (coral fragments) by simplifying their structure to a cylinder and then calculate the volume of this cylinder (i.e. Ecological Volume). The length of the cylinder runs along the longest part of the coral. Perpendicular to this I have measured the widest part (width1). Perpendicular to width1, I have measured a second width (width2). I want to use width1 and width2 to estimate the average diameter $d$ of the cylinder. Now this can be done in two ways: $d = \frac{\text{width1} + \text{width2}}{2}$ $d = \sqrt{\text{width1} \times \text{width2}}$ I only recently realised that there are actually different types of means. For now, I am completely clueless as to which mean to use. Any input greatly appreciated! For an example of a typical coral being measured, see: https://www.flickr.com/photos/ewoutknoester/29756453161/in/dateposted-public/
