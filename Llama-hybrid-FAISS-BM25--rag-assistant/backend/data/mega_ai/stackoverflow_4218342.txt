There is no way to organize tables hierarchically that is meaningful to MySQL. As others have noted, you can maintain separate schemas (in MySQL, databases), or you can develop and use a table naming structure that organizes your tables in a way that is meaningful to users (but is still not meaningful to MySQL).
