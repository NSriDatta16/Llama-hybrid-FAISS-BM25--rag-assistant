But is this a valid addition to a vector? Yes, a (standard library) vector stores copies. Is there a need for creating an int in heap storage using "new" operator If you don't want the objects to be copied or to work with polymorphic objects (see object slicing ) you'd use pointers. In that case you should preferably avoid dealing with deallocation manually and use wrappers (smart pointers or pointer containers) though to get exception safety back.
