You could also work with Microsoft's visual earth mapping application and api or use Google's api. I have always programmed commercially with ESRI products and have not played with the open api's that much. Also, you might want to look at Maker! and Finder! They are relatively new programs but I think they are free. Might be limited on embedding the data. Maker can be found here. The problem is that spatial processing is fairly new in the non commercial scale.
