Take a look at the .Skip() and .Take() extension methods to partition your queue into sets. You can then use .Average(t => t.Ticks) to get the new TimeSpan that represents the average. Just jam each of those 50 averages into a new Queue and you are good to go. Queue allTimeSpans = GetQueueOfTimeSpans(); Queue averages = New Queue (50); int partitionSize = 10; for (int i = 0; i t.Ticks) averages.Enqueue(new TimeSpan(avg)); } I'm a VB.NET guy, so there may be some syntax that isn't 100% write in that example. Let me know and I'll fix it!
