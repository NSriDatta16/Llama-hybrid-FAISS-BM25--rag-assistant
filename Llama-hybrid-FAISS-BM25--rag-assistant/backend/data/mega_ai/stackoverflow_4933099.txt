I would use a RelativeLayout . I like using it a lot. Its a great way to easily place and organize views,buttons,layouts,etc... Some Example code: I think the views and buttons will be drawn in order from top to bottom in the XML , but it may be the other way around.use margins like : android:layout_marginLeft="15dip" and android:layout_marginBottom="10dip" to help adjust the position .
