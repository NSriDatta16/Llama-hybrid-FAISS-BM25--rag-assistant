Tophat makes some great points. Another thing to consider is that you removed close to 20 percent of your data by removing the "outliers" which leads me to believe that they really aren't outliers, rather, just extreme values. Certainly, there may be an outlier on one dimension that you should look at, but with such a rich data set, an extreme value in one dimension is probably not enough to say it is an outlier. Personally, I would try clustering the data to find the outliers, if any. They would turn up as a cluster with only one or two constituents. Another point to consider is that outliers are not always a problem that must be resolved. One of the benefits of decision trees is that they perform well even with outliers. So in your case, I would keep all the records as any real outliers are probably of little impact on the efficacy of your random forest model.
