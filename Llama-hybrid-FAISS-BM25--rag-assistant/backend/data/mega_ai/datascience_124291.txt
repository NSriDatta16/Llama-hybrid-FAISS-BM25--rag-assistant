FYI, as of scikit-learn 1.3.2, the RandomForestClassifier 's default hyperparameters are: n_estimators=100 criterion='gini' max_depth=None min_samples_leaf=1 ... and so on. It does not give or try to get any best hyperparameter, just using a default. In general, finding 'best' parameters is NP-hard, i.e. the only way is to try all possible combinations. In practice, we leverage heuristics and guesswork to limit the search space. An exercise for you: try to train a model on a toy dataset, with and without parameter search, and observe the difference in performance.
