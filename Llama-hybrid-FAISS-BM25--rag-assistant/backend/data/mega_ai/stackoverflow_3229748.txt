These days, email tends to be a lot more reliable than the people who work with it. Something you should consider is that in a lot of cases people just come up with excuses for not receiving an email. Short of having a Skynet -like setup where the main computer can dispatch killer robots to your targets, you are essentially bound to delivery via the Internet. You've identified a lot of the potential weaknesses; there are workarounds for most, which I will try to enumerate. First, your app. I'll assume it's sufficiently redundant that it's never going to be too down to report. At the very least, you have redundant, reliable watchdog services. One mail server could go down. OK, so get a second one! Your network could go down. Bafflingly, this does happen in the big company I work in. So important stuff is rigged to run over two independent internal networks. If you only have one Internet line to the outside world, there's a chance your connection will be gone when you most need it. A sensible plan calls for redundant Internet connections. For emergency purposes, your backup connection could be wireless - UMTS or GSM or whatever they may call it in your country. You have a choice of running your own in-house mail server, distributing directly to the Internet, or using a commercial email service. If there's nothing confidential in your mails, I'd consider Google Mail for one of the outgoing paths. It has pretty solid up times and is well maintained. Your other outgoing mail server should probably be within your company. The weakest link is your recipients. You need to be sure they get their mails. To nab the "spam filter" excuse and others, have your server mail all the respondents once a week and have them reply, including the randomly generated subject. This will confirm to you that, at least within the previous week, your recipient was getting his mail. If not, investigate. Email to your recipients' mail box is not the only alternative. Once you get out to the Internet, there are alternatives like SMS and paging services. These get you as far as the recipient's phone. Once contacted, they can phone in or check their company email. If you're running NORAD , you may need even better foolproofing on your messaging. Otherwise, attention to the above points will make your operation as bulletproof as it's likely to get.
