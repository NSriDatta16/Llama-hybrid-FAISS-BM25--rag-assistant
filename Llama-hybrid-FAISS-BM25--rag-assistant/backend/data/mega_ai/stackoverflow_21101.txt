This is not directly an answer, but The thing is that to remove the disk you have to eject the volume and in this case do it for both volumes I have a similar situation. OSX remembers where you put your icons on the desktop - I've moved the icons for both of my removable drives to just above where the trash can lives. Eject procedure becomes Hit top-left of screen with mouse to show desktop Drag small box around both removable drives Drag 2cm onto trash so they both get ejected Remove firewire cable
