Change as follows: package MyApp.Services.ReportingService; // FIXME - Make package names lowercase!! // FIXME - Loopy package name public class ReportingService extends CommonService { private static ReportingService instance = null; private ReportingService() { } public static synchronized ReportingService getInstance() { if (instance == null) { instance = new ReportingService(); } return instance; } } and import MyApp.Services.ReportingService.ReportingService; package MyApp.Services.WebReportingService ; // FIXME - Make package names lowercase!! // FIXME - Loopy package names. public class WebReportingService { @WebMethod(operationName = "registerUDP") public boolean registerUDP( @WebParam(name = "Friendly Name") String friendlyName, @WebParam(name = "Username") String username, @WebParam(name = "Password") String password, @WebParam(name = "Communication Protocol") CommunicationProtocol communicationProtocol, @WebParam(name = "IP Address") String ipAddress, @WebParam(name = "Port") int port) { Consumer client = new Consumer(friendlyName, username, password, communicationProtocol, ipAddress, port); ReportingService rs = ReportingService.getInstance(); return true; } } Note: depending on which packages the Consumer and CommunicationProtocol classes are defined in, you may need to import them; e.g. add these lines before the package line. import some.package.Consumer; import some.other.package.CommunicationProtocol; Note 2: your current choice of package names has some seriously style issues. package names should be all lowercase the prefix of your package names should be the (reversed) DNS-style identifier for your company, organization, whatever; e.g. in.com.yourcompany... . Note, there are very good reasons form this convention!! MyApp / myapp is content free and shouldn't be used services.reportingservice is redundant / verbose; e.g. use services.reporting instead using the same name as a class and package name is redundant / verbose unless there are lots of classes in the reporting and webreporting packages, they probably should be folded into one package. Lots of packages with 1 or 2 classes in them is not helpful.
