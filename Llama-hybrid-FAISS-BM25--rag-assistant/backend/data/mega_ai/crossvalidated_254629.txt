I think a reference that my satisfy your desire is here . Go to section 4 - Optimisation in Modern Bayesian Computation. TL;DR -they discuss proximal methods. One of the advantages of such methods is splitting - you can find a solution by optimizing easier subproblems. A lot of times (or, at least, sometimes) you may find in the literature a specialized algorithm to evaluate a specific proximal function. In their example, they do image denoising. One of the steps is a very successful and highly cited algorithm by Chambolle.
