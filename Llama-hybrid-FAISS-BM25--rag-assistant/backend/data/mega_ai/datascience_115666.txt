Discussion: should we feed the original features as inputs to an ensemble model?

Let's imagine you have different models to give predictions on the same topic. One of your model is a regression, the other an ANN, the last one XGBOOST. Some of your models work better predicting at week+1, other at predicting week+3. Each of your model has interesting results. How to best combine them into a strong one ? My intuition is that you must feed the various forecasts to a new ensemble model, but also provide some of the initial features, so the ensemble model can learn in which case it is best to trust which original model. I extensively red about Ensemble Modelling and it always seem that the only inputs are the forecasts of the base models, so no features. Am I missing something or my intuition would be interesting?
