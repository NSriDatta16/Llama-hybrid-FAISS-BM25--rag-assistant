You cannot assign a DEFAULT value to a TINYTEXT and you cannot create an unprefixed index on the latter. Internally, additional objects are allocated in memory to handle TEXT (incl. TINYTEXT ) columns which can cause memory fragmentation on the large recordsets. Note that this only concerns the column's internal representation in the recordsets, not how they are stored on the disk.
