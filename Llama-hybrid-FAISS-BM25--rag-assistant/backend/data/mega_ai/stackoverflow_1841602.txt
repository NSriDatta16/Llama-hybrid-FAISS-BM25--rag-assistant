All the documents in SharePoint under the same Content Database (SQL Database) are stored in the same table, that said, you have an unique ID for files no matter where they are in the sharepoint structure. When retrieving files by their UniqueID The API only gives you the option to get them if you also know their SPWeb, so you could easily store, for each record you have in your external database (or your custom list, the SPFile GUID and the SPWeb GUID) retrieving them with: using(SPWeb subweb = (SPContext.Current.Site.OpenWeb(new Guid("{000...}"))) { SPFile file = subweb.GetFile(new Guid("{111...}")); // file logic } ps.: As Colin pointed out, url retrieval is possible but messy. I also changed the SPSite to the context since you are always under the same Site Collection in my example.
