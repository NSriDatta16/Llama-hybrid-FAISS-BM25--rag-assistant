Answering my own question if someone else has to deal with the same problem. In the end I came up with a pragmatic solution. Now I'm generating only the PNG files in my .NET program and use a CorelDraw macro I recorded and adapted to convert the content of a whole folder to .eps files. A small, but important detail: In order to assign the " CutContour " spot color from the color palette, you have to create a new "Graphics Style" in CorelDraw and assign that style to the rectangle .
