How to do k-fold cross validation to get optimal specification in a random forest model?

i am an R beginner and i have to do a 5 or 10-fold cross validation in a random forest model. My problem is i have to do the cv manually and not with an package. What i want to do is: 1. Building k-folds with my training data 2. Choose my tuning parameter for example trees = c( 200, 400, 600) 3. Fit my model on k-1 folds and predict my values on the holdout set(validation set) 4. Then i want to evaluate my prediction on the holdout set and save the value. my evaluation parameter should be AUC. I understand the theory but i have problems to do this in R. Have you an idea for my code? Thanks so much!!!!
