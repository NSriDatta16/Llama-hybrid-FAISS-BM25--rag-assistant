How to mix mongodb and a traditional db in Rails?

I am considering using MongoDB (mongo-mapper) for a portion of my rails application. I am not ready to go whole hog MongoDB because there are too many useful gems that depend on a traditional DB. That being said there are parts of my application that would be great to leverage a document database. Has anyone had success mixing the two approaches? How do you link activerecord models with mongomapper models?
