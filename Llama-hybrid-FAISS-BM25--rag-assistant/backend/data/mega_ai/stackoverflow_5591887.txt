How to bind a xamDataGrid to a dataset in WPF4?

I am developing a WPF4 app and using DataSet to populate a xamDataGrid (from Infragistics). Here is the xaml for datagrid: Now the code that I am using to populate the xamDataGrid is : var adcg = new OrganizationGridTableAdapter(); AddressBookDataSet dbcg = new AddressBookDataSet(); adcg.Fill(dbcg.OrganizationGrid); //xamDataGridIndividual.DataContext = dbc.Individual; xamDataGridOrganization.DataSource = dbcg.OrganizationGrid.DefaultView; Now the my DataTable OrganizationGrid has the fields: Id OrganizationName EmailId and some other fields .. I want to change the text in the header and some other properties (width, text-size) .. how can i do this? As you can see in the XAML code, I defined a FieldLayout with the exact same field names, can i bind a column from my DataTable to a particular field defined by me?
