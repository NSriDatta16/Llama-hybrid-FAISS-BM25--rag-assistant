Using both raw and weight of evidence values in logistic regression

I am building a logistic regressin model for probability of take-up for a lending product. I have a number of continuous variables. In the past, I have always used EITHER weight-of-evidence transformations OR raw variabels to build such models. My question is â€” can one use BOTH WoE and raw values in the same model? I.e. use WoE for variables $x_1,\dots, x_N$ and raw values for $x_{N+1},\dots x_M$ ? The model fit looks reasonable, so I am unsure if this is correct.
