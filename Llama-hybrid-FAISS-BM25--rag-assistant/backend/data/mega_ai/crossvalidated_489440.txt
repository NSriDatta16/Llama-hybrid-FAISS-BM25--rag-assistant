The comments mentioned that you should first identify what kind of bias you're concerned about. My thought is that it is possible that correlation of test scores with college performance may vary based on the number of tests taken (there could be some confounding variable that affects both number of tests and college performance). One thought i had on how you could incorporate all your scores is by using a bayesian model where you marginalize out the unknown test scores.
