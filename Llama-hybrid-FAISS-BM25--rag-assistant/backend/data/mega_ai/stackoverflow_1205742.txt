Code to Test Ratio is a bit of a misleading statistic. A much better method is to use rcov , you can easily use it by running rake spec:rcov Whilst 100% code coverage is sometimes held up as an absolute target, you quickly run into the law of diminishing returns . Personally I aim for 90% code coverage in all production code; even though this is mainly arbitrary I find it much easier to have a target number to aim for.
