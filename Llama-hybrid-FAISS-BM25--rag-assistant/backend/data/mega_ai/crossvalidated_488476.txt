It is not uncommon for coefficients to change sign when other terms are added to the model, e.g. when x7 is the only term in the model then the coefficient will be negative as you expect, but as you add more terms (either through a stepwise approach, or relaxing the penalties/constraints in the elasticnet) the coefficient on x7 can easily change sign due to relationships between x7, the other predictors, and the response. See this answer: Binary Logistic Regression: Direction of B's different in multiple than in bivariate cases for one example/explanation that may make this more clear.
