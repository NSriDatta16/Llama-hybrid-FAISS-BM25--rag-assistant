Javascript Opacity Issue

Using absolute positioning, I have placed a div with opacity of 0.5 in front of an image by giving it a higher z-index . Also using absolute positioning, I want to put another smaller div in front of the first div using a higher z-index . This smaller div would show only part of the image (like a window), but have no opacity. Eventually, I will make the smaller image draggable. What I am struggling with is that as long as the main div has the 0.5 opacity, the smaller one will also show the picture with the same opacity. How do I overcome this?
