Without knowing more about the data, especially the independent variables (the regressors), it will be impossible to give a one-fits-all solution for anyone here. However the issue you are adressing falls into the area of Econometrics. As such, there are a couple of good texts which will bring you further. They easiest book which will give you the tools to tackle this issue is Introduction to Econometrics by Stock&Watson . It is an undergraduate textbook which offers a very modern approach. Your small sample might give you issues. The standard books one would recommend in this instance are either "Econometrics" by Fumio Hayashi or Econometric Analysis by Greene. Finally, if you really want to dig deep into this problem, the go to guide is the landmark "Time Series Analysis" by Hamilton. It is, however, a challenging book. Be aware that there are other approaches in Statistics, often with their own terminology and goals. However in this case Econometrics is the best fit as it is designed exactly for problems such as this. Which tests you'd have to run specifically depend very much on data and model and approach. It will be some kind of structural break test, if you want to look into what's available there. But, as you already realized, with 12 observations the sample size and therefore the model selection will be an issue before you even get to these tests.
