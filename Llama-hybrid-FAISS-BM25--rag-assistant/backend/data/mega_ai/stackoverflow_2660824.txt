pro/con of having single/multiple action per file in symfony?

been working with symfony for a while. most tutorials describe having multiple actions in a single php file. however, i find having 1 action per php file easier to maintain. what's the pro/con of both? is this purely a developer preference in code organisation? any performance impact on either approach? what's common practice for reasonably large production applications?
