A good example of AI, but not machine learning is evolutionary computation. Here instead of learning from experience (as in Tom M. Mitchell's definition) we have genotype changing in each generation of computer program version, measured by its performance at task (phenotype expression in environment). As Melanie Mitchell puts it: '...from the earliest days computers were applied... to modeling the brain, mimicking human learning, and simulating biological evolution... The first has grown into the field of neural networks, the second into machine learning, and the third into what is now called "evolutionary computation,"...' Although, now neural networks are mostly considered as part of machine learning .
