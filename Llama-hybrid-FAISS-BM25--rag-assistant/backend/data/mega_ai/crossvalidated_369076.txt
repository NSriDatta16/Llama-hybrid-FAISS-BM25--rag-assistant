After reading some papers for mathematical models in thermal biology, I tested out a few equations: gaussian function, lactin 2 function, and the logan 6 function (Krenek et al., 2011) and got some solutions AND more questions ! Below are the plot and AIC results: AIC(lactin) = 126.6063 AIC(logan) = 112.1064 AIC(gaussian) = 110.6587 As you can see, visually the best fitting curve is the one produced by the Lactin 2 model, however, it has the highest AIC values and the peak occurred slightly later (25.5°C) than where I would like it to be (24°C). The Gaussian model has the best AIC value, but I don't know if it's peaking a little too early? Which model should I pick given the shape of fitting and the AIC values? If I should go for the Lactin 2 model, how can I change where the peak occurs?
