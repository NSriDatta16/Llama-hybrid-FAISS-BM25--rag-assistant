Linear Model with Categorical Predictor Variable: What's the Math behind it?

I do understand how linear regression models work with numerical data (finding the line that has the least squares). Having read Grolemund's and Wickham's R for Data Science , I was wondering about one of their examples which goes like this (edit: This is only a fraction of the data they use but I wanted to create a small and reproducable example without tidyverse, as Roland pointed out below): (daily Obviously, the cut could be regarded as an ordinal variable so that it can easily converted to the number but as the plot shows, this will not result in a linear line. I did consult R's lm() manual but did not find any information why the use of lm() here is ok.
