Performing outlier detection before semi-supervised anomaly (novelty) detection

I want to perform semi-supervised anomaly (novelty) detection on data using machine learning methods (e.g. one class SVM). Is it sensible that in pre-processing step, I use outlier detection techniques (such as isolaton forests) to cleanse normal data? By semi-supervised anomaly detection I mean we only have limited data with normal label but most of the data does not has label.
