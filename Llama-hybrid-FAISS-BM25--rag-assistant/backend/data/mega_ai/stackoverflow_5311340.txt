Implementing a bookmarks/favouriotes type function in my application

I am looking into concepts of how to implement a bookmarks or favouities type function into my application. Basically, this enables the users to save favourite pages from my app, which are then displayed on a list of favourites. The favouties of course need to be deleted as well. I would proably just need two or three pieces of information like 'page name' and 'address of page' within my application. My currrent trail of thought is with isolated storage and creating an XML file but this is proving difficult. EDIT,: I am not asking for code or anything, but more after ideas on how to approach this and which methods to use. Many thanks.
