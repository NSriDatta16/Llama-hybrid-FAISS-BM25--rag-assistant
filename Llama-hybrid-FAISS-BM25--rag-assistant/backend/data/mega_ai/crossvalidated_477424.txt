N size for not being considerated leverage

Suposse I have a dataset with two variables x and y, with the purpose to run a linear regression y ~ x. We have all x values equal and y varying between 1 and 10. For example (in R code): x If I add a new value, being x value 75, this new value will be considerated a leverage: x How many 75's I need to add to the dataset for not being considerated a leverage?
