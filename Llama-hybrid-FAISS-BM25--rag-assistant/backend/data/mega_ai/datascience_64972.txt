I would not necessarily call it data issues. There is always some threshold that you just can not surpass, depending on the dataset ofcourse. Generally feature engineering and understanding the data will yield much greater increases than just hyp.par. optimization, which as you can see from the picture, yields often marginal increases (there is a case where its worst than default parameters)
