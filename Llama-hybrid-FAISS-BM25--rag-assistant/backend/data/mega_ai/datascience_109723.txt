You wouldn't input all of the examples into one layer at once. You input the first example, feed it forward then feed it backward, then you input the next example and so on. Like the neural network needs to be able to actually learn you can't just run one iteration and have it make accurate predictions. If you're doing it from scratch it would look something like input_data = np.array() #shape of 1000x12x3 for i in range(1000): neuralnet = neuralnet(input=input_data[i]) #input data with shape 12x3
