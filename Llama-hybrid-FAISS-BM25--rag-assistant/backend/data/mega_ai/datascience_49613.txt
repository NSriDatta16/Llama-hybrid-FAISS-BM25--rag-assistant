The red line In my opinion, the red line is purely subjective, meaning its absence could be equally justified, therefore, we should not expect it to be found in general. For example, it is going through a densely clustered set close to the intersection point (orange circle), and also separates some equally-spaced points down the line (purple circles). A general solution However, the green line (and similar lines that clearly separate two sets) can be found using these steps: Applying a non-convex clustering algorithm such as DBSCAN (tuning its parameters is crucial), Labeling the detected clusters as classes, Using a multi-class classifier with linear decision boundary (e.g. multi-class logistic regression, or mult-class linear SVM) to find the separation line[s] between the classes. The red line revisited As commented by OP , if the assumption is "exactly two lines", I agree that the red line is a very good candidate. We can impose this assumption, i.e. domain knowledge, by tuning the parameters of DBSCAN until we get 3 well-populated clusters.
