Modern Browsers In modern browsers, you can leverage the :hover pseudo class in our selector. As an example, consider the following markup: This is a long string of text Delete Item By default, we would want the .adminControls to be hidden. They should, however, become visible once the user has hovered the .item element: .item .adminControls { display: none; } .item:hover .adminControls { display: block; } JavaScript and jQuery If you're using jQuery , you can accomplish this rather easily using the $.hover() method. If you're using Prototype, you can get the protoHover plugin to achieve the same result, or view this blog post . $("div.item").hover( function () { $(this).find(".adminControls").show(); }, function () { $(this).find(".adminControls").hide(); } ); That would accomplish the show/hide effect for the following: This is a long string of text Delete Item This is a long string of text Delete Item This is a long string of text Delete Item
