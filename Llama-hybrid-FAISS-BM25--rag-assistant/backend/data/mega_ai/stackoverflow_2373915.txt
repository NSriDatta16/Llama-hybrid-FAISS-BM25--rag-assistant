I would use a classification algorithm that accepts nominal attributes and numeric class, like M5 (for trees or rules). Perhaps I would combine it with the bagging meta classifier to reduce variance. The original algorithm M5 was invented by R. Quinlan and Yong Wang made improvements. The algorithm is implemented in R (library RWeka ) It also can be found in the open source machine learning software Weka For more information see: Ross J. Quinlan: Learning with Continuous Classes .
