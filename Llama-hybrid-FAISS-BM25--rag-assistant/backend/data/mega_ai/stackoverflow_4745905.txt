Seeing as nobody had an answer for my I used a crude method to find the time in Seconds of an audio track. Knowing that I recorded the track myself with settings I gave I knew the bitrate, could get the filesize too. So creating a File object and then setting that object as the file in storage to get the time in seconds use: float time = (float)file.length()/22050/2; Where 22050 is the sample rate, I think, of the recording and 2 I think is because it recorded it in stereo. Anyway hope this helps anybody in the future and correct me if I am wrong at all please.
