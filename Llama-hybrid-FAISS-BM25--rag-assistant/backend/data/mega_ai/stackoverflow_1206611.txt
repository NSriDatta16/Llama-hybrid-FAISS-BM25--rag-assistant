1) see Charles's answer above 2) come one now. this one is too easy. Path != Filename 3) What matters is the relationship between page size and record size. If you use varchars and have lots of data changes where fields go from being short to long, SQL spends time moving records to different pages. If your char fields are really long such that not very many records fit on a page, it may hurt performance a bit. If the length of the data varies a lot, varchars will make better use of storage space. And they don't have those pesky spaces on the end of your data that you have to strip off all the time.
