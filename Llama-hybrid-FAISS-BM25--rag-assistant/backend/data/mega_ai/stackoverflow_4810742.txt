What is the Best way to "Store" data for quick and repetitous retrieval

Fictious Background I get 100 hits a minute for "the hottest car" The hottest car always changes by the minute and its currently: "A Pinto" Everytime I receive what the current hottest car is, I save it into a MySQL Database. Situation Everytime I get a hit for "Whats the hottest car", I need to return the answer. I feel confident that retrieving the answer from a file vs. a DB will be faster and less work for the processor due to PHP storing the file into memory. My concern is that if I get a new file, how do I make sure i'm returning the information in the new file and not the old information stored in memory. P.S. If my assumptions are wrong and there is a faster way, please let me know. Thanks
