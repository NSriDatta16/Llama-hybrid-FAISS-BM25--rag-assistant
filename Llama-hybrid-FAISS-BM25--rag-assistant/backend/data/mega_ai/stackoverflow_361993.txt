I can't recommend this because I've never used it, but I know a small company that had decent luck with A Naive Bayesian Spam Filter for C# by Jason Kester. I would personally recommend using a 3rd party like Akismet though. Spam filtering is tough business and it is always better to delegate that to someone who can and will keep up with the spammers' techniques over time.
