You say you want to know whether the embedding is "coherent enough". It is not very clear what you mean by that, but I presume your question is somehow: How do I measure the quality of my embedding? And that depends on what you want to do. The clustering property of the embedding might not have anything to do with the task you want to solve. So, find a metric that evaluates your overall task, and then tune your embedding according to this metric.
