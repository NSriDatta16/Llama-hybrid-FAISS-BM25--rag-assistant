First, this my null hypothesis is to know if there's a significant difference between the 2 fasfoods in terms of gender, age, year level and school. is not a null hypothesis. The null hypothesis would be something like "There is no difference between preference for fast food based on gender age etc. Second you say I have 5 factors, 1st factor consists of 8 variables, 2nd, 3rd and 4th consists of 3 variables, and 2 variables for 5th factor. Total of 19 variables/questions. What are these factors? How will you use them? You don't mention them again in your post Next, the dependent variable should be the rating of the food. I hope this is on a nice simple scale like 1 to 5. The independent variables are age, gender etc (possibly the factors go here, but it is hard to say) The statistical method, if the rating of food is ordinal, would be ordinal logistic regression. At least, that's where to start.
