What kind of isolated storage are you referencing? How about: create a stored proc to perform the backup. BACKUP DATABASE [Foo] TO DISK = N'\\server\directory\Foo.BAK' WITH NOFORMAT, NOINIT, NAME = N'Foo-FullBackup', SKIP, NOREWIND, NOUNLOAD, STATS = 10 GO call this stored proc on the SQL Server from your C# client code depending on your needs (isolated storage?) use System.IO.File.Move() to move the .BAK file from its source to your destination.
