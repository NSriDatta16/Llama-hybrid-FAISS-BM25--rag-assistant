JQueryUI- Can options take more than one parameter?

I'm trying to make my draggables snap to each other as well as their containing div. Is this possible? this works: $($element).draggable({ snap: true }) but this (and variations of it) will not: $($element).draggable({ snap: true, '#mainwindow' }) Anyone know how to give options more than one parameter?
