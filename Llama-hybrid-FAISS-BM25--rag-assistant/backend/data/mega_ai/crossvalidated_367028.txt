Why do CNNs conclude with FC layers?

From my understanding, CNNs consist of two parts. The first part (conv/pool layers) which does the feature extraction and the second part (fc layers) which does the classification from the features. Since fully-connected neural nets aren't the best classifiers (i.e. they get outperformed by SVMs and RFs most of the time), why do CNNs conclude with FC layers, rather than let's say an SVM or a RF?
