Your problem is one where some context is really needed to say much, I think. So please add some more context! Besides that, there are many possible ideas, and I will here limit to reference some other posts which are relevant. Principled way of collapsing categorical variables with many levels? have many ideas (and when going there, look at the linked sidepanel.) Some posts dealing specifically with random forests is Label encoding vs Dummy variable/one hot encoding - correctness? and Random Forest Regression with sparse data in Python . Or maybe look to embeddings as used in text analytics.
