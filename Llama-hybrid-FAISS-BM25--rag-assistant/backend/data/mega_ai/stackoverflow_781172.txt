going left: unrestricted / wrapping mouse tracking? in Flash?

So, I'm shooting up dudes in [3D Game], and I can keep dragging my mouse to turn left round and round. Is this possible in Flash? Or have I misunderstood how the mouse is handled within [operating system] and then passed to the Flash Player?
