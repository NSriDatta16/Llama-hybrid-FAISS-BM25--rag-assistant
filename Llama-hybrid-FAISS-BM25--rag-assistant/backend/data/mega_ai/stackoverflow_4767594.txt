This becomes clearer when the whole paragraph is taken into context: The reference type of the Java virtual machine is cleverly named reference. Values of type reference come in three flavors: the class type, the interface type, and the array type. All three types have values that are references to dynamically created objects. The class type's values are references to class instances. The array type's values are references to arrays, which are full-fledged objects in the Java virtual machine. The interface type's values are references to class instances that implement an interface. One other reference value is the null value, which indicates the reference variable doesn't refer to any object. (Taken from http://javadeveloper-jayaprakash-m.blogspot.com/ ) I would assume from this that the "cleverly named" bit is referring to the fact that the references come in three different types and the JVM can distinguish between each one.
