How can I process data to avoid MySQL "incorrect string value" error?

I am trying to use a Rake task to migrate some legacy data from MS Access to MySQL. I'm working on Windows XP, using Ruby 1.8.6. I have the encoding for Rails set as "utf8" in database.yml . Also, the default character set for MySQL is utf8. 99% of the data is coming in fine, but every now and then I'll get a column value that gives me a error something like this: Mysql::Error: Incorrect string value: '\x92 Comm...' for column 'name' at row 1: INSERT INTO `organizations` ( [...] ) VALUES('Lawyers’ Committee', [...] ) It looks as though the thing that's giving MySQL trouble is the apostrophe immediately after the "s" in the word "Lawyers". Here's another one... Mysql::Error: Incorrect string value: '\x99 aoc' for column 'department' at row 1: INSERT INTO `addresses` [...] 'TRInfo™ aoc' [....] Looks like it's choking on the "TM" after "TRInfo". Is there any Ruby or Rails method that I can run the data through to cleanse from it any characters that MySQL will choke on? Ideally, it would be great to replace them with more palatable characters -- replace the apostrophe with a single quote and the TM symbol with the string "(TM)". Or, if I could somehow configure MySQL to store those characters as-is without errors that would be great too.
