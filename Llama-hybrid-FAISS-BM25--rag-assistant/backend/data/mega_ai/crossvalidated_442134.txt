Machine Learning - Data Pre-Processing

I'm currently working on a machine learning project. I have data from over 50 sensors but the time at which data was recorded are not the same, the data is not synchronized and there are missing data. Most of the sensors record data at an interval of 10 minutes, one record at an interval of 5 minutes and another record at an interval of 1 minute. What is the best approach to pre-process the data for machine learning? I'm trying to predict energy consumption which is being recorded at an interval of 1 minute.
