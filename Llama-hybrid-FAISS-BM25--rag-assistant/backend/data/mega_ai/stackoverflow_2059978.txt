I'd say if you're interested in a new and very "different" language and are considering several options, you should check out the community first. See how active the newsgroups are, if the people seem nice and have a good vibe. Investigate if popular projects in that language tend to be on topics that intrigue you. Haskell seems like a good option. Functional languages are important and show a different side to problem solving. I've been looking at Erlang but haven't written anything in it yet, so I can't speak about it on any level besides shared curiosity. link | flag add comment Psssst... over here! Shhhhh! Don't draw no attention! We clear? Are you sure no one followed you? So you wanna "completely change the way you look at programming", eh? People probably tellin' you the way to get mind expansion is to go to CS schoolâ€”functional programming, or something sissy like that. Yeah I know what I said...with the bullcrap about "community"...that was to get the moderation police off my back, dude! Fact is I got your "mind expansion" right here...the crack cocaine of programming: [Rebol] First time's free. But if anyone asks where you got that from, it wasn't me! We never met...I don't exist. You got that!?? :P
