Consider the hard margin SVM formulation, which tries to find a hyperplane that strictly separates the data. $$ min_{w,b} \space ||w||^2 $$ $$ s.t \space \forall i, (w'x_{i} + b)y_{i} \ge 1 $$ If our data is linearly seperable, all the inequality constraints will be satisfied. Notice that $w'x + b$ simply indicates which side of a plane a point lies on. Knowing the feasibility of the SVM problem is equivalent to knowing if our data is linearly separable. However, we don't actually care much about the objective for simply checking linear seperability. Can we solve a simpler feasibility problem, maybe a linear program? The following LP can be solved to check the feasibility. $$ min_{s,b, w} \space s$$ $$ s.t \space \forall i, (w'x_{i} + b)y_{i} \ge 1 - s $$ $$ s \ge 0$$ If optimal $s$ for this problem is zero, we know that the original inequality constraints can be satisfied. This means our data was linearly separable in the original space. Using separate $s_i$ for each training example can tell us which data-points cause linearly in-separability.
