How does cross entropy loss get calculated in overconfident neural networks?

Given formula for categorical formula for cross entropy: or binary forumla: how is cross entropy calculated in overconfident neural netowrks (especially CNNs where this phenomenon is common), e.g. given the output of 3 classes network is [0, 0, 1] and ground truth is [1, 0, 0] , how is cross entropy calculated, when log(0) is undefined.
