Neural Network 0 vs -1

I have seen a few times people using -1 as opposed to 0 when working with neural networks for the input data. How is this better and does it effect any of the mathematics to implement it? Edit: Using feedforward and back prop Edit 2: I gave it a go but the network stopped learning so I assume the maths would have to change somewhere? Edit 3: Finally found the answer. The mathematics for binary is different to bipolar. See my answer below.
