What are the possible causes of JasperException

I have a JSP that takes an Arraylist from the session object and removes the items from it. It seemed to be working fine and then out of nowhere when I navigate to that page, the page is blank. I checked the Tomcat log files and in catalina.out I am receiving a JasperException an it is showing it as being on a line with the following for(int i; i agentItems is the name of the ArrayList I am using. I have been debugging it and can't seem to figure out what the problem might be. I have read that a JasperException is sometiems thrown as a JSP's NullPointerException . Is this true or am I just completely overlooking the problem? I have the web application running on a local machine and a intermediate server for development in which both of them have had no trouble. Why could it be that only on this server it is giving me problems?
