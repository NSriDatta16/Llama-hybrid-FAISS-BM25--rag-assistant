Multiplying Weights by âˆšdmodel In the embedding layers, the weights are multiplied by the square root of dmodel. This is done to scale the weights appropriately and ensure that the dot product between the input tokens and the weights falls within a reasonable range. Scaling the weights helps in preventing the gradients from becoming too large or too small during training, which can lead to unstable learning dynamics.
