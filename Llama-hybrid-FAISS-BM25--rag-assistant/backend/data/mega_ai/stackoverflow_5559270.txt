No. And that's the philosophy of python: Do not make the compiler/parser enforce privacy since developers who want to access private members have ways to do so anyway (reflection etc.). The idea is telling people Hey, this is not part of the public API. If you use it improperly, it could breaks things or kill your cat. I might also change the signature often since it's not part of the public API and I don't have to care about people using it And fyi, you can actually access double-underscore variables (same applies for methods) from outside using obj._ClassName__variableName . Besides that it's not encouraged to use double underscores except for mixin objects - you can never know if someone wants to subclass your class.
