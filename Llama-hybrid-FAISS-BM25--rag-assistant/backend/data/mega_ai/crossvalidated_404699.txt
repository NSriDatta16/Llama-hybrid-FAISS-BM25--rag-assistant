How to rank observations with two variables (website performance)

I have no background in statistics, so I find myself confused by this simple problem. I'm not even sure which search terms to use. I have some website performance data. I have the number of times a page was requested/visited, and how long it took to load (average time and percentiles in seconds). I want to identify pages that are often requested/visited but take a long time to load. So for example, if an "FAQ" page takes 30 seconds to load but is only visited a few times a day, this is less important than a "Search" page that takes 2 seconds to load but is used thousands of times a day. The purpose is to make a "Top 10" list or something like that which some website developers will use to improve performance. I had thought to do something simple like create a new column with NUM_TRANSACTIONS * AVERAGE and sort that, but I'm wondering if there is something wrong with this approach. SOLVED: Edgar's answer worked well for me. I created the plot he suggested, and the scoring mechanism, and they produced similar results. The number markers indicate ranking.
