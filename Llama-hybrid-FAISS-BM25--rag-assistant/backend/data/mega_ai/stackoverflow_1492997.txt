SWT and Java WebStart on Mac OS X 10.5

I am using the most stable SWT Cocoa downloads for Mac OS X and and launching my app via Java WebStart. All jnilib files are within my app jar on its root. The app downloads, verifies, but I cannot get any buttons to respond. I can enter data into all my UI components. My VM arguements are "-d32" and "-XstartOnFirstThread". The app works fine as a stand alone app bundle (running in 32-bit mode), and works fine running out of Eclipse on the same machine. Is there a known issue with Cocoa SWT (swt-3.5-cocoa-macosx.zip) and WebStart on Mac? The JNLP is pretty standard, so maybe there is a setting that needs to be declared?
