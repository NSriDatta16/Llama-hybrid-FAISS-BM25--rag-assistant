The usual thing in SVM is to learn from the features directly - so you should give the features array to the SVM. But let us see what you are doing with the transformations. dissimilarities is a triangular or square matrix of distances. But then you are using MDS to project the data into 3 dimensions so that there is a low error between the true distances and the distances in the projection (this is what MDS does in a non-formal language). But the original data came from a 3D space - so all these transformations are doing is adding maybe a little error to the relative positions of the original data (because of the MDS transformation) and rotating and maybe reflecting the original data. So these transformations did not change the original data in any way that matters to the SVM algorithm.
