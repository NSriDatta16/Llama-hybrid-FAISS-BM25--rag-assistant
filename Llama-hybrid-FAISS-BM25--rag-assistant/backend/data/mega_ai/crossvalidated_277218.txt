Predicting variable Time Series - Unknown Frequency

I would like to create a model in order to predict the demand of a certain variable according to some historical data. I am working with Python and I am facing some problems. 1) My time series does not have a defined frequency. I have been working with R and time series in the past, and I used to specify a frequency for the observation. How should I deal with my case? (I can have 50 entries one day, 0 another day, and so on) 2) I would like to forecast the demand of a given "Function Title". Do you advise me to use any machine learning technique? (my dataset is about 26000 entries) Here a preview of my dataframe import pandas as pd import numpy as np df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv') #Replace column with english label df.columns = ['Work Experience', 'Function Profile', 'Function Title', 'Occupation', 'Education', 'Company Name', 'Clean Company Name', 'Sector (Industry)', 'Location', 'Salary Indication', 'Province', 'Date Found', 'ISCO', 'SBI-Code'] ts = df.set_index(dates) ts.head()
