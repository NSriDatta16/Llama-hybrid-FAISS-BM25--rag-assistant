Remember the values entered on standalone app on the client side

We have a standalone java swing app, in which the user can print something that he drew, on a printer by giving its IP. Now the requirement is that the app needs to remember the ip that was given the last time by this user. What I could think of till now is (a brute one though) - keep a log file kind of storage on the client machine, and that everytime the app comes up it reads the last submitted one. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks in advance.
