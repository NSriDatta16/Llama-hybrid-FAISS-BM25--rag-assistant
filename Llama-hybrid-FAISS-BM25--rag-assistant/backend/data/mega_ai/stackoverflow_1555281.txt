I would expect them to be about the same if they are value-types. There is an extra cast/type-check for ArrayList , but nothing huge. Of course, List should be preferred . If speed is the primary concern (which it almost always isn't, at least not in this way), then you might also want to profile an array ( T[] ) - harder (=more expensive) to add/remove, of course - but if you are just querying/assigning by index, it should be the fastest. I have had to resort to arrays for some very localised performance critical work, but 99.95% of the time this is overkill and should be avoided. For example, for any of the 3 approaches ( List / ArrayList / T[] ) I would expect the assignment cost to be insignificant to the cost of new ing up the new instance to put into the storage.
