Everything I know of Magento says it was designed to prevent exactly this from happening so as not to be penalised by search engines for duplicate content. You can, however, have multiple stores that share customers and catalog and products and prices and so on, but represent a separate domain each. In System > Manage Stores add several Stores for a single website and use the same root category for them all. Then in System > Configuration > Web assign the various domains.
