Why do we need to normalize data before principal component analysis (PCA)?

I'm doing principal component analysis on my dataset and my professor told me that I should normalize the data before doing the analysis. Why? What would happen If I did PCA without normalization? Why do we normalize data in general? Could someone give clear and intuitive example which would demonstrate the consequences of not normalizing the data before analysis?
