Between Subjects Likert Analysis -- Treat as Ordinal or Continuous for Stats Test?

I have 4 groups in a between subjects design answering likert scale questions. I am wondering how to analyse the data. There are 20 questions for each user in each group of 30 (so 120 people all together, with 120*20 responses). I see two options I could simply lump all questions in each group together and have a big distribution of 20*30 datapoints, each a number between 1-5. In this case, I'd have to use Mann-Whiteny U. I could average each persons 20 questions to reduce each user to one floating point number, and have 30 datapoints for each group. Here I could use a T-Test or ANOVA etc The thing is, I have no idea which is correct, I have seen people do both, and I have never gotten a straight answer which is correct. I know people use both methods, religiously, but is there actually a correct answer here? Thank you if you can give your opinion!
