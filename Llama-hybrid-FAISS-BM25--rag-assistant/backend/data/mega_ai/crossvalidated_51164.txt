When using maximum likelihood methods such as logistic regression, the R rms fastbw function uses an approximation based on sweeping the covariance matrix to produce Wald $\chi^2$ statistics for reduced models. You notice that the final $P$-value for x2 as on the 0.05 cusp of "significance". The disagreement in results is probably due to the model reduction approximation used by fastbw .
