Binary gunk..... well, you're using the BinaryEncoding! var binding = new CustomBinding(new BinaryMessageEncodingBindingElement(), new HttpTransportBindingElement()); Can you - just for argument's sake - try to use the TextEncoding instead and see if that works?? Also - by default, WCF will encrypt and sign every message, to if you trap the wire, you should only see binary garbage! :-) Also, at what point in the WCF communication are you trying to intercept these messages? If you intercept them "on the wire" between the client and the server, they'll be binary encoded in your setup - you'll get gooblydeguck. However, WCF offers a great extensibility story, so you could capture the messages before they're binary encoded (on the client), or after they've been decoded (on the server, incoming). Check into Message Inspectors - they allow you to have a look at the messages travelling through the WCF stack as they're being built on the client and unpacked on the server!
