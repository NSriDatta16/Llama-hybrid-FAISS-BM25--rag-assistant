Use the activeClass -option for the droppable. This allows you to highlight the droppables that accept the currently dragged draggables. But of course this is not what you want to do. To get the desired behaviour, you really have to accept all draggables on all sortables. There may be different solutions, one might be: on over of the droppable determine, if the draggable is accepted(I mean accepted by you, not by the droppable, as there are all draggables accepted). Assuming, you set revert to true in all draggables, you can now set the revert-option of the draggable to false(if its accepted). Otherwise add the class for highlightning if unaccepted draggables are received. On stop of the draggable remove the class set above and set revert back to true.
