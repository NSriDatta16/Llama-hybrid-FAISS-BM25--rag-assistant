These are interesting times for "the personal backup question". There are several schools of thought now: Frequent Automated Local Backup + Periodic Local Manual Backup Automated: Scheduled Nightly backup to external drive. Manual: Copy to second external drive once per week / month / year / oops-forgot and drop it of at "Mom's house". Lot's of software in the field, but here's a few: There's RSync and TimeMachine on Mac, and DeltaCopy www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp for Windows. Frequent Remote Backup There are a pile of services that enable you to backup across you internet connection to a remote data centre. Amazon 's S3 service + JungleDisk's client software is a strong choice these days - not the cheapest option, but you pay for what you use and Amazon's track record suggests as a company it will be in business as long or longer than any other storage providers who hang their shingle today. Did I mention it should be encrypted? Props to JungleDisk for handling the "encryption issue" and future-proofing (open source library to interoperate with Jungle Disk) pretty well. All of the above. Some people call it being paranoid ... others think to themselves "Ahhh, I can sleep at night now". Also, it's more fault-tolerance than backup, but you should check out Drobo - basically it's dead simple RAID that seems to work quite well.
