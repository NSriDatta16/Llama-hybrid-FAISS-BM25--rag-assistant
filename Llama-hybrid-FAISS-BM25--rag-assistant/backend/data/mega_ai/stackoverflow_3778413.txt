A data type actually says two things about your data: How it looks. To use your example, if itâ€™s an int , then it will contain a number from a specific range. What you can do with it. For example, you can add two int numbers together by saying 1 + 2 . Or you can append a text to string (this looks similar: "a" + "b" ). Or you can search for a fragment of a text in another text ( "hello".IndexOf("ll") will return 2). These two things are called the implementation and the interface of a data type, respectively.
