There will not be a "data driven way" to select the method from a single sample, for the method which is best today might not be best tomorrow with a new sample. My advice would be to perform some sort of calibration on your methods. Much like lab work, you should have some sort of control for each method and then ideally compare the method's estimate against the truth. Then, my advice would be to select the method with the lowest residual variance because errors in variables can attenuate the estimated effect towards the null. If this is not possible, you could just take the average between the two methods and use that as the variable into the model.
