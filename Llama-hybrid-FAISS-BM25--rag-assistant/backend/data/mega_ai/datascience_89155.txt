Since you are doing cross validation on a sample, while choosing a sample it is dividing in such a way that the sample contains only one class hence you are getting that error. If you have more data , you should not get this error. I have performed simple Logistic regression on these 5 records and I am able to create a model so can you increase your data and check? I have added data like this: 2- Create data set: raw_data={"A":["This is yellow","That is green","These are orange","This > is a pen","This is an Orange", "This yllow","That geen","These ornge","This a >pn","This an Ornge"], "B":["Yes","No","Yes","No","No", "Yes","No","Yes","No","No"] } And one more thing, I changed the r2_score in the last line to accuracy score.
