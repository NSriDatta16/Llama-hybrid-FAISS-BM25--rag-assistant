I would regress the information onto the variables whose effects you want to remove. The residuals should be uncorrelated with the variables to be hidden. You could then use those residuals in place of the original variables in your classifier. Another, similar, approach would be to regress the final predictions onto the variables whose effects you want to remove and use the residuals there. Since those are presumably categories, you could use logistic regression with 'race' (or whatever it is) as the predictor.
