I hope you are talking about the parameter count in a convolutional neural network. Below is basic understanding about calculating the parameters. After getting this, it would be self explanatory. kernel count = k kernel size = (a, a) depth of input = d Total number of parameters: k*(a*a)*d + k Now, for below scenario which has one input layer with one con2d layer. To cross check the number of parameters, we need k,d,a : k = 64, d = 3, a*a = 3*3 Total parameters: 64*(3*3)*3 + 64 = 1792 Hope its clear now.
