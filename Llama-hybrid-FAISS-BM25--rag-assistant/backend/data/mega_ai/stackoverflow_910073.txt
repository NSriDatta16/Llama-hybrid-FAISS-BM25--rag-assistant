Changing resolved status to Closed status for a user story in Jira

I am using Jira for organizing user stories for my project on Agile approach. When I tried to close a user story it shows the status as ' Resolved', rather than 'Closed'. Can someone help me how to change the user story status to closed? Please post your suggestions and help.
