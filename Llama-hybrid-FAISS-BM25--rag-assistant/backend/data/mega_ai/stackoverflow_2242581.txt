CSS : Table with Labels and Text Boxes

I am trying to break the table crutch... I want to place 3 "labels", "First", "Middle" and "Last" over 3 text boxes so that the labels are above the corresponding text boxes and the labels and text boxes are vertically aligned. In other words, I need a 3 columns table where the first row has 3 labels and the 2nd row has 3 text boxes in them and everything is left justified and I want ALL the columns widths to be identical and fixed. How do I do this with w/o tables using only CSS? I know that margin-left will give me a consistent distance between the groups, but how do I "carriage return" to the next line w.o using a Paragraph or a break tag, since the distance involved is really a function of the font, I imagine, instead of being able to "carriage return down" a specified number of pixels. I know that display: block will put things on a new line, but that creates a break before and after. I just want a break "after." I hope I explained it well enough. Thanks. Additional Edit: I understand that perhaps I should not be avoid using tables for something that tables is good at, but if CSS had an attribute analagos to margin-left:10px but in a vertical direction AFTER performing a cariage return, the advantage of using CSS over tables is that I wouldn't have a million TR and TD tags in my markup. Is there such a thing?
