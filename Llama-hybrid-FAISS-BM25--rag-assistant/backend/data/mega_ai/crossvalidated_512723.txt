It does look like you are able to implement estimator = "DWLS" and bootstrapping simultaneously: see here , though it does require you to implement the bootstrapping in one of the less-conventional lavaan-friendly ways. In particular, if you are looking for the speediest multi-core implementation, it looks like using boostrapLavaan() is your best bet. Also just to note that I see no reason why you wouldn't be able to interpret your defined indirect effect just because it was estimated with DWLS. The estimator is how you get the particular values in your model, but that doesn't change the way that indirect effects are defined (i.e., $ab$ , or $c-c'$ if you prefer). The choice of estimator might have some bearing on accuracy/bias of estimation and/or power/precision of testing/estimation (and that might be the sort of question for which there is a reference), and you might have to pay attention to if it changes the units of interpretation on you (my recollection is that lavaan uses probit for categorical outcomes), but otherwise I think the question of whether you can test indirect effects is more or less up to whether you've specified your model properly.
