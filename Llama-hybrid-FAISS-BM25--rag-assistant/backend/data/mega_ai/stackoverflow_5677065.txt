From the spec : size = cdata [CN] This attribute tells the user agent the initial width of the control. The width is given in pixels except when type attribute has the value "text" or "password". In that case, its value refers to the (integer) number of characters. So size for text and password fields represents the number of characters - it's not used to define the pixel width. Depending on the font used to style the input field, the pixel width of the field may differ. For this field: The browser will by default render it wide enough to fit 25 characters. Now, you could theoretically use the above information to determine what width to give it in CSS, but I haven't bothered with that myself yet. Besides, as oft-noted, how form elements are rendered on pages varies widely from browser to browser, so it may not be a reliable way to size your fields. Remember that setting a width using CSS always overrides the size attribute.
