Interpretation of logistic PCA loadings and why loadings depend on number components extracted

I am using Andrew J. Landgraf package logisticPCA to perform PCA on 41 binary variables. The purpose is the find main combinations of diseases in the sample and use it to model cost later. There are two questions which I would like to seek clarification: 1) How do I interpret the loadings? Is it the same as regular PCA? I am taking an arbitrary cutoff of |0.15| as a criteria to select 'important' diseases in a component. 2) I am planning to consider the first components as start for further analysis but I realized of the size of the loadings depend on the number of components extracted. This would be problem if I say decide to look at the second component later and realized that the 'important' diseases has changed. Here is a sample of my output: print(logpca1) > 430000 rows and 41 columns Rank 1 solution with m=5 13.00% of deviance explained 40 iterations to converge > load1=as.data.frame(logpca1$U) > row.names(load1)=names(df) > load1 V1 D1 -0.48 D2 -0.27 D3 -0.12 D4 -0.10 D5 -0.11 D6 -0.12 D7 -0.69 D8 -0.17 ... print(logpca2) > 430000 rows and 41 columns Rank 2 solution with m=5 23.01% of deviance explained 47 iterations to converge > load2=as.data.frame(logpca2$U) > row.names(load2)=names(df) > load2 V1 V2 D1 -0.47 -0.23 D2 -0.31 -0.10 D3 -0.23 0.17 D4 -0.17 0.08 D5 -0.31 0.47 D6 -0.36 0.44 D7 -0.30 -0.61 D8 -0.23 -0.02 ...
