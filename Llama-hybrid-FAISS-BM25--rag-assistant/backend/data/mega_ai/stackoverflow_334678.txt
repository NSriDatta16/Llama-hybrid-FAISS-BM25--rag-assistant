I started using my left hand for the mouse, this not only help me a bit, but allowed me to use my right hand more freely, if you write a lot of stuff dwon while you code this helps you a lot.. you can scroll and write down at the same time... When my problems began i put a water bag under my wrist, i loved it! the bag i had was perfect it was long and i put it before the keyboard so i could rest my wrists there.... until one day i step on it...
