As mentioned before there is nothing in the C# language that dictates the layout, I personally use regions, and I do something like this for an average class. public class myClass { #region Private Members #endregion #region Public Properties #endregion #region Constructors #endregion #region Public Methods #endregion } It makes sense to me anyway
