Azure AccountName and AccountSharedKey problem

I'm obviously not smart enough to figure it out on my own. Even after reading the very similar question , I'm still far from solving this problem. I'm sure that once again stackoverflow community will save me. I'm trying to update ServiceConfiguration.cscfg file and I'm having problem to get the right account name. It's also possible that I'm using the wrong AcountSharedKey. ;AccountKey= "/> Let assume that I have the following endpoint: http://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net And my primary access key: "some_very_long_key" I tried to put these values in DiagnosticsConnectionString section. Somethihg like this: I'm oviously doing something wrong and I'm sure that you know what it is. While waiting for someone to help me I also try this without any success: UPDATE: When I try to publish, I see a message box with the following error: There was a problem sending the command to the program.
