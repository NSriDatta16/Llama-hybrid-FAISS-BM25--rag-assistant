Derivative of Logistic Loss function

I was trying to find the derivative of logistic loss for all observations but I got stuck on the following step $$\frac{dZ}{d{{\theta }_{1}}}\frac{d\sigma }{dZ}\frac{dL}{d\sigma }$$ whete $Z$ is ${{\theta }^{T}}x$, ${\sigma }$ is the activation function and $L$ is the loss function. Now, $L$ is average of summation of all losses. $\frac{dL}{d\sigma }$ will reduce to average of some sum i.e. $$\frac{dZ}{d{{\theta }_{1}}}\frac{d\sigma }{dZ}\sum{something}$$ Now I am confused about how to proceed. I also saw this derivation which is directly derived w.r.t. ${\theta }$, but when I try to derive I get stuck in the step above. Which aspect am I missing out?
