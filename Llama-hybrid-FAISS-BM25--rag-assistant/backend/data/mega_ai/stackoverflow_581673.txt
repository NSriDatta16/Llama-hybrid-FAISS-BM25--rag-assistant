How to Make a Mouse Scroll Programmatically?

Related question: mouse drag & drop (identical code snippet) how do I a make mouse scroll programmatically? I've tried: SetCursorPos(32, 32); mouse_event((uint)MouseEventFlags.RIGHTDOWN,0,0,0,0); mouse_event((uint)MouseEventFlags.RIGHTUP,0,0 ,0,0); SetCursorPos(38, 38); mouse_event((uint)MouseEventFlags.LEFTDOWN,0,0 ,0,0); mouse_event((uint)MouseEventFlags.LEFTUP,0,0 ,0,0); The above code-snippet opens the top-left most item in a screen. Does anyone have a code-snippet that will made the mouse scroll?
