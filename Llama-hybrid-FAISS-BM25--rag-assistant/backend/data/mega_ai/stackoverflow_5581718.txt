Browser renders html. IE and some others open the xml file with formatting, but that's not the default behaviour of browsers - so you should not rely on it. Better solution for me is to suggest to download file, and the user will decide whenever he wants to save the file or open it. But in case you don't want file download, than you have to generate html from your xml. That's the case when you should make some formatting, add css styles for it to be more user friendly and readable.

But in case you also don't want this, and you really dont care about user experience, you could use some text element (p, span, etc) and write xml not directly into new window, but in this element's text. That way your xml will be displayed as is
