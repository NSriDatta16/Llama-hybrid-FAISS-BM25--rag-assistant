threshold cutoff value from ROC for test set evaluation, do I use the cutoff from test ROC or training ROC

Let's say I am doing logistic regression. I split my data into training and test. I get an ROC for my training data and it has a cut-off of 0.25 I calculate my evaluation metrics, let's say just specificity and get 70%. Then I do an ROC for my test data, and it has a cut-off of 0.4 If I use the cutoff value from training ROC (of 0.25) I get a specificity of 55%, but if I use cutoff from test ROC (of 0.4) I get specificity of 68%. Which one do I use and why?
