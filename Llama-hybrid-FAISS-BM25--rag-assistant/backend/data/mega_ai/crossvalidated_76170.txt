No, there is no power test. The 60 data points suggested by Box-Jenkins and the 36 by Makradakis are arbitrary and are more from the mind set of a "best fit" modeling approach. I am of the belief that any time series can be modeled. The signal to noise ratio determines how well you can identify a pattern that would be more complicated than a mean model with some outliers, for example.
