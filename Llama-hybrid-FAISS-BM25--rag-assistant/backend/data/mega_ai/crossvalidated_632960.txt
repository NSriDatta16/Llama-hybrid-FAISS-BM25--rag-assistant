Time Series with gaps in the dependent variable

I have a time series data with a dependent variable representing a stock market value of some stock. This data is available for weekdays, but unavailable for weekends as there is no trade. In addition I have values of some independent variables. This data includes weekends in addition to weekdays. What should I do in this situation ? Erasing the rows with missing weekend data will cause for data loss of the independent variables. Filling the gaps with the last observation (last observation carried forward?) ? Filling the gaps with some sort of average ?
