Tolerance and confidence in the minimum multi-variate effective sample size (minESS)

The minimum multi-variate effective sample size ( minESS ) is defined in the R package mcmcse (where the function is implemented) as: the minimum effective sample size required for a specified relative tolerance level It depends on the number of free parameters being sampled by the MCMC algorithm, and on two other parameters: $\epsilon$, and $\alpha$, defined as: $\epsilon$: tolerance level. $\alpha$: confidence level. In this answer the above parameters are described as: $\epsilon$: the precision. $\epsilon$ is the fraction of error you want the Monte Carlo to be in comparison to the posterior error. This is similar to the margin of error idea when doing sample size calculations in the classical setting. $\alpha$: the level for constructing confidence intervals. This answer also describes $\alpha$ as the " confidence in your estimate " and $\epsilon$ as the " Monte Carlo error ". The meaning of $(\alpha\,, \epsilon)$ is still not entirely clear to me. Could you describe these parameters as basically as possible (ie: aimed at non-statisticians)?
