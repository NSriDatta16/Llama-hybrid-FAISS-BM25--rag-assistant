Weighted average of measurements with unequal errors

Suppose I have the numbers below. Consider them as results of some measurement. 22.73 +2.15 -1.81 23.81 +1.77 -1.54 28.6 +11.4 -6.4 29.59 +8.58 -5.43 The numbers on the 2nd and 3rd columns are the errors associated to the values in the 1st one. I would like to know how to calculate an average of those numbers taking the errors in account. According to what I saw on the net, I should use a weighted average, but I was unable to find an example which uses values like those above, i.e. with unequal errors.
