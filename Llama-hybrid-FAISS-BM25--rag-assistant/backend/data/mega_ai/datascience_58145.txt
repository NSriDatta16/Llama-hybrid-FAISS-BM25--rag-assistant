How can I implement Double-Exponential Smoothing for my data?

I have a time series problem that I'm dealing with and I'm looking for guidance on how to implement Double/Triple-Exponential Smoothing algorithm to predict my data. My problem is Taxi demand prediction. I have Jan-2015 data. About my data: I have number of taxi pickups in $10$ minutes time-bins. $i.e$ each no_pickups entry is in 10 minutes bin and time-bins are from, $\text{01-01-2015 00:00:00}$ to $\text{31-01-2015 00:00:00}.$ There are about 4464 data-points because (31(days) * 24(hours) * 60(mins)) / 10(mins) = 4464 (time-bins) How can I use these previous values to forecast it for Feb-2015? I would really appreciate if you could tell me how to proceed with such problem and really looking forward to detailed answer so I can follow along. If anyone can help me out do let me know. Example of data-set: # Here's a sample data head. time_bin n_pickups (01-01-2015 00:00:00 - 01-01-2015 00:10:00] 50 (01-01-2015 00:10:00 - 01-01-2015 00:20:00] 108 (01-01-2015 00:20:00 - 01-01-2015 00:30:00] 160 ......... ... ......... ... ......... ... (31-01-2015 23:50:00 - 01-02-2015 00:00:00] 32
