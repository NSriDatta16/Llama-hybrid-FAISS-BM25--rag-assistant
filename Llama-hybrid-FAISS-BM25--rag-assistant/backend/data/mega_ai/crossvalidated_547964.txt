As you have a time series which is non-stationary, your most important step will be to stationarise the time series as much as possible. It's difficult to recommend precisely without seeing your data but potentially: Difference the data to make it non-cumulative. Subtract mean and divide by standard deviation. Given a more appropriate time series target (and that your problem is univariate), I think the most simple methods would be any autoregressive-based method (e.g. ARIMA).
