Object Oriented CSS: Catchy Buzz-phrase or Legitimate Design Approach?

It seems there is a new catch-phrase emerging in the web development field: object-oriented CSS. On the face of it, this strikes me as simply being best-practice packaged up in a catchy slogan. I understand and fully respect the intentions behind the movement, but is there any more to it? Does anyone have any further insight that sets this approach apart as something more credible or should I just take it as a reminder to make sure I inherit and cascade my classes correctly?
