Nested CV is not a model-selection procedure. It does not return hyperparameters. It is a method to estimate a generalization error of a model-selection procedure. It does not matter how you decide to choose your model/tune your hyperparameters in the inner loop. Just run it once to get an estimate of your generalization error, and then run exactly the same inner loop on the whole dataset to get your final model. You will need to decide in advance if you would like to use the Brier Score, the AUC, or a combination (you could go for a weighted average or use a model with the highest Brie in a certain quantile of AUC or anything you can dream up) to tune the hyperparameters and then do it exactly in the same way when fitting the final model.
