Alternatives to SQL COUNT(*) practices?

I was looking for improvements to PostgreSQL/InnoDB MVCC COUNT(*) problem when I found an article about implementing a work around in PostgreSQL . However, the author made a statement that caught my attention: MySQL zealots tend to point to PostgreSQL’s slow count() as a weakness, however, in the real world, count() isn’t used very often, and if it’s really needed, most good database systems provide a framework for you to build a workaround. Are there ways to skip using COUNT(*) in the way you design your applications? Is it true that most applications are designed so they don't need it? I use COUNT() on most of my pages since they all need pagination. What is this guy talking about? Is that why some sites only have a "next/previous" link? Carrying this over into the NoSQL world, is this also something that has to be done there since you can't COUNT() records very easily?
