I would say go for it. Analyzing code coverage can help even a single developer, maybe even moreso than a team, since you basically have the whole system on your shoulders. If you're the only developer, you have full control over what tools you use, and how you want things setup. Once/if more developers are added, you'll have all the tools in place to create quality software.
