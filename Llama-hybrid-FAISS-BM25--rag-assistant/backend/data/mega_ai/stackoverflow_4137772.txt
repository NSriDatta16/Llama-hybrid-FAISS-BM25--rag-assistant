HQL query to get parent of an object

I'm an absolute hql newbie so bear with me... How do I write a hql query to retrieve the parent object of a child object? I've got an object/table TrackClass with a one-to-many relationship with Track. Knowing Track, I would like to get the parent TrackClass. Right now I'm resorting to SQL, but I'm sure it could be written more elgantly with a single hql statement. string tcID = session.CreateSQLQuery("select trackclassid from track where trackid = " + t.TrackID).UniqueResult().ToString(); if (tcID != null) { trackclass = TrackClassDao.GetTrackClass(Convert.ToInt32(tcID), session); } The TrackClassDao.GetTrackClass method simply loads the TrackClass using the session after finding the correct TrackClassID with the SQL.
