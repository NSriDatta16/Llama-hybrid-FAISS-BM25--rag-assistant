Within-group covariance matrix is the average of covariance matrices of each group, weighted by the groups' weight. And between-group covariance matrix is the covariance matrix of the group means (centroids), weighted by the groups' weight. What LDA aims to achieve, is minimal variance within groups and maximal variance between groups.
