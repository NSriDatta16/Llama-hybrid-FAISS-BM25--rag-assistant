When (if ever) is a frequentist approach substantively better than a Bayesian?

Background : I do not have an formal training in Bayesian statistics (though I am very interested in learning more), but I know enough--I think--to get the gist of why many feel as though they are preferable to Frequentist statistics. Even the undergraduates in the introductory statistics (in social sciences) class I am teaching find the Bayesian approach appealing--"Why are we interested in calculating the probability of the data, given the null? Why can't we just quantify the probability of the null hypothesis? Or the alternative hypothesis? And I've also read threads like these , which attest to the empirical benefits of Bayesian statistics as well. But then I came across this quote by Blasco (2001; emphasis added): If the animal breeder is not interested in the philosophical problems associated with induction, but in tools to solve problems, both Bayesian and frequentist schools of inference are well established and it is not necessary to justify why one or the other school is preferred. Neither of them now has operational difficulties, with the exception of some complex cases... To choose one school or the other should be related to whether there are solutions in one school that the other does not offer , to how easily the problems are solved, and to how comfortable the scientist feels with the particular way of expression results. The Question : The Blasco quote seems to suggest that there might be times when a Frequentist approach is actually preferable to a Bayesian one. And so I am curious: when would a frequentist approach be preferable over a Bayesian approach? I'm interested in answers that tackle the question both conceptually (i.e., when is knowing the probability of the data conditioned on the null hypothesis especially useful?) and empirically (i.e., under what conditions do Frequentist methods excel vs. Bayesian?). It would also be preferable if answers were conveyed as accessibly as possible--it would be nice to take some responses back to my class to share with my students (though I understand some level of technicality is required). Finally, despite being a regular user of Frequentist statistics, I am actually open to the possibility that Bayesian just wins across the board.
