Working effectively with unit tests / Anyone tried the in-assembly approach?

I'm trying to re-introduce unit testing into my team as our current coverage is very poor. Our system is quite large 40+ projects/assemblies. We current use a project named [SystemName].Test.csproj were all the test code is dumped and organised to represent the namespaces using folders. This approach is not very scalable and makes it difficult to find tests. I've been thinking about added a Tests folder to each project, this would put the unit tests "in the developers face" and make them easy to find. The downside is the Production release code would contain references to nunit, nmocks as well as the test code and test data.... Has anyone tried this approach? How is everyone else working with unit tests on large projects? Having a Tests project per "real" project/assembly would introduce too many new projs. Thanks in advance
