Plone and all its add-ons support Unicode by default, you don't need to configure the encoding at any level. Even when using RelStorage, we only store binary data inside the SQL database and no strings, so there's no de/encoding taking place at this level. Changing the Python default encoding in site.py or sitecustomize.py is actually harmful and you should not do this. It will only mask actual programming errors inside the code base and can lead to inconsistent data. Inside the codebase we do use a mixture of both Unicode and utf-8 encoded strings. So generally your code will have to be written in a way to handle both of these. This is unfortunate but a side-effect of us slowly migrating to proper Unicode at all levels.
