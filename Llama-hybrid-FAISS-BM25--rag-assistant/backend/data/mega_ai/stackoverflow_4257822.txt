You can use a neural networks library and teach it to recognize different speech patterns. This will require some know how behind the general theory of neural networks and how they can be used to create systems that will behave a particular way. If you know nothing about the subject, you can get started on just the basics and then use a library rather than implementing something yourself. Hope that helps.
