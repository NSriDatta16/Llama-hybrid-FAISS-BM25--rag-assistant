Are @ManagedBeans obsolete in JavaEE6 because of @Named in CDI/Weld?

Because of CDI (and its implementation Weld), every POJO in JEE6 can be annotated with @Named , which makes the POJO accessible to the view. Does that mean that ManagedBeans are completely obsolete now? Or did I miss something where @ManagedBean still makes sense?
