Because (g)make has many non-intuitive aspects, e.g. its backward chaining, I'd highly recommend having a look at Robert Mecklenburg's book Managing Projects with GNU Make . Or even better is Andrew Talbot's Managing Projects with Make (second edition), which I feel has the better introduction to make. (IMHO naturally).
