PHP: Formatting the day number suffix in php with date()

I feel a bit silly for this one, but is there a more elegant way to format the day number suffix (st, th) other than by having to call the date() 3 times? What I am trying to output in html: January, 1 st , 2011 What I am doing now (feels very heavy) in php: //I am omitting the tags: echo date('M j',$timestamp) . ' ' . date('S', $timestamp) . ' ' . date(' Y', $timestamp); Anyone knows a better way?
