Bayes Factor A/B Testing

I am just starting to look at Bayesian statistics and so far I am aware that Bayes factor summarizes some form of evidence of an alternative hypothesis against the null one. As far as I know we can compare two competing models that use the same data, but is it not possible in any way to apply it to A/B testing?
