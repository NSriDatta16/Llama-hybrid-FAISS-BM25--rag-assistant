So you have a univariate time series and you want model it/forecast it, right? You have chosen to use an ARIMA type model. The parameters of the depend on what's best for your dataset. But how do you find out? A recent approach is "Automatic time series forecasting" by Hyndman & Khandakar (2008) ( pdf ). The algorithm tries different versions of p, q, P and Q and chooses the one with the smallest AIC, AICc or BIC. It is implemented in the auto.arima() function of the forecast R package . The choice of information criterion depends on the which parameters you pass to the function. For a linear model, choosing a model with the smallest AIC can equivalent to leave-one-out cross-validation. You should also make sure that you have enough data, at least four years. Some important checks: Does the model make sense? For example, if you have monthly retails sales, you will probably expect a seasonal model to be fit. How well does it forecast out of sample?
