I thought of an interesting solution to this problem and wanted to share it. function rand7() { var returnVal = 4; for (var n=0; n I built a test function that loops through rand7() 10,000 times, sums up all of the return values, and divides it by 10,000. If rand7() is working correctly, our calculated average should be 4 - for example, (1+2+3+4+5+6+7 / 7) = 4. After doing multiple tests, the average is indeed right at 4 :)
