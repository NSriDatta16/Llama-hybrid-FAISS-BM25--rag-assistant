Ant is still a major player. In my experience, it is dominant. Plus, with Ivy, it handles some of Maven's strengths. IMO, Ant will become a framework for other tools: XML is too rigid (see link below). Maven 2 is also a major player. I know people who quite like it and bristle at criticisms that were true for Maven 1 (it has come a long way). Groovy is offering some cool stuff in the build space, because they build on Ant. Gant is used in Grails, but may be subsumed into Gradle. These can be used for Java as well. At the risk of pimping my own blog, here is a post about Gant and Gradle. Here is a link to the very current debate about their future.
