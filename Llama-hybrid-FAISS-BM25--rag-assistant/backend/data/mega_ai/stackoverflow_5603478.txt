I feel dirty even suggesting this, but: Here's a more relevant manual page than the page you were referencing . In particular, pay attention to the string: prefix to the "filename" passed in the display method call. You can simply pull the template data out of your database (a horrible idea, IMNSHO) and pass it to Smarty that way. No need to build your own custom resource thing unless you really want to do it that way. I, for one, would urge you to keep it as stupid, ugly and obvious as possible, as to remind yourself about how much of a horrible, no-good idea this is. I'd like to remind you that Smarty compiles to PHP , and placing Smarty code in the database is an effective gateway to arbitrary code execution, a severe security vulnerability.
