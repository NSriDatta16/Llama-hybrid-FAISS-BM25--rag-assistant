You could run a CCA and see what it says. But, CCA optimizes a least squares objective function. If you interpret the objective function as a possibly-penalized (and scaled) log likelihood, then the corresponding PDF is a Gaussian, not a coin-flip. You may lose some statistical efficiency compared to a more custom-built model, and if you want to test hypotheses, you may have to rely on an approximate null distribution. Least square formulation of CCA Relationship between coupled matrix factorization and CCA Objective function of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) Perhaps a more important question: is CCA really what you want, even disregarding the binary data issue? You write "I would like to know what features are highly correlated with the features in second data set." This sounds like a feature selection problem where it would be more useful to (for instance) run an L1-penalized logistic regression with X as the covariates and Y as the response.
