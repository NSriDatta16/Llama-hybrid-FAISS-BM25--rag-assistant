How to programmatically move a window slowly, as if the user were doing it?

I am aware of the MoveWindow() and SetWindowPos() functions. I know how to use them correctly. However, what I am trying to accomplish is move a window slowly and smoothly as if a user is dragging it. I have yet to get this to work correctly. What I tried was getting the current coordinates with GetWindowRect() and then using the setwindow and movewindow functions, incrementing Right by 10 pixels each call. Any ideas? Here is what I had beside all my definitions. while(1) { GetWindowRect(notepad,&window); Sleep(1000); SetWindowPos( notepad, HWND_TOPMOST, window.top - 10, window.right, 400, 400, TRUE ); }
