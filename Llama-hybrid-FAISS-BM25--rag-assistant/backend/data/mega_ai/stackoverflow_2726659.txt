Is there a way to programatically popup the "Microsoft Silverlight Configuration" dialog?

I am building for Silverlight 4, and I handle MouseRightButtonDown events and build my own ContextMenu's (a class from the Silverlight Toolkit). I would like to add the classic " Silverlight " menu item to my menus, and give the user the familiar option of launching the " Microsoft Silverlight Configuration " dialog. This is the dialog lets users manage Updates, Webcams, Permissions, and Application Storage. So I need a way to programatically launch the dialog when the menu item is clicked. I can be done for Flash, and it would seem that Microsoft would want to encourage developers to support that option. Can it be done?
