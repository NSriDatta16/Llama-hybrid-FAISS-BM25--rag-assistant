Simple jQuery draggable image slider

I have been searching for some time now with no success for a simple jQuery draggable image slider. I am new to jQuery. This needs to display images of the same height, around 600px, across and off the sides of the page. It needs to be click and draggable, clickable for further info and also to scroll by itself when not being dragged. Please see the image below. http://chrisfraser.co.za/Image%20Slider.png Thanks in advance
