Facebook-Notification like Pullable Screen

Can anybody point me to any public source where I can see how a pullable/draggable screen, like the one in the Facebook application for notifications, is implemented? I have seen also this pattern in the application Ã–ffi for DE/AT/CH/BE/UK. Thanks for any help!
