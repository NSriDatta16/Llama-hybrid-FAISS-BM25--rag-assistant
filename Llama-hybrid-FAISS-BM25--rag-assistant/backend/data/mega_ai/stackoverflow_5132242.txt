We are using the telerik dragdropmanager, and while dragging, the component is raising events to check if you can drop through 100 elements deep. Solution, until they make that configurable (or that you modify it yourself if you have the source code) is to set IsHitTestVisible to false on heavy elements when you start dragging. this worked for us :). Dragging is very fluid, even on pages with a lot of elements
