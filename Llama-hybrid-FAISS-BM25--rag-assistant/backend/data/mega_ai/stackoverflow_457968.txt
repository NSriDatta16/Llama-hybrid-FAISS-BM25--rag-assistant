We find it useful, because vs automatically checks to make sure that certain comments are there. Also, anyone new coming into the organization that has used vs before knows how the comments work, and we don't have to explain a new system of commenting code. On occasion we have generated documentation from it, but really it's just easier for us to use it because it fills in a number of things for you (like some parameter tags etc.)
