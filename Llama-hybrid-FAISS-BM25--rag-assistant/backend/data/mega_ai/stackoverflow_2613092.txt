NoSQL is not about getting better performance out of your SQL database. It is about considering options other than the default SQL storage when there is no particular reason for the data to be in SQL at all. If you have an established SQL Database with a well designed schema and your only new requirement is improved performance, adding indexes and views is definitely the right approach. If you need to save a user profile object that you know will only ever need to be accessed by its key, SQL may not be the best option - you gain nothing from a system with all sorts of query functionality you won't use, but being able to leave out the ORM layer while improving the performance of the queries you will be using is quite valuable.
