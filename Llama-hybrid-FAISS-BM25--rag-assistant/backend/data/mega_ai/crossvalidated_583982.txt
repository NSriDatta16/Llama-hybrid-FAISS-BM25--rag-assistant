Why is it difficult to sample from a multivariate distribution?

The Monte Carlo Markov Chain method requires sampling from a multivariate distribution. This is because the Markov Chain process requires dependent draws. See 1:55 at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LB1VHp4tLE . It is claimed that it is difficult to simultaneously draw from a multivariate distribution. But modern computers and software can sample from a multivariate distribution. So my first question is in which sense is it difficult? Because that is why a solution is proposed which is to sample from a conditional distribution. There is no need to watch the entire video because my question is only about sampling from a multivariate distribution. Why is it difficult to sample from a multivariate distribution as compared to a univariate distribution?
