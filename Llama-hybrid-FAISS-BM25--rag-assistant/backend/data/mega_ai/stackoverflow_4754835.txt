You can provide implicit conversion to-and-from a third-party type for any type that you author yourself, but you cannot add support for implicit conversion between two third-party types. You could improve the elegance of converting between the two types somewhat by adding extension methods to both Vector3 types; public static Bar.Vector3 ToBarVector3(this Foo.Vector3 foo) { return /* instance of Bar.Vector3 */ } public static Foo.Vector3 ToFooVector3(this Bar.Vector3 bar) { return /* instance of Foo.Vector3 */ } That's about the best you can expect to achieve.
