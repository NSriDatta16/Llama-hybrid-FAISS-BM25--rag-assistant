At least two points: A logistic regression (or more generally a generalized linear model) do not imply use of regularization, it is often fitted with mle (maximum likelihood estimation) without any regularization. And, regularization do not necessarily improve the fit . You try to evaluate the fitted model by accuracy, which is not a proper scoring rule . But it is fitted by optimizing another criterion (likelihood.) By including more variables, the criterion it is fitted on will improve (on the training set, that is), but on some other criterion, like accuracy, it does not need to improve. So there is no contradiction! Also see the good comments on the question.
