I personally like Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis by Alan Agresti and Introduction to Generalized Linear Models by Dobson and Barnett Both are very readable and specifically designed for beginners. Math is kept at a minimum while emphasis is given on intuition and the methods are illustrated with many examples. If you are only interested in Logistic regression, then Agresti would be the best choice but if you would also like to see what else is there, besides the classical linear model, Dobson is a good reference. Hope this helps.
