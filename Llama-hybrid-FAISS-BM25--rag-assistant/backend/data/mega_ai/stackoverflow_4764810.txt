Perl, ppm, and trying to download module dependencies

I have Strawberry Perl and PPM installed. I am no stranger to installing modules by hand from CPAN, but recently came into one of those situations where a module required one dependency and -that- dependency required twenty.. So I decided to give PPM a whirl (because that automatically installs dependencies, right?), and I initially thought it worked like Ruby Gems. I loaded it and typed: ppm> install OLE::Storage_Lite from this tutorial . Then I ran into the problem saying 'Could not locate a PPDfile'. So I followed this tutorial which walks you through hooking up a link to a repository, and it still couldn't find the PPD file. My question is: Can anyone help me load a Perl module so I can read and write from Excel files!? Solved: My problem turned out to be a proxy server at work that wouldn't allow me to download packages through PPM.
