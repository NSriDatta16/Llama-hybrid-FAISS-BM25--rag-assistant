Since this is a hugely contentious topic you may have to use more simple/less rigorous mathematics to allow people to understand what you're doing. You're right to be skeptical of just averaging the criteria percentages, in your example it looks like it's easy to score high in criteria 4 so manager B is being assessed in fewer of the easy criteria. Normalization is done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the scores for that criteria. If $X$ is the criteria score with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ then the normalized criteria score $Y$ is given by $$Y=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$$ Normalizing is useful because it accounts for how high the average score is by subtracting the mean (this fixes the problem highlighted for manager B missing out on criteria 4), it also takes account of how spread out the scores are by dividing by the standard deviation. Here's an example to show why dividing by the standard deviation is important. Suppose you have five managers who are assessed on a criteria and get scores of $50\%, 40\%, 60\%, 65\%, 35\%$. The average is 50% so the manager who got 35% was 15 percentage points below the average. Now suppose they are assessed on another criteria and their scores are $50\%, 30\%, 70\%, 80\%, 20\%$. The average is still 50% but now everybody's deviation from 50% is double what it was in the previous criteria. The manager who got 20% is 30 percentage points below the average but since everybody is twice as far from the average in this criteria a 30 percentage point difference in the second criteria is equivalent to a 15 percentage point difference in the first criteria. Dividing by the standard deviation fixes this problem. If you take this approach and normalize all the criteria scores you can average those normalized scores to get a fairer overall assessment of the managers' performance which won't penalize or favour somebody for not being assessed in one criteria.
