The answer by Dr. Manning is the most appropriate if you are considering the JAVA (and Ruby too in hard way ;)). It is here- There is a sentence splitter: edu.stanford.nlp.process.DocumentPreprocessor . Try the command: java edu.stanford.nlp.process.DocumentPreprocessor /u/nlp/data/lexparser/textDocument.txt oneTokenizedSentencePerLine.txt . (This is done via a (good but heuristic) FSM, so it's fast; you're not running the probabilistic parser.) But a little suggestion if we modify the command java edu.stanford.nlp.process.DocumentPreprocessor /u/nlp/data/lexparser/textDocument.txt > oneTokenizedSentencePerLine.txt TO java edu.stanford.nlp.process.DocumentPreprocessor -file /u/nlp/data/lexparser/textDocument.txt > oneTokenizedSentencePerLine.txt . It will work fine as you need to specify what kind of file is being presented as input. So -file for Text file, -html for HTML, etc.
