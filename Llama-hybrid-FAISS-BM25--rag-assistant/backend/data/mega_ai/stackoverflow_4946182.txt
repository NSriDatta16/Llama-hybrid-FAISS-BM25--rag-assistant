Are queries against Azure Table Storage indexed when using a partial RowKey?

I understand from the MS PDC presentations that the PartitionKey is used to load balance the table across multiple servers, but nobody seems to give any advice on whether the PartitionKey is used as an index WITHIN a single server. Likewise, everyone will tell you that specifying the PartitionKey AND the RowKey gets you great performance, but nobody seems to tell you if the RowKey is being used to improve performance WITHIN a PartitionKey. Here are some sample queries to help me frame the questions. Assume the entire table contains 100,000,000 rows. PartionKey="123" and OtherField="def" PartitionKey="123" and RowKey >= "aaa" and RowKey Here are my questions: If I have only 10 rows in each Partition, would Query 1 be fast? If I have 1,000,000 rows in each Partition, would Query 2 be fast?
