Haitao Du is correct that this is the most common approach. Adam Kelleher references Sendhil Mullainathan in talking about machine learning vs social science as follows: In machine learning, the goal is often just to reduce prediction error, and not to estimate the effects of interventions in a system. Social science is much more concerned with the effects of interventions, and how those might inform policy. At IC2S2 recently, in Sendhil Mullainathan’s keynote, he called this the “beta-problem” (the focus on the regression coefficients, more common in social science) and the “y-hat problem” (the focus on the actual prediction, more common in machine learning). That said, as Adam also points out, people working in causal inference ML, building on work by Judea Pearl and others, bridge this gap between ML and social science as they are interested in the beta-problem. The DoWhy package for causal inference in Python by Amit Sharma and Emre Kiciman is a good example. They're also working on a book on this. Another good example is the “ Elements of Causal Inference: Foundations and Learning Algorithms ” book by Jonas Peters and colleagues.
