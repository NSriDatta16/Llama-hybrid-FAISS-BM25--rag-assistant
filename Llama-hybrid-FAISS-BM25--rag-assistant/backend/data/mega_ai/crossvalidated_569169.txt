Handling Missing Not at Random type of Missing Data

I'm working on University Enrollment dataset and trying to predict whether an individual who is admitted will enroll or not. One of the variables in it is the scholarship test. This variable has the scholarship test score in it as well as missing values. I understand from the data that the missing values in this particular variable means that the individual did not take the test So my question is how should I handle this missing data? As per my understanding, this can be considered as Missing not at random type of missing data, since the missing values denote that the individual did not take the test. Can I replace the missing values with 0 because the data points are numeric ? Will that impact the model in any way? The model I'm planning to use is SVM and Random Forest.
