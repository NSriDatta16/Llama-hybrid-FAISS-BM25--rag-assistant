How does SAS compute standard error

I need help with estimated standard errors in SAS. I'm doing logistic regression of and I obtained the score, standard error, pd and lower and upper limit of confidence interval. I also computed these estimates manually for a few observations and I was able to replicate the results for pd and the confidence intervals. I used following formulas for pd and intervals: pd=1/(1+exp(-(xbeta))); up_test=1/(1+exp(-(xbeta+probit(1-0.05/2)*std))); lo_test=1/(1+exp(-(xbeta-probit(1-0.05/2)*std))); But when I manually computed the standard error I obtained different results than the ones produced automatically from model. My question is, what is the formula for standard error used in logistic regression in SAS? I tried using results from maximum likelihood: $\sqrt{(se(intercept)^2 + se(score)^2*(score-averagescore)^2}$ , where $se$ is the standard error but it doesn't work. I hope I described my problem clearly, because i'm not an expert on this. :)
