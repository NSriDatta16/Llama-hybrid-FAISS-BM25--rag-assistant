With your interest in the time to event, this seems for the most part to be compatible with a standard competing-risks survival model. You have 2 mutually exclusive and final event types (ending either in $Y1$ or $Y2$ ), while those remaining in state $Y0$ would be considered "censored" in the sense that the time to an event for those cases hasn't yet been reached. See this vignette , for example. One potentially complicating factor is the granularity of your sequence times. Standard survival analysis works best if time is effectively continuous. Otherwise discrete-time survival analysis might be better, which is essentially a set of logistic regressions (multinomial rather than binomial in this case) at each point of your sequence. I think that's what @kjetil b halvorsen was getting at in a comment on the question. Another thing to consider is the "fixed maximum sequence length, after which all sequences transition to failure by default." With that handling of the final transition, the proportional hazards (PH) assumption underlying approaches like Cox regression wouldn't hold at the end. If you were willing to treat those as censored instead of transitioning explicitly to $Y2$ then you could still get the probability of being such a case (time-to-event greater than final time point) from a Cox or parametric survival model if the PH assumption holds up to that point. Alternatively, such a transition could be handled in discrete-time survival analysis with a separate logistic model for that last time point.
