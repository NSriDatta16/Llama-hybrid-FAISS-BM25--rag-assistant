Using coefficient of variation in lab testing

In order to determine the accuracy of a specific method, I need to determine if the results are statistically precise. In the example below, I am taking a sample from 7 individuals and running their sample twice. For each row I calculated the mean SD and Coefficient of Variation. Ideally the CV should be My question is whether or not it is acceptable to average the CV values to get one CV. Or is there another more appropriate way to approach this problem?
