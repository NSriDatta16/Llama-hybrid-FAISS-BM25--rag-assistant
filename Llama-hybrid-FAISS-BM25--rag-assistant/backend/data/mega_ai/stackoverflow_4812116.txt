Use any of the SSH tools (there are a bunch opensources, e.g., ganymade) Ref: http://java-source.net/open-source/network-clients/ganymed-ssh-2-for-java I have not used this particular one, but other ssh clients to do what you want. PS: You really do not need a ServerSocket for this, but use of threads is helpful.
