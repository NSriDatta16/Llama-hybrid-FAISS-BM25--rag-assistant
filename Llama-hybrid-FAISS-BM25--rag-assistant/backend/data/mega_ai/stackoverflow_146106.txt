How should I organize the contents of my CSS file(s)?

This question is about organizing the actual CSS directives themselves within a .css file. When developing a new page or set of pages, I usually just add directives by hand to the .css file, trying to refactor when I can. After some time, I have hundreds (or thousands) of lines and it can get difficult to find what I need when tweaking the layout. Does anyone have advice for how to organize the directives? Should I try to organize top-down, mimicking the DOM? Should I organize functionally, putting directives for elements that support the same parts of the UI together? Should I just sort everything alphabetically by selector? Some combination of these approaches? Also, is there a limit to how much CSS I should keep in one file before it might be a good idea to break it off into separate files? Say, 1000 lines? Or is it always a good idea to keep the whole thing in one place?
