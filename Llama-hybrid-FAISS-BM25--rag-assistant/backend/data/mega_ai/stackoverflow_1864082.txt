Rails - Roles or Inheritance?

I began writing an app using declarative_authorization ( http://github.com/stffn/declarative_authorization ) but I'm now wondering if it's the correct approach. In my app, I was giving some Users a "customer" role, some an "administrator" role, and some a "superadmin" role. That was working fine, but I now realise that I need some fields on the models which are specific to the "customer" Superadmin = administrator editor Admin = customer editor Customer = has extra attributes like "avatar" At this point I began creating a Customer model which inherited from User. However in that case, Customers would always have the "customer" role and only customers would have that role. That seemed a bit strange. I guess I'm looking for a bit of guidance for this scenario.
