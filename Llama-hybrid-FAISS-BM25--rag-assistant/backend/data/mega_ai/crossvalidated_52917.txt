If you are sure the categorical attribute is actually ordinal, then just treat it as numerical attribute. If not, use some coding trick to turn it into numerical attribute. According to the suggestion by the author of libsvm, one can simply use 1-of-K coding. For instance, suppose a 1-dimensional category attribute taking value from $\{A,B,C\}$. Just turn it into 3-dimensional numbers such that $A = (1,0,0)$, $B = (0,1,0)$, $C = (0,0,1)$. Of course, this will incur significantly additional dimensions in your problem, but I think that is not a serious problem for modern SVM solver (no matter Linear type or Kernel type you adopt).
