The Pragmatic iPad book is coming out soon. The main author, Daniel Steinberg, is a good writer. You can download some sample chapters from it too. There's not all that much extra to know. Mostly you need to learn about split-view controllers and popovers. If you absolutely must have a book now, the Wrox: Beginning iPad seems pretty good, but you'll go over a lot of info you've already learned Apress has one for iPhone converts too: Beginning iPad Development for iPhone Developers . Jack Nutting (very good writer, author of the Apress Cocoa book) is the second author.
