This is a guess here, but based on your comments it sounds like you've successfully rewritten the Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Price class. However , Magento's rewrite system isn't the "true" duck-typing/monkey-patching you see in Ruby/Python. The rewrite will only work if the core code is instantiating a Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Price via the class alias catalog/product_type_price . It doesn't work with an objet that's an instance of a class that inherits from Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Price . So, consider this #File: app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Model/Product/Type/Configurable/Price.php My guess is the page you're loading instantiates a Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Configurable_Price . That's why your rewrite appears to be working when you instantiate a catalog/product_type_price in isolation, but when the system instantiates a catalog/product_type_configurable_price your rewrite doesn't (and can't) be triggered. Long story short, try rewriting the catalog/product_type_configurable_price model instead and see if you have more luck. If that doesn't work you'll need to track down where the Magento core code is instantiating these objects, and debug what's going on. Providing more context for your code can help people here help you with that problem.
