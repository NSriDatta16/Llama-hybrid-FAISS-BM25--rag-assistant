Combining/updating parameters from multiple estimations

Take a simple example of performing two independent linear regressions on a set of x-y data, in the form of y = mx + b, each using half of the data. I will obtain two separate estimates for m1, b1, m2, and b2. I could then obtain how confident I am in estimating each of the parameters. I wish to find the global m and b. My question is, how would I update my first estimate (m1, b1) with my latter estimate result (m2, b2)? Assuming I no longer have access to the full dataset and am only left with the estimates and their confidence? If these were independent parameters, I can update them using Bayesian Inference (ie. weighted average based on the confidences), but can I look at m and b independently? For example, if I manage to estimate m1 and b2 with 100% confidence, and m2 and b1 with 0%, then taking m1x + b2 as the best model would be wrong? In actuality, this problem arises from performing online parameter estimations. Given a polynomial model structure with unknown coefficients to be estimated, a new set of parameters are estimated at each interval and updates the prior. However, I struggle to figure out how to merge these coefficients with the prior since mix-and-matching the coefficients independently would result in a Frankenstein of an equation that resembles nothing. Any input would be greatly appreciated.
