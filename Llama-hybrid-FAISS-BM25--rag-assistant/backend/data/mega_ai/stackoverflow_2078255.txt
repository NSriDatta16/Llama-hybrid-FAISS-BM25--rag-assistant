Is hosting the processing side of a web app on Amazon EC2 a good idea?

I've got a web app which has pretty intensive processor requirements, specifically in relation to the amount of data that gets stored. Because of the massive amounts of data coming in and out (and being sorted, formatted, etc), I'm routinely bringing the server down. The problem is usually CPU related, not memory related, and it is happening because of the massive number of inserts, updates, and selects to the database. The really processor intensive stuff is done in the background, all run via scheduled cron jobs. The front end, where the users are interacting, is relatively simple. In order to keep the server up and running quickly, I have to slow down the background processes significantly. I hate to do this, because it limits the whole apps usefulness. It seems to me that this would be an ideal candidate for something like EC2 - leave the front end files and interaction on the server, and outsource all the processing and data storage to the cloud. However, after doing some reading on EC2, this doesnt sound nearly as simple as I thought it might be - questions of persistent storage and the constant suggestion that I "change the way I think" about cloud computing are making me nervous - mostly because I hear that, but don't get an explanation of what the change should be. Can someone help me understand if what I've got is a good candidate for EC2, or some other type of system?
