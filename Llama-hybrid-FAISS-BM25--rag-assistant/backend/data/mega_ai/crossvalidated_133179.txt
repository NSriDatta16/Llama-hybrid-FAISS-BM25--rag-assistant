Since I'm quite interested in the mixture analysis , I took the liberty to perform a brief research to see, if there is something new (both due to my limited knowledge of the subject and due to time elapsed since the original posting) on the topic, related to your question. The results follow. In terms of the reasons of why one would want to use Student-t distribution instead of Gaussian (based on the discussion in comments) in the context of financial industry, I have found this interesting presentation slides document , which clarified the rationale to me (starting from page 4). In terms of the algorithms for Student-t distribution's mixture analysis, I have discovered several interesting research papers, such as this general paper and this financial industry-focused paper . Finally, in terms of the R packages that are focused on or support Student-t distribution-based mixture analysis, I have discovered several packages that are either relatively new or simply haven't been mentioned in previous discussion. So, I thought it might be beneficial to list them: package AdMit : home page , brief introductory note and more detailed vignette ; package MitISEM : home page and vignette ; package EMMIXskew : home page and vignette .
