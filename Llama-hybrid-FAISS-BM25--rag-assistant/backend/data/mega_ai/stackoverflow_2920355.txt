When you say 'play Flash movies' I assume you are referring to the video 'codec' and not the Flash browser plugin technology itself. As far as I'm aware Flash supports it's own .flv video format and H.264 format. HTML5 video doesn't specify a codec to use, some HTML5 browsers support the H.264 codec (Chrome, Safari and IE9), others support Ogg Theora (Firefox, Opera, Chrome). If you have a Flash video that is in H.264 then in theory it should work as an HTML5 in Chrome, Safari and IE9, but not in other browsers. Your best bet is to use HTML5 video in H.264, and default back to Flash video if either HTML5 isn't supported (IE8 and below), or if the video codec isn't supported. Or you could encode in H.264 and Ogg to switch between them depending on the browser, but your storage and processing requirements go up. To add to the confusion there is a third video codec for HTML5 called VP8 (or WebM) recently acquired and Open-sourced by Google, this will be supported in Firefox, Opera, Chrome and IE9, but not Safari. Given the confusing landscape for HTML5 video at the moment, you might be better off sticking with Flash until things clear up, unless you don't mind the extra effort, or you need your videos to play on iPods/Pads
