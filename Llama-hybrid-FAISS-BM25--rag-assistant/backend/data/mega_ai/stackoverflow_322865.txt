Most likely what is hapening is they are giving you a link to a script that is building the image and returning it on the fly, there is nothing aside from no allowing users to use external images, that you can do about it, one option to prevent it is to download and store the image on your server as opposed to linking to the external image. --I decided to provide a sample This image is created on the fly, the url I'm giving is: http://unkwndesign.com/profilePic.png : alt text http://unkwndesign.com/profilePic.png now, profilePic.png is a folder that when requested is providing index.php which, using gd, is getting the SO logo, and imposing your IP address over it, to be very clear here I AM NOT LOGING THIS OR ANY OTHER DATA the source for the index.php is: Since I am returning an image, with a proper extension, and the proper mime-type there is no way to detect what I am doing. If the server had downloaded my image and stored it locally the IP address would be that of the server, which would ruin the fun of doing it and likely prove to be enough of a discurageing factor to stop the behavior.
