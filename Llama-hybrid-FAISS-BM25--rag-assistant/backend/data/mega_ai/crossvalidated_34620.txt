The simple way to work it out is that a test with high specificity has a high proportion of disease negative patients resulting in test negatives. Therefore high specificity implies low false positive rate. When you are not very convinced a patient has a condition you want to make sure a test is only likely to give a positive result if the patient has the condition. From a Bayesian perspective, let $P(D+)$ be your prior belief that the patient has the disease. Let $T+$ and $T-$ denote the outcomes test positive and test negative respectively. $sensitivity = P(T+\mid D+)$ and $specificity = P(T- \mid D-)$ By Bayes' rule $P(D+ \mid T+) = \frac{P(T+ \mid D+)P(D+)}{P(T+)} = \frac{sensitivity \times P(D+)}{P(T+)} = \frac{sensitivity \times P(D+)}{P(T+ \mid D+)P(D+)+P(T+ \mid D-)P(D-)} = \frac{sensitivity \times P(D+)}{sensitivity \times P(D+)+(1-specificity)\times P(D-)}$ A similar formula can be constructed for $P(T- \mid D-)$. You should observe that when the prior belief that the patient has the disease is small the denominator is strongly affected by $specificity$
