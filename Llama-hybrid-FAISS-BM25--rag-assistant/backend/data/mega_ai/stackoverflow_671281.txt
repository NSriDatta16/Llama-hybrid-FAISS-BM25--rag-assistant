I usually take this approach: Have a global settings variable for your application that points to the folder where you store uploaded files. In your database store the relative paths to the files (relative to what the settings variable points to). So if a file is located at /www/uploads/image.jpg, your settings varible points to /www/uploads your database row has image.jpg. This is a flexible way that decouples your systems directory structure from your application. Further you can fragment file storage in directories based on what database tables these relate to. Say you have a table user_reports and a table user_photos. You store the files that relate to user_reports in /www/uploads/user_reports. If you have large number of user uploads you can implement fragmentaion even further. Say a user uploads a file on 20.03.2009, the file is called report.pdf, so you store it at /www/uploads/user_reports/2009/03/20/report.pdf.
