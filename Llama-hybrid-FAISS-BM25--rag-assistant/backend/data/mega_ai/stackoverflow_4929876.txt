Array data to nested HTML

I'm having trouble converting an array into correctly nested HTML. Assuming I have an array with the following example values - An, Author---Some Book Another, Author---A Book Another, Author---Another Book Be, Author---Book 1 Be, Author---Book 2 No, Author---Book 1 How do turn that into an organised HTML like - A An, Author Some Book Another, Author A Book Another Book B Be, Author Book 1 Book 2 N No, Author Book 1 I don't have any trouble with PHP, its just I'm not sure how I would organise the data. Split into three different arrays (Letters, Authors, Books) before pulling the data back together? But then how would I associate the books (Letter->Author->Book)? Thanks for any ideas.
