is there a deep learning model that handle 47800+ classes for classification?

I am trying to build a text classifier with 47893 classes and 1.3 billion (1,302,687,947) data samples. What would be the best classifier to build with such kind of data? Each data label will contain industry, department, specialization, normalized role information and data have title and skills information. I have tried to build a classifier with a small amount of data and I can see the data has enough distinct information to differentiate the class information. Size of the data is 4.56 GB. __label_0043-0010-1002-1005 senior_data_scientist_python,_r,_machine_learning,... Previously I have trained models for around 20 classes with fasttext, but training model with fasttext is not possible and fasttext can run only on a CPU machines. It shows around 10789h to complete training. I know deep learning models on GPU work fine, but which model would be good for such a scenario? Any suggestion is appreciated and I can add any additional information required.
