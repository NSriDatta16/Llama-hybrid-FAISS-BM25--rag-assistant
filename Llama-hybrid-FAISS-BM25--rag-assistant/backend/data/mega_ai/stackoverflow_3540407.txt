Ant and maven are too great build tools. With maven, if you want to do custom builds, you are likely going to have to write your own maven plugin which isn't that hard. There is loads of documentation online to create your own plugin. The cool thing about making a maven plugin is that it is easy to share in an organization or with a team of developers; do share these plugins, you generally need to be hosting your own maven repo. Ant is really quite flexible as it has a really extensive set of tags for doing just about anything including building, running tests, moving files around, checking out code from a repo, and even executing commands on a remote server. In my opinion, ant is a little easier to work with when you have to make custom builds. The problem with ant is that it is more difficult to make into a sharable module that you can share and configure like you can with a maven plugin. Ivy is another popular build tool however, I have no experience with it.
