AIC and deviance don't agree

I'm trying to test the fit of two logistic regression models. I understand that deviance and AIC are good methods for this, but what if one model has better AIC but worse deviance? This is what I think has happened in my case. Here's the summary/anova table from the first logistic regression: Call: glm(formula = winperc ~ prevwinperc, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = New_Data, weights = gp_col) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.9750 -1.0090 0.0503 1.0859 3.7078 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.02740 0.07812 -13.15 and here's the same info for the second: Call: glm(formula = winperc ~ prevPyth, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = New_Data, weights = gp_col) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.9997 -1.1134 0.0745 1.1310 3.7486 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.13383 0.08564 -13.24 So the first model has higher AIC but lower Deviance.
