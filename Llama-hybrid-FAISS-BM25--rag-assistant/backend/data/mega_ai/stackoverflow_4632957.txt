Let start with some definitions. Fortran programs are composed of program units. In so-called Fortran 2008 (current standard) there are five types of program units: main program; external subprogram; module; submodule; block data program unit. Let me concentrate your attention on the first three. Main program As standard claims it is program unit that is not a subprogram, module, submodule, or block data program unit. Not very useful definition. =) What you should know is that main program unit starts with keyword PROGRAM , it is the entry point of application and obviously a program shall consist of exactly one main program. A program may also consist any number (including zero) of other kinds of program units. External subprogram A subprogram defines a procedure. There are two types of procedures and of course two types of subprograms to define them: function subprograms to define functions; subroutine subprograms to define subroutines. A function subprogram is a subprogram that has a FUNCTION statement as its first statement. A subroutine subprogram is a subprogram that has a SUBROUTINE statement as its first statement. Also both procedures and subprograms differ in place of their appearance in program. You can use: external subprograms to define external procedures; internal subprograms to define internal procedures; module subprograms to define module procedures. external subprogram subprogram that is not contained in a main program, module, submodule, or another subprogram internal subprogram subprogram that is contained in a main program or another subprogram module subprogram subprogram that is contained in a module or submodule but is not an internal subprogram Module It is just a definitions (type denitions, procedure denitions, etc.) container. Now small example. main.f90 ! Main program unit. PROGRAM main USE foo IMPLICIT NONE CALL external_bar CALL internal_bar CALL module_bar CONTAINS ! Internal subprogram defines internal procedure. SUBROUTINE internal_bar PRINT *, "inside internal procedure" END SUBROUTINE internal_bar END PROGRAM main foo.f90 ! Module program unit. MODULE foo IMPLICIT NONE CONTAINS ! Module subprogram defines module procedure. SUBROUTINE module_bar PRINT *, "inside module procedure" END SUBROUTINE module_bar END MODULE foo bar.f90 ! External subprogram program unit. ! External subprogram defines external procedure. SUBROUTINE external_bar PRINT *, "inside external procedure" END SUBROUTINE external_bar
