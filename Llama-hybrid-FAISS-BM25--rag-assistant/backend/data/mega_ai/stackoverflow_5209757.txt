File system storage/access to IE cookies

is there any way to list/decode cookies stored by Internet Explorer, w/o running the browser? I am now tinkering with SWT Browser component which provides get/set methods for cookies, but is there any way to see what is really stored by IE itself? UPD : I am using IE7. This location: C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files does not contain cookies if I look at the place with Far Manager. Apparently Explorer mixes them in from some other location or database. Any ideas? UPD2 : Okay, okay. This is my current problem. Some webapp does not work if I restart IE7 and load the same page again (lots of scripting, embedded flash and video streaming). Killing the cookies seems to help, if we do that from within the IE itself. If we programmatically kill the cookies (listed by name) it does not help and page gets stuck on restart/reload sequence. If I manually wipe the cache folder it indeed helps and subsequent page loads work fine. So the question is - do I really wipe the cookies while wiping the Temporary Internet Files folder or not? I just need to know the cause - is it resource cache or some cookie which we don't list in the cleanup sequence.
