Why does the Youden rule does not recommend a threshold of 0.5 on balanced data?

Suppose I have a logistic regression model estimated using a balanced target (equal group sizes). My questions concern the optimal threshold for prediction and it's relationship with the Youden's rule and the estimation of balanced logistic regressions. Question 1) Will the optimal threshold for prediction be necessarily be 0.5 ? Question 2) Will a criteria like the Youden's rule (maximize the difference between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate) recommend an optimal threshold of 0.5 ? Question 3) If the target is unbalanced (i.e. more negatives than positives) and I estimate a weighted logistic regression, how does the answer to the questions above changes ? Thanks in advance.
