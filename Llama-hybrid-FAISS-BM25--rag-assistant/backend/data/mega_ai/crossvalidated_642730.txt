experimental evidence for differences in perception on vertical vs. horizontal scales

I am searching for experimental studies, by Cleveland or anyone else, that test differences in the accuracy of quantitative judgements (or related aspects of visual perception) based on whether data are presented in a horizontal vs. vertical layout. I am generally aware of Cleveland's work (e.g. Cleveland and McGill 1984, 1987) and of many similar experiments done subsequently by others (e.g. Heer and Bostock 2010, Kennedy 2016), but am not aware of any that explicitly consider horizontal vs vertical orientation. A comment below this answer suggests that there's some material in Ch. 4 of the 1985 edition of Cleveland's Elements of Graphing Data ; I have looked at the revised (1994) edition on the Internet Archive but don't see anything; I will have to wait to get a copy of the first edition by interlibrary loan I found a pirated PDF of the 1985 edition online, and see nothing relevant in Ch. 4 there either (only the "Cleveland hierarchy" stuff I knew about already) ... I am aware of discussions of the relative merits of horizontal vs vertical layouts , but as far as I've seen these boil down to the criteria of (1) ease of label positioning/reading (2) cultural conventions in a particular field (3) visual metaphors (4) overall presentation layout/available space (e.g. see here , not anything about perception. (I've also think I've seen speculations about whether perception would differ between Western cultures accustomed to horizontal [mostly left-to-right] reading and Eastern cultures accustomed to vertical reading ...) If the experiment hasn't been done maybe someone should try it ...
