I will explain why anomaly detection should not be considered as classification problem by taking an example of anomaly detection using time series. Let us say we have a time series that has some anomalies, and the anomaly points are present above and below the normal time series points. Now if we apply the clustering method(DBSCAN) to this time series, you will have a cluster something as shown below. Had we considered this problem as a binary classification problem, we would get two clusters, here even though I applied the clusters (k=1) to the algorithm, you can see the anomalous points are no where seen to be forming cluster, they are scattered, this does not make sense to consider as another cluster.
