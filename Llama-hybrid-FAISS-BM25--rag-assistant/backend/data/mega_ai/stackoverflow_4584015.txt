Handle screen orientation changes when there are AsyncTasks running

I've been bugged by this for a while. How do I properly handle screen orientation changes while I have a separate Thread / AsyncTask running? Currently, I have android:configChanges="orientation|keyboard|keyboardHidden" in my AndroidManifest.xml , but that is not really encouraged : Note: Using this attribute should be avoided and used only as a last-resort. Please read Handling Runtime Changes for more information about how to properly handle a restart due to a configuration change. Also, in the 2.3 emulator , it works when switching to landscape , but switching back to portrait fails. Now, the reason why I use configChanges is because when the user switches orientation, I might have an AsyncTask running, doing some network traffic, and I don't want it stopped. Is there any other way of doing this, or is there a way of fixing 2.3 to switch back to portrait? I know about onRetainNonConfigurationInstance , but I'm not sure it would be a good idea to "save" the AsyncTask instance, mainly because the class that extends AsyncTask is not static (so it is tied to the Activity ) -- and it needs to be, because in onPostExecute() it calls methods from the Activity instance.
