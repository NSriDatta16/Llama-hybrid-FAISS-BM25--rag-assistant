In Bayesian statistics the half normal,with a sufficiently large variation parameter, can be used as a noninformative prior distribution on the SD of a standard distribution. This is suggested in, for example: Gelman, A. (2006). Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models. Bayesian analysis, 1, 515-534.
