I have trained neural netowrk with 40-45 technical indicators but the problem comes as misclassification. My actual buy signals are predicted as sell signals and vice versa or hold signals are predicted as buy or sell signals and vice versa which does not help to devise a profitable strategy. I have tested across range of parameter buy no success. I am using combination of movig averages, RSI,MACD,BB,SMI,ADX,ret,sd,mean,return, cimullative return, CCI,CHV,Chaikain volatility, SAR and so on as input to the NN. Noise in the input indicatos causes hevoc.
