It sounds like you only use Assembler because you seem to think that this is necessary. This isn't the case. If you don't have any other reason for it (i.e. wanting to learn it), don't use Assembler here, unless you know exactly what you're doing. For your average graphics engine, Assembler programming is completely unnecessary. Especially when it comes to a Super Mario style 2D sprite engine. Even “slow” scripting languages like Python are fast enough for such things nowadays. Adding to that, if you don't know very precisely what you're doing, Assembler will not be faster than C (in fact, chances are it will be slower because you'll re-implement existing C functions less efficiently).
