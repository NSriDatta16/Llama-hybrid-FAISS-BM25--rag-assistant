SVD PCA reconstruction of data

I have some data about the $\{noise,~ size,~ speed,~ length,~ width\}$ of cars. I have performed SVD, and I want to reconstruct my data using only the first 2 principal components. I subtracted mean from data and then did [U,S,V] = svd(matrix,0) in matlab If I am right the first 2 columns of V would be the first 2 principle components can anyone help me reconstruct the data please. also my data is originally a $14 \times 5$ matrix
