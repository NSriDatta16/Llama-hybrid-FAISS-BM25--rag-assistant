Yes, the "extract" refers to the end of sequence token. We can see this in section 3.3 of the original paper (no idea why they called it "extract" in the figure): All transformations include adding randomly initialized start and end tokens $(\langle s \rangle, \langle e \rangle)$ . The way they apply the final linear layer is described in section 3.2 of the original paper and consists of taking the output of the last Transformer layer $l$ at the last position ( $h^m_l$ in the paper) and use it as input for the linear layer: $P(y|x^1, ..., x^m) = \mathit{softmax}(h^m_l W_y)$
