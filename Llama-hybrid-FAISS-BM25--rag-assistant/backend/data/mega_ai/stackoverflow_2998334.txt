When I'd previously worked in web-development (currently I'm in admin/support) the problem was that the designers couldn't get their heads around the idea of using placeholders which would be substituted later - and for some complex layouts (e.g. a dynamic accordion type hierarchical navigation menu) there was a chicken and egg problem around designing the parts of the stylesheets which handled animation and functionality vs controlling fonts and colours. Even with the most capable of designers, the tools they use don't lend themselves to solving the problem. The approach we ended up taking was that the developers would provide examples of HTML fragments which the designers would then build the pages around, and then the developers would replace the fragments with the dynamically generated content and clean up the style sheets, merging any classes. It was the most pragmatic solution we could arrive at. C.
