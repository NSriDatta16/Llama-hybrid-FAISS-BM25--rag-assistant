I think that there are several issues with your model: First of all - Your generator's loss is not the generator's loss. You have on binary cross-entropy loss function for the discriminator, and you have another binary cross-entropy loss function for the concatenated model whose output is again the discriminator's output (on generated images). The "generator loss" you are showing is the discriminator's loss when dealing with generated images. You want this loss to go up , it means that your model successfully generates images that you discriminator fails to catch (as can be seen in the overall discriminator's accuracy which is at 0.5). Another issue, is that you should add some generator regularization in the form of an actual generator loss ("generator objective function"). You can read about the different options in GAN Objective Functions: GANs and Their Variations . A final issue that I see is that you are passing the generated images thru a final hyperbolic tangent activation function, and I don't really understand why? The generator in your case is supposed to generate a "believable" CIFAR10 image, which is a 32x32x3 tensor with values in the range [0,255] or [0,1]. Your generator's output has a potential range of [-1,1] (as you state in your code).
