I don't know that you can alias file names in the way you'd like. Here are a couple of hacks I can think of for public files embedded freely by a customer: 1) Create one Cloudfront distribution per client, each pointing at the same bucket. Each AWS account can have 100 distributions, so you could support only that many clients. Or, 2) Duplicate the files, using the the client-specific names that you'd like. This is simpler but your file storage costs scale with your clients (which may or may not be significant).
