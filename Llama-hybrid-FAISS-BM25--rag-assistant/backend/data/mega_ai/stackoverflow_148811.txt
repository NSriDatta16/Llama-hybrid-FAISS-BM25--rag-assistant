The method GetDrives() returns a DriveInfo class which has a property DriveType that corresponds to the enumeration of System.IO.DriveType: public enum DriveType { Unknown, // The type of drive is unknown. NoRootDirectory, // The drive does not have a root directory. Removable, // The drive is a removable storage device, // such as a floppy disk drive or a USB flash drive. Fixed, // The drive is a fixed disk. Network, // The drive is a network drive. CDRom, // The drive is an optical disc device, such as a CD // or DVD-ROM. Ram // The drive is a RAM disk. } Here is a slightly adjusted example from MSDN that displays information for all drives: DriveInfo[] allDrives = DriveInfo.GetDrives(); foreach (DriveInfo d in allDrives) { Console.WriteLine("Drive {0}, Type {1}", d.Name, d.DriveType); }
