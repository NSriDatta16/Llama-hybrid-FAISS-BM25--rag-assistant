Yes, I implemented the Aho-Corasick algorithm algorithm in java for the problem you are suggesting and it showed a consistent improvement of about x180 on the naive implementation (what you are doing). There are several implementations available online, although I would tweak them for better performance. Note that the solutions complexity is bounded by the length of the word (in your case the URL) and not the number of sub-strings. furthermore it only requires one pass on average for matching. P.S - we used to give this question to people in job interviews, so there are many ways to solve it. The one I offer is the one we use in production code, which (for now) beats all other solutions. Edit: wrote the wrong algorithm name previously, fixed...
