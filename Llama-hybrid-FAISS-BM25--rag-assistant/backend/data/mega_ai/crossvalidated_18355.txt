It comes down to variance and bias (as usual). CV tends to be less biased but K-fold CV has fairly large variance. On the other hand, bootstrapping tends to drastically reduce the variance but gives more biased results (they tend to be pessimistic). Other bootstrapping methods have been adapted to deal with the bootstrap bias (such as the 632 and 632+ rules). Two other approaches would be "Monte Carlo CV" aka "leave-group-out CV" which does many random splits of the data (sort of like mini-training and test splits). Variance is very low for this method and the bias isn't too bad if the percentage of data in the hold-out is low. Also, repeated CV does K-fold several times and averages the results similar to regular K-fold. I'm most partial to this since it keeps the low bias and reduces the variance. Edit For large sample sizes, the variance issues become less important and the computational part is more of an issues. I still would stick by repeated CV for small and large sample sizes.
