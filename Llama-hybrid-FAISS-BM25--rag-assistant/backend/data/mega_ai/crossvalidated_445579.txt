Hierarchical Forecasting using exogenous variables at each sub level

I am newbie, exploring some concepts for Hierarchical Forecasting using exogenous variables. I am stuck at obtaining an efficient approach where I have to incorporate exogenous variables at each sub level. Example: I need to forecast volume of inventory for an garment industry at country level. This industry has multiple levels of hierarchy for their stores like - 1st Level - zones (East, West, North etc.,) 2nd Level - States in each zone 3rd Level - Cities in each state 4th Level - Stores in each cities 5th Level - Male /Female 6th Level - Sizes (L/M/S) I have exogenous variables at almost each level. The traditional models like PyAF, seer, htsprophet and hts package in R doesn't allow me to provide these exogenous variables at each level. Other approach I thought was to build traditional time series at each level for each entity (this is not an efficient solution). Any thoughts are welcome and highly appreciated.
