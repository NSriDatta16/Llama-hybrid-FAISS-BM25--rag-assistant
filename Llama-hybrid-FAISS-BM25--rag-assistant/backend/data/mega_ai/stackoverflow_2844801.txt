Expectably, almost all forecasting (AI powered or not) techniques have been utilized to attempt an “efficient” stock market prediction. Results posted are not that encouraging, how could they after all; if someone comes up with the holy grail model, he’s not expected to publish it, but use it to make some money, right? In general, a fit gets “optimal” if the trades it suggest have an accuracy bigger than 50% + transaction costs, so that it is expected to return profits to anyone using it. If this sounds feasible, don’t get disappointed with your results; the sure thing is that you’ll get to learn a lot during the process, plus much fun is guaranteed :) with the generous contribution of the MineKnowledge team
