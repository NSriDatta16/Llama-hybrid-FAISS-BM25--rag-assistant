Check Apple's sample project BubbleLevel . You want the SoundEffect.h and SoundEffect.m into your project and then just call: mySound = [[SoundEffect alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:[mainBundle pathForResource:@"mySound" ofType:@"aif"]]; [mySound play]; Warning: I was able to play only AIF sounds converted via iTunes. Anything else failed, including CAF files. In short: import your whatever sound into iTunes (drag'n'drop), change export to AIF format and then export the file.
