Does REPEATED K-fold cross validation make sense with Random Forest?

When using random forest, would using normal cross-validation and just taking the average results from multiple models with different random states give me the same results as using Repeated K-fold cross validation? Repeated K-fold cross-validation basically repeats cross-validation with multiple different splits of the data and reports the average results.
