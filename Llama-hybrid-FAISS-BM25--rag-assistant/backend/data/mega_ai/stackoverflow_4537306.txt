Does the service account that the build agent runs as have access to work items in the team project? This can be a reason why the WorkItemStore object would be null. Normally build agent service accounts are added to the "Project Collection Build Service Accounts" group that already has this access on every team project. However, if you have customized the process template, your groups/permissions or not setup the build agents correctly - then the permissions might not be correct.
