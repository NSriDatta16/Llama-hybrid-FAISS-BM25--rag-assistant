Which regression metrics fit best cases with very large values and exactly 0 values?

I'm working on a CLTV problem, where the objective is to predict the future spending of the customers, given their past behaviour. According to arXiv:1912.07753 , paragraph 4 EVALUATION METRICS, I'm measuring calibration (difference between actual and predicted values) and discrimination (ranking of the user by CLV). I'm having a hard time finding a good metric for calibration because values can be extremely large for some customers (making squared errors based on metrics such as R-square and MSE less meaningful ) or exactly zero (making percentage metrics such as MAPE impossible to compute). The only good metric I could find is the MAE, but it doesn't allow us to compare with other results, as the MAE is very dataset-specific. What metrics would you recommend for regression problems with 0 and very large values?
