Here are my answers your questions: 4- If your variables are all either 0 or 1 you should not have to normalize. 2- There are many distance calculation methods available. My default one is Euclidean distance (for environmental variables) but you should look to find one appropriate for binary variables. 1- You can try non-metric multidimensional scaling using the package vegan to visualize your selected distance matrix. At the end, you'll have a 2D plot of each of your samples and the points closer will be the most similar ones while the points farther will be the most dissimilar ones. 3- I previously used the software PRIMER to do clustering analysis and the package clustsig seems to be doing pretty much the same thing in R . You should look into this package to perform your clustering analysis.
