PHP file_get_contents() and setting request headers

With PHP, is it possible to send HTTP headers with file_get_contents() ? I know you can send the user agent from your php.ini file. However, can you also send other information such as HTTP_ACCEPT , HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE , and HTTP_CONNECTION with file_get_contents() ? Or is there another function that will accomplish this?
