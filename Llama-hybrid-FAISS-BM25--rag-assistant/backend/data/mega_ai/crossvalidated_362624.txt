reconstruction loss for disentangled variational autoencoders

I am using disentangled variational autoencoders which is a variant of VAE. You will find the github code in this link . I want to quantify the difference or the loss between the ground truth (test_data) and the regenerated test data. In the link, I am only visualizing the ground truth and the predicted ones but I want to quentify the difference between them. So, which measure should I use in this case ? Just implement the accuracy function ?
