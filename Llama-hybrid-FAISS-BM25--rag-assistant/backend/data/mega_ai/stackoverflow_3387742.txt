How to remove widget when the app is uninstalled in Android?

Possible Duplicate: Removing Widget from Home Screen when Uninstalled In Android, I have created a widget for my application. When I uninstall the app, the widget shows "problem loading widget" error in home screen. I need a scenario where widget should be removed by the developer through code (and not by the drag and drop to the trash) when I uninstall the app. Is it possible? If so, what changes we need to do? Is there anything that can be set in the manifest so that it removes all references of the app once it is uninstalled?
