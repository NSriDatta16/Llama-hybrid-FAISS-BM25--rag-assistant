WireShark uses WinPCap so you could go that route as well. For security application, is that a intrution detection system or do you actually want to drop offending packets? WinPCap, SharpPCap etc. do not allow you you drop packets, for this you will need to look at some kind of intermediate driver or look at Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/network/WFP.mspx IMHO, if you can find a callback driver that calls back to user mode and allows you to filter the packets from C# or C++, this would probably be fine for experimental purposes etc. but for a production solution, I think you would need to stick to the kernel level to ensure that you can keep-up with the peek volume.
