What you're seeing is how Safari draws scrollbars when there is not enough space to draw the entire scrollbar widget set. You should set overflow: hidden in the CSS for the body of any frame/page you don't want to scroll. Note that Safari doesn't entirely obey these rules (or scroll="no" on the element) in that you can actually scroll the element by drag-selecting its contents, if there is in fact content beyond the visible area.
