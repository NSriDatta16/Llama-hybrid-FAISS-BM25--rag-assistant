There are no real sneaky or tricky ways to do this. You might be able to build a dynamic query using the data dictionary, but that's really not recommended. If you honestly need the average of 100 different columns, you're going to have to type avg() 100 times. I do agree with the above comment, however, that it is likely that you DB would benefit greatly from some normalization. This is especially true if you have a bunch of columns named 'Something##` where ## is a series of numbers.
