One vs All appraoch to multiclassification in LIBSVM

I'm working on multiclass classification problem (precisely 4 classes). I want to use the most simple approach for this problem: one-vs-all! I have 4 different test set (only labels are different). Using one-vs-all approach, during test, for each input pattern, I have to compute 4 different objective function values from 4 different SMVs. So, the pattern will belong to the class with the greatest objective function value. So, I tried this: ./svm-train -s 0 -t 5 -c 16 -g 0.05 -b 1 'traindata' ./svm-predict -b 1 'testdata' 'traindata.model' 'outfile' I'm not sure about the means of b parameter . Opening the file 'outfile' generated from svm-predict, I get probabilistic values. I suppose that comparing these probabilistic values between all SVMs, I'm able to classify each pattern in the class with the greatest probabilistic value. My assumption is correct? In other words, I want to be sure that these probabilistic values are directly proportional to the relative objective function values.
