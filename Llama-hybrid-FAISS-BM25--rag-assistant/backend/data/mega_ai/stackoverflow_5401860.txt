In most cases it does not matter. I think you should use the autorelease since it makes the code more simple and the @"string" shortcut is very elegant. The basic difference is the point in time when the release happens. Like I said, in most cases it does not make any difference. If you want to control the release time more closely, then you can also do that for autorelease by rolling your own NSAutoreleasePool pool.
