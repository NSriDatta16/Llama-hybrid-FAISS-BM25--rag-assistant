Detecting when the ball hits the paddle in pong?

I have been reading through this tutorial . I am in a chapter where you can build a pong game. However I am having trouble trying to make a function that can detect when the ball hits the paddle? It says I should do this: Make a boolean function hit(bx, by, r, px, py, h) that returns True when the vertical coordinate of the ball ( by ) is between the bottom and top of the paddle, and the horizontal location of the ball ( bx ) is less than or equal to the radius ( r ) away from the front of the paddle. I have tried this so far: def hit(bx, by, r, px, py, h): if by > py and by ... # If this returns True then change the direction of the ball (dx). if hit(ball_x, ball_y, radius, paddle_x, paddle_y, height): dx *= -1 I'm having trouble translating the quoted paragraph into code. What am I doing wrong? Note: The expected output of this function would be: hit(760, 100, 10, 780, 100, 100) False hit(770, 100, 10, 780, 100, 100) True hit(770, 200, 10, 780, 100, 100) True hit(770, 210, 10, 780, 100, 100) False
