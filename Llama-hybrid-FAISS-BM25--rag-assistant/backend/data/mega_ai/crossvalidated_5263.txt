The correct answer here is hierarchical modeling (also called multilevel modeling). What you want to do is have the variance parameters drawn from a common prior distribution who's parameters are also estimated. Something like CountryVariance_i ~ D(Location, Scale) Location ~ D_2(LocationPriorParams) Scale ~ D_3(ScalePriorParams) Where D, D_2, D_3 are whatever distributions would like. This formalizes the notion that the variance parameters should be similar, and will do the correct kind of shrinkage. I believe that Gelman's books ( Bayesian Data Analysis and Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models ) talk quite a bit about this kind of thing (though perhaps not a lot for variance parameters). I don't have a great introduction on hand, so I recommend looking at the wikipedia page and searching for "Hierarchical modeling" or something and clicking on various introductions (there are many). Look for graphs as these are helpful for understanding hierarchical models.
