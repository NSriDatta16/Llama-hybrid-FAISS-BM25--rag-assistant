The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test using the usual tables (or some computer implementation of the null distribution) is designed for testing completely specified continuous distributions. (The help for ks.test even tells you this, in the first paragraph under Details -- indeed, the word continuous is emphasized there.) While the digit distribution under Benford's law is completely specified, it is discrete, rather than continuous. The distribution under the null is affected by that (specifically, p-values will tend to be too large if you used tables designed for continuous distributions). Presumably the null distribution of the test statistic when specifically used for Benford's law correctly deals with the effect of that law's particular discrete distribution on the null distribution of the Kolomogorov-Smirnov statistic.
