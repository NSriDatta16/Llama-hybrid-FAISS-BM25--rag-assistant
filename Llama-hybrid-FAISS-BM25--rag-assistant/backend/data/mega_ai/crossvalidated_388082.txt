The most common visual clue to heteroscedasticity is a "funnel-shape", where we can clearly see an uneven distribution of variance across our residuals: This does not particularly appear to be the case with your data, and you might find that the data is homoscedastic even with some anomalies as is this case with your data. However, the only clinical way to diagnose the presence of heteroscedasticity is through a formal test, such as Breusch-Pagan. I take it you are using R, so the test can be run using bptest , through use of the lmtest library. Suppose there is a regression called reg1 . Here's some sample output: > reg1 library(lmtest) > bptest(reg1) studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: reg1 BP = 3.8512, df = 3, p-value = 0.278 In your case, I would run a formal test as above first to diagnose more accurately. Graphs can provide a visual clue, but they are not the be all and end all.
