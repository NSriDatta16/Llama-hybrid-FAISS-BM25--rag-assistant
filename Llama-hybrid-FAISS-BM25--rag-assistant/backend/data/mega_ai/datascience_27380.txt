Linear SVM with slack variables: Will it find a perfect decision boundary if it exists?

Suppose I use a linear Support Vector Machine with slack variables on a dataset that is linearly separable. Could it happen that the Support Vector Machine reports a solution that does not perfectly separate the classes? As an illustration: Is the situation in the picture possible for a Support Vector Machine with slack variables? Although there is a "better" boundary that allows perfect classification, the Support Vector Machine goes for a sub-optimal solution that misclassifies two samples.
