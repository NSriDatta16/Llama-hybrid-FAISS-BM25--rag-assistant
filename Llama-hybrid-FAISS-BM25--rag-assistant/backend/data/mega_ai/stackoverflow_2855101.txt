Using SNMP set message on MS Windows SNMP agent

State of TCP connection (tcpConnState) is writable per RFC 1213. Everything is fine when i reset this tcpConnState value from established (5) to deleteTCB (12) with SNMP set message with SNMP Agent from DMH software ( http://www.dmhsoftware.com/snmp.html ). But i cannot perform the SNMP Set command on that variable with Windows SNMP service (install SNMP service on Windows XP, Vista or Win 7; doing several configuration steps for community string etc). I guess that's due to some limitation/implementation policy on Windows SNMP service, but could not find any proof for that. Could anyone help? Thanks a lot in advance.
