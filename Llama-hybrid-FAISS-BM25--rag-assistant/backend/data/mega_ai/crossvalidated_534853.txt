This would be an excellent situation to use a generalized linear model like logistic regression, since the outcome is binary. In the case where the outcome is continuous (perhaps with some other conditions), linear regression would be viable. A key takeaway is that binary predictor variables present no challenge to linear and generalized linear models.
