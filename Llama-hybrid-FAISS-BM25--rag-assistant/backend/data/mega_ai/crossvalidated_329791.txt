as it happens, both proposals in the question are incorrect : in the first proposal the simulation is correctly implemented by sample but [there is a bug in the R code and] the computation of the variance of a mixture $$f(x)=p_1 f_1(x)+ p_2 f_2(x)$$is incorrect: it should be $$p_1 \text{var}_{f_1}(X)+p_2\text{var}_{f_2}(X)+p_1\mathbb{E}_{f_1}(X)^2+p_2\mathbb{E}_{f_2}(X)^2-\mathbb{E}_{f}(X)^2$$which leads to $$p_1\lambda_1+p_2\lambda_2+p_1\lambda_1^2+p_2\lambda_2^2-(p_1\lambda_1+p_2\lambda_2)^2$$which gives a numerical value of $9.16$ for the reference parameters in the second proposal the simulation is invalid as it returns a weighted average of two Poisson samples, which is not distributed from a Poisson mixture but from a Poisson convolution, in which case the variance is $$p_1^2\lambda_1+p_2^2\lambda_2$$
