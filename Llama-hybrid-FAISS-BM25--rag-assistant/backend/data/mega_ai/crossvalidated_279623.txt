Retraining CNN : Classification to Regression

I am currently working on CNNs and would like to create a Regression model. However I have a relatively small amount of new pictures so I was thinking about retraining. Is it possible to retrain a classification model and turn it into a regression model? I mean, is there a way to modify some layers at the end of the net to make it as a regression? I do not really know if this was clear, I'll just try to show with an example : Let's say you would like to get the head position (x,y) on dog pictures . Then you could retrain a CNN using dog pictures with (x,y) cooridnates as labels. Using retraining I expect that we will start using Weights and Biases already well initialized. I tried to be clear, and welcome any kind of answer that can help me. I am also up to add further details if you need for better comprehension. Thank you very much!
