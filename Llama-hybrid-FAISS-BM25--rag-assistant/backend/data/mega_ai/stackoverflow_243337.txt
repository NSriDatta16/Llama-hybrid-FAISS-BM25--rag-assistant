Fortunately, namespaces are in 5.3 and 6. I would highly recommend against using the Path_To_ClassName idiom. It makes messy code, and you can never change your library structure... ever. The SPL's autoload is great. If you're organized, it can save you the typical 20-line block of includes and requires at the top of every file. You can also change things around in your code library, and as long as PHP can include from those directories, nothing breaks. Make liberal use of === over == . For instance: if (array_search('needle',$array) == false) { // it's not there, i think... } will give a false negative if 'needle' is at key zero. Instead: if (array_search('needle',$array) === false) { // it's not there! } will always be accurate.
