Are there some nice introductions to IDI, NRI, biomarker validation?

Are there some nice introductions to IDI (integrated discrimination improvement index), NRI (net reclassification index), multivariable likelihood ratios, Bayesian methods, biomarker validation, risk scores from multi-biomarker data? Where do they arise and how are they obtained or performed? I guess the topics are from survival analysis. But I can't find it in some survival analysis books.
