This is common with MediaTemple -- I encountered this problem, fixed it, and somehow it's broken again. It has to deal with something about NFS locking, and the system calls used by django's storage modules. ... (10 minutes later) ... Found it: Anyone trying to run the latest 1.1 svn release will have noticed that the above fix no longer works since TemporaryFileUploaderHandler now uses the locking code also. A workaround until mediatemple and/or django devs figure this out is to edit django.core.files.locks and change the two calls to fcntl.lockf to fcntl.flock Here's a relevant bug report for anyone who's interested: http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9400 http://osdir.com/ml/DjangoUsers/2009-06/msg01014.html -> https://forums.mediatemple.net/viewtopic.php?id=2514
