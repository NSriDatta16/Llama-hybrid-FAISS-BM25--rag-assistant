iPhone App: Making a webpage accessible only to people using a specific app

I was just wondering if it is possible and if so what the best way to create a web-page that is only accessible from a custom iPhone application? For example, if you tried to access the webpage from the iPhone's built in browser, or any other browser it would display an error page but when accessed from a custom built application it would be fully functional. One idea that has come up is to change the User-Agent string in the embedded browser inside the application to something custom. I'm not sure if this is viable though. I hope this makes sense. Thanks in advance. -Ben
