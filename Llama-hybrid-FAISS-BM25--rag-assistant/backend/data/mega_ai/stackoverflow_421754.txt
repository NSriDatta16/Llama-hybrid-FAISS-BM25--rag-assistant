We use Solution Folders quite a bit to "associate" projects within a Solution. For example, most of our "projects" have 3 actual projects - implementation, unit tests and integration tests. We put all 3 in one Solution Folder. We also might put all Infrastructure in one and all CAB Modules in another. Basically when you have a Solution with 50+ projects, it helps to keep them organized so you can expand only what you're looking for and find things based on logical grouping.
