I will have to heavily discourage the use of Unity for this task. It is not aimed for the type of development I am getting the impression you want to do. It is also mainly a 3D tool, and working in 2D with it contains various quirks. Lastly, they do not currently have a HTML backend, although I have heard they are planning on one using WebGL. The unity web plugin only runs on windows and Mac OS. I.e deployment to android or iPhone is done through a binary build.
