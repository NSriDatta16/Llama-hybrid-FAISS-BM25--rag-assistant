Create draggables by dragging mouse

I am new to JQuery library. I am currently trying to create a Draggable by mouse. Say, when I press the mouse it start to draw and then I drag the mouse to change the size and then I release the mouse to finalize the drawing. Is it possible to do this with JQuery?
