Item position in Gravity Search Algorithm

According to this article titled Efficient clustering in collaborative filtering recommender system: Hybrid method based on genetic algorithm and gravitational emulation local search algorithm This is a paragraph from the article The current solution is chosen randomly from among the set of chromosomes with the lowest mass. Its space is an s-dimension space that is equal to the maximum number of clusters in the chromosomes transmitted to the GELS algorithm. The number of dimensions of the place of each mass is equal to s and the mass position in each dimension is measured by the items numbers in the cluster corresponding to that dimension. From item sets of O={O1, O2, O3, O4, O5}. Assuming that i have the items clustered as: C={C1,C2,C1,C2,C2} So based on that paragraph i encoded the solution as C={C 1 ={O1, O3}, C 2 ={O2, O4, O5}} Am i doing this right ? Now currently i'm having a problem with this part The current solution moves in accordance with its current location and its new velocity in the dimension d, and is located in a new location in the dimension d. In fact, the new velocity value is added to the number value of all items in the dth cluster in the current solution Suppose that i have a velocity value of 1 How do i add integer to a set of objects? (Ex: C 2 ={O2, O4, O5})
