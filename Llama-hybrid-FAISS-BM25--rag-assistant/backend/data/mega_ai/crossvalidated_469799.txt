Why is logistic regression particularly prone to overfitting in high dimensions?

Why does "the asymptotic nature of logistic regression" make it particularly prone to overfitting in high dimensions ? ( source ): I understand the LogLoss ( cross entropy ) grows quickly as $y$ (true probability) approaches $1-y'$ (predicted probability): but why does that imply that "the asymptotic nature of logistic regression would keep driving the loss towards 0 in high dimensions without regularization" ? In my mind, just because the loss can grow quickly (if we get very close to the wrong and full opposite answer), it doesn't mean that it would thus try to fully interpolate the data. If anything the optimizer would avoid entering the asymptotic part (fast growing part) of the loss as aggressively as it can.
