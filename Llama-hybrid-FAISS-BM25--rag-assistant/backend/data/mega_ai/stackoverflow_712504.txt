Best practices for storing production passwords for small groups

This is not a technical question. How do small organizations keep sensitive information that must be shared among several individuals safe, such as root passwords to production servers? Not all people that need to have access work in the same location.. new passwords can be distributed by phone, but what rules should be enforced for team members in the storing of the passwords? UPDATE: this question is not about the proper usage of root passwords -- that was just meant as an example. Maybe a better example would be the SSL passphrase or any other password that must be shared among people performing administrative tasks. The fact is, root passwords and the like need to be generated and stored and usually more than one person needs to have access, sometimes those people work in different locations. The question is about storage protocols. Thanks.
