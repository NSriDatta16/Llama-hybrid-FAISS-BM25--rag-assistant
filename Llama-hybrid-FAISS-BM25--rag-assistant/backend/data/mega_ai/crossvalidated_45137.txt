To get a distribution over the hidden state sequence use the forward-backward algorithm rather than viterbi. Regarding the problem of inferring too many 1s in your hidden sequence, you should think about why your training procedure is not working the way you expect it to. Is your training set too small? Is your training set biased toward some states? Take a look at your learned transition and emission matrices and try to identify wether it is the transition probability or emission probability that is leading to misclassifications? Once you have a better intuition about why your HMM is underperforming then you can try to address it. One way to address either issue (wether it be with your emission probabilities or transition probabilities) is to use Bayesian HMM with a Dirichlet prior on each of the rows in your transition and emission matrices, and use Gibbs sampling for inference. You could then incorporate your domain knowledge by encoding it in your priors.
