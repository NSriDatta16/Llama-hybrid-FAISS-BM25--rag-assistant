CKEditor with jQuery output is chopped, possibly because of special characters

I have the following code that correctly generates the CKEditor: $(function(){ $("#newWrite_body").ckeditor({ extraPlugins : 'autogrow', autoGrow_maxHeight : 800}); }); Then I grab some text from a web page, paste it into the editor, and alert the text back upon submitting it shows: Fort McKay, Alberta (CNN) -- Celina Harpe was 7 when her grandfather made a prediction that would forever change her life. &quot;I won&#39;t see it, I&#39;m too old now, but it&#39;s going to be really bad,&quot; she recalls him saying on a warm summer night after returning from a moose hunt. The two were standing on a hill that overlooks the birch-and-spruce-lined river here in far northwest Canada. But when I echo it back from the PHP code before the insert, it is reduced to: Fort McKay, Alberta (CNN) -- Celina Harpe was 7 when her grandfather made a prediction that would forever change her life. Apparently the special characters are being dropped. All my attempts to escape them and/or convert them have been futile. What is the proper way to convert these from CKEditor's text to a POST-able value in PHP?
