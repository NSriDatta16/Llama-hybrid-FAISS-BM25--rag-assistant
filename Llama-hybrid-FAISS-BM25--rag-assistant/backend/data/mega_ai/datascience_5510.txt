Wouldn't recommend use of complex methods first. Use faster simple approaches initially (kNN, NBC, etc.), then progress through linear regression, logistic regression, LDA, CART(RF), KREG, and then to least squares SVM, gradient ascent SVM, ANNs, and then metaheurustics (greedy heuristic hill climbing with GAs, swarm intelligence, ant colony optimization, etc.)
