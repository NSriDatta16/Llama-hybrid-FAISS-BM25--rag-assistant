Jquery hide/show ruins my divs?

I recently added a tiny bit of jquery to a website to fix a rendering bug in IE7. Unfortunately for some reason this tiny show script broke some divs on the bottom and I can't for the life of me figure out why. I've already spent too many hours playing messing around with it, making sure divs are aligned properly, etc. Could anyone tell me why this script would change the way my code is displayed? $(document).ready(function() { $('#hide').show() }) Below are links to versions with the hide and without the hide so you can see what I'm talking about, along with all the code. http://alecsanger.com/shipcarsnow/index_nohide.html http://alecsanger.com/shipcarsnow/index.html If anyone has any clues as to how I could fix this, I would greatly appreciate a push in the right direction. Thank you.
