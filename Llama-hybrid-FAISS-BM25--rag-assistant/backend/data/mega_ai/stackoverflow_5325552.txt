You can build regexp containing all your words, capturing each word by enclosing it in parentheses. Using that in a replace will provide enough information to recover the original word in the replace function. function correct (text, words) { return text.replace (RegExp ('\\b(?:(' + words.join (')|(') + '))\\b', 'ig'), function (m) { for (var a = arguments.length - 2; a--;) if (arguments[a]) return words[a-1] || m; }); } console.log (correct ("My iphone itunes divx firewire application has a user form under uiviewcontroller.

I try to figure what is going on when application starts again from background and where the UIView changes can be done. This turns out to be faster then the original code .
