Statistics/Data Science: Real world example for a donut destribution?

I'm looking for different real world examples for donut distribution (in the statistic meaning). https://i.stack.imgur.com/VrGq4.jpg For the most other distributions, I found good examples. But for this the only one is the way to focus a laser beam: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Donut-shaped-laser-beam-for-thermocapillary-induced-dewetting-a-Microscopic-pictures_fig2_274400395 But this wouldnÂ´t fit to e.g. a classification problem. Has anybody a good source oder idea, where donut distributions are existing in real world data? Thanks a lot!
