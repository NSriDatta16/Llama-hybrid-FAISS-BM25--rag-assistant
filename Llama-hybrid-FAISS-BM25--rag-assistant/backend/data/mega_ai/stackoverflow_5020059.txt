Re-encoding of Jpeg Image in binary column when saving

I know there are similar questions, but I have a question concerning the storage of images in a binary-column. I have a small windows forms app that loads an image into a picturebox control from a sql compact db using Linq2SQL. The user can drag any image (jpg,bmp,gif) on a picturebox. On the DragDrop-Event the image is loaded into the picturebox. When I save the record following code is executed to store the image of the picturebox control: MemoryStream imgStream = new MemoryStream(); pictureBox1.Image.Save(imgStream, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg); myTable.MyImage = imgStream.ToArray(); I have checked the size of the byte array and it didn't change after saving the record. Is the image re-encoded every time the Save-Method is called? It would be maybe then better to check if the image has changed at all.
