How to calculate the average selling period from inventory list (uneven intervals)?

Will I be able to calculate the average sales time (number of days) for an item, simply from the following 6 data points? Or will I need to repeatedly collect data, such that I for each day (say in the next 14 days) have the following data? PUT UP FOR SALE WITHIN NUMBER OF ITEMS The last day 17,319 The last 2 days 30,832 The last 3 days 44,328 The last 7 days 96,829 The last 14 days 177,765 Total 1,272,306 Once an item is sold it no longer appears in the list above. And all items are removed after approximately 2 months. The guess (of the top of my head) would be to estimate some sort of Sigmoid function, and then calculate the average sales time on that. But having only 6 observations -- and not knowing which initial parameters I should start with -- means that it doesn't converge to anything reasonable. I also remember learning something about the Possion distribution that related to time, but I've completely forgotten it.
