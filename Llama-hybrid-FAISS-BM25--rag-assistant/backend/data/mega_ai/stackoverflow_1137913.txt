I was just reading this article by Erland Sommarskog, The Curse and Blessings of Dynamic SQL , and it includes the following paragraph in regards to the SET QUOTED IDENTIFIER setting: The default for this setting depends on context, but the preferred setting is ON, and it must be ON in order to use XQuery, indexed views and indexes on computed columns. Does your stored procedure make use of XQuery, indexed views or indexes on computed columns at all?
