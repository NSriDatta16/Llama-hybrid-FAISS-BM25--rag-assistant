Confidence Interval of estimator for the exponential distribution

We have an exponential distribution $$f(x)=\frac{e^\frac{-x}{\theta}}{\theta}$$ We are told that $n=3$ and that the data are given as $x_1=1, x_2=2.5, x_3=5.5$ a.) Determine an approximate 95% confidence interval based on asymptotic normality of $\overline{x}$ b.) Determine an approximate 95% confidence interval based on the asymptotic distribution of the deviance $D(\theta)$. The solution does not have to be exact. Pay attention to the function g, defined as $$g(\theta)= \frac{3}{\theta}+\ln\theta -\ln3-1$$ My questions: a.) I have to take the sample mean, and then I add up the $z_{ \frac{\alpha}{2} }\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}$ thing? With $z_{0.025}=1.96?$ What value do I use for $\sigma$? b.) What deviance $D(\theta)$ mean? The question added a graph, on the x-axis I see theta from 0 to 14 and on the y-axis I see (a probability?) from 0.0 up to 1.0 Has this something to do with the power function of the test? I should have knowledge about Neyman-Pearson, likelihood ratio tests, power function of a test.
