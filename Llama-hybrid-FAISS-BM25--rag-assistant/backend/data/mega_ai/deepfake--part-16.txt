hout their consent with a cause of action against the content's creator. Assembly Bill No. 730 prohibits the distribution of malicious deepfake audio or visual media targeting a candidate running for public office within 60 days of their election. U.S. representative Yvette Clarke introduced H.R. 5586: Deepfakes Accountability Act into the 118th United States Congress on 20 September 2023 in an effort to protect national security from threats posed by deepfake technology. U.S. representative Mar√≠a Salazar introduced H.R. 6943: No AI Fraud Act into the 118th United States Congress on 10 January 2024, to establish specific property rights of individual physicality, including voice. In November 2019, China announced that deepfakes and other synthetically faked footage should bear a clear notice about their fakeness starting in 2020. Failure to comply could be considered a crime the Cyberspace Administration of China stated on its website. The Chinese government seems to be reserving the right to prosecute both users and online video platforms failing to abide by the rules. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the Ministry of Public Security jointly issued the Provision on the Administration of Deep Synthesis Internet Information Service in November 2022. China's updated Deep Synthesis Provisions (Administrative Provisions on Deep Synthesis in Internet-Based Information Services) went into effect in January 2023. In the United Kingdom, producers of deepfake material could be prosecuted for harassment, but deepfake production was not a specific crime until 2023, when the Online Safety Act was passed, which made deepfakes illegal; the UK plans to expand the Act's scope to criminalize deepfakes created with "intention to cause distress" in 2024. In Canada, in 2019, the Communications Security Establishment released a report which said that deepfakes could be used to interfere in Canadian politics, particularly to discredit politicians and influence voters. As a result, there are multiple ways for citizens in Canada to deal with deepfakes if they are targeted by them. In February 2024, bill C-63 was tabled in the 44th Canadian Parliament in order to enact the Online Harms Act, which would amend Criminal Code, and other Acts. An earlier version of the Bill, C-36, was ended by the dissolution of the 43rd Canadian Parliament in September 2021. In India, there are no direct laws or regulation on AI or deepfakes, but there are provisions under the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act 2000/2008, which can be looked at for legal remedies, and the new proposed Digital India Act will have a chapter on AI and deepfakes in particular, as per the MoS Rajeev Chandrasekhar. In Europe, the European Union's 2024 Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) takes a risk-based approach to regulating AI systems, including deepfakes. It establishes categories of "unacceptable risk," "high risk," "specific/limited or transparency risk", and "minimal risk" to determine the level of regulatory obligations for AI providers and users. However, the lack of clear definitions for these risk categories in the context of deepfakes creates potential challenges for effective implementation. Legal scholars have raised concerns about the classification of deepfakes intended for political misinformation or the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery. Debate exists over whether such uses should always be considered "high-risk" AI systems, which would lead to stricter regulatory requirements. In August 2024, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) launched court proceedings against X for its unlawful use of the personal data of over 60 million EU/EEA users, in order to train its AI technologies, such as its chatbot Grok. Response from DARPA In 2016, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched the Media Forensics (MediFor) program which was funded through 2020. MediFor aimed at autom
