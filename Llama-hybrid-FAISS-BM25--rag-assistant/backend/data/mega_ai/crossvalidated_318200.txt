Feature engineering with MNAR data

I have logs from a user's keyboard, mouse, and a few other things. I am trying to use them in order to do some predictions. Exploring the data and trying some feature engineering, I have discovered that the Hold Time (duration between when a key is pressed and released in milliseconds) seems very promising. In order to make predictions, the data is aggregated to be in the following form: __________| keys pressed | mouse clicks | hold time mean |...| label minute 1 | X_11 | X_12 | X_13 |...| y_1 minute 2 | X_21 | X_22 | X_23 |...| y_2 ... ... ... ... ... ... minute N | X_N1 | X_N2 | X_N3 |...| y_N The issue is that sometimes, a user would spend a minute without typing and thus computing a Hold Time mean makes no sense and creates a missing value. This obviously only happens when the value for keys pressed is zero. I do not know how to handle these missing values. I do not want to drop all entries where the user was not typing, because I can rely on other features to do predictions in those cases. I thought that maybe putting the Hold Time mean to zero would make sense, since indeed the amount of time a key was held is zero, but this must bias my model? Would anybody have any recommendation how to deal with this?
