I would take a look at the median score and see if it is a better representation of what you want. If not you can do two other things. 1) Use the mean and standard deviation. Yes, I know that is 2 numbers, but it would give you a better representation of the distribution. 2) Use the mean and standard deviation to come up with a composite score. e.g. you might want to divide the mean by the standard deviation, or come up with some other linear combination of these two factors depending upon what you feel is more important. If you are "loath" to take the average, for example, you might want to give more weight to the standard deviation, e.g. 60% of the total score. But even so, two numbers are better, and I would plot the scores to see if they made sense.
