Magento learning curve and best tips

Ok, magento is new to me, and in fact ecommerce site development itself is new. Magento seems to be extremely difficult to get to grips with - I have spent 3 days now going round I'm circles trying to create a custom theme and modules. The documentation is poor, the code and structure appears obfuscated - when will it get easier?! Are there any specific tips or advice that you can offer for learning magento properly ? For any other developers out there - how long (full time development) did it take to start to make sense of magento and to get things done quickly?
