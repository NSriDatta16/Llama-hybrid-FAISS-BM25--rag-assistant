Univariate analysis in logistic regression

I am doing multivariate analysis using logistic regression to see the relationship between one categorical outcome variable and a group of continuous and categorical explanatory variables. I did preliminary explanatory analysis using chi-square for the categorical covariates and t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests for the continuous variables based on the type of the distribution. When I did the univariate analysis using binary logistic regression for the same variables, the results are different for the skewed data (previously analysed by Mann-Whitney) and the same for the normal data (previously analysed by t-test). Should I stick to the logistic regression for the univariate analysis, or should I do either transformation or categorization for the skewed data before launching the multivariate analysis?
