Time series to Hankel Matrix

This must be bog standard (if so, references would be appreciated): Suppose I have a (time) series $a_1, a_2, \dotsc, a_n, \dotsc.$ I make an infinite by $k$ Hankel matrix $H(k)$ in the "obvious" way: $$\begin{align} &a_1, a_2, \dotsc, a_k\\ &a_2, a_3, \dotsc, a_{k+1}\\ &a_3, a_4, \dotsc, a_{k+2}\\ &\dotsc \end{align} $$ What can be said about the singular value decomposition of $H,$ and how is the structure of the time series reflected in this?
