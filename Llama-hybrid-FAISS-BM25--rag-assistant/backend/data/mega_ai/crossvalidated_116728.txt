What is a convolutional neural network

I have been studying neural networks and I recently found out about deep learning and convolutional neural networks. Can someone give me a newbie introduction to convolutional neural networks, what is the intuition behind them, little bit about the theory (+ possible good references for details and pseudo-code). I do understand how convolution-operation is defined, but can't connect it into neural networks. I'm also just beginning with deep learning methods, so I don't have any experience with that. Question shortly put: Could someone give an introduction to convolutional neural networks? I would appreciate to have answers to questions: What? Why? How?
