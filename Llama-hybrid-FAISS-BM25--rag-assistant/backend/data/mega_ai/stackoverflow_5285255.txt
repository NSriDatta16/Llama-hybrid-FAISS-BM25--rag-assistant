Create image with DnD

I'd like to create an own displayable image in Java - this is not the problem. But this image should be draggable inside a JLabel (only within the JLabel). First I plan to create a new class for this intention extended from class JComponent. With this I can use createImage(ImageProducer producer) to create my image. But how can I use this method? Or is there another possibility to implement a draggable image?
