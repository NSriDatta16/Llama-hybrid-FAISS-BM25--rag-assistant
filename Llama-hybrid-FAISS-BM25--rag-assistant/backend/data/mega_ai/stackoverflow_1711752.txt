General guidelines we use: Make getting around easy: use a toolbar or side menu to access different parts of the application. Make viewing information as easy as possible, and in different formats. Make changing information as consistent as possible. I.e., put New, Edit, and Save buttons in the same place. Make the most common action the easiest. Specific guidelines we use: Use the same or similar font across the application. Vary by size or bold to catch attention. Use color backgrounds to group and separate types of information. Put the most relevant information together and make the most commonly used button larger than the rest. Don't use a drop-down control where there are only only a few options. Use a list control big enough that one doesn't have to scroll or use a radio-button. Adding some white space can actually make it easier to read the screen or report.
