In theory, this is an easy question. In practice, it is really, really hard. In theory, we should only use multiple comparisons methods when we are worried about making too many Type I errors. We should not use multiple comparison methods if are worried about making too many Type II errors. For example, suppose we are screening to see if any genes are associated with a particular disease. Well, since there's about 20,000 genes, if you we don't use multiple comparison methods, we would expect to get about 1,000 genes showing up as significant, even if no genes were associated with the disease . As such, it would be a big waste of everyone's time to say "Hey, look, I've found that these 987 genes are significantly related to the disease!" (ie the very real cost of Type I errors with these studies is that they waste everyone's time trying to reproduce your results). On the other hand, suppose Type II errors were of more concern. For example, suppose you're evaluating potential terrorist threats. Of course, there is a very real Type I error cost (false accusation), but there's also a very significant Type II error cost (not catching someone in time). Now this becomes a difficult problem, but you can see right away that just saying "I'm doing multiple comparisons, therefor I must use multiple comparison adjustments" is a really bad idea. In the cases you have presented, I would say that none of them are really clear cut. In particular, you appear to doing a screening, rather than a necessarily confirmatory analysis. As such, I would somewhat discourage multiple comparisons: you should see it a little more as an exploratory analysis. As such, in a perfect world I would recommend unadjusted confidence intervals, with a reminder to the reader that these are unadjusted. Very unfortunately, reviewers are likely to require p-values for publication. And sadly, which types of studies they will require you to use multiple comparison methods is very dependent on which reviewer you get.
