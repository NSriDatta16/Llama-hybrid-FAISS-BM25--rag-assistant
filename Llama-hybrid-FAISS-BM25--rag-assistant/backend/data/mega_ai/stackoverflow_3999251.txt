How to modify HTTP responses in a different .NET process

I have a standard web server that serve web pages. I want to monitor traffic on port 80, intercept every http responses, and add/inject an additionnal header to them. The process will then act like a proxy between the web server and the client. Could you please give me some pointers? I'm already aware of SharpPCap , but I'm not sure where to start. Note: I can't rely on the web server, I can't control it or change it's configuration. However I can install any other process on the same machine. Thanks a million
