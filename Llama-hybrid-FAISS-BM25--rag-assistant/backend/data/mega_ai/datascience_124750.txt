I don't have a ready answer, but I come up with some ideas that may help you approach this problem. As I understood, the main difficulty in treating it as a binary classification of this data is that you are sure just about those who have left, but we don't know if those who stick to the company will leave it in a month. So, maybe let's try transforming your problem from will he/she leave? to will he/she leave after t time? . If you have information about the time after someone left the company, it will allow you to not only operationalise your problem properly but also augment your training data. Let's take a look at the example of two employees: Robert - has been working here for two years and still does Karolina - left after one year of working It's hard to classify leave/not leave as we don't know how to consider Robert here. However, if we take time into consideration we can transform it to input data like these ones: Robert, one year - stay Robert, two years - stay Karolina, three months - stay Karolina - eight months - stay Karolina - one year - left Karolina - fifteen months - left Now it's simple to feed the model with this data and even it might have some prediction capabilities about when someone leaves the company and some interesting interpretations. I'd like to underscore that I didn't check this solution, it's just an idea you can try and I hope it helps you.
