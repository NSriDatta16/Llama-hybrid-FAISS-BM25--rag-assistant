Transforming proportion data: when arcsin square root is not enough

Is there a (stronger?) alternative to the arcsin square root transformation for percentage/proportion data? In the data set I'm working on at the moment, marked heteroscedasticity remains after I apply this transformation, i.e. the plot of residuals vs. fitted values is still very much rhomboid. Edited to respond to comments: the data are investment decisions by experimental participants who may invest 0-100% of an endowment in multiples of 10%. I have also looked at these data using ordinal logistic regression, but would like to see what a valid glm would produce. Plus I could see the answer being useful for future work, as arcsin square root seems to be used as a one-size-fits all solution in my field and I hadn't come across any alternatives being employed.
