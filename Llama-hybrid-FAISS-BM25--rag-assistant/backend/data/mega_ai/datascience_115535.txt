information retrieval vs recommendation system

Apologizes in advance, if this question is so basic, Problem : I have read this paper and noticed that Information Retrieval can be identified as a field of study whereas Recommender Systems are a technology. Information retrieval addresses the information needs of users by delivering relevant pieces of information but requires users to convey their information needs explicitly. In contrast, recommender systems offer personalized suggestions of items automatically. Ultimately, both fields help users cope with information overload by providing them with relevant items of information. I have some doubt about the concept and differences between these two. Therefore, I tried to formulate my research question as follows: Given the information retrieval field as an umbrella term, my goal is to conduct the research on the state-of-the-art recommendation system (technology) which is able to retrieve the best TOP-N (N=5, 10, 20 , ...) search matches, in a dataset, Questions : Is this a legitimate statement in Data Science or AI community? if not, is there a better way to formulate the research question to address recommendation systems?
