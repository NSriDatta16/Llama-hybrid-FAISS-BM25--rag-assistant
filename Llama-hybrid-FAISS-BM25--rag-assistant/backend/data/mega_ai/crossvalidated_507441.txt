Linear Regression with Maximum Likelihood or OLS + Logistic Regression

As far as I know, regression parameters can be estimated among others with the maximum likelihood method or with the OLS method. If the assumption of normally distributed residuals is fulfilled, both methods lead to identical parameters. This raises some questions for me: for an efficient parameter estimation by OLS, the residuals must be normally distributed. However, this is not a necessary assumption of MLE estimation. Therefore, is MLE estimation always preferable to OLS estimation if the residuals are not normally distributed? Suppose I want to analyze the relationship between the sales price of my car and its mileage with a linear regression analysis, and I set up the following model: Sales_price_i = ÃŸ0 + ÃŸ1x_i + e Let's assume that the assumptions of the OLS estimation are satisfied. Consequently, OLS and MLE estimation would lead to the same estimation result. Are the coefficients of an MLE estimation interpreted in the same way as those of an OLS estimation? I can use the MLE method to estimate the parameters of an assumed probability distribution. To do this, a certain probability distribution is assumed (e.g. normal distribution). Which distribution is assumed if the parameters of a regression model are to be estimated by MLE? In logistic regression, is it the Bernoulli distribution because the Y variable can only take two values? MLE estimation also plays a role in logistic regression, where the Y variable is binary and can only take two values. Am I correct in my understanding of the procedure: First, the MLE method is used to estimate the coefficients of a linear regression. This is estimated using MLE because the residuals are not normally distributed for a binary distributed random variable. In the next step, the estimated Yi parameters are plugged into the logistic distribution function. The logistic function can be understood as a transformation function. It ensures that the function values will be 0>= and Thanks!
