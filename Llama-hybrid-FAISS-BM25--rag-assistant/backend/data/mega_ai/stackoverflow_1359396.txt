The answers from Chris and dkackman are on the mark but we also need to listen to the W3C every now and again: XML parsed entities are often stored in computer files which, for editing convenience, are organized into lines. These lines are typically separated by some combination of the characters carriage-return (#xD) and line-feed (#xA). This means that in your XSLT you can experiment with some combination of &#xA; and &#xD; . Remember that different operating systems have different line-ending strategies .
