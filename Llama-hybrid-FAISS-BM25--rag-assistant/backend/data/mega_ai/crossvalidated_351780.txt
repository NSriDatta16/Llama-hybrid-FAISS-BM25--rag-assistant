As already stated in the comment section, both the Laplace Method and a certain class of Variational Inference Methods (convex-type representations) are based on locally approximating a (non-Gaussian) density. Chris Bishop's book 'Pattern recognition and machine learning' has a chapter on this (Chapter 10.5. Local Variational Methods). I hope that helps.
