Do likelihood-based confidence intervals avoid general criticisms of confidence intervals?

In the literature, I see post-sample criticisms of frequentist confidence intervals â€” but the usual targets are intervals that use somewhat weak methods such as assumed normality or other long-run/asymptotic methods. However, Bayesian credibility intervals simply average over a number of likelihood intervals. If we construct an approx CI based on the likelihood function does this address the issues like post-sampling nonsense intervals?
