Which features corresponds to which eigenvalues when use SVD in PCA?

Today, after learning about performing $PCA$ using $SVD$ , I know $PCA$ will choose $K$ components that have the highest eigenvalues. I have a question which feature will correspond to which eigenvalue? I mean, I have data matrix $\hat{\mathbf{X}}$ have list columns, each column name correspond with one column in $\hat{\mathbf{X}}$ , after using $SVD$ on $\hat{\mathbf{X}}$ , I will have list eigenvalues sorted, and I don't know which column will correspond to which eigenvalue. # list columns in data selected_col=['temperatureMax', 'dewPoint', 'cloudCover', 'windSpeed', 'pressure', 'visibility', 'humidity', 'uvIndex', 'temperatureMin'] x=df[selected_col] # Standardized X_std = standardized(X) # Use SVD on X U, S, VT = np.linalg.svd(X_std, full_matrices=False) Now I have S containing eigenvalues was descending sort, so I don't know what column is corresponding with the highest eigenvalue, is it 'temperatureMax', 'cloudCover' or another? Any help is highly appreciated. Thank you. Edit: Thanks for answer from @utobi. From this answer i was found how to find which variables are most correlated with the each PC in here , hope it's useful.
