ASP.NET MVC: Hierarhical roles, custom authorization

Is there a way to organize the roles in my app like a tree? You know, User can do several things, Moderator is just like user but can do little more, Administator have even more abilitities, etc. I've found nothing in the "Web Site Administration Tool".
