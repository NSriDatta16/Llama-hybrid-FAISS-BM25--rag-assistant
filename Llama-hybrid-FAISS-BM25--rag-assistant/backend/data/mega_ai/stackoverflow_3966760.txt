Jquery.can make JQuery UI draggable,droppable,sortable work together?

In my page I have some dynamic created note sticker which draggable. And then I have a dropper which that sortable(enable sort) at the same time. I drag and drop the note sticker inside the dropper and sort(via drag) the sticker up and down inside the dropper! I think I can make it using the Jquery UI. But always make mistake!
