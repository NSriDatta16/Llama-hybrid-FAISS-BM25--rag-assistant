Evaluating Block Bootstrap Confidence Interval

I have an estimation that is obtained by using MCMC. In order to calculate the standard error of the estimation, I use Block Bootstrap approach and using this standard error I create a 95% confidence interval. In order to evaluate the coverage of this confidence interval, I repeat the same simulation experiment 100 times and calculate the estimation for each of them. At the end, I have 100 different estimations. My strategy is to count how many of these estimations falls in the confidence interval that I created using Block Bootstrap Confidence Interval. Let's say 85 of 100 estimations falls in the confidence interval. I would like to perform a statistical test in order to further evaluate if my 95% confidence interval is actually good. If I treat this experiment as a binomial distribution (success if it falls in confidence interval, failure otherwise) I think I can come up with such statistical test. My questions are whether this way of evaluating the coverage of confidence interval makes sense and what can be a sensible way to perform such statistical test? Thanks.
