Is a simple linear regression appropriate for an originally ordinal outcome variable?

Context: To form an index, I summed (and weighted) 2 variables containing ratings (1-9). Potentially problem: Wondering if it is appropriate to conduct a linear regression, all other assumptions being met, even though the individual component ratings of this outcome variable are technically ordinal? I think the alternative is an ordinal logistic regression.
