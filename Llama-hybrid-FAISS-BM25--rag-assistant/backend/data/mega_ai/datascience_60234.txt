As you know, Auto ML can have a general meaning. To know better the meaning, some paper could help you to catch some idea about auto ml (that can be applied in NLP too). This paper could be helpful. The success of machine learning in a broad range of applications has led to an ever-growing demand for machine learning systems that can be used off the shelf by non-experts. To be effective in practice, such systems need to automatically choose a good algorithm and feature preprocessing steps for a new dataset at hand, and also set their respective hyperparameters. Recent work has started to tackle this automated machine learning (AutoML) problem with the help of efficient Bayesian optimization methods.
