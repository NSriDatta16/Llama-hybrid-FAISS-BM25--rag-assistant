Drupal menu or taxonomy?

i have a hierarchical list of organizations and a module that performs actions to an organization. my task is to build a page where a menu tree of organizations is placed on the left side and the module is on center. what is the best way to implement this? my current suggestion is to make links in the form of "organization/$orgid" and make the module hook_menu() wildcards. but the problem is that i can't assign wildcard paths when creating a menu item. maybe i should use taxonomy?
