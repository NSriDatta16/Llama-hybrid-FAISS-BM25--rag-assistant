I would encourage you to introduce a field in your type to keep references to your checkboxes (an array, a list, a dictionary -- you choose.) This way you'll no longer need to use this non-typed and somewhat ugly find-control-by-key-method. Anyway, if you're still in .NET 2.0 and prefer to use the Find method, you could simplify a little bit your loop: for (var i = 0; i 0) { var checkBox = controls[0] as CheckBox; if (checkBox != null) checkBox.Checked = i%2 == 0; } } The latest non-nullity test on checkbox can probably be omitted.
