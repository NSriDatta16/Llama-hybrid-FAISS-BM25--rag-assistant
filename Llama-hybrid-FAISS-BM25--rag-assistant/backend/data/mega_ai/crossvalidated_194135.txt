That Chi-squared statistic is gigantic. With 8 degrees of freedom, the a chi-squared statistic of 21.96 is associated with a p-value of 0.005. So a very large statistic like 200, with 8 degrees of freedom has a p-value so small that R returns zero, (i.e. close to zero). It is certainly less than .05, the level you are trying to test at, which is achieved with a chi-squared test statistic of only 2.73.
