I don't see any benifit really. Let's say the average app has 3 primary goals: Rendering User input / event handlers Number crunching / Network / Disk / Etc Dividing these into one thread each(several for #3) would be pretty logical and I would call #1 and #2 UI. You could say that #1 is already multithreaded and divided on tons of shader-processors on the GPU. I don't know if adding more threads on the CPU would help really. (at least if you are using standard shaders, IIRC some software ray tracers and other CGI renderers use several threads - but i would put such applications under #3) The user input metods, #2, should only be really really short, and invoke stuff from #3 if more time is needed, that adding more threads here wouldn't be of any use.
