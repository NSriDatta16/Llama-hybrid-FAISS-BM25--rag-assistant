Use the strcpy function. #include #include #include int main(int argc, char *argv[] ) { char *str = "Hello World"; size_t length = strlen(str); char *s = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char) * (length + 1)); strcpy(s, str); s[length] = '\0'; // makes sure it's NUL terminated printf("%s", s); free(s); return 0; } When allocating the destination buffer, pay attention to the fact that strings are terminated by the NUL character. To only copy a substring, use strncpy : strncpy(s, str + 6, strlen(str) - 6); will just copy "World" into s . In any case, make sure your C strings are NUL terminated before using functions like printf . See also strcat and strncat . And well, familiarize yourself with C arrays and pointers.
