The CAST() operator in the context of character encodings translates from one method of character storage to another — it does not change the actual characters, which is what you are after. An é character is what it is in any character set, it is not an e. You need to convert accented characters to non-accented characters, which is a different issue and has been asked a number of times previously ( normalizing accented characters in MySQL queries ). I am unsure if there is a way to do this directly in MySQL, short of having a translation table and going through letter by letter. It would most likely be easier to write a PHP script to go through the database and make the translations.
