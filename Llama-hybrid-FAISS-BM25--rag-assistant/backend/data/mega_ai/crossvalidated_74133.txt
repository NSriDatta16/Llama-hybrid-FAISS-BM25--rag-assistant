Discriminant analysis for the validation of cluster analysis

I did a discriminant analysis for the validation of my cluster analysis. The cluster analysis is based on a PCA, so I used the components as the independant variables in the discriminant analysis. My question is: is there a restriction considering the number of the independant variables (components) compared to the number of my (cluster) groups? Thanks a lot!
