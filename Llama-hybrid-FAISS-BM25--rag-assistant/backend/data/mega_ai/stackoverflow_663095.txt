I would check to see how long the actual retrieval is taking. for instance: Private Sub timeCheck() 'NOTE: Assuming you have a sqlconnection object named conn 'Create stopwatch Dim sw As New System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch 'Setup query Dim com As New SqlClient.SqlCommand("QUERY GOES HERE", conn) sw.Start() 'Run query Dim dr As SqlClient.SqlDataReader = com.ExecuteReader() sw.Stop() 'Check the time Dim sql_query_time As String = CStr((sw.ElapsedMilliseconds / 1000)) & " seconds" End Sub This will allow you to see whether the hold-up is in the retrieval, or in the execution of the reader.
