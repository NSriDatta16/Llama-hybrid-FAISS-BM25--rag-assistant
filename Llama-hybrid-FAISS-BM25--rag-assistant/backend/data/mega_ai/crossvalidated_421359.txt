So far is I can see, it would not be not possible to use the classical Lindeberg-Levy CLT here, because you have a weighted sum rather than straight average. I would assume that the error terms are still IID in your formulation (though you have not stated this), so you will need to apply a version of the CLT that applies to weighted sums of IID random variables. Your assumed limit result for the regressors ensures that each of the individual weights vanishes in the limit, so that should be sufficient to apply an appropriate version of the CLT for weighted sums. I would imagine that you can prove it via an application of Lyapunov's CLT plus Slutsky's theorem.
