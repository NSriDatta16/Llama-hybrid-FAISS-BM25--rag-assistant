Best value to store ratio data and compare it to time period average

I'm looking for a simple way to store ratios. For a time component, I must store the average ratio between two behavior. For example the number of people that turn left compared to the number of people that turn right. I have to detect unusual behavior (people that turn right abnormally). How should I mathematically compare the average ratio against the analyzed ratio, and how should I display the difference on a graph ? Thanks a lot in advance.
