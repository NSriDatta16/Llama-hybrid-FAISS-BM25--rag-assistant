Query Google storage to get only files in specified path

First of all: yes, I do realize that there is no such thing as folders in the Google Storage system. However, Google Storage has dummy folders suffixed _$folder$ . I know that you can define prefix to help you filter-out some results, though, how do I define the depth? In other words, I want to get only files/_$folder$s that are under /foo/bar but not children of the deeper _$folder$ s. Is that possible to do with query? PHP version of it is rather messy.
