DNA sequence classification

I have a database of 3190 instances of DNA consisting of 60 sequential DNA nucleotide positions classified according to 3 types: EI, IE, Other. I want to formulate a supervised classifier. At the moment I apply the 60 nucleotides as features and in addition 64 features from a 2nd order Markov Transition Matrix. The nucleotides A,C,G,T are encoded simply as 1,2,3,4 I'm running a Neural Net and achieving about 90% accuracy. Next thing to try is a SVM. My Question is: 1. Is there a better way to encode the feature data? 2. Is there a better way to approach the problem given that the sequential nature of the data is relevant.
