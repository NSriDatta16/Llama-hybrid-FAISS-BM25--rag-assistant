I am working on the same scenario, although NOT like a microblog (Yammer, Twitter, etc). The basic storage is to have the Blog as its own entity or table. You then have a user or users that can publish to that blog. In Yammer, you have the user with his "blog", you then have a higher container that allows multiple users to belong to a "blog". To mirror this in a database, you have the concept of the "user blog" and one of a "organizational blog", which contains many "user blogs". Hope this helps.
