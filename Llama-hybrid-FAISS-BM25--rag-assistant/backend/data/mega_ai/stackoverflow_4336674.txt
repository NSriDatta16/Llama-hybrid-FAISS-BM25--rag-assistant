Can I use jQuery selectors on an HTML string that is not attached to the DOM?

So if I have a variable like var ht = " Paragraph Here " If it was attached to the DOM I could just do this to get the text $('p').text(); But can I do the same kind of selection just on a variable that has not yet been attached to the dom?
