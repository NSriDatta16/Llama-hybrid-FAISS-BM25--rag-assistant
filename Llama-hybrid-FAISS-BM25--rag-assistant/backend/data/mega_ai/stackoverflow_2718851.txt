Not able to get response back on java code while http get with S60

I am using Net Beans for developing an application on S60. I made one page for user authentication and using .net wcf service to authenticate user. i am able to send data on .net service by HttpGet method but not able to get response back on java page. I have tested it on fiddler with this url its working fine and returning response code 200, but not getting response code by java code. Following code i am using. Is some thing wrong here ? httpConn = (HttpConnection)Connector.open(url); httpConn.setRequestMethod(HttpConnection.GET); httpConn.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Profile/MIDP-2.1 Confirguration/CLDC-1.1"); int respCode = httpConn.getResponseCode();
