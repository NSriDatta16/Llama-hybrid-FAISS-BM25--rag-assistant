There doesn't appear to anyway in native C# to do it (there might be in native Win32, but I don't know). What you could do is open the existing file and copy it to a new file and delete the old one. It would be slow compared to a move, but it might be only way. var oldName = "file.old"; var newName = "file.new"; using (var store = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) using (var readStream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream(oldName, FileMode.Open, store)) using (var writeStream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream(newName, FileMode.Create, store)) using (var reader = new StreamReader(readStream)) using (var writer = new StreamWriter(writeStream)) { writer.Write(reader.ReadToEnd()); }
