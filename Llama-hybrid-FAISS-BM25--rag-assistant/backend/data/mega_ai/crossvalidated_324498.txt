I had originally thought to do PCA on the item means (i.e., averaging across all ratings for that item), but realized that I will have fewer observations than dimensions, which I understand is not idea for PCA. That's not necessarily the case, for example see this question . Also you could try models that explicitly handle missing data, like probabilistic matrix factorization. The general term you could google is low-rank matrix factorization in the context of recommender systems. For an implementation you can see H2O - see this example for slides on application for missing values. If you're into Python you could also check this example (it uses H2O on Movielens dataset).
