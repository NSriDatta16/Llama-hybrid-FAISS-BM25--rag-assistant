This is still a view. You are not specifying what kind of storage are you using, I'll make an example using the entity framework, but you can do it with whatever method you like. The model for the view is an Entity. When you display the form in your view, only part of the fields in your model are editable. When the user submits, therefore, your model has only several fields filled in. So, you should retrieve a new copy of the object you are editing from the database (call it "fromDb"), copy only the edited fields into the fromDb object, and save the fromDb object instead. This way, all the fields are preserved. Another way to do this, is to render hidden fields for all the fields that are not present. However this is NOT secure, as the user could edit those fields by hand (using the developer tools, or firebug).
