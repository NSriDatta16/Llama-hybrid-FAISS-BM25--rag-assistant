In asp.net 1.1, when you compile in "batch mode" set to true, the output of the source files is compiled into single assemblies according to the directories, the type of file, etc. When "batch mode" is turned off, the output is a single assembly for the entire project. Some of the advantages and disadvantages are described in this small paragraph from an MSDN article . There are several issues you should be aware of when using this attribute. Performance—when Batch=false, the ASP.NET compiler will create an assembly for every Web form and user control in your Web application. It also causes the compiler to do a full compile, not an incremental compile, in Visual Studio 2005 when you build using F5. The net result is your Web application may run slower when deployed, and your build times will increase significantly in Visual Studio 2005. Assembly References—the Batch attribute may hide potential broken assembly references (when Batch=True), or even introduce a Circular Reference (when Batch=False).
