You need to look up Magento Event Dispatchers. Basically, every time an event occurs - updating a product, submitting an order, deleting something etc - a message is sent through the system. These messages can be caught and can then trigger methods you have created. To achieve what you want, you would need to catch the event that is triggered when a product is created and updated and get this to run a method from one of your custom modules. This method would then grab the value from the remote site and update the product with it. After a quick Google Search, I found the following article: http://blog.baobaz.com/en/tag/magento-events You can find what Magento events are triggered by looking at the appropriate module code.
