Testing if one group has bigger values than the other

I have one dimensional data that has been split into two groups. Now I would like to test wether the values in group one are 'bigger' than the values in group two. One naive way to do this would be to simply compare the averages. But I believe it doesn't really factor in the variation... What would be a good test to achieve this?
