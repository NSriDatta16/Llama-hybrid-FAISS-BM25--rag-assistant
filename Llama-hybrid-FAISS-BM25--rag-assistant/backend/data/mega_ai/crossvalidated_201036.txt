Does it make sense to transform time series variable into dependent variable of OLS model?

Assume that I have a data for the $ y $ like y 2000 74.5 2001 73.5 2002 71.4 2003 70.3 2004 79.1 ... ... Also, I have data on $ x $. x 2000 123.5 2001 136.5 2002 243.4 2003 235.3 2004 278.1 ... ... Can I simply transform this data into two variables for OLS estimation and just forget about time-component as follows y x 74.5 123.5 73.5 136.5 71.4 243.4 70.3 235.3 79.1 278.1 ... ... and estimate a model like this $ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i $? Will it be meaningful at all? Or why it can be wrong? UPDATE : data to play with
