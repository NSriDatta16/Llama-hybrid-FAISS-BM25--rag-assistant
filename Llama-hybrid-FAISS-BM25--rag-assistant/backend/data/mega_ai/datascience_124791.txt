Is there a Tensorflow built-in function to create a matrix from a single-layered feedforward neural network without activation functions?

In Tensorflow, I implemented a simple single-layer feedforward neural network with N inputs and N outputs without activation functions and biases. Simply, it is just a N-by-N matrix. Question : is there a Tensorflow built-in function that can express this neural network as a matrix easily? I know I can configure weights manually to construct a matrix; but, I am just wondering if a Tensorflow built-in function exists to do this configuration.
