Is this an accurate way of testing the speed of variable declarations? It's good enough to get a rough idea, but it's not perfect. Like most things, it relies on the CPU. If the CPU spikes during testing due to another application, such as a virus scanner, or another action from the browser, such as a phishing check, the JavaScript execution can be slowed. Even when the CPU is idle, it's not an exact science and you will have to run it many times to get a good average. how could i test more cycles without having firefox to crash? If i set doit to 1000000000 for example, firefox want to stop the script. Firefox limits JavaScript execution to a maximum of 10 seconds. I'm not sure if there's a work around. why are my results (of my script and in jspref) so different each time? Sometime the individual variable declaration is faster then the grouped :/ Because there's probably no real difference between the two. All variable declarations are "hoisted", and it's likely that this is done at parse-time instead of run-time as an optimization, so the internal representation of the functions after they have been parsed would be identical. The only difference is the subtle factors affecting the time it takes to initialize the undefined variables and execute the otherwise empty functions.
