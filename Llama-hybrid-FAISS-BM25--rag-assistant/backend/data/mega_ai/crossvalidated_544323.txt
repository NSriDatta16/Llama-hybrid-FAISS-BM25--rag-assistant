I have never heard of this trick before, and it does look strange ... since the trace is a sum of the $n$ diagonal terms, while the quadratic form needs a double sum over all the $n^2$ terms. So I guess the "trick" must be used only as one idea in combination with others, for some more involved problem than just a trace. And indeed, in your own linked reference such examples are given, so just start top read those examples with attention. But I do not find the example in that link very well written, so better to go to the reference they give Randomized algorithms for matrices and data , but that paper does not mention the trick! Search gives a lot of relevant papers, and RANDOMIZED ALGORITHMS FOR ESTIMATING THE TRACE OF AN IMPLICIT SYMMETRIC POSITIVE SEMI-DEFINITE MATRIX says, in its abstract that these algorithms are useful in applications in which there is no explicit representation of $A$ but rather an efficient method to compute $z^T Az$ given $z$ . So this trick is not useful in isolation, but as a building block for randomized algorithms.
