Personally, I would leave them as separate files unless your site is getting a very, very large amount of trafficâ€”it makes debugging simpler and keeps things nicely organised. Another thing: I'd recommend loading jQuery itself from the Google AJAX Libraries . It will offload one HTTP request to Google (allowing the rest of your scripts to start downloading more quickly) and has the added benefit that many visitors will already have it cached on their machine, as the AJAX Libraries are so widely used by major sites.
