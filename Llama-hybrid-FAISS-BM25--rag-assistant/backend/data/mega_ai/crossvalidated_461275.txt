Model selection when AIC scores are very close

Let's say you have a twice differenced time series. The AIC for two potential models are 2000 and 2000.1. As a rule of thumb you usually choose the one with the lower AIC, but if the model with AIC 2000.1 is a slightly simpler model would you be more inclined to choose it since both AIC's are within 2 units of each other?
