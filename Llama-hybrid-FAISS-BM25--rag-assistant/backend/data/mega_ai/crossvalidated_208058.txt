LDA is an unsupervised learning method that maximizes the probability of word assignments to one of K fixed topics. The topic meaning is extracted by interpreting the top N probability words for a given topic, i.e. LDA will not output the meaning of topics, rather it will organize words by topic to be interpreted by the user. In some cases, we have access to the meaning of topics, for example in the 20 newsgroups dataset , we know the newsgroup titles (e.g. sci.med, sci.crypt, comp.graphics). So we expect the learned topics to be closely related to newsgroup titles. In general, however, the topic meaning is interpreted by the user. On the other hand, for a quantitative evaluation of topic models, perplexity is used as a measure of how well the topic model fits the data by computing the average log-likelihood of the test set.
