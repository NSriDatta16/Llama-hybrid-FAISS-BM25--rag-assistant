What you are trying to achieve is commonly called Ensembling . Here's a link on some ensembling techniques that you might want to try. For simplicity's sake, a simple ensembling approach would be to perform a majority vote . That is, for a classification task with options 1 or 0 , and you have 10 models, just count total number of 1s and 0s . Another would be averaging the probabilities for each model and from the resulting probability, get the corresponding prediction. Hope that helps.
