Removing an Entity from an EntitySet during Iteration

I've got this code... seems nice and elegant, but apparently the framework don't like it when i mess with a collection while iterating through it: foreach (KitGroup kg in ProductToTransfer.KitGroups) { // Remove kit groups that have been excluded by the user if (inKitGroupExclusions != null && inKitGroupExclusions.Contains(kg.KitGroupID)) ProductToTransfer.KitGroups.Remove(kg); else { // Loop through the kit items and do other stuff //... } } The error it throws when it iterates to the 2nd object in the collection is: "EntitySet was modified during enumeration" I know i could create a new collection of KitGroup objects (or even just IDs) that i want to remove, and then another loop afterwards to loop through these, and remove them from the collection, but this just seems like unnecessary extra code... can anybody suggest a more elegant way of achieving the same thing?
