NServiceBus persisting subscriptions in Pub/Sub sample

I want to figure out how I to set up the Pub/Sub sample from NServiceBus to work in the case of publisher malfunction. When I start the samples and accidentaly close the Subscribers, if I restart everything works fine. If however I kill the publisher and the subscriptions continue to work, if I restart the publisher, then it doesn't seem to know it has subscribers and doesn't post any messages. I added the config entry but it seems to not function... I miss something. I googled about MsmqSubscriptionStorageConfig and DbSubscriptionStorageConfig but i didn't find a solution. Could someone point me in the right direction ?
