PCA is restricted to a linear map, while auto encoders can have nonlinear enoder/decoders. A single layer auto encoder with linear transfer function is nearly equivalent to PCA, where nearly means that the $W$ found by AE and PCA won't necessarily be the same - but the subspace spanned by the respective $W$ 's will.
