Why do neural networks use cost minimization of loss function and not profit maximization of profit function?

In neural networks, gradient descent is used to find optimum minimum value of cost function. Why this preference instead of finding maximum value of profit function? What are the pros and cons of minimising cost function versus maximizing profit function?
