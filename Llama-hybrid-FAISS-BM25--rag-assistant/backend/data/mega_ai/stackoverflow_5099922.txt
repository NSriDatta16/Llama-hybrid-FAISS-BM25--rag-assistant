I'd try http://www.ant4eclipse.org/ . It allows you to build your eclipse project from an ant file. From the first paragraph here: http://www.ant4eclipse.org/node/6 it sounds very much like what you want. With ant4eclipse ant will access your eclipse project and then it should be able to build through Hudson. The aim of the ant4eclipse project is to avoid (or at least: to reduce) the redundancy of Eclipse and Ant configurations. More precisly: it consists of Ant tasks that are able to read and work with some of Eclipse's configuration files.
