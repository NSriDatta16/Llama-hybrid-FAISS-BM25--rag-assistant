Why does my ROC curve look like this (is it correct?)

I have a ROC curve generated for a multivariate logistic regression. Does it look correct? This is what I've done: Solve $\theta_0 + \theta_1X_1 + \theta_2X_2 ... = Y$ for the $\theta$s Iterate over all the input $X_i$ and compute the predicted $Y_i'$ for various cutoff values (thresholds) from $0 - 1$, incrementing by $0.01$ For every $X_i$ and the predicted $Y_i'$, compare with original $Y_i$ to get the False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), True Positive (TP) and True Negative (TN) Calculate $\text{Sensitivity} = TP/(TP+FN)$ and $\text{Specificity} = TN/(FP+TN)$ for all these values and store them in two different vectors. Plot the ROC curve for $\text{Sensitivity}$ v/s $\text{Specificity}$ as shown below Please can someone tell me what is going wrong here?
