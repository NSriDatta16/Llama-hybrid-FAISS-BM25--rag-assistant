Templates spread across multiple files

C++ seems to be rather grouchy when declaring templates across multiple files. More specifically, when working with templated classes, the linker expect all method definitions for the class in a single compiler object file. When you take into account headers, other declarations, inheritance, etc., things get really messy. Are there any general advice or workarounds for organizing or redistributing templated member definitions across multiple files?
