I think the main explanation is simply different traditions. They started pretty much randomly with different terminology and they just continue. I do not think there is any deep, philosophical explanation. By the way, the terminology in applications of statistics and machine learning also varies across the fields; some (biology?) probably use samples instead of sample for statistical problems as well, as they just copy the term(s) from their domain.
