If @EEE's concern can be addressed and you proceed with an hypothesis test, then rather than logistic regression I'd recommend a chi-square test. For a person fairly new to statistical testing, it'll be dramatically easier to conduct, interpret, and explain to an audience. Plus I think it'll give you just about as much information.
