Various matrix as examples in neural network

I have to train a feedforward neural network for pattern recognition in matlab. Each example has 4 matrices of the same size (e.g. $N$ x $K$). The form I know to enter the values to the network is to convert each matrix into a vector and enter each value of each matrix as a single feature. But I would like to know how to tell the network (and if I have to tell the network) that the element $(i,j)$ of one matrix is related with the element $(i,j)$ of all the other matrices. Thanks.
