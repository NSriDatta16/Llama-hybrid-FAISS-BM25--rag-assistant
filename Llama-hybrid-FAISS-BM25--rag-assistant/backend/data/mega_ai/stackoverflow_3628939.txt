Is there a way to tell browsers to disable the "run" button when downloading an EXE?

It may be convenient for some of the unlimited bandwidth types to let your users continually download your product and continually forget where they put it and redownload it. But perception of scarcity of is the beginning of wisdom as the bail bondsman said to the coroner as he brought in the week's catch in a two meter gunny sack and I'd like to save us the trouble. Here's what I'm doing in PHP header("MIME-Version: 1.0"); header("Pragma: public"); header("Expires: 0"); header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0"); header("Content-type: application/octet-stream"); header('Content-Length: ' . $filesize); header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' . basename($filename).'"'); header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary"); readfile($filename); Is there another line I could add that would magically confuse all browsers into thinking there is no way any operating system could possibly do anything with this lump of bytes except place it in some secure location for its master to fiddle with at his or her leisure?
