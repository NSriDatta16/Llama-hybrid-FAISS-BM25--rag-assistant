Usually you develop reports with iReport . iReport has facilities for including subreports within reports (by dragging the subreport icon onto the master report page). Note that JasperReports uses absolute paths for file references. I would recommend you set up parameters to your reports as follows: $P{ROOT_DIR} $P{SUBREPORT_DIR} Give $P{SUBREPORT_DIR} a default value of $P{ROOT_DIR} + "subreports/" . At that point, you can pass the absolute path as $P{ROOT_DIR} into your report and then the subreports will be stored in a subdirectory called subreports , which is located in $P{ROOT_DIR} .
