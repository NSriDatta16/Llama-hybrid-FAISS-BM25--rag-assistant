First, you convert your cell array into a 3D array, then you can take the average, like this: tmp = cat(3,Data{:}); %# catenates the data, so that it becomes a m*n*z (or m*1*n) averageData = mean(tmp,3); %# takes average along 3rd dimension Note: if you get memory problems this way, and if you don't need to keep the variable Data around, you can replace tmp with Data and all will work fine. Alternatively, if Data is simply a m*n numeric array averageData = mean(Data,2);
