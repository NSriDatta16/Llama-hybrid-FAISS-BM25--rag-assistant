I'm not sure how you plan to use NLP techniques on behavioral data like cigarettes-per-day. That aside, correlation and/or covariance between your features, as is an established challenge to time series prediction, can be addressed to a certain extent with feature selection techniques and/or by adding a regularization parameter to your loss function. Random, but relevant paper that gives an example of regularization in time-series. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21851-7 There are also feature engineering methods that mitigate "seasonality" or other trends, such as ARIMA. I honestly don't really understand the rest of your question/proposition. Hope I've addressed some piece of your question.
