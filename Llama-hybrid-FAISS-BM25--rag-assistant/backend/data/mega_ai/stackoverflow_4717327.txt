I moved from TextMate to MacVim. My -- entirely personal and subjective -- reason for switching was the breadth of available documentation, plugins, hacks, tutorials, etc. for Vim. It made it easier for me to research ways to quickly perform common tasks. Another turning point for me was the realization that the entire TextMate project hinges upon how much or little attention it gets from its author. Case in point: a while back an update was released that broke a feature I use quite often. The problem was rectified within a couple of weeks, but I didn't like the feeling that my hands were tied while I waited for the developer to fix it. Also, once I grokked Vim's motion commands, I didn't really want to use anything else for writing text.
