Fulvio, I haven't looked at my Facebook code for 9+ months. Hence, take my answer as a suggestion. That said, I've just reviewed it and the authentication state is maintained in cookies leftover from the authorization process. This is pretty easy to log: NSLog(@"%@", [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] cookies]); Enjoy, Andrew
