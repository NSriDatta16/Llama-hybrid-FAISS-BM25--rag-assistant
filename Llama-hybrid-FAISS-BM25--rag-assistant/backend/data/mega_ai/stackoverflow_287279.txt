How do you unit test a FileSystemWatcher event?

I am working on a system that processes documents that are dumped into a target directory. I pick up the files by detecting the FileSystemWatcher OnChanged event. As part of a unit test, how should I go about automating this? How should I organize the input files and the output files that get compared to verify that the transformations are correct? Is this something that is better handled by a batch file issuing diff commands?
