When I am referring to 'parameters' or 'weights' in the hidden layer, are they between input - hidden or hidden - output? Between both. I also saw some conflicting info on what a layer is: In correct science is this just neurons or just synapses or some combination between the two? I have no idea what you call "correct science" , but ANNs do not model real neuronal networks, it's a metaphor, a meta-heuristic. Having said that, the idea is that the nodes in the layers are neurons themselves. They receive input from previous layers and pass it forward, so a layer is just like a cortical layer so common in the cortex: it's a collection of neurons organized, just in a more contrived way in an ANNs than in real biology.
