No, what you are describing is not a hierarchical model. Hierarchical model is a single model (all at once) that describes such hierarchy, in this case this is a random slopes model, where the slopes vary among groups. Moreover, the procedure is incorrect, because you are using the same data multiple times to calculate same things (first to estimate higher-level parameters, then use them as a "prior" and use same data combined with this prior for estimating new parameters etc.), this will lead to your model being overconfident, because it would see the same information multiple times. If you want to learn about hierarchical regression model (with emphasis on Bayesian approach), check the Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models book by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill.
