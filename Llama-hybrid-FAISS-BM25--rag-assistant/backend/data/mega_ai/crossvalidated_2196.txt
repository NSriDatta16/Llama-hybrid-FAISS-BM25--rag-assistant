You can try Latent Semantic Analysis , which basically provides a way to represent in a reduced space your news feeds and any term (in your case, keyword appearing in the title). As it relies on Singular Value Decomposition, I suppose you may then be able to check if there exists a particular association between those two attributes. I know this is used to find documents matching a specific set of criteria, as in information retrieval, or to construct a tree reflecting terms similarity (like a dictionary) based on a large corpus (which here plays the role of the concept space). See for a gentle introduction An Introduction to Latent Semantic Analysis , by Landauer et al. Moreover, there is an R package that implements this technique, namely lsa .
