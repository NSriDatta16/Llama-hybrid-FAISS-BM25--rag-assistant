Hierarchical logistic regression package in R

I'm working on a logistic regression model; the purpose of the analysis is to identify factors that influence use of an app - the DV being use/no use, and IVs being a couple of numerical and categorical variables. I want to do a hierarchical regression and add variables step-wise, and compare how much each variable improves the model. At the moment I define multiple models, add a variable for each model, compare the models using an ANOVA and save and compare the (adjusted) R squares in a table: model1 Rather than doing this manually, I was wondering if there is a package/function in R that does this for you and gives the relevant results? And is R squared the best comparison for logistic regression or should I include other measures?
