I think you're looking for the [implode][0] function. Then just echo the imploded string. The only more elegant i can think of making that exact algorithm is this: function implodeEcho($array, $joinValue) { foreach($array as $i => $val) { if ($i != 0) echo $joinValue; echo $val; } } This of course assumes $array only is indexed by integers and not by keys.
