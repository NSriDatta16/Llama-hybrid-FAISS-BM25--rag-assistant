Matching two power signals for similarity

Below are the images of two signals that i plotted. Both the signals are from fridge belonging to different houses. Visually looking at the plot i can tell that these plots belong to fridge as they look very similar. But is there a way i can statistically compare the two graphs for similarity using the time series plot ? Thanks
