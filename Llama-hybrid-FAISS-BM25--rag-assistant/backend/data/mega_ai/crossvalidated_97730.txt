I don't have access to SPSS, but I strongly suspect that it can output a confidence interval for the intercept in logistic regression. You probably have to know how to use the underlying syntax (e.g., PASTE ) to call for it. As to why it isn't output by default, you'd really have to contact the company. But I would guess that they believe people aren't very interested in seeing the CI for the intercept and want to minimize the volume of statistical output.
