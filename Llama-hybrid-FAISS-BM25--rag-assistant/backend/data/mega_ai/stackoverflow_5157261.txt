First: Are they different methods, or a copy-paste-error? printSelecteds (narrow_list); printSelected (list); Second: To disable a button you usually use: ok.setEnabled (false); If the file is loaded, you call ok.setEnabled (true); to enable the JButton "ok". I don't see how that is related to your info-text, and to your printSelected(s) method. If you pass the state via the GUI, you might loose the one or the other due to race conditions. Changing a label could be the sink of an state change. You could have mutual exclusive bit patterns to allow interference: FILE_OPEN = 1; SEARCHED = 2; FRIDAY = 4; to add them bitwise: state |= FRIDAY to ask them up in a binary pattern: if (state | FILE_OPEN) .... It doesn't look very elegant to me. I guess I'm not sure what your problem is. :) To fire an action if some button is pressed, you have to implement an actionListener, which could modify your label as well. But the swing eventloop will already check the state of your components. You seem to duplicate the work partly.
