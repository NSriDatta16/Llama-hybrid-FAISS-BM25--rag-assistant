Generally speaking, you can't. I would be very wary of techniques that claim to be able to prove a $1/10^6$ error rate given only $4000$ tests. Often those kinds of techniques involve somewhere making an assumption of independence, which there is no way to validate reliably: it's just a leap of faith. These kinds of flawed reasoning have led to serious failures in the world of safety-critical systems. There may be some special cases where you can demonstrate the desired level of reliability using such a limited number of tests, e.g., by taking into account something about the physics of the situation. But they are rare, and that kind of reasoning is fragile.
