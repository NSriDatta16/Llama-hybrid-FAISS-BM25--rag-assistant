Why does Wikipedia say "Polymorphism is not the same as method overloading or method overriding."

I have looked around and could not find any similar question. Here is the paragraph I got from Wikipedia : Polymorphism is not the same as method overloading or method overriding. Polymorphism is only concerned with the application of specific implementations to an interface or a more generic base class. Method overloading refers to methods that have the same name but different signatures inside the same class. Method overriding is where a subclass replaces the implementation of one or more of its parent's methods. Neither method overloading nor method overriding are by themselves implementations of polymorphism. Could anyone here explain it more clearly, especially the part "Polymorphism is not the same as method overriding"? I am confused now. Thanks in advance.
