R function `poly` in logistic regression not giving orthogonal results

After reviewing this comment , I have been interested in using the polynomial function within logistic regression. As I understand it, the poly function is useful because it produces orthogonal polynomials that have the ability to assess the contribution of each additional polynomial term. However, I am getting results that vary drastically when adding subsequent terms in logistic regression for predicting categorical variables. I am attaching a brief example using the same data as the previous comment, but trying to predict a categorical outcome that is TRUE if mpg > mean(mpg) and FALSE if mpg library(ISLR) fm2 mean(mpg) ~poly(horsepower,1), family = "binomial", data=Auto) cbind(coef(fm2)) # [,1] # (Intercept) -1.015118 # poly(horsepower, 1) -72.853345 fm3 mean(mpg) ~poly(horsepower,2), family = "binomial", data=Auto) cbind(coef(fm3)) # [,1] # (Intercept) -0.5624529 # poly(horsepower, 2)1 -57.7684809 # poly(horsepower, 2)2 12.3423471 Furthermore, it seems that not using the poly function at all has different results from using the poly function: library(tidyverse) fm2 mean(mpg) ~poly(horsepower,1), family = "binomial", data=Auto) cbind(coef(fm2)) # [,1] # (Intercept) -1.015118 # poly(horsepower, 1) -72.853345 fm2_alt mean(mpg) ~horsepower, family = "binomial", data=Auto) cbind(coef(fm2_alt)) # [,1] # (Intercept) 8.98463249 # horsepower -0.09571943 In an attempt to visualize what is going on, I have plotted both of these logistic regression functions overlying two different distributions: The original distribution The original distribution translated to have a mean of zero. func_fm2 mean(mpg))), color = "darkblue") + geom_jitter(aes(x = horsepower - mean(horsepower),y = as.numeric(mpg>mean(mpg))), color = "darkred") + stat_function(fun=func_fm2, colour="orange") + stat_function(fun=func_fm2_alt, colour="cyan") + xlim(c(-50,200)) + labs(title = "Logistic Regression of horsepower and mpg", subtitle = "Original distribution in dark blue. Shifted distribution in dark red.", caption = " Logistic Regression fit plotted. `poly` fit in orange. non-`poly` fit in cyan.") Am I doing something completely wrong? Should I be using a different function for polynomial logistic regression? Or rather, is it valid to first translate the distribution to have a mean of zero, and then subsequently add polynomial terms by the poly function?
