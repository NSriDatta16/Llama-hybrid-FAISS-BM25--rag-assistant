Hello, qsc. I am very sympathetic to your quest of learning Bayesian statistics by posing problems to yourself, and then trying to solve them. However, this method also meets many roadblocks at times, such as here. You are not trying to infer $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ individually (which is easy), so I assume you are attempting to infer them from their convolution , and working backward, given your assumptions on the distributions taken by $S$ and $P$ . So the first step is solving this convolution problem. Based on wikipedia's convolution page , the convolution of Exponential's is a Gamma, and the convolution of Gamma's is yet another Gamma, so based on some intuition, I imagine the conv. you are looking for would also produce a Gamma. Here, you are in luck, because as you found, most convolutions do not have closed-form answers as easy as this. However, where you are out of luck, is that there does not seem to be a known, documented way of performing convolution via Bayesian methods, and then using that to go backwards somehow. This is a simple roadblock that I hope you figure out how to overcome with enough research.
