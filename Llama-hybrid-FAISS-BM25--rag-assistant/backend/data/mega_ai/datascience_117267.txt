There are a few ways to incorporate new features into an existing machine learning model: Train a new model: Training a new model from scratch on the entire dataset (including the new features) is one option. This can be a good choice if the new features are very different from the old features and you want to start from a clean slate. Fine-tune the existing model: You can fine-tune the existing model by adding the new features to the input data and retraining the model on the expanded dataset. This can be a good option if the new features are related to the old features and you want to preserve the knowledge that the existing model has already learned. Train a submodel: You can train a submodel on the new features and then combine it with the existing model. This can be a good option if the new features are related to the old features and you want to preserve the knowledge that the existing model has already learned, but you also want to allow the submodel to specialize on the new features. Which approach is best will depend on the specifics of your problem and the characteristics of the new features. In general, it is usually a good idea to try a few different approaches and see which one works best for your problem.
