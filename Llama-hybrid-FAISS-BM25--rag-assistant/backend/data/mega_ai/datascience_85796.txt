Annealing is short for simulated annealing . Simulated annealing is the process of slowly decreasing the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Over the course of the experiment, γ value was slowly lowered to balance exploration and exploitation. γ is a machine learning hyperparameter so any hyperparameter search method would work (e.g., manually selection or cross-validation).
