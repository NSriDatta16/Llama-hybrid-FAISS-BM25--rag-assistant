Sentence Classification Machine Learning API

Are there any ML models or APIs that can be used to classify a sentence into one of the four types of sentences; i.e. declarative (statement), imperative (command), interrogative (question) and exclamatory (exclamation). P.S. A web rest api would be ideal. Alternatively, if it exists, please recommend an algorithm that solves this problem.
