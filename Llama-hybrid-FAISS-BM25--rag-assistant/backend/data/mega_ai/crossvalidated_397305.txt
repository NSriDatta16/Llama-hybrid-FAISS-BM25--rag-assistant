For binomial success / fail data, how to calculate if the time since last success is out of the normal range

Struggling to figure this out. I have data sets that are essentially ObjectId, Date, Pass/Fail (1/0) The data is normally daily. What I want to figure out is IF the number of days since the last pass is normal, or, out of the ordinary For some of the data, it might show that we, on average, it passes every day.. In this case, a fail in the last 1 or 2 days is out of the ordinary For other data, we might only have a pass on average every 10 days. For this data, what is out of the ordinary? I tried just averaging the pass/fails into an average number. But in this case, roughly 50% of cases end up showing on my report So - Any ideas for a formula to calculate some confidence that a particular object has had too many days since it's last pass? (based on the average number of days that it usually passes) Let's say, for sake of argument that I look at a 90 day window. The current things I have tried to calculate is: Number of of passes divided by total tries (pass rate) Number of total tries divided by passes (avg days between passes) I assume some standard deviation calculation comes into play?
