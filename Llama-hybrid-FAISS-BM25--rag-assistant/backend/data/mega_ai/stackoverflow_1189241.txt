I don't think you'll be able to achieve this, JAX-RPC just doesn't have the flexibility (which is why it was killed in JavaEE 5). In general, I usually find that WSDL generators do not have the expressive power to generate the exact WSDl I want, and so I tend to use them to generate a WSDL as a starting point, and then modifying the result. You then server up the WSDL as a static file rather than as a generated one. It's not ideal, but it's not a big deal either.
