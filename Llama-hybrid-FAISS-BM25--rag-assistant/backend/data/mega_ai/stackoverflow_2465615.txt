Static members of the class. If they are used in multiple places by the one class, it's usually easier to keep things organized - and to later find where you defined everything - if you keep them defined in the class that uses them. Defining them in-place makes them hard to locate and later modify. And I'd opt for the specific class over the anonymous namespace for cleaner class definition and use.
