How to float paragraph next to image without wrapping the image?

I want to float a paragraph next to image, but without wrapping the image. Like this: div.img { float: left; display: block; margin: 15px 2% 0 2%; width: 26%; /* I cannot use that */ } div.info { float: right; display: block; margin: 15px 2% 0 2%; width: 66%; /* The width should be variable */ } The problem is that I can do it if I set width to both img and info but the image is a variable width/height . It does not have specific width/height. I am almost lost in this situation. Please suggest to me anything.I want both divs to float next to each other without wrapping .. without specifying box width. Any solution..workaround?
