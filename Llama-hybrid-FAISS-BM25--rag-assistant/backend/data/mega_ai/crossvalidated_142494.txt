Your problem description sounds like a Poisson-type scenario. I don't see any issue with how you estimate the number of cars per unit length. Let's take an example. Suppose your data for 4 units of length are 13, 12, 10, and 13. Taking the entire length, we would estimate the mean number of cars per unit length $\lambda$ as $$\hat \lambda={{13+12+10+13} \over {4}}=12$$ The variance of this estimator is ${\lambda \over n},$ which we would estimate with ${\hat \lambda \over n},$ where $n$ is the number of intervals. So our estimate is $$s^2 ={ {12} \over {4}} = 3.$$ Now suppose you use intervals that are twice as long. Now your data are $25$ $(13 + 12)$ and $23$ $(10 + 13).$ The estimators are now $$\hat \lambda_1 = {{25} \over {2}}$$ and $$ \hat \lambda_2 = {{23} \over {2}} $$ If we average these we find, as before, $$\hat \lambda=12$$ Given that we have summed two estimators and divided by $2,$ the variance estimate will be ${{1} \over {4}}$ times the sum of the estimated variances. So we have $$ s^2 = {{1} \over {4}} \left({{25} \over {4}} +{{23} \over {4}}\right) =3$$
