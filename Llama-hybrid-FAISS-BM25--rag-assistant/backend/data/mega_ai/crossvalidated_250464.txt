It seems there are indeed no bias units at either layer. In his thesis on neural network based language models, Mikolov states that: [...] biases are not used in the neural network, as no significant improvement of performance was observed - following the Occam's razor, the solution is as simple as it needs to be. (Mikolov, T.: Statistical Language Models Based on Neural Networks , p. 29) While this is a quote concerning recurrent neural networks specifically, I am going to assume the same is valid for the Skip-gram model.
