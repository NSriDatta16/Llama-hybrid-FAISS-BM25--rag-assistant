jQuery (Nvio slider) not firing on a CodeIgniter app once moved to Media Temple host

I am hoping someone might know the answer to this off the top. I have developed this site on a Fedora box, then moved it to my test box (link below) running Ubuntu Svr 10.10/Apache2/PHP5/MySQL5.1 and all works fine through on the dev and test platforms. I have researched the Media Temple, Code Igniter (using 1.7) & jQuery forums for the past two days and so far and can't find a similar issue where the script does not fire the function and my js and css paths are correct. Specifics: I have run the following code successfully on my development and self hosted test server with results that pass. Once the same code and same database is moved to Media Temple the jQuery stops firing. The test server link is (so you can see it work): http://ganymede.likescandy.com/site/ On view source you see the pictures in the slider which give us that nice slider action. The Media Temple link where it fails is: http://jeffbreece.com/site The code that is not firing on the Media Temple hosted code is this function (but does on both the test hosts): jQuery(function() { jQuery('#slider').nivoSlider({ effect:'sliceUpDown', pauseTime:5000, directionNav:false }); });
