If you train a neural network on inputs, you can't simply transform those inputs without also transforming the weights and biases of the network you trained to match. The transformation you're proposing is indeed invalid. Consider the simple case of regression where I learn a model $y = ax + b$ . Now I transform my input to $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$ . It's of course not true that $ax + b = az + b$ . But $y = a(z\sigma + \mu) + b = a{\sigma}z + a\mu$ , and there's still an equivalent transform you would learn or just create directly if you choose to transform your input. They're all just linear transformations, after all.
