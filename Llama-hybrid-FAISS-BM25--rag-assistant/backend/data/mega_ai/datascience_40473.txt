There are some ways to deal with it but they do not solve the problem well. You can use black pixels, special values for nan, resizing and a separate mask layer that says where the information on the picture is. But most likely they are working not so well. Otherwise the image datasets would have images of different sizes. Separate layers for masks is used in the currently best image recognition neural network (SENet. Hu et al. Winner of ImageNet in 2017). But they use masking for zooming into the picture and not for different image sizes.
