As pointed out in comments, what you have read you must have misunderstood. Apart from that, neural networks are universal approximators, that is, can approximate uniformly any continuous function on compacts (that is for one-internal layer networks, deep nets can possibly approximate even more functions). If neural networks always gave convex functions, that property would fail!
