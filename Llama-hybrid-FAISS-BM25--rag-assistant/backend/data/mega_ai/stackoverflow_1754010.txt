One thing you need to check is .css file and .eot should be in same folder if you do url('HelveticaNeueLTCom-LtCn_0.eot') or do full url path like src:url( http://www.example.com/path/to/url/Helvetica.eot ) Quotes are optional as far as I know. ps# I am doing font embedding in my blog for long time, its working fine.
