if a different covariate violates the PH assumption, does this actually matter since I don't care about, and won't be reporting, the coefficients associated with these adjustment covariates? I think it's good practice to report the entire Cox model summary, even if just in supplemental data to a full report. You audience will want to know what you attempted to control for and what associations those "adjustment covariate" themselves had with outcome. If nothing else, that will put the association between your "exposure" and outcome into a more quantitative perspective with respect to other known or suspected risk factors. Consider simple ways to fix the PH violation. If the adjustment covariate is categorical, a model stratifying on it instead of modeling it should remove the problem. If the adjustment covariate is continuous, you might have mis-specified the functional form of its association with outcome. See this page for an introduction. If there's still a problem with PH, I'd recommend that you read Sections 6.5 and 6.6 of Therneau and Grambsch , a useful overview of the issues. As they say, "The first two questions to ask are 'does it matter' and 'is it real;' it will often turn out that nothing is required." Cross Validated posts on PH by @AdamO , like this one , are also useful. As those posts point out, when PH is violated you get lower power and a sort of event-averaged hazard ratio, which isn't much of an issue with an adjustment covariate. I would still recommend trying to fix the PH problem, however, as fixing it is less likely to raise problems with reviewers of your report than will arguing that the PH violation doesn't matter.
