refreshing QTreeView / QSortFilterProxyModel

Good Day to All, Been writing code for years, but still a bit green when it comes to PyQt, so please forgive my syntactically lacking question(s) ;-) I'm hacking a derivative of the (famous?) packaged example that comes with PyQt4 (and Qt), namely "basicsortfiltermodel.pyw" from "../examples/itemviews" in PyQt4... I've added a little popup menu (let's call this B.py) that one can launch from the BasicSort-derivative (let's call this A.py). I believe I'm correcting adding new data (a new record) to the QSortFilterProxyModel(). (I think this because I'm not getting any errors now, after some effort) But I seem to be unable to get the QTreeView to refresh. I've scoured the Qt class docs and Google'd the heck out of it (seems like a common question from the looks of it, lol).. Now I know this is an ugly hack, but just to try to get it to work (elegance can come later is my theory)... At the bottom of A.py, I declared a global "wX", global wX; [...] window = Window() wX = Window() window.setSourceModel(createMailModel(window)) so that when I hit a button later, I could more easily get a hold of the "parent" value found in the runtime "createMailModel". From which I get the "model" handle.. model = QtGui.QStandardItemModel(0, 17, WinX) addMail(model, "image", "tabl00", etc etc) Anyways,..I think this is working.... But after adding a new record via addMail(), I can't seem to get self.proxyModel to refresh itself.. I'm pretty sure this a stupid newbie issue, lol....but could anyone help shed some light on how to make this work? Many Thanks,
