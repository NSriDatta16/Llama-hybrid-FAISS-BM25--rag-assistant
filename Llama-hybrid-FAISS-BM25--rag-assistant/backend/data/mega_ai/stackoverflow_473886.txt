Create a base action for your application; this will help you IMMENSELY later on Do create actions as you have in your code, instead favor subclasses of your base action To organize them, it will depend on what you are doing with them, and you may have some actions organized one way and others created a different way. It will all depend. What you want is to have a consistent way to locate/create an action in your code. Depending on your UI, you may need to differentiate between "static" actions (i.e. stuff that's always available in your app, such as the menu system) and dynamic actions that are created only on certain screens or in certain locations. In any case, using concrete subclasses of your specialized base action will help you keep these things organized. What you don't want is to be specifying things like labels, mnemonics, and icons all over the place in your code.
