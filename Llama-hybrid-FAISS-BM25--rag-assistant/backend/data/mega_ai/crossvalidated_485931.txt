PCA with $\mathcal{l}1$-regularization

For any matrix, $X$ , $\lambda>0$ and $j$ vectors, $v_1$ , $v_2$ , ..., $v_k$ . We want to solve the following optimization problem. $$\textrm{max}_vv^TX^TXv\textrm{ s.t. }\|v\|_2\leq1, \|v\|_1\leq \lambda\textrm{ and }v\perp v_1, ..., v_k$$ Some Thoughts Optimization of PCA can be converted into a convex programming problem by tricks introduced in this link . Therefore, we can view it as a convex programming with absolute values in contraints. Relevant Work If the optimization were the following, $$\textrm{min}_vv^TX^TXv+\lambda\|v\|_1\textrm{ s.t. }v\perp v_1, ..., v_k$$ we could solve it by LASSO with linear constraint. The reference work is here
