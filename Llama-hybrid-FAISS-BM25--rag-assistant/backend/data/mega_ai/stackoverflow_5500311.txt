In our case, we specify all the files needed (jar and zip wise) in our jnlp file. We have used .dll's but they were packaged with a program that was already installed on the system. We interacted with this program via ours. All we needed was to make sure the path to the .dll's was specified in the Windows path variable. In terms of packaging, we packaged all our jars into a .war file and then put that .war into an .ear file (not necessary, but we did) and deployed that to our application server. When we updated the jar versions in our war, we also updated the jar version numbers in our .jnlp file (as well as in some version.xml file we use) and redeploy it all. Then when the client's fire up, they check against the new .jnlp file and download the right jars. Is that helpful? Did I understand your question correctly?
