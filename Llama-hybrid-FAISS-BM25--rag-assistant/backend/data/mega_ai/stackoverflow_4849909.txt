Pseudo code is informal; it's one way to communicate your ideas and algorithms to others. There's not much to learn. If you understand data structures and algorithms and can explain them in english, then you already do know pseudo code. If you want real, usable pseudo code, Python is the closest thing I've seen that resembles readable pseudo code if elegance and readibility are important considerations.
