This is a poor man's solution, but if build storage is a major financial decision, then I think this answer is warranted. :) First, it is highly unlikely that you will find a brand new storage/source control system that does this type of complex file referencing for less than you could just pay for new storage . How about keeping the last 2 months worth of builds on expensive storage (i.e. RAID) and then go get yourself some cheap storage for archiving (i.e. a 1TB USB drive that someone else mentioned). Write a simple little console app that runs as a scheduled task every night and moves all files
