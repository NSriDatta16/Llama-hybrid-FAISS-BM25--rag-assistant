Interpreting Hurdle Model Output for Count Data in R

I have a model looking into the use of a social media news site within an enterprise. In particular I am examining which factors have the greatest influence on the number of replies and ratings a comment receives. I would be grateful for any help interpreting the output to my hurdle models. I have run tests, root grams and so forth to ensure the hurdle method is the most accurate. I am just not sure how to report the output. Using the following code: # The average use of they as a percentage of overall word use summary(RatersTheyAVG I obtained the following results: Call: pscl::hurdle(formula = SUMRaters ~ AVGthey, data = dfUsers, dist = "negbin") Pearson residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.5245 -0.4598 -0.3584 -0.1358 49.6193 Count model coefficients (truncated negbin with log link): Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -7.239 5.673 -1.276 0.2020 AVGthey 1.501 0.107 14.030 |z|) (Intercept) 1.40878 0.02443 57.664 Which I then used as a foundation to take the exp values for using: R-code: exp(cbind(Exponentiated_Odds_Ratio=coef(RatersTheyAVG), confint(RatersTheyAVG))) Exponentiated_Odds_Ratio 2.5 % 97.5 % count_(Intercept) 0.0007178858 1.063765e-08 48.446812 count_AVGthey 4.4854145071 3.637047e+00 5.531670 zero_(Intercept) 4.0909480423 3.899676e+00 4.291602 zero_AVGthey 1.1488266855 1.080102e+00 1.221924 Am I right in interpreting this as follows (AVGthey is scored from 0 to 100): For each percentage increase in AVGthey, there is a 4.49 unit increase in the absolute number of ratings For each percentage increase in AVGthey, there is a 0.15 unit increase in likelihood of a user having received at least one rating Another question is what I should do with the fact that the count model intercept is not significant? I am new to the use of count models and hurdle models in particular, so I hope that you can forgive my ignorance. Happy to provide any more info required and appreciate any time spared to help me. Thanks in advance, Sean
