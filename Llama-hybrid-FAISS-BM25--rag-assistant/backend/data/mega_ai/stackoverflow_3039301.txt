I've taken the liberty of dumping your markup to a file on my server: Original markup Alternative markup There is no actual gap on my iPhone, but... the resizing algorithm does leave some space between the tables from time to time while zooming in/out. This almost certainly has to do with some math not perfectly aligning to the pixel and getting rounded to match the nearest horizontal line. There is not much you can realy do about this, unless you resort to surrounding the tables with an inline-block that has the same background-color set like in the alternate file linked above. On my iPhone the alternate version never displays any black lines between the tables. Be aware though that now the next element will be next to the inline-block ed div instead of underneath the tables. I'll leave solving that upto the reader. hint: css clear attribute.
