For a simple illustrative case, take the CO2 data, pretty linear, so a simple parsimonious model, even a simple linear trend model, or better a simple one parameter auto-regressive time series model, is appropriate. However, I would argue, in the longer term, some caution based on knowledge of what is actually driving the CO2 creation on earth itself. For example, per the EPA , a government source: Since 1970, CO2 emissions have increased by about 90%, with emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributing about 78% of the total greenhouse gas emissions increase from 1970 to 2011. Agriculture, deforestation, and other land-use changes have been the second-largest contributors.Feb 25, 2022. Note, fossil fuel combustion is, at least, in theory a controllable event by mankind. Perhaps electric vehicles may shift the fossil fuel demand, as could further transition to solar, wind and other green sources. The latter may mitigate the CO2 trend line, at least, to a limited extent, in the next 10 years. As such, for example, in the short term, pay attention to whether the percent contribution mix is changing. If it is, try using it as an added explanatory variable, as opposed to a more simple model, to produce better forecasts that can actually capture turning points better. Next, known the nature of the data, as for example, economic data is percent change driven, so a log transform to induce normality is an appropriate step. Conversely, just looking for the best transform or the current best fitting model, without any justifying foundation as to why/how it is providing a good fit is not recommended. Do not model all the data to suggest a model! This likely the opposite of best practice. However, data exploration on a random subset, excluded from further analysis, may provide insights for suggesting models along with other further supporting fundamentals. On temp_anomaly These are likely a lagged function of green house gases, based on the physics/chemistry. Try a 3rd or 4th order fitting polynomial exercise based on lagged values of say CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.
