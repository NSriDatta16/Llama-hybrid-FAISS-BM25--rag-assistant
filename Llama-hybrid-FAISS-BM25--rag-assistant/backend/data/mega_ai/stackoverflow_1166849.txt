Fix Eclipse java references database corruption?

How do I make eclipse rebuild the database of classes contained within a project or workspace? This is what it uses to make the "References" menu action work, what it uses for the "Add import" dialog, etc. Basically, it's part of the core usefulness of Eclipse. And now, it's only working for maybe 5% of my project. I've run into this problem multiple times: something happens with eclipse, either through an OutOfMemoryError because I opened some huge file, or because a workspace just has months of hard usage. Right now, I'm using Eclipse Galileo on Win32. However, I've had this problem on MacOS as well as with Europa and Ganymede. In the past, I've trashed my workspace and started again, but today this is not an option. My last workspace backup is from last Friday, but that still means hours of work in restoration. Surely there must be another option? EDIT: I've used eclipse -clean as well as rebuilt my project. This is a corruption problem somewhere in eclipse, not in my project.
