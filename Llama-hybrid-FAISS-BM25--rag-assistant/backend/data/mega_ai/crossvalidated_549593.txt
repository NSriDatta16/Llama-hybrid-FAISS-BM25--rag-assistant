As was noted in the comments you could use an average. Other alternatives would be a naive forecast (just the last value projected forward) or seasonal naive (last seasonal period repeated). Additionally, the previous M4 competition used the average of simple exponential smoothing, double exponential smoothing, and damped double exponential smoothing all averaged together as the benchmark so you could try that out as well. Judging your model can be done by doing time series cross validation on it and which ever is the best performing for whatever error metric you use is the best model.
