Android layout folder organization

I am developing an Android app and I currently have about 8 layout xml files in the layout folder. The need for organizing this folder is increasing with each additional layout resource file. However, when I create a folder inside of the layout folder and move a resource to it via the refactor operation, it breaks my project. For example, my resource is being refernced here: setContentView(R.layout.login); After moving the login.xml file to a newly created folder called "test" , it breaks my build. If I update the reference to: setContentView(R.layout.test.login); It still doesn't compile. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
