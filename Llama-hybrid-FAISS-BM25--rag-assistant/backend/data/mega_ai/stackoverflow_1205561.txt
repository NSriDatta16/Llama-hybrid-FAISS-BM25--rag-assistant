Unique html item ID in Javascript

I am building a drag'n'drop gui builder in Javascript. So far so good. As I add items to the GUI and configure them; I have two mechanisms for addressing them: the 'class' - which I use for doing things to all instances of an item (eg CSS, generic functionality and so on and so forth) and which I can bind javascript libraries to... and I can make full use of polymorphic class names (ie class="name1 name2 name3 name4" with different things bound to each class name...) the 'id' - which refers to this particular instance of a text box or a paragraph and which I can bind javascript libraries to My problem is this: the 'id' must be unique across all html items on the page (by definition) so how do I ensure this? I need to get all the id's of all the items and then maintain some sort of state table. Starting from a blank bit of html this is pretty reasonable - but I need to start from a partly created bit of html with a mixture of existing 'id's - some of which will be in my unique scheme and some of which wont be... The way to do this best ought to be a solved problem. Suggestions, tips, examples?
