The pros and cons of storing files in "the cloud" IMHO: The pros: Availablity: you have your data available anywhere you go (if you have internet access of course) You can store a relatively large amount of data without having to worry about the storage capabilities of the client computer. It is easier to share data with other people / to do workgroup. The cons: Security: you need to trust that the storage provider will treat your data confidentially and it has strong enough security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access. Unavailability: you can't continue working if for some reason you temporarily lose connectivity (this can be anyway partially solved by using data caches). Performance, as you have mentioned, especially with very large amounts of data. So, bearing this in mind, you decide what's best for your particular project.
