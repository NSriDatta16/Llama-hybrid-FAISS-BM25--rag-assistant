Statistical Significance of Rolling Z-Score and Z-Score w.r.t. Central Limit Theorem

I have a very fundamental doubt regarding the z-score and rolling z-score method. As per the central limit theorem: http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/BS704_Probability/BS704_Probability12.html , the sample means are normally distributed if sample size >= 30. In my case I'm using time-series data and trying to detect anomalies using rolling z-score. I am taking a window size of 15, to calculate my moving average and standard deviation, which is less than 30. But when I evaluate the anomalies through graph they seem pretty convincing and explainable. However, I am not able to understand the statistical significance of the rolling z-score method. How do I explain it to someone that although 15 data points is less than 30, but still the values to be normally distributed.
