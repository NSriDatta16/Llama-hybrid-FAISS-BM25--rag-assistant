Have a look at Eclipse's working sets feature for grouping and managing your projects. You can create working sets from the Window → Working Sets → Edit... menu. Once you've done that click the triangle button in your project listing view (either your Project Explorer or C/C++ Projects view) and change the Top Level Elements option to be working sets instead of projects. From here you can then drag and drop your projects from the Other Projects folder in your project listing into the working sets you have defined. From there you can then open or close all the projects contained in a working set by right clicking on the the working set and selecting Open Project or Close Project . I'm not entirely sure if that alone will address your situation, but it did the trick to help me manage all my Java projects in a single Eclipse workspace.
