Unfortunately there isn't an entirely CSS solution to that problem (without seeing partially-rendered text). The nearest thing would be to use the CSS3 property, text-overflow: ellipsis , which will clip the string and add 'â€¦' to the end. The biggest drawback of this technique is that Firefox doesn't currently support it, and it doesn't look like it will in the near future either. However, there is an alternative and less elegant solution for Firefox that you could use for the time being.
