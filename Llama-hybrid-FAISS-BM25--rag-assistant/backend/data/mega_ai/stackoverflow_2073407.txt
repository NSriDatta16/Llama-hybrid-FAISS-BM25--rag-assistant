I for the most part agree with the answers that have been given but I want to put a slightly different spin on this. You sound like a .NET developer who is looking at Java. I am a Java developer who has started getting into .NET. One thing that is very different from the .NET world and the Java world is the IDEs. If you go into a .NET shop you may see VB coders, C# coders and such all developing .NET using Visual Studio. If you go into a Java shop you'll see coders all coding Java but they may be using different IDEs (Eclipse, RAD, NetBeans, etc) and even within those you may see different functionality within the IDEs (in Eclipse for example you add functionality via plug-ins). That being said there are plug-ins in IDEs such as Eclipse that are similar to what you see in Visual Studio. The main difference I see is that these are more fundamental to Visual Studio than any IDE I've seen that Java developers use (many Java developers I know don't drag-and-drop anything past the initial screen creation). Hope this helps.
