Your comment "Hence, this is a forecasting type problem, but not in the time series sense where you observe a sequence of data significantly longer than the time horizon you are trying to predict." causes me some concern. If I observe 3 numbers say 8,10,12 ... the "best model" to predict this stream for the next 33 periods would be an ARIMA/Transfer Function model with a causal predictor(t) of the form y(t)=6+2*t+a(t) . Thus to me it is a "typical time series forecasting problem" as there is no requirement (although it is a good suggestion) that the data used to develop a model is "longer" than the length of the prediction. As an aside a functionally equivalent representation is y(t)=y(t-1)+2+a(t) both yielding the same forecasts. As new observations become available e.g. the four values 8,10,12,10 , the best that could be done would be to identify the last observation (value=10) as being an anomaly and the equation would remain the same as the one that was developed using the first three observations. In terms of generality,the "8" could be considered an anomaly to the pattern "10,12,10" which just illustrates the problem with small data sets. This ambiguity would go away as the observed sample got larger. One of our classic time series is 1,9,1,9,1,9,1,9,5,9 where the "5" although near the mean is nowhere near the expected value of "1". Combining both ARIMA( the general term ) and empirically detected exceptions (Pulses,Level/Step,Seasonal Pulses/Local Time Trends) can lead to useful models.
