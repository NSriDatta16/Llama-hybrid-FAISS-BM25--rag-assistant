Usually the answer to "which is faster, ISAM or innodb" would be ISAM But for best performance with a table which has very few updates you might want to have a look at Infobright's columnar db (which is integrated into mysql). However with only 30k rows you'll not see a significant difference between innodb, isam and infobright. OTOH, you really should have a long hard look at whether you really need 200 columns in a single table. I suspect that's not the case - and the schema is far more important in determining performance than the storage engine.
