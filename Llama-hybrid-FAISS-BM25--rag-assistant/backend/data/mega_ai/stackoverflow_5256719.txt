If you want to register all models into django admin, you should (although you dont have to ) create an instance of the admin . This is because, although django admin can expose all models based just on the schema alone, it has so many bells and whistels to make that schema representation meaningful real solution . That said, in your case, you should not keep this admin.py in project level, but just at the application level. Is the Students and ApplyLeaves in the same db database you have passed to the get_models ? The elegant solution to what you are going to do would be as follows: project-folder/bare_tables.py from django.db.models import get_models from django.contrib.admin import AdminSite, ModelAdmin class BareTables(AdminSite): pass new_admin = BareTables(name='bare_tables') for el in get_models(): new_admin.register(el,ModelAdmin) In your urls.py from bare_tables import new_admin urlpatterns = patterns('', (r'^bare-tables/', include(new_admin.urls)), (r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)), That way you can continue to build meaningful interfaces in /admin while you have all tables exposed in /bare-tables .
