AlbertEin is onto something, but to do integer division like that in VB.Net you have to write it like this: Dim range as Integer range = someInteger \ 50 Notice the backwards division symbol. From there you can Select Case range . But really, jvanderh's answer most expresses what you want to do, because it allows for easy addition of cases in the future that don't break on a multiple of 50 and don't require future maintainers to follow the math or know about the \ operator.
