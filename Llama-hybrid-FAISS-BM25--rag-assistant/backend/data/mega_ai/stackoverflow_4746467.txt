Use Mailto with a large set of emails

On a page I have, there is a piece of code that creates a mailto link for the members of a team. It just iterates through the list of members and dynamically creates the link My problem is that when the number of members grows, it eventually stops the mailto link from working. I believe there is a character limit on this function, with the actually character limit depending on browser maybe. I'm wondering is there any elegant solution or alternative to this? Sending the email from the server side is not really an option, users still want to use their own desktop email app.
