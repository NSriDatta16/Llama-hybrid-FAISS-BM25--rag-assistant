UIView, its superview and touchesBegan:

Suppose I have a UIViewController subclass that takes care of some UIViews. These UIViews are added as subviews of the UIViewController's view property): UIViewController: - (void)viewDidLoad { UIImageView *smallImageView... [self.view addSubview:smallImageView]; UIButton *button.. [self.view addSubview:button]; UIView *bigUIView.. // covers the entire screen (frame = (0.0, 0.0, 1024.0, 768.0)) [self.view addSubview:bigUIView]; ... } AFAIK, since the bigUIView is the frontmost view and covers the entire screen, it will receive the touchesBegan:withEvent: and the other views, such as button won't receive any touch event. In my application bigUIView must be the topmost view because it holds the main user interface objects (CALayers, actually, the main game objects) that, when animated, must be on top of all other secondary UI elements (UIButtons, etc). However, I'd like to be able to still have the UIButtons and other objects in the Responder Chain. I tried implementing the following in the bigUIView class: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self.superview touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; ... hit test the touch for this specific uiview.. } Notes: bigUIView 's superview refers to the UIViewController's view property, does it propagate the touch event to all of it's subviews? bigUIView must have userInteractionEnabled = YES because it also handles user input. I can't bring the button / smallImageView to front because it would appear above the main game objects (sublayers of bigUIView ). Thanks in advance.
