How to preserve order of factor levels in R

I have an unbalanced longitudinal data for glucose levels of some patients coming to a hospital. My data looks like id, date, glucose_level . As I want to find the average glucose level by year in the hospital, I introduced another field year which is the year extracted from date . Now this is my model lmer( glucose_level ~ as.factor(year) + (1 | id)) My question is how do I preserve the order of visit by the patient (or measurement taken by date ) in the model. i.e. for a given patient the model should pick the older dated measurements first before the later measurements.
