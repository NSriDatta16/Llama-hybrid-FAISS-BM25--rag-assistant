SAS NLMIXED proc and LOGISTIC proc results different

Consider a dataset $Z$ with $S\in \{0,1\}$ as binary response variable and 2 predictors $\{x_1, x_2\}$. The logistic regression model proc logistic data=Z; model S=x1 x2; run; and consider an aggregate dataset $A$ with $Y$ as the response varible "1" counts and $N$ as total variable counts for each predictor $x_1$ and $x_2$ the nonlinear Mixed model proc nlmixed data=A; parms A=1 B=1 C=1 S=0.1; ell= A + B*x1 + C*x2 + u; p= exp(ell)/(1+exp(ell)); model Y ~ binomial(N,p); random u ~ normal(0,S) subject=ID; run; These two procs should return similar coefficient estimation. However I observed big gap between the coefficient estimated mean and confident interval for my data. What is the possible cause to this difference?
