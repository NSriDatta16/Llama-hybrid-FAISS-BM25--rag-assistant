Should I MAKE the training set imbalanced?

We are taking anonymised demographic data of n people with a rare medical condition, and trying to train a binary classifier (currently using xgboost) to reach more similar people with let's say a public service announcement. To train we have been taking a random sample of n non-patients (with their demo data). The classifier helps us reach many people with what we believe is a propensity to have the disease. Starting to have doubts if an artificially balanced sample like this is a good thing. Should there be more non-patients in the training sample since in real life there is MANY more non-patients and why? Thanks!
