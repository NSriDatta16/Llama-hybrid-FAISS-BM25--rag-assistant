The 'two-sided' test indeed means they consider deviations of the test statistic in both the negative and positive sense (lower and upper tail). A two-sided $\alpha=0.05$ is very standard, if you were interested in only one direction (e.g. we only want to see if LT is superior to ETI) you would then have to do that test at one-sided $\alpha=0.025$ . If you were to use a one-sided $\alpha=0.05$ you'd be working at twice the type I error rate. I'm not sure what you mean exactly by 'outcome on an individual level', the whole goal of such models is to provide an average (difference in) probability of survival. They did not provide any details on how this was parametrized, e.g. is it $n$ patients with a yes/no outcome each or is it a site that has $k/n$ survivors - mathematically these are the same but the former is more flexible in terms of model specification. The GEE's robust standard errors correct for the fact that observations from one cluster are not expected to be independent, which is otherwise an assumption in most statistical models. Removing correlations between within-cluster observations makes the results more generalizable, for example to agencies that weren't in this particular study, and in fact not doing so (by treating patients in one cluster as independent whereas they are not) would lead to bias. Obviously any given individual may have a much higher or much lower probability of survival, and there might even be some for whom the intervention is worse instead of better, but on average they show that LT increases survival probability at 72h by ~3%. A problem with GEE is that it only provides so-called marginal (population-level) estimates. Someone treating a patient might very well be interested if LT is really better for this patient, all the results tell you right now is that if you were to give everyone within the population/protocol under study LT instead of ETI you expect to end up with ~3% higher survival at 72h. (edit) : and, not unimportantly, that this difference is unlikely to have manifested due to random variability in the outcome being studied.
