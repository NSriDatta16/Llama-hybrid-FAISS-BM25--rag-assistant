Deriving the formula for the mean of a stratified sample

The formula for the mean of a stratified sample $\bar Y_s$ is: $$\bar Y_s = \frac 1 N \sum_i N_i \bar Y_i$$ where $N$ is the sample size for all strata, and $N_i$ and $Y_i$ are the sample size and mean, respectively, for the $i$th stratum. I understand intuitively why $\bar Y_s$ is just the sum of the stratum totals $\tau$ (where $\sum \tau = \sum N_i \bar Y_i$) divided by the sample size for all strata $N$, as this follows pretty directly from the sample mean formula $\sum \frac {Y_i}{n}$. However, I'm confused by the following. Consider a random variable $Y_i$, which represents some estimation from the strata. If we want to account for the fact that each stratum has a different sample size, we can weight the $Y_i$ with a constant $c_i$, which represents the strata's sample sizes. The expected value of the estimation is then: $$E(c_1Y_1 + c_2Y_2 + … + c_iY_i)$$ $$= c_1E(Y_1) + c_2E(Y_2) + … + c_iE(Y_i)$$ $$= \sum c_iE(Y_i)$$ From here, I'm not exactly certain how these steps inform/guide the derivation of the formula for $\bar Y_s$. I understand that this final formula looks a lot like the one for $\bar Y_s$. But I'm not quite sure how to make the leap in logic or to show mathematically how the two are connected. Do I just stick the whole sum $\sum c_iE(Y_i)$ over $N$ and say that I'm averaging it? That is: $$\sum c_iE(Y_i) \equiv \sum N_i \bar Y_i$$ $$\therefore \frac {\sum c_iE(Y_i)}{N} \equiv \frac{\sum N_i \bar Y_i}{N}$$ Any insight would be great. Thanks!
