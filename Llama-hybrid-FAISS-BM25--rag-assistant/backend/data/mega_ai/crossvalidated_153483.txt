Time series forecasting using SVM

I am trying to set up a Python code for forecasting a time series, using SVM libraries of scikit-learn. My data contains $X$ values at a day interval for the last one years, and I need to predict $y$ for a month of the next year. Here's what I have set up - SVR().fit(X, y).predict(X) But for this prediction to work, I need the $X$ value for the next month, which is not available. How do I set this up to predict future $y$ values?
