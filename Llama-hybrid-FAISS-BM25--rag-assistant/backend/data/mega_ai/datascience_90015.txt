Hypertune xgboost to dealing with imbalanced dataset

My training data has extremely class imbalanced {0:872525,1:3335} with 100 features. I use xgboost to build classification model with bayessian optimisation to hypertune the model in range {learning rate:(0.001,0.1), min_split_loss:(0.10), max_depth:(3,70), min_child_weight:(1:20), max_delta_step:(1,20), subsample:(0:1), colsample_bytree:(0.5,1), lambda:(0,10), alpha:(0,10), scale_pos_weight:(1,262), n_estimator:(1,20)} . I also use binary:logistics as the objective model and roc_auc as the metrics with booster gbtree. The cross validation score is 82.5%. However, when I implemented the model to the testing data I got the score only Roc_auc: 75.2%, pr_auc: 15%, log_loss: 0.046, and confusion matrix: [[19300 7],[103 14]]. I need helping to find the best way to increase the true possitive with tolerance false positive until 3 times actual positive.
