The conditionals of the posterior for the Dirichlet likelihood model are not of standard form so (as far as I know) you can not write a straightforward Gibbs sampler. You can either Use a different MCMC sampling procedure, such as Metropolis-Hastings or a slice sampler. Use a different likelihood, such as a constrained Gaussian model where it is possible to write a Gibbs sampler.
