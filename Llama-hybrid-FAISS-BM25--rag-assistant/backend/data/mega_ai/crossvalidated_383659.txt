Comparing proportions between multiple groups - Fisher's exact test

I have a simple dataset on reproductive success of a certain plant species. Reproductive success was defined as a proportion between number of flowers and number of fruits. We measured on 10 different sites, several seasons. I would like to test if there is a significant difference in RS between sites. An example of my dataset: I used Fisher's exact test - the same approach as in this example here: Fisher's exact test in R - 2x4 table - as follows: data The result shows that there is no significant difference between sites, but if you check site no. 5 in the data, the percentage of fruit is much higher than the rest. Did I use the right test? If I did - did I do it right? Would you suggest any other method? Additional question: I would also like to check if the number of flowers and pH affect the production of fruits on each site. Which test/method should I use in this case - logistic regression? I'm very new to R, so a more detailed explanation would be very very appreciated.
