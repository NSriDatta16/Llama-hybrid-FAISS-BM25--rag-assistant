How can I make CAPTCHA work across multiple pages?

Ever visit a website such as myspace where they leverage CAPTCHA to prevent spam? The typical pattern is to present a challenge to each URL that is opened, yet the challenge doesn't actually belong to the page itself which causes additional bandwidth usage. So, if I open up six pages at the same time and want to present a challenge on each page. I want the challenge to be tied to the page and not to the session. How can I make this work with Spring and/or Struts.
