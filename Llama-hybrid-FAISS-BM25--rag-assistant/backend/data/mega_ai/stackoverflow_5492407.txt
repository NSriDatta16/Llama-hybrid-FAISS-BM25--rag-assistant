This is likely not possible (automatically detecting disc changes without intervention or running at least one line). R needs to read into memory functions, so a change on the disc wouldn't be reflected in the workspace without reloading your functions. If you are into developing R functions, some amount of messiness during your development process will be likely inevitable, but perhaps I could suggest that you try writing an R-package to house your functions? This has the advantage of being able to robustly document your functions, using lazy loading so that you have access to your functions/datasets immediately without sourcing them. Don't be afraid of making a package, it's easy with package.skeleton() and doesn't have to go on CRAN but could be for your own personal use without distribution! Just have fun! Try to accept some messiness during development knowing you are working towards your goal and fighting the good fight of code organization and documentation! We are only imperfect people, in an imperfect world, but we mean well!
