Should I modify dataset?

I am working on a dataset which contains more than 80 features, and thousands of instances. Among those features there are some nominal ones, such as IP SOURCE, IP DESTINATION, Flow ID, which don't have any signification for my machine learning model. My question is, should I remove those features manually, or do I have to replace their values with numerical ones?
