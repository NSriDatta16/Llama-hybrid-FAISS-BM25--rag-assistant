Dragging a div along with all of its child divs

I have the following code: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I want to drag the 'container' div such that all child divs are dragged at the same time. I can drag individual divs, but that is not what I want. Can a div drag child divs or do they have to be images? I am using the WalterZorn drag drop API, but am open to using any API, script or whatever.
