This still applies from my previous post: //====== Begin previous post Hopefully, your MYSQL database has a primary key? If it does, set the value of each to the primary key of the item. For example: SQL id desc 1 "dressmaker thing with mannequin" 2 "dressmaker thing no mannequin" Form PHP echo " ".$query['desc']." "; When the form is submitted, re-query the database for the desired description. You'll be doing this re-query anyway to retrieve prices and such, yes? The reason this is happening is that spaces are discouraged in HTML attributes. You shouldn't have an attribute like value='this attribute is spaced' . //====== End previous post Basically, change this line: while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { echo " $row[style] $row[color] "; } to while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { echo " $row['style'] $row['color'] "; } and add this in process_form.php to get the description: $desc = mysql_query("SELECT style FROM products WHERE id='".$_POST['item']."';"); You can also use this to get all other related info from the DB right when you need it. // Another edit @Cambraca - right on - I forgot to sanitize the quote. @Ottoman - Your solution is a temporary fix. I strongly recommend applying an id/primary key system if it's not in place. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
