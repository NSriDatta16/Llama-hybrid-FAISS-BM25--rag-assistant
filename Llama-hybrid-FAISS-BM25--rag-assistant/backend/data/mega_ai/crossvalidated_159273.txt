Random ferns and EnsembleSVM might be interesting to you. Both are for classification only. Random ferns has a nice Bayesian philosophy, while ensemble SVM uses SVM base models based on small subsamples. The latter may appear slightly unorthodox since SVM models are not considered weak learners, but the technique works well nonetheless.
