How do you delete directories from Isolated Storage in Silverlight 4.0?

I have a snippet of code that should remove a text file and its' parent directory: if (isolatedStore.FileExists(logPath + "\\" + logFileName)) isolatedStore.DeleteFile(logPath + "\\" + logFileName; if (isolatedStore.DirectoryExists(logPath)) isolatedStore.DeleteDirectory(logPath); ...where logPath + "\" + logFileName might be: "Logs\log.txt" When this executes I get an exception that says it could not create the directory, not erase it. Does anyone know why this is ? Thanks, Scott
