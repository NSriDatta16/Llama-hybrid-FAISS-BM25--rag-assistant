If I understood correctly you have images similar to a heat-map like Fig 6: Well, non-natural images related applications can benefit from DNN as much as natural images, but you are unlikely to be able to use any transfer learning technique. If you have this heat-map-like images (please consider posting some samples) you can try a simple CNN structure. Since you are a starter you could benefit from using this modeler called Ennui and outputting the source-code in Python or Julia, just remember to take a quick class on CNN to understand your options. For a complete course see Stanford's YouTube playlist on CNNs. Some papers related to it: Inverse Design of Airfoil Using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network Application of Convolutional Neural Network to Predict Airfoil Lift Coefficient Deep Learning Methods for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulations of Airfoil Flows You can inspire your models architecture by theirs If you want a book to cover NN for deep learning try Goodfellow's .
