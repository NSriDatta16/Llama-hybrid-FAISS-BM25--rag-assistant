The universal approximation theorem states that a deep learning network can construct to learn a wide class of functions, including predicting one number from five other numbers. Finding that construction can be a challenge. The three best tips are: A large amount of data. Hopefully, millions of examples for complex functions. A large network. For example, large language models (LLM) have billions of parameters. A large amount of compute. Graphics processing unit (GPU) are useful and sometimes clusters of compute.
