Reduce over-forecasting in H2O regression with tree-based algorithms

I'm trying to solve a time series forecasting problem. While accuracy is fine, I'm now trying to punish / reduce under-forecasting events where the forecast is too low. Forecasting approach: Build lag features (e.g. truth from 1/2/3 ... /12 periods ago) Build trailing features (e.g. moving average over preceding X periods) Train H2O regression model (GBM) to predict truth based on features Result: Forecast accuracy is good on average But in total, too many instances of under-forecasting How to 'punish' under-forecasting more than over-forecasting when fitting the ML model? I've tried log-transforming the target variable, this helped a bit but not enough. Are there other approaches I could use for this issue? Thanks in advance for your comments!
