What does "mean age at childbearing" mean?

I'm having trouble putting this into plain English. According to the UN World Population Prospects glossary it means: The mean age at childbearing is the mean age of mothers at the birth of their children if women were subject throughout their lives to the age-specific fertility rates observed in a given year. The "their children" part trips me up. Can I understand this measure as "average age of entry into child bearing" or "Average age of first child"?
