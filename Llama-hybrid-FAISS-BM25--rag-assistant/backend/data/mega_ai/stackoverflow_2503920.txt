CSS gradients in IE7 & IE8 is causing text to become aliased

I'm attempting to use a CSS gradient in a div containing some text. With Gecko and Webkit, the text displays fine. In IE7 & IE8 the text appears aliased (jaggy). I came across this blog stating: "we decided to disable ClearType on elements that use any DXTransform". IE Blog: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/08/31/730887.aspx That was back in 2006; 3.5 years later, I assume this bug would be fixed, but it's not. Is there a way to do this in IE8 without resorting to stuffing a repeating background image in the div? Here's an example of what I mean. div { height: 50px; background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #fff, #ddd); background: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(#fff), to(#ddd)); filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#ffffffff, endColorstr=#ffdddddd); } Hello World Normal text In IE, the text in the div is aliased (jaggy), and the text in the paragraph is not. Any solution that doesn't involve images would be greatly appreciated.
