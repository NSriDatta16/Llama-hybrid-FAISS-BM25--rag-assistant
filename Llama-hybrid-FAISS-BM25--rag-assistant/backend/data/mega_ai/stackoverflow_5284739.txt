In general, the method to use to hook into Linux authentication is via PAM . Either writing your own PAM module, or by finding one that can be coerced into doing what you want. The easiest option I can see is pam_script . Install, then put auth optional pam_script.so in the appropriate file(s) in /etc/pam.d and write a pam_script_auth script that looks at $PAM_USER and $PAM_AUTHTOK. Note that the script could be run as root or as the user, so storage of the password failure data needs to be done with careful attention to permissions. The simple version without the multiple failures version is somewhat like: if [ $PAM_USER = "jv" ] && [ $PAM_AUTHTOK = "ThePoliceHaveMe" ]; then shredcommand fi
