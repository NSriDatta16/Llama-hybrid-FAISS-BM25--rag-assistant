From the Autoencoder Wikipedia article : One milestone paper on the subject was that of Geoffrey Hinton with his publication in Science Magazine in 2006 [ Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks by G. E. Hinton and et al. ]: in that study, he pretrained a multi-layer autoencoder with a stack of RBM s and then used their weights to initialize a deep autoencoder with gradually smaller hidden layers until a bottleneck of 30 neurons. The resulting 30 dimensions of the code yielded a smaller reconstruction error compared to the first 30 principal components of a PCA, and learned a representation that was qualitatively easier to interpret, clearly separating clusters in the original data.
