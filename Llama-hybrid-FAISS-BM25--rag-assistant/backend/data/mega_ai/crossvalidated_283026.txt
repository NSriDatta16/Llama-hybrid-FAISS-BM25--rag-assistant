Understanding Multiple Logistic Regression Interactions

I ran a logistic regression with categorical variables. The estimates and odds ratios are: Marital_Status- Estimate: .6605 Odds Ratio: 3.747 Professional Suffix: .5342 Odds Ratio: 2.911 I understand that the odds ratio says : "The odds of the dependent variable happening is 3.747 times higher if someone is married than if someone is single" and "The odds of the dependent variable happening is 2.911 times higher if someone has a professional suffix than if they don't" Question: Is there a way to say "If someone is married AND they have a professional suffix then they odds of the dependent variable happening will be ___? Would it be Y(1)= intercept + .6605O + .5342? Or is that unnecessary to do? Should results only be looked at with holding all other independent variables constant?
