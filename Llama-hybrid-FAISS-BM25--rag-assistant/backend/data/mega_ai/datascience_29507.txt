Are CNNs insensitive to rotations and shifts in images?

Can CNNs predict well if they are trained on canonical-like images but tested on a version of images that are little bit shifted? I tried it using mnist dataset and found the contrary. The accuracy of the test set that was shifted was very low as compared to MLPs .
