If you include the MyFile.tpp (I renamed it from .cpp), then you don't need to include the MyFile.h . #include ing a file is like exactly copying it's content into the file where it's included. Other from that, it's a common practice to organize the headers a bit. (Though you don't need the include-guards in the MyFile.tpp , because it should only ever be included from another header directly (like GMan says).)
