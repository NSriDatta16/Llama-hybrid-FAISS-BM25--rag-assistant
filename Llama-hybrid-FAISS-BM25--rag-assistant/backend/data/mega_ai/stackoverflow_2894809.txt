MAgento top-nav bar

I am working with the free redtheme to make a website. This is my first week into magento and designing any website. I have installed and started having a look at magento admin interface. I am not sure how to get top navigational bar working. Which files needs to be changed to get a top nav bar. While googling and reading a few articles I found that top.phtml file and added my tags with menus. But they donâ€™t seem to work. {{ maybe this is why everyone is saying magento is slow }} Finally got it working but now unable to get drop down menus. Can anyone help with this. Which files do i need to edit to get a drop down horizontal menu. My next question is regarding red theme. I installed the theme and was playing with it. Trying to get the banner using the red theme user guide pdf but couldnt find the add new banner option anywhere. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks
