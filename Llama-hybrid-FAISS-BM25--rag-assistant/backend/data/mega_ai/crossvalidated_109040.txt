What are the statistical implications of assigning treatment and control in time series study under 2 different approaches?

I have a project wherein my group wants to measure the effect of counseling at-risk students on their academic outcomes. There are 1,000 students who will be enrolled during the current academic term. Resources (such as the counselors) are limited, so we can only use a subset of these. My boss says that we have enough funding to take the top 6 deciles (600 students with the worst grades) and randomly assign 50% to control and 50% to treatment . The 50% who receive treatment will be contacted by advisers, whereas the 50% in control will not. However, this is not just a pre/post study. Instead, we will have k instances of outreach (i.e. treatment ) during the term, where k is between 2 and 5. My boss laid out 2 different approaches that we could take and asked which I recommend. I'm want to be sure that I understand the statistical implications of each approach, so that I can make a well-informed recommendation. Here are the two choices: Randomly assign treatment and control to all students at the beginning of the study, select the top 6 deciles , at k = 1 , and have the counselors talk to these same students at each of the k time periods. Within the 6 deciles , about 300 should be in treatment and about 300 in control and those groups will be compared at the end of the study. Randomly assign treatment and control to all students at the beginning of the study, select the top 6 deciles , at k = 1 , and have counselors reach out to the approximate 50% in the treatment group, just as in option #1. BUT at k = 2 and each subsequent time period, recalculate the top 6 deciles . Many of the students will be the same, but some of those who were in the top 6 deciles at k = 1 may be in the bottom 4 deciles at k = 2, k = 3, etc . Assignment to treatment or control won't change, but inclusion in the subset of the population will change for some students. My intuition is that option #1 will me more simplistic and thus shield us from potential bias that we may introduce. On the other hand, #2 would give us a larger sample with more identifying variation , though not all treatment students will receive treatment at each of the k time periods. In some ways, it seems like #2 could actually allow for a more in-depth analysis, because we could not only look at the effect of treatment , but also the frequency and timing of treatment, so that we could potentially pick up on diminishing marginal returns to treatment or variations in the effectiveness of treatment in terms of timing (i.e. outreach by counselors could be more effective earlier on or at the end of the course). Would #2 introduce bias or create other statistical complications? If so, should I rule out #2 or would it require additional statistical controls to account for the (semi-) endogenous changes in the composition of the 6 deciles?
