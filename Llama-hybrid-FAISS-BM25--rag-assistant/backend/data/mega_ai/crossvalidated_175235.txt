The Pearson correlation measures linear correlation only. You should do a scatterplot of your data (eg. Calcium content in an organ as x-axis and calcium content in bones as y-axis) and see if the points seem to be falling in a straight line. If they do, then Pearson is appropriate. If they fall in a pattern that's not straight, then you may want to consider regression.
