You may find something here , here or, best of all, Bulgaria Flex Group where the entry begins with "I would like to show an easy way to drag and drop files from filesystem within your Air applications." Hmmm ... just read your request again and I realise it's not quite what you asked for. I hope the DND of files at least points you in the right direction.
