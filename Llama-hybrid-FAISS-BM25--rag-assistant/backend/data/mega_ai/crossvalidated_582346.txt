Trimmed means are difficult to interpret in my opinion, and may not always be statistically efficient. I think that a better choice is the use of semi-parametric regression models such as the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model, which generalizes the Wilcoxon and related rank tests. Semiparametric models use only the ordering of $Y$ , not the absolute values, and are robust to extreme values. They also have the great advantage of transformation invariance, i.e., the regression coefficients and statistical test statistics don't change if you replace $Y$ with $\log(Y), \sqrt(Y)$ , etc. For resources see https://www.fharrell.com/post/rpo . After fitting an ordinal model, especially when using the R rms package's orm function, you can obtain predicted means, quantiles, and exceedance probabilities and their differences over values of $X$ .
