Well, google added many features to its search engine over past years, and probably it will be able to see the changes. But how do you imagine a client should reach a page which address doesn't change, but content does after few clicks? You must combine AJAX with normal separate pages; this will also add compatibility for clients that have JavaScript disabled. E.g. have all pages redirect to the one working with AJAX if JavaScript is enabled and user-agent string doesn't match *bot* .
