Complex Time Series Problem

I have a difficult time series problem that is stumping me. I have registration data for a repeating annual event. The date of the event changes every year as does the open period for registration. I have data for 5 events. Plot of the data look like this: Conference 3 years ago: Conference 2 years ago: Conference 1 year ago: I am being asked to take data from this year's conference UP TO 60 days prior to start and make a prediction on what total attendance will be. I am able to develop a feature set that is comprised of binary day indicators, the registrations on a particular day away from start date (since as I mentioned the date changes each year, I use 'days prior to start' as a feature). A sample of the training set (including the target variable here: registrations) is as follows: To make the training set I drop the calendar date (reg_day) and move registrations to train_y while keeping all remaining features in a train_X file. That data from all prior conferences are placed in the training set. I then use a random forest to make predictions on the last 60 days of THIS year's conference. My results are as follows: Not bad - but not good enough. My totals are about 20% off of actual when my target is about 10% I have looked for other features that could help explain the spikes - but have had no luck. I have tried various other approaches. I have tried a SARIMAX model using 'this years' actual data from -200 to -60 days out using prior event data as additional exogenous features. Results are bad. Seems I don't have enough data to capture the relationships among the time series and that period - if anything - has low registrations and a positive trend. When I difference the data, make predictions, and undo the difference results are terrible. Any guidance on approach or refinements here appreciated. I am at a loss.
