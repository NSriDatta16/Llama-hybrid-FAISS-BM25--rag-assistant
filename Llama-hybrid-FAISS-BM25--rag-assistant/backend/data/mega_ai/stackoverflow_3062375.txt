Questions to ask yourself: Is there a 1 to 1 relationship between gem, effects, and source? Would you more often be pulling effects without pulling data from gem? If the proposed tables have a 1 to 1 relationship then I'd suggest leaving them combined in one table. The only time I would consider splitting them out in this condition is if I only needed data from effects without needing other data AND these tables were going to be large enough to justify having them stored on different drives. Otherwise, you're just making work for yourself, adding more storage requriements and reaping exactly zero benefits.
