This is an utterly subjective question and, full disclosure, I am a PHP programmer. There is a lot of hating on PHP by non-PHP programmers for a lot of (good and bad) reasons. I will leave it to them to list the reasons why .net is better. I believe that most of the differences are academic and with that said, here are some reasons you might want to stick with PHP: You can copy and paste code out of your current app into your new app. No reverse engineering, just literally copy and paste. Your organization is probably staffed with PHP programmers, as you currently have a PHP app. PHP has more support and resources available online. The community is huge. PHP is easier to understand than .net (which is also one of the critiques of PHP, because the simplicity comes in part from lack of support for languages such as C#, J#, and C++). PHP integrates exceptionally well with MySQL (Wikipedia, for example runs on the two) as well as SQLite. Most importantly, PHP is open source. As with my #3, this means more support. It also means, in my humble opinion, more security. But, as I said, this question is subjective and both are (nowadays) fine object oriented languages.
