We had a similar problem with UIAlertView in iOS 4.2; we were customizing the layout, added text boxes and rearranging the buttons. This won't be a popular answer, but due to the changes to UIAlertView, we had to abandon using it entirely for this purpose. We always knew it was a fragile implementation since customizing/subclassing UIAlertView isn't officially supported and makes assumptions about the internal structure of the view hierarchy, but the release of 4.2 really kicked us into gear. In the end, we implemented our own UI element to replace the customized UIAlertView.
