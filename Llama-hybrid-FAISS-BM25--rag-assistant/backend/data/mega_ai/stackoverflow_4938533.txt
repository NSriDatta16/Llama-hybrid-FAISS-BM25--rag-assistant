Best method to maintain in-memory cache of DB objects in Silverlight

I'd like to set up a cache of database objects (i.e. rows in a table) in memory in silverlight, which I'll do using WCF and linq-to-sql. Once I have the objects in memory, I'm planning on using MSMQ to receive new objects whenever they have been modified. It's a somewhat complex approach but the goal is to reduce trips to the database and allow instant data communication between Silverlight applications that are connected to the MSMQ. My Silverlight applications are meant to be long-running and the amount of data to be cached will not be large. I'm planning on saving the in-memory cache using local storage. Anyway, in order to process the updated objects that come in, I'd like to know if the user has changed the existing object. Could I use some event relating to data-binding to set a flag indicating that the object has changes? Maybe there's a better way to do the cache entirely? Thanks!
