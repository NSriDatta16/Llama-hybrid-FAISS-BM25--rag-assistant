Artificial neural networks EQUIVALENT to linear regression with polynomial features?

I want to improve my understanding of neural networks and their benefits compared to other machine learning algorithms. My understanding is as below and my question is: Can you correct and supplement my understanding please? :) My understanding: (1) Artificial neural networks = A function, which predicts output values from input values. According to a Universal Approximation Theorem ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem ), you usually can have any possible (though it should behave well) prediction function, given enough neurons. (2) The same is true for linear regression, by taking polynomials of the input values as additional input values, since you can approximate (compare Taylor expansion) each function well by polynomials. (3) This means, that (in a sense, with respect to best possible outcomes), those 2 methods are equivalent. (4) Hence, their main difference lies in which method lends itself to better computational implementation. In other words, with which method can you find, based on training examples, faster good values for the parameters which eventually define the prediction function. I welcome any thoughts, comments and recommendations to other links or books to improve my thinking.
