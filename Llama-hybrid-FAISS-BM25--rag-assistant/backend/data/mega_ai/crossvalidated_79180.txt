Fitting a "pseudo" discrete dataset

I'm working with a dataset that contains information about consumption of apples. The dataset contains the amount of apple consumed in g/day. The problem with this is that the data points fall into 3 categories: - a real number (e.g. 54 g/day, people weighing their consumption) - a discrete number (number of apples per day), which is converted to g/day using the average weight of an apple (+/- 100g) - 0, people not consuming any apples A histogram of the data looks like this: Any tips on either transforming this data into something analyzable or fitting a distribution would be greatly appreciated. I want to use this data to perform a risk analysis. For this we need to fit a distribution to the values and then sample from this distribution. The classic distributions included in the software I use (@Risk) obviously deliver horrible performance (as measured by AIC/BIC criteria)
