RL problems roughly fall into 3 categories: Finite-horizon problems, where a final state is reached. Discounted problems, where the total reward is bounded in the limit. Average cost per stage problems, where the average reward is bounded. But RL is typically online learning. To learn from previous navigation data, you can use dynamic programming methods .
