If you've already selected the four lines in visual mode: > will shift them shiftwidth to the right. After they are shifted, the visual selection will be gone, but you can indent again via . (repeat last command). If you are normal mode, with your cursor anywhere on the first line: >> will indent that line, 4>> will indent all four lines, >3j will do the same thing in a different way (indent from this line to three lines down), >} will indent all of the lines until the end of the paragraph (i.e. to the first empty line, see :help object-motions ), and >ap will indent all of the lines for a p -aragraph (see :help text-objects ), even if your cursor isn't on the first line. Again, you can repeat these commands via . for deeper indentation levels (or you can set shiftwidth appropriately). If your file is nicely composed of "paragraphs" (and most of my code and prose is), I think you'll find the ap text-object to be the most common way to work on blocks of text like this. You can also use text-objects to speed up visual selection.
