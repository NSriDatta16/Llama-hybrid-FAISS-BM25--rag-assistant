Best way to share iphone and mac code between projects

I realise that the view/controller stuff will be different between Mac and IPhone apps but the model code may well be similar/the same. So whats the best way to organise a project(s) so that the model code is/can be shared? Copy/paste - just duplicate it and manually keep it in sync Have 2 xcode projects point at the same workarea - one for Mac and one for IPhone and share the code. Common library - presumably you can't do this (or can you) Thanks for any tips.
