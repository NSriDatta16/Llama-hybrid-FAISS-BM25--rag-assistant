Unbalanced classification problems have been studied a bit and "Roughly Balanced Bagging" and "Weighted Random Forests" have had some success. It might we worth discretizing your data and applying one of these if the discrete results would be useful. Other then that I would transform the data using something like log(d/D) where D is the maximum distance you are interested in. Assuming no zero distances (add 1 to d and D if you actually have discrete distances equal to zero) this will map/expand the short distances to the negative half of the real line so that they will contribute significantly more to the r^2 error commonly used in random forest regressors. There are also some methods for constructing balanced training sets you could look into. See for example: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/523
