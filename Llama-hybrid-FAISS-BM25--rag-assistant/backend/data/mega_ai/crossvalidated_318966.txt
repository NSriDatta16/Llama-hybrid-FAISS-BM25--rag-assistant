What is the loss/cost function of decision trees?

In Decision Tree, splitting criterion methods are applied say information gain to split the current tree node to built a decision tree, but in many machine learning problems, normally there is a cost/loss function to be minimised to get the best parameters. My question is how to define such a cost function of Decision Tree?
