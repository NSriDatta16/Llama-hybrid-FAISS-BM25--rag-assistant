See Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013) (or this blog entry ) for more information and a discussion on $R^2$ for mixed models. First of all, as Nagakawa and Schielzeth notice, using $R^2$ from OLS linear model for mixed models is misleading and should not be used. Generally, there are multiple ideas how to compute $R^2$ for mixed models, but there's still no consensus on it. As for me, the Nagakawa and Schielzeth's ideas are most interesting, however you should always remember that $R^2$ for mixed models is not the same "variance explained" as for linear models and it is just an approximation. Among other approaches you could also check Snijders and Bosker (1994) for comparison. Statistical significance is also problematic for mixed models (and problematic in general) so I wouldn't pay much attention to it. As for your question, I'd recommend Gelman and Hill's (2007) book. First of all, they suggest to compare "effect sizes" for mixed models. In your case marginal $R^2$ is very small, but you should also look at the "Betas": if they are small compared to variance of your data, i.e. including this effects in the model does not change anything for estimation, you probably could abandon those effects. On another hand, in regression and mixed models literature there are multiple examples for leaving "non-significant" effects in the model and it is almost never a decision based on a simple rule of thumb. For example, in your case the AIC changed quite dramatically what suggests that the second model has a better fit. So I do not see a simple answer in here, not yet.
