Show running instance in single instance application

I am building an application with C#. I managed to turn this into a single instance application by checking if the same process is already running. Process[] pname = Process.GetProcessesByName("SwapCardDesktop"); if (pname.Length I intend to have another functionality in here which brings up the running instance when tried to launch again. I tried calling ShowWindowAsync() if application is already running, ShowWindowAsync(hWnd, 9); But this fails to bring up the application when minimized to tray. Any suggestions on this?
