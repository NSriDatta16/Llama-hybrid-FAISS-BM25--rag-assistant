This isn't a question with a simple answer, so all I can really do is point you in the right direction. The RODBC package isn't meant to extract data online, it's meant to pull data from a database. If you will be leveraging that package, it will be after you pull data down from the web. Jeffrey Bean put together a slideshow tutorial for doing sentiment analysis with Twitter data a few years back. He used the Twitter stream as well as some data pulled in from web scraping. It's a good starting point. There's also this site that discusses a few different approaches to this problem in detail, including Bean's, the sentiment package, and ViralHeat (which is a commercial sentiment analysis service who's data you can pull into R). Sentiment has since been removed ( archived versions here ), but the qdap package is available and is designed for use in transcript analysis.
