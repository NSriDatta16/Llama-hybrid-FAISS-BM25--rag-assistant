Why dont languages allow overloading of methods by return value?

c, java and many other languages do not pay attention to return values. int i = func() float f = func() int func() { return 5 } float func() { return 1.3} Why isnt the above legal? Does it make it more difficult to program int i = func(func(func(func2(func3())))) //you dont know what you are getting Is it hard to write a compiler? are there more language unambiguity? Is there a language that can do the above?
