Most elegant way to get the array element by position?

I have an array: private int[,] _blocks = new int[6, 4]; It represents a set of blocks which is 6 deep horizontally and 4 deep vertically. Graphically it looks like this: alt text http://www.angryhacker.com/toys/array.png I need a function that would take in a number, from 1 to 24 and return the array element that matches. So for number 14, I'd get back _blocks[1, 2]; I've created a simplistic function: private int GetBlockByPosition(int position) { int count = 0; for (int i = 0; i But this seems very wasteful and smells bad. Is there a more elegant and faster way?
