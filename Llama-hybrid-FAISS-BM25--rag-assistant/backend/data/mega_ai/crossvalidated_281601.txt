If your regression model is not over-fitting, would using regularization give better prediction?

I was building a OLS model. The RMSE was not very satisfactory. So I tried feature engineering and the result improved and there was no over-fitting. To, further improve the results I thought of trying Ridge regression, but there was no significant improvement. So, my question is - Do regularization techniques work towards improving the predictability ONLY by reducing variance? If your regression model does not have high variance then using regularization will not help?
