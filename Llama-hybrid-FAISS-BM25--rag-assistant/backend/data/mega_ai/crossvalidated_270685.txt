It seems that there are some disagreement between researchers on what the difference between 'transfer learning' and 'domain adaptation' is. From {0}: The notion of domain adaptation is closely related to transfer learning. Transfer learning is a general term that refers to a class of machine learning problems that involve different tasks or domains. In the literature, there isn't yet a standard definition of transfer learning. In some papers it's interchangeable with domain adaptation. From {1}: References: {0} Li, Qi.
