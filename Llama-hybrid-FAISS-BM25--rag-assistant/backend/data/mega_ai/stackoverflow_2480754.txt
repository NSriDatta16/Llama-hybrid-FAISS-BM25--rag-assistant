Ivy supports resolving timestamped snapshots, but with the following limitation: the specified pattern on your ibiblio resolver must end with: [organisation]/[module]/[revision]/[artifact]-[revision](-[classifier]).[ext] This is not the case in your setup, so Ivy won't try to find your timestamped snapshot. Updating your pattern to this one should solve your problem; update the definition of your archiva-snapshots repository to: Remark: mind the 's' in [organisation] instead of the 'z'. Maarten
