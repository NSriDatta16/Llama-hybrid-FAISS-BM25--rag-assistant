Note that random effects terms are translated to correlations. In particular, by including a random effect (e.g., a random intercept) in the Field level, you assume that RateOfUse measurements within the same Field are correlated. And by including a nested random intercept for Survey within Field , you assume that RateOfUse measurements from the same Survey within the same Field are more strongly correlated than RateOfUse measurements from different Surveys within the same Field . Now, the question is, is this the case for your data? You can test data using a likelihood ratio test, i.e., by comparing the two models: fm1 When you include the Survey as a fixed-effect, this translates to a different average for the RateOfUse per Survey level controlled for Area and Year . ( Note: this will depend on whether Survey is a factor or not; if not, then Survey is included as a numeric variable, and you assume a linear relationship between the average RateOfUse and the Survey levels).
