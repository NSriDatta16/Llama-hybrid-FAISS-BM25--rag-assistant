Can a DevExpress XtraGrid be filled using a a Dynamic SELECT statement string

Can a DevExpress XtraGrid be filled using a a Dynamic SELECT statement string? i.e. SELECT * FROM Employee or SELECT * FROM Dependents To fill our XtraGrids currently, we use a ORM that creates entities. To do this it takes a lot of steps and time. What is driving me to ask this question is we do a lot of client aquistions where we get hundreds of files. I do not want to create entities for all of these then have to create an XtraGrid for each entity. Ideally if I can just feed it a SELECT statement and the XtraGrid could render it then I could use the XtraGrid very nice data minipulation features (Filter, Group By, etc). If you have any other ideas or suggestions please do not hesitate to post them. Revised: Per Brendon's responce below to create a static method that returns a DataTable. Here is a link to a page that actually does that. http://msmvps.com/blogs/deborahk/archive/2009/07/07/dal-retrieve-a-datatable-using-a-sql-statement.aspx
