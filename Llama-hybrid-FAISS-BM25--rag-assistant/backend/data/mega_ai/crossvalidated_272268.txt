What is the difference between PCA and PLS-DA?

I read a paper Obesity changes the human gut mycobiome (2015) in which the authors used PLS-DA to look at the differences in their groups based on the microbiome of their gut. I am currently working with a data set containing similar microbiome information and I am using a PCA. What is the main difference between these two? Why would one be advantageous compared to the other?
