A decent methodology is that employed by the automated (S)ARIMA model selector function auto.arima in "forecast" package in R. It is described in a paper by Hyndman & Khandakar "Automatic time series for forecasting: the forecast package for R" (2008). The method has been employed widely and seems to be quite popular. Its performance has been evaluated on a large set of time series and has been good, as documented in Rob J. Hyndman's blog post "R vs Autobox vs ForecastPro vs â€¦" (see Table 1 and Table 2). So how does it work? There are two aspects to seasonality in SARIMA modelling: seasonal differencing and seasonal AR and MA patterns. First, auto.arima uses OCSB (or optionally Canova-Hansen) test to determine whether there is a need for seasonal differencing. Second, auto.arima determines the "optimal" lag orders of SAR and SMA by doing a local search of models with different lag orders and selecting the one that minimizes the AICc (or optionally AIC or BIC).
