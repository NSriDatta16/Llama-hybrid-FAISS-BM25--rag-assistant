After having performed X=np.array([[1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,1,0,0], [1,0,0,1,0], [1,0,0,0,1]]) y=np.array([0,1,1,1,0]) you have to do the following: y = y.reshape(1, -1) model=svm.SVC() model.fit(X,y) test = np.array([1,0,1,0,0]) test = test.reshape(1,-1) print(model.predict(test)) In future you have to scale your dataset. You can use either Standard Scaler (suggested) or MinMax Scaler.
