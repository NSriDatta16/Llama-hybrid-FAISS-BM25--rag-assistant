Pro ASP.NET MVC Framework by Steve Sanderson includes the obvious ASP.NET MVC topic with C# as well as TDD, the Repository pattern, and domain modeling. Good overview of all of these topics in one book. For deeper coverage of DDD, i agree with Arnis L to get the bible ("Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" ) by Eric Evans, and for a .NET specific view, I agree with Per Noalt on Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns: With Examples in C# and .NET.
