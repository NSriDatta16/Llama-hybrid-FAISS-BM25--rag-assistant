If you're using Visual Studio you could also do "#pragma once" at the top of the headerfile to achieve the same thing as the "#ifndef ..."-wrapping. Some other compilers probably support it as well .. .. However, don't do this :D Stick with the #ifndef-wrapping to achieve cross-compiler compatibility. I just wanted to let you know that you could also do #pragma once, since you'll probably meet this statement quite a bit when reading other peoples code. Good luck with it
