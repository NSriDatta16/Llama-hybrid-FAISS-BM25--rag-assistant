Iconic (toy) models of neural networks

My physics professors in grad school, as well as the Nobel laureate Feynman, would always present what they called toy models to illustrate basic concepts and methods in physics, such as the harmonic oscillator, pendulum, spinning top, and black box. What toy models are used to illustrate the basic concepts and methods underlying the application of neural networks? (Please provide references.) By a toy model I mean a particularly simple, minimally sized network applied to a highly constrained problem through which basic methods can be presented and one's understanding tested and enhanced through actual implementation, i.e., constructing the basic code and preferably to a certain degree doing/checking the basic math by hand or aided by a symbolic math app.
