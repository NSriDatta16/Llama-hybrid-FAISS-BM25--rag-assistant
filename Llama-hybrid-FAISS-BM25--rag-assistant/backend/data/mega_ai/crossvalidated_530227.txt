There are some similar questions on this site, so you would benefit from a look: Regression for an outcome (ratio or fraction) between 0 and 1 What is the difference between logistic regression and Fractional response regression? How can standard logistic regression model fractional response variable while denominator is available? But in short: In a fractional outcomes logistic regression, do my independent variables have to be transformed to be between 0 and 1 before including them in the regression? - I have found mixed indications of this online NO , they need not. Avoid information sources which tell you otherwise! How do I check if my fractional regression is robust? I have read about Quasi-Maximum likelihood estimation test but I'm not sure if it is correct to test the robustness, or if there are other methods. Since your response is not binomial, you must use quasilikelihood. In R that would be glm with family=quasibinomial ; other software should have similar options. Alternatively you could look into robust standard errors. Are there any assumptions or steps in my methodology that I should include? I have checked variables for multicollinearity, any other important tests or steps in my process I should look at? Mostly, it's the same as for any other glm, so see Diagnostics for logistic regression? . Make a lot of plots. On CRAN there is an R package frm for these models. One of its authors has a dedicated web page with many references. An alternative could be beta regression.
