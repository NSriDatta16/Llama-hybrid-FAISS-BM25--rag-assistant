On your server you could try checking the UserAgent string in the RequestHeader. This may let you distinguish between standard IE and Excel VBA - depends how your power users are doing it. You could ask your users to set the UserAgent string they are sending to a known value. Example: Dim oHTTP As WinHttp.WinHttpRequest Set oHTTP = New WinHttp.WinHttpRequest oHTTP.Open Method:="GET", url:="http://stackoverflow.com/", async:=False oHTTP.setRequestHeader "User-Agent", "ExcelVBA-UserApp" Altenatively, Why not set up a separate access URL just for your excel user to use. Or create a simple RESTFul API for them to use. There are may ways this could be done - Try to keep it simple and easy to maintain. Your "Clever" uses could try posting a question in SO - The functionality does exist to automate IE better than your question suggests.
