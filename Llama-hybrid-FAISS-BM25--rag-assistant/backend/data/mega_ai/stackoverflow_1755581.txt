One way to do this is to create several documents out of a single book. The documents could represent books, chapters or verses. As the text need not be unique, this is what I would do. This way, the first verse in the first chapter in the book of Genesis will be indexed four times: in the whole bible, in the book of Genesis, in the first chapter and as the verse. A subtlety here is the exact goal of retrieval: Do you want just to display the search keywords in context to a user? In this case consider using a Lucene highlighter . If you need the retrieval to be further used (i.e. take the retrieved pointer to a chapter or verse and do some processing on this place in the text) I would go with the finer-grained documents as I described before.
