Are there any performance penalties when using nested structures?

Are there any performance penalties when I use multiple nested structures/classes (kinda like using muti dimension heap arrays) or is it just an organizational feature of the language to make it easier to keep track of data and the compiler doesn't actually see any difference? Thanks
