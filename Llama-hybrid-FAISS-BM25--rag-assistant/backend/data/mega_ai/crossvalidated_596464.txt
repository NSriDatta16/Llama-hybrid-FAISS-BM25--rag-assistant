Confusion regarding ROC

I am studying ROC for model evaluation for the first time and I have two questions that are confusing me : I totally understand how to construct ROC with a logistic regression model, in which for every threshold we compute the true and false positive rates. This makes sense with logistic regression as logistic regression calculates probabilities and then to get the final value we need a crisp value and we do so by selecting a threshold. However, this doesn't make sense with models like decision tree , random forests , support vector machine and so on, as where is the threshold in these models ?? For example in decision tree we use splits with for example Gini criteria. So in general, how ROC can be interpreted with any model other than logistic regression ? From ROC we can calculate AUC, which is the area under the ROC curve. If we have two models, we select one the model with the higher AUC. Why ? Because higher area means that we can find points where the true positive rate is larger and the false positive rate is smaller than the model with the smaller AUC. Is that correct ?
