You should simply calculate differences between the height of people in a sample and average height of a person given age (WHO growth curve). So if a height of an 2 months old person $i$ in a sample is 55 cm and average height of a 2 months old person based on WHO growth curve is 58 cm then $diff_i=-3$. Then you should simply run a T-test where: $T_0: \quad diff=0$ $T_1: \quad diff \neq0$ But you can also just calculate t-test based on Z scores. Z score is simply a difference between an observation $x_i$ (height of person $i$ in a sample) and population mean $\bar{x}$ (given the age) normalized for standard deviation $s$: $$Z=\frac{x_i-\bar{x}}{s}$$ But the meaning is slightly different. Z-value measures deviation from the mean expressed in SD. Consequently $T_0$ assumes deviations of the sample heights are equal to 0 and $T_1$ proposes that deviations are not 0. You will also notice that if SD is constant and independent of age (this is not true in this particular case), both T-tests give identical results.
