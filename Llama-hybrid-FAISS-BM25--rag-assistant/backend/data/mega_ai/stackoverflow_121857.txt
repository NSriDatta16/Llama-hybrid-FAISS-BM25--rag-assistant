I was going to put this in a comment, but I think it's more useful in the open: Could you add more detail about your setup: Which VM server? (VMware Server, VMware ESX, MS VirtualServer, MS Hyper-V, something else?) Which OS for the guest(s)? (Windows, Linux, 32-bit, 64-bit?) Where are the guest(s) stored? (Local disk, or on a NAS or SAN?) Were you rsyncing between guests on the same VM server, or between a guest and a physical server? If across a network, how fast is the network? Performance tuning in any environment is 90% collecting data, and 10% analysis. Virtualized environments have more variables to consider than Physical environments, but more importantly, they have a different response curve than physical environments. Some applications can perform better in a virtualized environment than a physical environment; others will not. You have to understand the requirements of the application as well as constraints of the implementation. I don't believe that there are any software-only applications that cannot be successfully deployed on virtual servers, if you pay attention to the details. (Applications that require custom hardware that can't be successfully virtualized is a different problem.)
