Debugging in netbeans (java)

I have been asking this myself for a while. Debugging in visual studio goes smooth. But when i debugg in Netbeans(java) i find myself more than half of the time browsing through the system code itself. This makes it almost impossible for me to detect hard to find bugs, cause debugging simply is too tedious and unmanageable. How can this be avoided? Stepping out all the time takes a insane amount of time, and i only wish to debug the code i have written down. I usally add all the controls myself without using any drag and drop for forms if that makes any difference in the total picture. Regards.
