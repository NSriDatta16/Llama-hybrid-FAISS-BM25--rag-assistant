Logistic regression with multi-class features in R

I'm working with a data set like the following: X = c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 y a c f h j 0 a d f i k 0 a c g h j 1 a c f h k 0 b d g h k 0 b e f h j 0 I'm trying to create a logistic regression model that is able to predict y (0 or 1) based on the features of X . Info on X : The values of c1 â€“ c5 are all factors. The features have a varying number of levels (e.g. c1 : 2 levels, c2 : 4 levels, c3 : 3 levels, etc.) Approx 10% of y is 1. I've tried using SVM and GLM without any good result. model and model I'm used to working with features with continuous values when creating a predictive model, but I don't really know how to tackle a problem with factors. What would you guys recommend for this type of problem? Changing from logistic regression to something else or using other functions besides GLM & SVM?
