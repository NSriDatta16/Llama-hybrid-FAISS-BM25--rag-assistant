I'm a little wary to refactor along these lines if that is all you are doing to your source tree. The examples so far do not seem like reasons alone to change any working code base, but maybe if you are adding new functionality you should take advantage of all the new stuff. At the end of the day, these example are not really removing boiler plate code , they are just using the more manageable constructs of newer JDKs to make nice looking boiler plate code . Most ways to make your code elegant are not in the JDK.
