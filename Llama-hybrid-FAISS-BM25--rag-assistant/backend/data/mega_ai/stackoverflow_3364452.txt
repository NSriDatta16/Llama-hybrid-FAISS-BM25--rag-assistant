Each user can see other databases and roles listed, but should not be able to see tables in other databases, ever. If you revoke CONNECT privilege on all databases except the allotted one, the user will not be able to access the contents of other databases. Roles and database names are global, and not readily blockable. You can try Frank Heikens suggestion of selective revocations on the system tables, but you take risks to do that. PostgreSQL developers on the usenet mailing lists have discouraged tampering with access to the system catalogs. Psql, among other tools, assumes they will be available and functions poorly without them. Why is knowing the names of other databases and roles so bad?
