By "sketch the distribution" they probably mean a plot with 1,2,3,4,5,6 on the horizontal axis and on the vertical axis the number of times each result was observed; or the empirical probability of that result (which is just the number of times divided by the total number of rolls). This could be either six dots or six columns (if columns it will look like a histogram). Sketching the distribution of the average is indeed much more complex and requires an understanding of what you would expect the average result to be if you repeated this 20-roll experiment many times. Try looking up "sampling distribution" and "central limit theorem". This will also help you answer the inference questions in the last paragraph.
