D2009 uses UTF-16 for the default string type, although you can make variables UTF-8 if you need to. Jan Goyvaerts discusses the size/speed tradeoff in a good blog post. String literals in DFMs have been UTF-8 since at least D7. Hence, there will be no increase in size due to strings in DFMs with D2009.
