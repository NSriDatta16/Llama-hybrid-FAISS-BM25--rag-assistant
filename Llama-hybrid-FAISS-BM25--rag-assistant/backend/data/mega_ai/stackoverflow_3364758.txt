How do I get first x elements of an NSArray in Cocoa?

New to Cocoa, and seem to be missing something. What is the most elegant/idiomatic way to obtain the first x elements of an NSArray as another NSArray ? Obviously I can iterate through them and store them manually, but it seems like there has to be a more standard method of doing this. I was expecting there to be an -arrayWithObjectsInRange: or something similar, but don't see anything... NSArray* largeArray...// Contains 50 items... NSArray* smallArray = // fill in the blank // smallArray contains first 10 items from largeArray Thanks!
