How to change upper/lower case in a TFS work item field definition (WIT)?

I have a weird problem with the configuration of TFS 2010 work items. It seems to be impossible to change the case of characters in the allowed values collection of a field e.g. change "Works for me" to "Works For Me". Every other string e.g. "Works For Me 123" is valid. Even if I try to change the name to another string first (since i know the similar case problem with files in Visual Studio projects) it is just not accepting the upper case version and returns always to the lower case string. Background information: We have a custom WIT file to define the "Bug" work item. This includes the definition of the allowed values for the field "Resolved Reason". Initially our list contained lower case words e.g. "Works for me". Since we want to synchronize the TFS work items with HP Quality Center we need an exact match of the state names now. The desired version: The reason why the bug was resolved The actual version: The reason why the bug was resolved Any ideas are welcome. Thanks, Robert
