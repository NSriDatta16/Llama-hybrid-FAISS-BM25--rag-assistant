(I really didn't mean to respond with a bag of cliches, but XML seems to bring out the proverb collection... ;-) I have found XML configuration (and config files in general, but that's another question) to introduce multiple levels of your question, because, "To a small boy with a hammer, everything looks like a nail." It is easy to become enthusiastic about a tool (such as XML) and start using it much more widely than it deserves, or to keep adding "just one more" feature until the result becomes too unwieldy. Also, as the old saying goes, "Everything in programming is a trade-off." So, to play devil's advocate, have you reached the point where you need to do maintenance or tweaks on the running system? In the new scheme of life, how often do you have to make adjustments by re-building all or part of the system, instead of being able to tweak a config file? Finally, there's rough equivalent of the "Hawthorne effect" (see below). Sometimes a team gets a burst of excitement when they are allowed to clean up some minor issue, and they achieve a burst of productivity out of proportion to the actual improvement, triggered by the relief at getting rid of a long-standing annoyance. Footnote: The Hawthorne effect is named after a study of factory worker productivity relating to changes in lighting. The researchers found that increased light was followed by an increase in productivity. But then they found that decreased light was also followed by an increase in productivity. (Both increases were typically short-term.) The final conclusion was that the workers were more productive because someone was paying attention to them. So, sometimes an otherwise trivial change triggers a boost in morale (sense of empowerment, etc.) that causes improvements in performance. There's seldom just one factor.
