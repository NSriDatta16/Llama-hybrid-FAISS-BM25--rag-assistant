In Ruby, if something is not nil, it will return true in a boolean expression and its value in a calculation. I'm not explaining it really well, but you can do something like this: amt = alt_inv - (alt_tax || 0) - (alt_freight || 0) - (misc1_amt || 0) - (misc2_amt || 0) This is a more concise way of doing the ternary you were originally using. Edit: I actually like Jed Schneider's answer better than my own. I'll not copy it here, since his answer deserves the upvote for its elegance.
