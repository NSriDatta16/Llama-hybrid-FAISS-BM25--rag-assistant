First I would declare an empty array for the navigation. $part_array = array(); First I would loop through the array and combine items based on the part name. $counter = 0; foreach($mysql_result_array as $part) { $part_array[$part['ID'] = $part['ID']; $part_array[$part['ID']['Name'] = $part['Name']; $part_array[$part['ID']['parts'] = $part; $counter++; } Now you have all of the parts separately, but contained within the same ID of an array. From here I would loop through each part of the $part_array and echo each part within that ID out as it's own list item. foreach($part_array as $list_item) { echo ' ">'; echo ' '.$list_item['Name']; echo ' '; foreach($list_item['parts'] as $list_item_part) { echo ' '.$list_item['Desc'].' '; } } It may not be the most efficient or the most elegant, but hopefully it gives you the idea.
