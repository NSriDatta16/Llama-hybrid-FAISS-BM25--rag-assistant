In Bayesian statistics, such predictions as usually done using the posterior predictive distribution, not by estimating the parameters directly. See the Wikipedia page on the posterior predictive distribution . If the prior distribution is beta, and the likelihood is binomial, then the posterior predictive distribution is a beta-binomial distribution. See An introduction to the Beta-Binomial model , which has details and formulas. The previous sentence beginning "If the prior distribution" is a direct quote from pg 8 of this document. Also see the Wikipedia page on the Beta-binomial distribution . You probably want the value of the posterior predictive distribution for your new data point to start with.
