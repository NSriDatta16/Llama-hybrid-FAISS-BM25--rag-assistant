You should be focused on a slope, as you think. The trick with PCR data in practice is that a reliable slope related to amplification efficiency doesn't typically extend over the entire range of PCR cycles. At low cycle numbers, the background signal (e.g., fluorescence) tends to overwhelm the DNA-associated signal. At high cycle numbers, reagents are often completely consumed so that there is no further increase in DNA-associated signal. What's done in practice is to plot the data separately for each primer set, with log2 DNA on the vertical axis and cycle number on the horizontal axis. Identify visually the region on each curve where there is a linear association between log2 DNA and cycle number, then assess the slopes of those regions. Perfect amplification would have a slope of 1 on that scale. A one-sided test could then be a test of whether the slope is greater than what corresponds to a 1.95-fold amplification, or log2(1.95) .
