Combining vectors of unequal length into a data frame

I have a list of vectors which are time series of inequal length. My ultimate goal is to plot the time series in a ggplot2 graph. I guess I am better off first merging the vectors in a dataframe (where the shorter vectors will be expanded with NAs), also because I want to export the data in a tabular format such as .csv to be perused by other people. I have a list that contains the names of all the vectors. It is fine that the column titles be set by the first vector, which is the longest. E.g.: > mylist [[1]] [1] "vector1" [[2]] [1] "vector2" [[3]] [1] "vector3" etc. I know the way to go is to use Hadley's plyr package but I guess the problem is that my list contains the names of the vectors, not the vectors themselves, so if I type: do.call(rbind, mylist) I get a one-column df containing the names of the dfs I wanted to merge. > do.call(rbind, actives) [,1] [1,] "vector1" [2,] "vector2" [3,] "vector3" [4,] "vector4" [5,] "vector5" [6,] "vector6" [7,] "vector7" [8,] "vector8" [9,] "vector9" [10,] "vector10" etc. Even if I create a list with the object themselves, I get an empty dataframe : mylist but do.call(rbind.fill, mylist) data frame with 0 columns and 0 rows I have tried converting the vectors to dataframes, but there is no cbind.fill function, so plyr complains that the dataframes are of different length. So my questions are: Is this the best approach? Keep in mind that the goals are a) a ggplot2 graph and b) a table with the time series, to be viewed outside of R What is the best way to get a list of objects starting with a list of the names of those objects? What the best type of graph to highlight the patterns of 60 timeseries? The scale is the same, but I predict there'll be a lot of overplotting. Since this is a cohort analysis, it might be useful to use color to highlight the different cohorts in terms of recency (as a continuous variable). But how to avoid overplotting? The differences will be minimal so faceting might leave the viewer unable to grasp the difference.
