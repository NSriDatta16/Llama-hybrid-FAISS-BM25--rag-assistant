Android Compatibility package and getLoaderManager()

Android Compatibility package is said to support LoaderManager. How can I get an instance of LoaderManager? The getLoaderManager() method is missing in FragmentActivity, it's only in Fragment class. But I want to use only Loaders, not Fragments in my app.
