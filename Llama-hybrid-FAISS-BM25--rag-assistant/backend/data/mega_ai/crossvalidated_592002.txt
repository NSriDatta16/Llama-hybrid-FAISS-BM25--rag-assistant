Some regression methods, e.g. ordinary least squares , do indeed require a normal distribution. But note that it is not the data that is supposed to be normally distributed, but the errors. I.e. in the model: $$ y_i = a + b x_i + \epsilon_i $$ it is the $\epsilon_i$ that is required to be normally distributed, not the $y_i$ . Also, there are many regression models that provide for error distributions other than Gaussians. Thus, if you know that your errors are not normally distributed and those distributions cannot reasonably be approximated with Gaussians, you should check out those methods. See e.g. glm or more sophisticated R packages like brms . In general, replacing your actual data with local averages means losing information and should be avoided.
