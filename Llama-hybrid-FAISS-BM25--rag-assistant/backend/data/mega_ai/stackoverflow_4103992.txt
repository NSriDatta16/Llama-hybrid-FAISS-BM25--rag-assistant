There would have been no way to know this from my post, but I found the problem. I set up the dependency injection in an HttpModule, and there was a lock on the configuration function. I think it was there from old code I copied (and then forgot about) from somewhere when I was first learning how to use StructureMap. I removed the lock and it worked. (well, at least it began generating new, unrelated errors). Oh, and the reason it was affecting my DataContext was because the classes that wrapped instances of the Datacontext were inside the lock.
