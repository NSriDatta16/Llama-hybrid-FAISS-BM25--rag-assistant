How to iterate over two arrays at once?

I have two arrays built while parsing a text file. The first contains the column names, the second contains the values from the current row. I need to iterate over both lists at once to build a map. Right now I have the following: var currentValues = currentRow.Split(separatorChar); var valueEnumerator = currentValues.GetEnumerator(); foreach (String column in columnList) { valueEnumerator.MoveNext(); valueMap.Add(column, (String)valueEnumerator.Current); } This works just fine, but it doesn't quite satisfy my sense of elegance, and it gets really hairy if the number of arrays is larger than two (as I have to do occasionally). Does anyone have another, terser idiom?
