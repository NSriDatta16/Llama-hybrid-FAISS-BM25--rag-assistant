In some situtations like this where a record of a class needs 'direct manipulation' I've often resorted to the following: PMyRec = ^TMyRec; TMyRec = record MyNum : integer end; TMyObject = class( TObject ) PRIVATE FMyRec : TMyRec; function GetMyRec : PMyRec; PUBLIC property MyRec : PMyRec The benefit of this is that you can leverage the Delphi automatic dereferencing to make readable code access to each record element viz: MyObject.MyRec.MyNum := 123; I cant remember, but maybe WITH works with this method - I try not to use it!
