It may be that your minority class(es) have poor performance in the hard classification (obtained by choosing the class with the largest predicted probability), but that their predicted probabilities rank-order well. The former would explain low macro-averaged hard classification scores compared to high weighted-averaged scores, and the latter would explain why AUROC is not so encumbered.
