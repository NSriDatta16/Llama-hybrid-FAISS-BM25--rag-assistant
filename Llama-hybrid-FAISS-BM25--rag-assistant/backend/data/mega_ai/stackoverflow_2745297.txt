How can I import color schemes into Visual Studio 2010?

I recently came across this website: http://studiostyles.info , which contains a list of color schemes that people have already created. However, I can't find instructions on how to import them into Visual Studio 2010, does anyone know how? PS: I am sorry, if this question has been asked but I cannot find an answer, through search. Thanks Robert, this whole process was confusing here is the exact way to get to it: Tools / Import and Export Settings / Import selected environment settings / Next / No, just import new settings, overwriting my current settings / Next / Browse
