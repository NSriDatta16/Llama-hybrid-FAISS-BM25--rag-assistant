See if there is statistically significant difference between two periodograms, in time series

I'm doing a research about some fishes in two different zones, = 9 meters and I'm working with time series. I did two periodograms for each zone. Now, I would like to compare them and see if there is some statistically significant difference between these two periodograms.
