Ok, it seems that it can't be done the way I wanted it. Possible solutions are: Pass some parameters in d&d and do some inter-process communication on your own, after user drops data in target processes window. Use DataObjectComposite to support multiple drag&drop formats and keyboard modifiers to choose current format. Scenario: User initiates drag. State of CTRL, ALT and SHIFT is checked, and depending on it the d&d format is selected. DataObjectComposite is created, and has set data in chosen format. User drops data in target window. Drop target asks dropped DataObject for supported format and retrieves data, knowing what format it is in. I'm choosing the solution 2. , because it doesn't require hand crafting communication between processes and it allows me to avoid unnecessary data retrieval when user wants to drag only the simplest data. Anyway - Toni, thanks for your answer! Played with it a little and it made me think of d&d and of changing my approach to the problem.
