Interpolating the empirical cumulative function

The empirical cumulative distribution function of a random variable, given observations $x_\left( k \right) > x_\left( k-1 \right)$, $k \in \mathbb N$, $k \le n$, is defined as $F_{emp}(x_\left( k \right) > X \ge x_\left( k-1 \right)) = \frac k {n+1}$ and $F_{emp}(X \ge x_\left(n\right))=1$. Why? As long as we're interpolating, wouldn't it make sense to use some interpolation method with less error? A simple nearest neighbour or piecewise average interpolant would be an improvement, and a cubic interpolant would get us a differentiable empirical density function, too. The above definition won't even give you the piecewise infimum of the cdf, because the variable is random. It certainly approaches the true function as $n\to\infty$, but then so would any other interpolant. Surely at least linear interpolants were considered.
