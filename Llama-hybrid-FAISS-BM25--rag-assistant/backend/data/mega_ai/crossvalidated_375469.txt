Find bayesian credible Interval

I am taking this example from here . They have given the steps but i cannot understand them so a little dumbing down of answer is necessary or you can just explain the answer given there. its on page 5 consider a device that will operate without failure for a time θ because of a protective chemical inhibitor injected into it; but at time θ the supply of the chemical is exhausted, and failures then commence, following the exponential failure law. It is not feasible to observe the depletion of this inhibitor directly; one can observe only the resulting failures. From data on actual failure times, estimate the time θ of guaranteed safe operation. Find 95% uncertainty bounds Failure times observed : $(10, 12, 15)$ . use uninformative prior
