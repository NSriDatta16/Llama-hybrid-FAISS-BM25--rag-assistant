Are these approaches suitable for solving this problem (deciding how many parameters to include in your model, or selecting among a number of models)? Either one could be, yes. If you're interested in obtaining a model that predicts best, out of the list of models you consider, the splitting/cross-validation approach can do that well. If you are interested in known which of the models (in your list of putative models) is actually the one generating your data, then the second approach (evaluating the posterior probability of the models) is what you want. Are they equivalent? Probably not. Will they give the same optimal model under certain assumptions or in practice? No, they are not in general equivalent. For example, using AIC (An Information Criterion, by Akaike) to choose the 'best' model corresponds to cross-validation, approximately. Use of BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) corresponds to using the posterior probabilities, again approximately. These are not the same criterion, so one should expect them to lead to different choices, in general. They can give the same answers - whenever the model that predicts best also happens to be the truth - but in many situations the model that fits best is actually one that overfits, which leads to disagreement between the approaches. Do they agree in practice? It depends on what your 'practice' involves. Try it both ways and find out. Other than the usual philosophical difference of specifying prior knowledge in Bayesian models etc., what are the pros and cons of each approach? Which one would you choose? It's typically a lot easier to do the calculations for cross-validation, rather than compute posterior probabilities It's often hard to make a convincing case that the 'true' model is among the list from which you are choosing. This is a problem for use of posterior probabilities, but not cross-validation Both methods tend to involve use of fairly arbitrary constants; how much is an extra unit of prediction worth, in terms of numbers of variables? How much do we believe each of the models, a priori ? I'd probably choose cross-validation. But before committing, I'd want to know a lot about why this model-selection was being done, i.e. what the chosen model was to be used for. Neither form of model-selection may be appropriate, if e.g. causal inference is required.
