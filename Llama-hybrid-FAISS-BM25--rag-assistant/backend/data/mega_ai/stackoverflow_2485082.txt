I found a lot of the stuff in that example to be out dated. The syntax for mixed hrefs and the [] around the paragraph do not work for me. For mixed content, you need to use the special keyword 'mkp.yield'. There is also an 'mkp.yieldUnescaped' if you don't want escaping. There are some other functions you can do with mkp as well. This example does work and shows using mixed content: def builder = new groovy.xml.MarkupBuilder() builder.html { head { title"XML encoding with Groovy" } body { h1"XML encoding with Groovy" p"this format can be used as an alternative markup to XML" a(href:'http://groovy.codehaus.org', "Groovy") p { mkp.yield "This is some" b"mixed" mkp.yield " text. For more see the" a(href:'http://groovy.codehaus.org', "Groovy") mkp.yield "project" } p "some text" } }â€‹ Output: XML encoding with Groovy XML encoding with Groovy this format can be used as an alternative markup to XML Groovy This is some mixed text. For more see the Groovy project some text
