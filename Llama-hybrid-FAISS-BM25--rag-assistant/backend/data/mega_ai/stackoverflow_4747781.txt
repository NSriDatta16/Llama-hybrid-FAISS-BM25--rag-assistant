If you want for your class to provide some notification mechanism, what you really want is an event , not to update a UI directly. In the context of a WinForms app, you can handle this event from your form and perform any Invoke / BeginInvoke work there. Hopefully that makes sense. If not, try looking up .NET events to understand how they work. But by all means, keep your class decoupled from your user interface. I'm not sure why anyone would encourage a move in the opposite direction.
