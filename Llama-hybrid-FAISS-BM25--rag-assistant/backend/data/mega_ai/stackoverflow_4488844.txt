If speed is the most important aspect, you should consider GNU-Prolog. I recently developed using Amzi! Prolog with its Eclipse IDE (not to be confused with ECLiPSe programming language). Once the debugging was done, I turned my attention to timing. Porting to SWI-Prolog and GNU-Prolog was fairly straightforward, both on Windows and Linux, since at that point the code was fairly standard "ISO" Prolog. My timings showed Amzi! and SWI were comparable in speed, and GNU-Prolog was significantly faster. It also turned out the code was spending a large majority of time in one section that was very numeric. While Amzi! and SWI both implement exact integer arithmetic in arbitrary precision, it turned out my requirements were just within the integer limits in 32-bit GNU-Prolog. Moreover GNU-Prolog was easy to link to a rewrite of that critical section in C. The hybrid code is what I'm using in production.
