SQL Server DB - Deleting Records, or setting an IsDeleted flag?

Possible Duplicate: What to do when I want to use database constraints but only mark as deleted instead of deleting? Is it more appropriate to set some kind of "IsDeleted" flag in a heavily used database to simply mark records for deletion (and then delete them later), or should they be deleted directly? I like the IsDeleted flag approach because it gives an easy option to restore data in case something went terribly wrong, and I could even provide some kind of "Undo" function to the user. The data I'm dealing with is fairly important. I don't like IsDeleted because it really messes with data retrieval queries, as I'd have to filter by the state of the IsDeleted flag in addition to the regular query. Queries use no more than one index so I'd also assume that this would slow down things tremendously unless I create composite indexes. So, what is more appropriate? Is there a better "middle way" to get the benefits of both, and what are you using & why?
