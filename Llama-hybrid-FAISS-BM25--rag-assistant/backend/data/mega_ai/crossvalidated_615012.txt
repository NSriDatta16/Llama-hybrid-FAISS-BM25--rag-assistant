Generalised speed measure balances between entropy of proposal density and average acceptance

This is in reference to page 3 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01373 In the following line after equation (3): the author mentioned that the generalised speed measure (a measure of speed for which a proposal distribution converges to its stationary distribution) balances between high entropy of the proposal and the average acceptance probability for a Markov Chain at initial state $x$ . It is unclear to me what this tradeoff is. Can it not be the case that both the proposal and the average acceptance probability is high? How does $\beta$ balances the ratio of the entropy and the average acceptance probability?
