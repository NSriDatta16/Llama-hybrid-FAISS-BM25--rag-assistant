How does the given data gets plotted on a graph

I come from a programming background and learning the math behind the data science and algorithms now. I would like to understand the logic behind how a data gets plotted in a graph when using Logistic regression. Lets consider a Testing data like this, ID Age Grade Location Churn 1 24 1 A 1 2 25 1 A1 1 3 28 1 A2 1 4 31 2 A3 0 And this could get plotted like this in Logistic regression like this - [A mocked image below] How did these ID's usually gets plotted in the graph. What's the math behind a data like this getting plotted in a graph. I understand the plane separating the points. But couldn't understand how the points got there in the first place. This may be basic for experienced people. But it has been a question in my mind for a while. I tried to get any online materials but I couldn't or may be I don't know what to search for. Also, does this plotting differs in any way for SVM and other models. I guess only the model splitting the points will differ. Please give me leads in understanding this one.
