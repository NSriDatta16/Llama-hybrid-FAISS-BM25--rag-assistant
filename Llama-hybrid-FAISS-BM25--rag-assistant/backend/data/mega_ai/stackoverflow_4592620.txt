Why is this collection initializer trying to be static?

I am trying to create a very simple list of entities that I am using for some unit tests I'm writing, but the compiler is complaining that I can't access an instance variable from a static context. So far as I can see, there are only instance variables. using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using EMP.Domain.Entities; using NUnit.Framework; namespace EMP.Domain.Tests.Repositories { [TestFixture] public class AuditTrailRepositoryTests { private Guid orgId1 = Guid.NewGuid(); private IList fakeAuditData = new List { new AuditTrail { ChangeDate = new DateTime(2011, 1, 1), EntityName = "Test", OrganisationId = orgId1, Username = "admin" } }; } } That is literally all the code in the class at this point. The compiler is complaining that Error 1 A field initializer cannot reference the non-static field, method, or property 'EMP.Domain.Tests.Repositories.AuditTrailRepositoryTests.orgId1' What is causing the fakeAuditData to think it's running in a static context? I've even added an instance method and been able to access both the collection and the Guids. So is the collection static when initialised and does this mean that it is only initialised once?
