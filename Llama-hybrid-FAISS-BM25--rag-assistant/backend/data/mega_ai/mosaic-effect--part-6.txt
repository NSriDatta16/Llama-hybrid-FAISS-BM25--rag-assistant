r social security numbers, may enable the extraction of sensitive information when combined with additional datasets, due to structural properties embedded within those identifiers. Additional releases, changes to published datasets, or unforeseen auxiliary data can compromise anonymity, allowing individuals to be re-identified through mosaic-style analysis. Public demonstrations of the mosaic effect highlight its threat to data anonymization practices and underscore the need for secure research pathways that protect user identities while supporting AI development, according to Abhishek Gupta. Researchers successfully identified Netflix users in the Netflix Prize dataset by combining it with public Internet Movie Database (IMDb) information, enabling the inference of political preferences and other sensitive attributes. In another incident, researchers were able to combine a Massachusetts hospital discharge database with public voter databases and previously breached and leaked AOL user information to identify local medical patients. An executive from AOL was forced to resign and a research team was fired due to public outcry after it was revealed that client data could be used in such reconstructed ways to identify people. Automatic number-plate recognition Automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) refers to systems that combine high-speed cameras with optical character recognition to automatically detect, photograph, and convert license plates into machine-readable text for use in applications like tolling, vehicle screening, and traffic monitoring. First articulated in United States v. Maynard (D.C. Cir. 2012) and later applied to ANPR in Commonwealth v. McCarthy (Mass. 2016), the mosaic theory holds that aggregating individually lawful location reads—whether GPS pings or license-plate scans—can collectively invade a reasonable expectation of privacy. Although not originally designed to identify individuals, ANPR technologies have drawn legal and privacy scrutiny since the 1990s as agencies increasingly linked license plate data with third-party records and retained it over time, raising concerns about surveillance, misuse, and personal re-identification. Critics have argued that fixed-location surveillance, such as pole cameras, can expose personal routines and associations in ways comparable to mobile tracking. Mosaic theory can render previously lawful surveillance retrospectively unconstitutional; for example, McCarthy suggested that tracking periods under two months were permissible but one year would not. In a report authored by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute with the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, they found that aggregating discrete surveillance data points such as travel patterns from license plate tracking may collectively constitute an unconstitutional search. License plate numbers, though not personally identifiable on their own, can become PII when linked with contextual metadata or external databases such as department of motor vehicles records. The mosaic theory offers no objective threshold for when aggregated data becomes a search, leading to arbitrary, case-by-case rulings. Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union have warned that aggregating long-term license plate records could expose intimate personal behaviors, affiliations, or routines, especially when datasets are shared or retained indefinitely. Anonymization of license plate data may not prevent re-identification, particularly when datasets are linked to external sources, increasing privacy risks. Tracey v. State (Fla. 2014) held that the mosaic theory's ad hoc, case-by-case scrutiny of cell-site data is unworkable and undermines law-enforcement planning. Cellular, data and internet services Data brokers and aggregators assemble information from disparate sources to create high-definition mosaic portraits of individuals, raising the risk of profiling and digital expos
