I use git to manage all of my Magento projects and deployments. It's much easier to merge new versions, especially if you use the Magento mirror I maintain on github. ( GitHub Magento Mirror ) As for you specific question about where the base url is stored in the DB, try this: SELECT * FROM core_config_data WHERE path = "web/secure/base_url" OR path = "web/unsecure/base_url";
