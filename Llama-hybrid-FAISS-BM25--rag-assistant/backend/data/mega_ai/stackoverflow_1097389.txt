Which one is faster rewrite or folder based URLs?

I am creating URLs in my website as http://example.com/register/ http://example.com/login/ I am creating above URLS by writing following rules in htaccess RewriteRule register/ /register.php RewriteRule login/ /login.php Now its working fine for me, but if I create my URLs by creating seprate folder for /login/index.php and /register/index.php By creating folders and index.php files inside those I can achieve above functionality easily. But I want to know which w=one will be faster, I tried both methods but not seen much difference, according to logic and apache specifications and everything which method will be faster and a good method to go with. My friend says .htaccess rules will be slower, because in case of htaccess first it will check for rules and then it will redirect to the corresponding attached page, this process will take time than folder organization.
