Encryption Algorithm

I am creating an application which uses a steganography algorithm. Now I can encrypt and decrypt text. But I want my application to ask for password after encrypting the text into the image, so that whenever someone will decrypt the image it would ask for the password for authentication. Is this even possible? If yes, how?
