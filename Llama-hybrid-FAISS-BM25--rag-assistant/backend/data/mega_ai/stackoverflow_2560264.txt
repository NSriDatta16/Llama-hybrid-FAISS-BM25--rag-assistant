Fetch excerpt from Wikipedia article?

I've been up and down the Wikipedia API , but I can't figure out if there's a nice way to fetch the excerpt of an article (usually the first paragraph). It would be nice to get the HTML formatting of that paragraph, too. The only way I currently see of getting something that resembles a snippet is by performing a fulltext search ( example ), but that's not really what I want (too short). Is there any other way to fetch the first paragraph of a Wikipedia article than barbarically parsing HTML/WikiText?
