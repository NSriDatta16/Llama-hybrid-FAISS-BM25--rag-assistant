What should be the return type for the WCF service method having a master-detail Linq-to-entities query?

I have a service method written as follows for a Silverlight 4 application: [OperationContract] public List GetAll() { GearsLtdEntities ge = new GearsLtdEntities(); var query = from a in Employees join b in Depts on a.DeptID equals b.DeptId group a by b.DeptId into c select new { DeptId = c.Key, Name = from cg in c group cg.Name by cg.Name into g select new { Name = g.Key } }; return query; } and I want the data to be returned in this manner: Now the query works fine when I run it standalone in LINQPad but when I am confused how to return the results back from the method. What should the method type be? I tried IEnumerable , then I tried IEnumerable , also tried a class DeptEmployee specifically created for this, but nothing seems to work. Edit I looked up projections and WCF data services as well, but couldn't find a single complete example demonstrating these, what I see are fragments and snippets and these aren't helping me get what I want. Is there a complete working example of using a master-detail query in WCF and SL with linq to entities and then returning the result from the service method?
