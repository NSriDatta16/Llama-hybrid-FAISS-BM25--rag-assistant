If you want any value in a dictionary, you have to do it on the way dict.key (On python you'll write it as dict['key']) So, to present the value stored with key 'name' {{ sc.name }} Anyway, I think this is not you're case. I think you're not seeing a dictionary, but an object defined from models (as is a entry on the database). You're storing in dict (don't call that value as dict , you're masking a keyword) a key 'sc' with value variable sc , which is returned from a model. I'm having to guess, because I don't know how this model is. Maybe 'Robert' is stored in the attribute name , id or something similar? You need to show then the proper attribute, something like {{ sc.name }} {{ sc.id }}
