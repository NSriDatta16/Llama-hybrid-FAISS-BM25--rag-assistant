Reinforcement Learning in 2018, best tips and tricks?

Putting aside things applicable to neural networks such as dropout, l2 regularization, new opitmizers - what are the cool things I should be adding to my Reinforcement Learning algorithm (Q-Learning and SARSA) to make it stronger, in 2018 ? So far, I know these: Experience Replay (gather experiences, then train at once on some of them) Slowly making our network approach the Q-values of a Target Network. The target Network is only cloned sometimes. If our function approximator is RNN and our Memory Bank stores sequences of several timesteps, after selecting few random sequences from Memory bank, only backpropagate a half of the sequence, without going back to its start
