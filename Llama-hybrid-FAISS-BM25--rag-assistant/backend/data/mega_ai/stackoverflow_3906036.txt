You're right. Big O (big Theta etc.) is used to measure functions . When you write f=O(g) it doesn't matter what f and g mean. They could be average time complexity, worst time complexity, space complexities, denote distribution of primes etc. Worst-case complexity is a function that takes size n, and tells you what is maximum number of steps of an algorithm given input of size n. Average-case complexity is a function that takes size n, and tells you what is expected number of steps of an algorithm given input of size n. As you see worst-case and average-case complexity are functions, so you can use big O to express their growth.
