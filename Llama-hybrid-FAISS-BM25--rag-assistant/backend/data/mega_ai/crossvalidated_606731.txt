The distribution is binomial distributed and with that you can compute this manually. If $X$ is the average of five coin flips (which I assume are fair) then $$\begin{array}{} P(X = -1) &=& \frac{1}{2^5}\\ P(X = -0.6) &=& \frac{5}{2^5}\\ P(X = -0.2) &=& \frac{10}{2^5}\\ P(X = 0.2)& =& \frac{10}{2^5}\\ P(X = 0.6) &=& \frac{5}{2^5}\\ P(X = 1) &=& \frac{1}{2^5} \end{array}$$ And the expectation value for any function of the variable is $$E[f(X)] = \sum_x P(X=x) \cdot f(x)$$ with $f(X) = |X|$ you can get your answer which should be close to the approximation below. In the limit, you can estimate this with the half normal distribution , which has an expectation value of $\sigma \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}$ and the distribution of the mean of $n$ coin flips is approximated by taking $\sigma = 1/ \sqrt{ n}$ giving $$E[|X_n|] \approx \sqrt{\frac{2}{n\pi}}$$ which is equal to about $0.3568248$ in the case of $n = 5$ , a bit less than 5% away from the exact answer.
