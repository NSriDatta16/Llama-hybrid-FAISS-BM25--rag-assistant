nCover + MSTest + CruiseControl = Zero Coverage

I use CruiseControl.net, MSTest 3.5 and nCover 1.5.8. I am new to nCover and want to integrate it in CruiseControl. The problem is that I get a 0% coverage result but it should be 100%. My demo app calls just one method and in my mstest project this method is tested. in my cruiseControl server all works fine without ncover and i can see the mstest results (passes with ok) now i want to through in nCover. in my cruiseConttrol server I call a nant script that does this (simplified): Running this in cruisecontrol seems to work and i can see the ncover result. but the result is 0% coverage any ideas? bye bembi
