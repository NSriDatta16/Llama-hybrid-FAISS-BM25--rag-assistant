Difficulties training a classifier

I'm a begginer in data science but I tried to build a classifier for my own bank transactions, I collected ~ 50.000 in total. My intention is to create a relationship between the statement of the transaction and the type of transaction. For example: Statement: Payment with card number XXXXXX in Wallmart. Type/label: Buy in a supermarket For doing so I trained my model with 80% of the total of statements (previously labeled) and I reached a so high accuracy (85%). After that I realized that something was wrong, there are so many statements with the text: Statement: Payment with card number XXXXX in _______ . Because this is a "default" statement text in my bank when someone buys a product in a supermarket. Then, if the model tries to find out in what category the statement is it will be pretty simple because there will be many statements repeated and the probability of predict one of those will be high. What I did later was trying to delete all the repeated statements, since the repeated ones will not affect in the training process, but because of this my total of statements went down to ~ 2.000, and reaching then only a 10% of accuracy in the prediction. My questions are: What is correct process to train my model? Should I let the repeated statements? (I feel like I'm cheating the prediction letting the repeated ones) What I'm doing wrong?
