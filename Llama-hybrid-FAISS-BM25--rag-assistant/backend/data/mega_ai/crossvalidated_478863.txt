Averaging quarterly level data to the annual level

From the Quarterly Workforce Indicators, I have obtained a measure of data measured at the quarterly level for earnings and employment. so in each quarter, they take the total earnings, and divide by the total employment for that quarter. I want to create an 'implied' annual average earnings from this. A few questions: would it be invalid to just take the average of the average quarterly earnings, and multiply that by 4? alternatively, since I can obtain the denominator for each quarter, I wished to do the following: for each quarter q, multiply average quarterly earnings by the total employment in that quarter. this should yield the total quarterly earnings. Do this for each quarter, and then add each to get the total annual earnings. divide by the total annual employment. is 2. equivalent to a 'weighted' mean? or can it be directly interpreted as an annual average earnings? my concern is that since each measurement is calculated independently each quarter, the denominator and the numerator could be double counting many jobs.
