FlexGantt TimelineObject color change

I'm using the FlexGantt Javax Swing package ( http://www.dlsc.com/ ) to display some Gantt charts. The trouble I'm having is that I can't figure out how to change the color of a DefaultTimelineObject that I've extended into my own class. Actually, about the only colors I seem able to change are the ones that are for the background colors of the Gantt rows.
