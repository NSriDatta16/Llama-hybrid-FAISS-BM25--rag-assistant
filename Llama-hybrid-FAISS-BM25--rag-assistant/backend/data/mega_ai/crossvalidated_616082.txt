HDBSCAN on UMAP output

My question is about using UMAP as a dimensional reduction technique before HDBSCAN clustering. I have a dataset of ~5000 observations each with ~20 descriptors. According to HDBSCAN guidelines, HDBSCAN clusters decently on less than 50 dimensions, so in theory I should be able to cluster directly on the raw data. However, when I do so, HDBSCAN classifies about a quarter of observations as noise and the density-based cluster validation (DBCV) implementation in the HDBSCAN API gives a validity index of ~0.2. In contrast, clustering on a 2-dimensional UMAP embedding yields a validity index of ~0.8, which is much better. Additionally, all observations are clustered (e.g. there is no noise). I've experimented with UMAP embedding into intermediate dimensions and different HDBSCAN hyperparameters, such as 10-dimensions or 5-dimensions, but it seems that clustering on 2-dimensions yields a slightly better DBCV score than anything else. It just seems a little suspicious to me that there is absolutely no noise when clustering on the 2D UMAP embedding, although the clustering does pass the eye-test. Additionally, a consistent trend is that the lower the minimum cluster size hyperparameter for HDBSCAN (e.g., min_clust_size
