How to model multiple inputs to multiple outputs?

1. My purpose I am trying to build a model with multiple inputs and multiple outputs, which is something like this: I am not sure if I need to firstly integrate the xi into X, and yi into Y so as to make the model easier like this: 2. Features of the training data There are several features for the training data: There are some missing factors for different entries due to lack of resources. For example, X1 may not have x3 and x5, Y1 may not have y4 and y5, X2 may not have x1 and x2, Y2 may not have y4. There might be multiple projections for X=g(Y). For example Of course, I would like to minimise the number of projections so as to build a more generalised model. 3. My question So may I ask how could I tackle this problem? I feel that the regression (e.g. polynomial regression) and classification (e.g. logistic regression, neural network) models only require one sigle output for each entry. I also do not think PLS is the right answer as PLS essentially models multiple x variables to a single yi instead of considering the Y=Î£yi as a whole. It seems that it is about modelling multivariate (not multivariable) regression. But how could I deal with missing factors?
