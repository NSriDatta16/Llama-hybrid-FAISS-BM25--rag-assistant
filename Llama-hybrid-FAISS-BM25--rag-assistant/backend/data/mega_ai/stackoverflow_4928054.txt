PostgreSQL wildcard LIKE for any of a list of words

I have a simple list of ~25 words. I have a varchar field in PostgreSQL, let's say that list is ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'] . I want to find any row in my table that has any of those words. This will work, but I'd like something more elegant. select * from table where (lower(value) like '%foo%' or lower(value) like '%bar%' or lower(value) like '%baz%')
