When the traffic is not completely jammed but slowly moving, crazy drivers still tend to change lanes frequently. For such a process of driving, I would rather use a continuous-time Markov chain and specify transition rates (the probability of transition per unit time) or half-lifetimes (the time after which I'm still in the same lane with probability 1/2) instead of transition probabilities (which are for a process having discrete time steps). For example, I would say If I'm in the left lane I switch to the right with a transition rate of 60% per minute. A transition rate of $\lambda_L = 0.6 \; \mathrm{min}^{-1}$ means that if I'm in the left lane now ( $\xi(t) = L$ ), the probability of changing lane in an infinitesimally small amount of time $dt$ is $$P\big[\xi(t+dt)=R\big|\xi(t)=L \big] = \lambda_L dt,$$ and the probability of not transiting and still staying in the same lane after say the first $t = 1 \; \mathrm{minute}$ is $$P\big[\xi(t)=L \mbox{ and not transiting back and forth meanwhile} \big| \xi(0)=0 \big] = e^{-λ_L t} \approx 0.549.$$ Then the probability of making the first transition between $t$ and $t+dt$ is the product of the two expressions above, so the expected time of first transition is the integral $$T_L = \int_0^\infty t \lambda_L e^{-λ_L t} \, dt = \frac{1}{\lambda_L} \approx 1.667 \; \mathrm{min}.$$ Once I have switched to the right lane, I expect to spend there an average of $T_R = 1/\lambda_R = 1.25 \mathrm{min}$ . Thus, over the long term, the fraction of time I expect to spend in the left lane is $R_L = \frac{T_L}{T_L+T_R} = \frac{1}{1 + \lambda_L / \lambda_R} = \frac{4}{7},$ which is exactly the same as for the case of discrete Markov chain.
