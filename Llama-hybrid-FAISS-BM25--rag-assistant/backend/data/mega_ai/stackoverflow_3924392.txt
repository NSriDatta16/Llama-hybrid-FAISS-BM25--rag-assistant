Couple of problems: Your forward declaration of averageN is not correct Code: double averageN(); The supplied version below takes a parameter. Your declaration of averageN does not quite work Declaring parameters of type array is not intuitively obvious. Normally people let the array degrade to a pointer to the array and pass a length as a second parameter. Code: double averageN(double *decimals, int arraySize) If you want to only pass arrays of a specific size you need to do so by reference: double averageN(double (&decimals)[arraySize]) Your call to averageN() in main. You are passing zero parameters. Now this matches the forward declaration but not the actual definition. Result I would change the code like this: extern double averageN(double (&decimals)[arraySize]); int main() { double data[arraySize]; averageN(data); return 0; } // why does the array have to be created here? double averageN(double (&decimals)[arraySize]) {
