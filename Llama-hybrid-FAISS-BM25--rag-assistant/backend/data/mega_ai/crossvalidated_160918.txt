What is expected count formula for zero-inflated negative binomial regression?

My IT department wants me to translate my zero-inflated negative binomial regression model into a formula for calculating expected count which they can hard code into SQL. I'm running the model in SAS, which outputs coefficients for both the logistic regression and negative binomial components of the model. Is this the correct formula for calculating the expected count? $E(y)=p_{i}\times 0+(1-p_{i})\times {\mu_{i}}=0+\left (1- \frac{1}{{{1+e^{-X\beta} }}} \right )\times e^{X\gamma }=\left ( \frac{1}{1+e^{X\beta }} \right )\times e^{X\gamma }$ where the $\beta$ vector contains the logistic regression coefficients and $\gamma$ contains the negative binomial regression coefficients. I think what threw me off is that the expected count for the negative binomial portion is just a simple log link function. Thanks!
