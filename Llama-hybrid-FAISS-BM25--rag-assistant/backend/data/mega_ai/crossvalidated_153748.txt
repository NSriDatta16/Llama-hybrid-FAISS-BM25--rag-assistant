Theano would be my personal preference while PyLearn2 is also very powerful. For a more lower-level approach, you could use autograd a great work coming from HIPS lab ( https://github.com/HIPS/autograd/ ). Autograd does automatic differentiation of numpy functions and has examples of NNs, RNNs etc. If you are looking for something easier and scikit-style you can try I. Laradji's implementations of Multilayer Perceptron and Autoencoder https://github.com/IssamLaradji/NeuralNetworks .
