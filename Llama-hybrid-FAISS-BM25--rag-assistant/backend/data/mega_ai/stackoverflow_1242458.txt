I have the same issue, but I have an ipod touch version 2.2.1. It used to connect to Xcode 3.1.2, then I upgraded to 3.1.3 and it doesn't work. I reverted back to 3.1.2 and it does not work. It does work on a friends mac with 3.1.3 so there is something wrong with my iMac. Firewall is disabled. It connects to iTunes fine and it is activated. Just won't show up in the organizer. Rebooting does not work. I reset, and restored it and it still doesn't connect. The fact that it connects to a friends mac and not mine leads me to believe that upgrading the ipod to version 3.0 would not fix the issue. Jimi
