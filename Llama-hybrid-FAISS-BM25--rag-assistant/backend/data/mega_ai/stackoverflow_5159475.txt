Either have a look at the Java source code (Yes, it comes with the JDK, but is zippen in a file called src.zip), or look at JBossSerialization , which is faster and reduces the size of the serialized objects. I have written my own some time ago, which is 6 times faster and produces 6 times less data, but it requires the exact class structure to be known to both sides, so it is just usable as a communication protocol and not for persistant storage.
