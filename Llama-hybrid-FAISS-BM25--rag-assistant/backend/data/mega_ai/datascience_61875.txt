You are almost there as you mentioned the addition of third class as random photos. Generally what happens when you train a neural network, it assumes the entire domain of images existing as the training data. For your case each image can be either cat or burger. Now you have not shown random images to network and hence when a image which is neither cat nor burger, network will try it's best to predict it as either cat or burger. Instead I would suggest you to train network as burger vs not burger. In not burger class have all possible kind of images that are not burger. You can use CIFAR 1000 data to get images of different classes. Now your model will learn to differentiate between burger and not burger properly. Obviously you can still find some cases where miss classification happening and the reason will be because you have not covered such images in training. Also play a bit with softmax threshold to get high presicion and recall.
