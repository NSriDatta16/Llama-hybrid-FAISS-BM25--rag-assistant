The Hudson Cobertura plugin should allow a build to be configured with the path to a Cobertura report (in XML format), from which Hudson can then pull the coverage report and render it. The build will still need to run Cobertura itself, either as part of a full site generation, or using cobertura:cobertura . From memory, look towards the bottom of the project's configuration page (under Post-Build actions); the setting is labelled something like "Publish Cobertura report".
