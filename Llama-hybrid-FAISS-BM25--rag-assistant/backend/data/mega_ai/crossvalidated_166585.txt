Pearson VS Deviance Residuals in logistic regression

I know that standardized Pearson Residuals are obtained in a traditional probabilistic way: $$ r_i = \frac{y_i-\hat{\pi}_i}{\sqrt{\hat{\pi}_i(1-\hat{\pi}_i)}}$$ and Deviance Residuals are obtained through a more statistical way (the contribution of each point to the likelihood): $$ d_i = s_i \sqrt{-2[y_i \log \hat{\pi_i} + (1 - y_i)\log(1-\hat{\pi}_i)]} $$ where $s_i$ = 1 if $y_i$ = 1 and $s_i$ = -1 if $y_i$ = 0. Can you explain to me, intuitively, how to interpret the formula for deviance residuals? Moreover, if I want to choose one, which one is more suitable and why? BTW, some references claim that we derive the deviance residuals based on the term $$-\frac{1}{2}{r_i}^2$$ where $r_i$ is mentioned above.
