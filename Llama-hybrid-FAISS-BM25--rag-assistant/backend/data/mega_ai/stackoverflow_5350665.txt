You are dead. Point. There IS NO open source solution that does what you want. The requirements of open source + c# basically kill all available solutions. MySQL has SOME databases that are good for time series, sort of (storage systems). You could try thsoe. That said, tuning SQL Server to accept 200.000 inserts is not that hard. I do 80.000 now and I know I have issues on the cpu timing side (virtual machine) that I will soon resolve, my discs are not busy, nor is the CPU.
