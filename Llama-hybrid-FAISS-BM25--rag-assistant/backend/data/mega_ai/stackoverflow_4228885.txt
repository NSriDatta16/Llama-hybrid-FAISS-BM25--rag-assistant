In the past I've compiled sources with Free Pascal using the "generate assembler" functionality, and then made some simple filter programs that operate on the source. (for this bit is useful to know that smartlinking is done using linker "section" granularity) It sometimes gives you insights why certain things are not smartlinked out (e.g. because there is a reference in some table that might be accessed by something in an initialization) Of course Delphi is not FPC, but when you have hints what to look for, it is a matter of looking at the dots in the margin after a Delphi compile to see if it is smartlinked or not. Likewise, if you have wonder why certain code has (not) been smartlinked out, analyzing a small example program compiled to assembler with FPC can make the reason obvious. (e.g. you find RTTI tables with a reference to it) The FPC route allows for a systematic route to search the WHY? something is eliminated or not, while map file and code coverage only tells you it is or is not linked in, not why. For a short description of smart linking see Delphi: Which are the downsides of having unused units listed in the uses clause?
