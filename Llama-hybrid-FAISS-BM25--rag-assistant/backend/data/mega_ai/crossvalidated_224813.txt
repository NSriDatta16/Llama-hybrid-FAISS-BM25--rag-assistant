PCA with variables in different Likert scales

Can I run PCA (principal components analysis) if my Likert variables are measured differently? E.g. one Likert variable is in the range 0-6, another one is in the range 0-10 and yet another one is in the range 4-12. These are all risk variables. I want to keep them this way because the risk if you answered a 4 on one scale (first) would be equivalent to the risk if you answered 2 on another scale.
