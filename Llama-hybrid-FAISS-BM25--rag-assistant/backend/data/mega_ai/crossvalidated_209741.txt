Can a model recognize the interactions between variables?

I have a data set similar to the following one, x1 x2 x3 x4 TARGET 1 1 5 3 9 0 2 5 4 3 12 0 3 5 2 2 9 0 4 5 7 1 13 1 5 7 3 2 12 0 6 5 6 6 17 1 7 1 3 4 8 0 8 2 2 7 11 0 9 5 2 6 13 1 10 4 2 1 7 1 The above data set can be generated using the following code in R, set.seed(1234) x1 = sample(1:7,10,replace = T) x2 = sample(1:7,10,replace = T) x3 = sample(1:7,10,replace = T) x4 = x1 + x2 + x3 TARGET = sample(0:1, 10, replace = T) df QUESTION: I have x1, x2, x3, x4(which is basically the sum(x1,x2,x3)), should I remove x1, x2, x3 from the data while modelling? Can a model(preferably GBM or randomForest or XGBoost) capture such interactions?
