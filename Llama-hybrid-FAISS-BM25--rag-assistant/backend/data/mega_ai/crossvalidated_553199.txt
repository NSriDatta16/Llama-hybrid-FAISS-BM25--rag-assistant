When you include an interaction term in a model it also changes the interpretation of the two "main effect" terms in the model - they no longer estimate the "average" effect of the original variables, but the effect of each when the other is zero. In your case you have an interaction between two binary variables: treatment (1=got treatment and 0=didn't get treatment) and gender (1=female 0=male). You include those two variables along with an interaction (treatment * gender) in a model of Y. The interpretation is as follows: The coefficient for "treatment" estimates the effect of being in the treatment group (as opposed to the control for MALES (gender=0) The coefficient for "gender" estimates the effect of being female (as opposed to male) for those in the CONTROL group (treatment=0) The coefficient for the interaction term estimates the difference between the treatment effect for females (as opposed to for males). In other words, to get the effect of the treatment for females you have to add the interaction term coefficient to the main treatment coefficient. So let's say that the treatment coefficient is nonsignificant, the gender coefficient is positive and significant and the interaction term is positive and significant. This means that: a)For MALES getting the treatment is not associated with a significant difference in outcomes b) for those in the control group being female is associated with higher outcomes c) For FEMALES getting the treatment is associated with a significantly MORE POSITIVE difference in outcomes, compared to for males. In other words, the interaction tells you that the effect of the treatment is significantly bigger for females than for males. What it doesn't tell you is if the effect for females is significantly different from ZERO. To test that you could just male "female" the reference category for gender instead of male.
