On the estimated formula of covariance of two random variables

We define the covariance of two random variables $X$ and $Y$ as $Cov(X,Y) = E[(X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)]$ . The covariance measures the "linear dependence" between the two r.v s. But in a lot of places, on the internet as well as in a course I am taking, I see the covariance defined for a set of paired data points $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_N, y_N)$ as $$Cov(X, Y) = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^N (x_t - \mu_X)(y_t - \mu_Y)}{N-1},$$ which looks like an average has been taken. Does this assume that $(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)$ follows a uniform distribution?
