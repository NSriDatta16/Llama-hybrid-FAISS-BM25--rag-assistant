How to model categorical (discrete-valued) time series?

Just want to make a little survey, What are, according to you, the best approach to model categorical time series? I'm building a model able to generate time series reproduicing the characteristics of a set of data. The available data is a discrete time, discrete-valued time serie. I have generated synthetic time serie using Markov chain, semi-markov chain and moving block bootstrap, I would like to know if you think of better way to do that job.
