I ran an excel simulation with 10K rows assuming a margin of error of 9.3%. The simulation used norminv with the probability parameter randomized. The simulation indicated approx 83.5% for the 45%, 11.5% for the 30% and 4.5% for the 25% candidate. While straight math gives a single number, as noted in the "Flaw of averages" the average result is overly narrow.
