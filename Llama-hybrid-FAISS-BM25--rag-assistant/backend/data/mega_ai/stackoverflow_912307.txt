There can be no 'frequency the "rsyslogd" runs', because it is a daemon, providing logging facilities. As Robert S.Barnes indicated, you'd better check the logs to determine the application, that is clogging up rsyslogd (ha!). The names of the logs are OS-specific, but chances are, they are in /var/log and its subdirectories. I've seen rsyslogd consume relatively large amounts of memory, but 170Mb is wayyyyyy too much and is not normal at all. Shameless offtopic edit: I have serverfault and stackoverflow tabs next to each other and, honestly, I was 100% sure I was posting to serverfault until I've actually submitted the answer (that should be a hint for you) :P
