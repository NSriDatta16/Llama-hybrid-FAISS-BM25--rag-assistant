Refining my Dojo/Dijit NumberTextBox numeric validation

I have the following code: Questions: 1) How do I set the width of the box? Do I have to do it in a style tag or a CSS? Is the traditional "input size" tag ignored? 2) The above sample shows the error when I type in a non-numeric value. But if I tab over the field and don't fill in anything, it's still blank. Is there a quick way to enforce the validation when I click the submit button? Do I need a Dijit submitt button? Do I need to write more JavaScript to make this happen? How does the required="true" actually occur? (One get-around is to set the value to 0, but I'd rather force the user enter a value rather than just defaulting it). Thanks, Neal Walters
