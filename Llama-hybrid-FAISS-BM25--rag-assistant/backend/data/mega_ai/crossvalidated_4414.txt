As for (on-line) references, I would recommend looking at Andrew Moore's tutorial slides on Statistical Data Mining . There are many textbooks on data mining and machine learning; maybe a good starting point is Principles of Data Mining , by Hand et al., and Introduction to Machine Learning , by Alpaydin.
