IIRC, the C# compiler will omit references to dll's that are never actually used in the code. So if all code is inside #if s, the reference to the dll will not be there in your compiled app, and the dll will never be loaded. You can check this using Reflector, by the way. Just drag & drop your compiled app into Reflector, and look at the References node. ILDASM also provides this feature, I think. Caveat: DllImport s and dynamic type loading (e.g., Type.GetType("type,dll") ) will dynamically load dlls without the C# compiler knowing or caring. But again, if inside the proper #if s, nothing will be loaded.
