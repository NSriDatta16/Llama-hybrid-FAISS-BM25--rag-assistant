Do you need the description/website rows to remain merged? If not unmerge to make it easier. You've tagged it as VBA but if this is a one-time fix then is it OK to manually work on the sheet? As a starting point I would suggest adding an identifier to each group of rows, and depending on your data quality you could do this by checking the website cell, or simply by counting rows. For example, you could insert a new column before your data and put the following in cell A2: =IF(Left(Lower(B1),4)="http",B2,A1) Where B1 (the row above) could be Organization, Description 1, Description 2, Organization's website, and if it is a website, we assume that on this new row we're starting with a new block of data so we'll take the organization name. If it isn't a website, we'll use the organization name we were using previously (A1 will need to =B1). Then copy that formula down until the end and the 4 rows will at least now have a common key which you can then use to mash around the data. If there are URLs which just start www. then modify the formula or better, just search/replace "www." to be " http://www ." so that your data quality has improved.
