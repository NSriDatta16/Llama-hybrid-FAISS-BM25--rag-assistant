Typically you would do credibility weighting of some kind to ensure that if you have small or insufficient statistics for a person their overall average is closer to the average of the overall group. In particular you might employ an equation like that in the wikipedia article on credibility theory $$ S = z_j \bar{X}_j + (1-z_j) \bar{X}$$ where $S$ is average win/score, $z_j$ represents how credible the group $j$ is with 0 meaning not at all and 1 meaning totally, $X_j$ is average for group $j$ and $X$ is average overall. As a first step you could take $z_j$ to be the proportion of games played.
