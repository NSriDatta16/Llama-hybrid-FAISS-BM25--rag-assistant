Based on what you're saying (and a couple assumptions, such as you will work with a single image more than once), it seems like caching an image's dimensions in memory would be one thing to do to increase efficiency here. Doing it this way, then you can intelligently set the dimensions in HTML or CSS. See this question for instructions on how to obtain the resolution (if you don't already know this - unfortunately I know of no way to do this without loading the entire image). I would encourage you to keep that image variable in a very small-scoped area and dispose it ASAP. I would discourage you from ignorantly using CSS's max-width and max-height properties as you'll lose your aspect ratio.
