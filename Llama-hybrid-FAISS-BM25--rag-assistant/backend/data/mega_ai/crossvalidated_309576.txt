Autoencoder is designed to preserve previous data in a 2-norm sense, which can be thought as preserve the kinetic energy of the data, if data is velocity. While t-SNE, use KL divergence which is not symmetrical, it will lead to t-SNE focus more on local structure, while autoencoder tends to keep overall L2 error small, which is in a global sense.
