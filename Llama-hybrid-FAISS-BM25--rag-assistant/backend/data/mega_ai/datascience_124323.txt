Workflow when making a machine learning model

I'm new to data science, and kinda confused with the workflow and steps to make a model. Before learning the math and concepts behind the algorithms like SVM, linear regressions, etc, I would just select a whole bunch of models and evaluate them. Then I'll select the best or the top 3 and randomsearcv it and evaluate all of em. Then evaluate fully on the best one. However, now that I've learned about the models, I don't know how to go on. For example, now I know that if I add features by messing around with PolynomalFeatures , I can possibly make a dataset linearly separable. However, for me to do this, I would need to mes around with SVM directly. Or perhaps, now that I understand the generalized linear models (cost function, hyperparameter, method of optimization), how does it change my workflow? Is trying all the models and then randomsearchcv-ing the best method?
