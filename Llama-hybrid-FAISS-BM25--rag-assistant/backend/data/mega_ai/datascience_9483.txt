XGBoost Linear Regression output incorrect

I am a newbie to XGBoost so pardon my ignorance. Here is the python code : import pandas as pd import xgboost as xgb df = pd.DataFrame({'x':[1,2,3], 'y':[10,20,30]}) X_train = df.drop('y',axis=1) Y_train = df['y'] T_train_xgb = xgb.DMatrix(X_train, Y_train) params = {"objective": "reg:linear"} gbm = xgb.train(dtrain=T_train_xgb,params=params) Y_pred = gbm.predict(xgb.DMatrix(pd.DataFrame({'x':[4,5]}))) print Y_pred Output is : [ 24.126194 24.126194] As you can see the input data is simply a straight line. So the output I expect is [40,50] . What am I doing wrong here?
