Operations on Recommendation Embeddings

I've trained a recommendation system to recommend steam games based on game tags. An example output is shown below, where GAME is the game recommended based on the similarity score. Game to recommend for: Total War: WARHAMMER GAME: Total War: WARHAMMER Similarity: 1.0 GAME: Phantom Doctrine Similarity: 0.97 GAME: Total War: THREE KINGDOMS Similarity: 0.96 GAME: Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II Similarity: 0.96 GAME: Total War: WARHAMMER II Similarity: 0.95 GAME: Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II Chaos Rising Similarity: 0.94 Game to recommend for : Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition GAME: Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition Similarity: 1.0 GAME: Rise of Nations: Extended Edition Similarity: 0.97 GAME: Age of Empires II (2013) Similarity: 0.97 GAME: Stronghold Crusader HD Similarity: 0.96 GAME: Age of Mythology: Extended Edition Similarity: 0.95 GAME: Medieval II: Total War Kingdoms Similarity: 0.95 The model used here is based on embeddings which are determined by a neural network. After training I have two matrices containing the embeddings: Games Matrix : n games * embedding size Tag Matrix : n tags * embedding size The embedding size for both matrices are the same and the similarity score is calculated by the cosine distance of the game in question to all other games. Would it be possible to find games similar to other games minus a given tag, for example, TOTAL WAR: WARHAMMER has the following tags: Strategy Fantasy RTS War Grand Strategy Say I like this game but I don't like the Fantasy element, could I somehow remove the Fantasy element when making a recommendation? Would a simple operation say Total War: WARHAMMER embedding - Fantasy embedding and then find similar matches work?
