deleterious mutation if Perf s ⁡ ( f , r ′ ) − Perf s ⁡ ( f , r ) ≤ − t {\displaystyle \operatorname {Perf} _{s}(f,r')-\operatorname {Perf} _{s}(f,r)\leq -t} . If there are any beneficial mutations, then Mut ⁡ ( f , r , s , t ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Mut} (f,r,s,t)} is equal to one of these at random. If there are no beneficial mutations, then Mut ⁡ ( f , r , s , t ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Mut} (f,r,s,t)} is equal to a random neutral mutation. In light of the similarity to biology, r {\displaystyle r\,} itself is required to be available as a mutation, so there will always be at least one neutral mutation. The intention of this definition is that at each stage of evolution, all possible mutations of the current genome are tested in the environment. Out of the ones who thrive, or at least survive, one is chosen to be the candidate for the next stage. Given r 0 ∈ R n {\displaystyle r_{0}\in R_{n}} , we define the sequence r 0 , r 1 , r 2 , … {\displaystyle r_{0},r_{1},r_{2},\ldots } by r i + 1 = Mut ⁡ ( f , r i , s , t ) {\displaystyle r_{i+1}=\operatorname {Mut} (f,r_{i},s,t)} . Thus r g {\displaystyle r_{g}\,} is a random variable representing what r 0 {\displaystyle r_{0}\,} has evolved to after g {\displaystyle g\,} generations. Let F {\displaystyle F\,} be a class of functions, R {\displaystyle R\,} be a class of representations, and D {\displaystyle D\,} a class of distributions on X {\displaystyle X\,} . We say that F {\displaystyle F\,} is evolvable by R {\displaystyle R\,} over D {\displaystyle D\,} if there exists polynomials p ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) {\displaystyle p(\cdot ,\cdot )} , s ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) {\displaystyle s(\cdot ,\cdot )} , t ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) {\displaystyle t(\cdot ,\cdot )} , and g ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) {\displaystyle g(\cdot ,\cdot )} such that for all n {\displaystyle n\,} and all ϵ > 0 {\displaystyle \epsilon >0\,} , for all ideal functions f ∈ F n {\displaystyle f\in F_{n}} and representations r 0 ∈ R n {\displaystyle r_{0}\in R_{n}} , with probability at least 1 − ϵ {\displaystyle 1-\epsilon \,} , Perf ⁡ ( f , r g ( n , 1 / ϵ ) ) ≥ 1 − ϵ , {\displaystyle \operatorname {Perf} (f,r_{g(n,1/\epsilon )})\geq 1-\epsilon ,} where the sizes of neighborhoods N ( r ) {\displaystyle N(r)\,} for r ∈ R n {\displaystyle r\in R_{n}\,} are at most p ( n , 1 / ϵ ) {\displaystyle p(n,1/\epsilon )\,} , the sample size is s ( n , 1 / ϵ ) {\displaystyle s(n,1/\epsilon )\,} , the tolerance is t ( 1 / n , ϵ ) {\displaystyle t(1/n,\epsilon )\,} , and the generation size is g ( n , 1 / ϵ ) {\displaystyle g(n,1/\epsilon )\,} . F {\displaystyle F\,} is evolvable over D {\displaystyle D\,} if it is evolvable by some R {\displaystyle R\,} over D {\displaystyle D\,} . F {\displaystyle F\,} is evolvable if it is evolvable over all distributions D {\displaystyle D\,} . Results The class of conjunctions and the class of disjunctions are evolvable over the uniform distribution for short conjunctions and disjunctions, respectively. The class of parity functions (which evaluate to the parity of the number of true literals in a given subset of literals) are not evolvable, even for the uniform distribution. Evolvability implies PAC learnability. References Valiant, L. G. (2006), Evolvability, ECCC TR06-120.
