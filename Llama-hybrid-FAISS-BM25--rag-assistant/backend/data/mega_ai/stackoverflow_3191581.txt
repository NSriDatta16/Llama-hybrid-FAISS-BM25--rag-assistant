Is the Cross Domain Fragment Identifier hack no longer working?

I see this referenced a lot: http://ajaxify.com/run/crossframe/ And I noticed now it's no longer working for the IFRAME (child) to change the parents hash. I've been spending a few hours trying various things wondering why this isn't working anymore -- then I finally realized that the example I originally based it on was down too. Can anybody confirm? - - I need to use a cross domain iframe to take care of an order upload form that our shopping cart doesn't support, and I need the form to return an order ID to the parent, so that I can associate the data between the two servers. Any recommendations or directions to head in would be appreciated. I'm not looking for a shortcut or somebody to do my work. I've been reading all day... I just need a nudge in the right direction. Thanks!
