Briefly, the naive mean model is guessing the average $y$ value no matter what the values of your predictor variables are. Longer answer: The goal of regression is to predict a conditional mean. In other words, for given values of the predictor variables, you might sometimes get 2.1, sometimes 1.9, sometimes 2.2, sometimes 1.8, etc, but, on average, you expect to get 2. Then 2 is your predicted value. The most naive way to do this prediction is to ignore the predictor variables and always guess the average value of your response variables. This results in high variance, and we use regression to tighten up our estimates. For instance, we expect adults to be taller than toddlers, so if we were to guess the height of an adult, we would want to account for the fact that they ought to be taller. By including this toddler/adult variable, we make fair comparisons to other adults instead of letting many 2-foot-tall toddlers stretch out the distribution and cause less precision in our estimate.
