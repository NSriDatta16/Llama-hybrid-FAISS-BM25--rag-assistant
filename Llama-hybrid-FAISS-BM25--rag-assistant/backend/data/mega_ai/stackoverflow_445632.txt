How to organize 800 forms?

My company is moving from classic asp (a nightmare) to .Net (rapidly becoming the same nightmare). We have over 800 forms, very similar in how they are processed, but 800 different sets of questions. They have common code: add to the database, get from the database, validate user inputs, validate credit card info, etc... We're using Visual Studio 2008. How would you organize these solutions/projects? Do we put them all in one solution?
