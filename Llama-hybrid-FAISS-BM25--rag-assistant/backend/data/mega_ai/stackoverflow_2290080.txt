The simplest approach (by quite a long way) would be to use the specified constructor to generate a random number with the right number of bits ( floor(log2 n) + 1 ), and then throw it away if it's greater than n. In the worst possible case (e.g. a number in the range [0, 2 n + 1) you'll throw away just under half the values you create, on average.
