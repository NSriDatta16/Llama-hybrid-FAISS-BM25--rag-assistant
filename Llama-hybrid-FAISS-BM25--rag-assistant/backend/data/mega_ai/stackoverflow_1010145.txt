I love good, clean code but in most cases, clean & elegant doesn't mean short and smart. Code brevity is good for competitions. Changing an "if not null" statement to a foreach might seem way cooler but it's harder for everyone else working in the project to understand what you are trying to accomplish. Believe me, even you won't remember it a few months later :P. Your code is just fine as it is!
