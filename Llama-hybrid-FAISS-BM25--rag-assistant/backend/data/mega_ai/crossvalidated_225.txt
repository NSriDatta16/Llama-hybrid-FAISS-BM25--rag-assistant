Why is the average of the highest value from 100 draws from a normal distribution different from the 98th percentile of the normal distribution?

Why is the average of the highest value from 100 draws from a normal distribution different from the 98% percentile of the normal distribution? It seems that by definition that they should be the same. But... Code in R: NSIM I imagine that I'm misunderstanding something about what the maximum of a 100 draws from the normal distribution should be. As is demonstrated by an unexpectedly asymetrical distribution of maximum values.
