You cannot get around marking every language section with a class and font if you want this to work cross-browser. It cannot be done with only CSS. You can apply a language class manually or automatically. Manually might be a lot of work to support and maintain, but is robust. Dynamically it can be done using a back-end script or Javascript, by scanning a string for characters that fall within certain unicode character blocks, and applying a language class accordingly. You can find the block definitions here (Japanese is Hiragana and Katakana): http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/index.htm I'd recommend the back-end way of doing this, because changing a font on the page might cause flickering or shifting of elements during page load.
