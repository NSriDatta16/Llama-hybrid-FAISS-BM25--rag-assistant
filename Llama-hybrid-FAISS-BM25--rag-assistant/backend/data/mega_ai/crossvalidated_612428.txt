A quick and dirty solution is to apply the inverse transform sampling in which the quantile function is computed via numerical inversion. Below is an R implementation along with an example. # (your density) myf $double.eps, upper = 1-.Machine$ double.eps)$root } # get some uniform draws u Surely there are less dirty solutions, i.e. more computationally efficient methods to handle this problem, one of these is suggested by Galen in the comments. Many other methods can be found in these three outstanding books: Monte Carlo Statistical Methods by Robert and Casella, Springer; Computational Statistics by Givens and Hoeting, Wiley; Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation by Devroye.
