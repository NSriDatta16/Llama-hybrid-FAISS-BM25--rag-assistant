Probably the most powerful Bayesian package presently available in R is the RStan package (which has a whole website here ). This pacakage uses a powerful method of MCMC integration called Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo, and a variant called the NUTS sampler (see here ). The package requires you to learn some syntax for model specification, but it is relatively simple to use, is very powerful, and gives information on convergence of MCMC chains for fitting the models.
