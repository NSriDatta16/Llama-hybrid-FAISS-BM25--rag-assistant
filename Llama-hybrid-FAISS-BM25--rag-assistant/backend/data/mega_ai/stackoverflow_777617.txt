Calculate broadcast address from ip and subnet mask

I want to calculate the broadcast address for: IP: 192.168.3.1 Subnet: 255.255.255.0 = 192.168.3.255 in C. I know the way (doing fancy bitwise OR's between the inversed IP and subnet), but my problem is I come from the green fields of MacOSX Cocoa programing. I looked into the source of ipcal, but wasn't able to integrate it into my code base. There must be a simple ten lines of code somewhere on the internet, I just can't find it. Could someone point me to a short code example of how to do it in C?
