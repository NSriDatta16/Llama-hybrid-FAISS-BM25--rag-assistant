I can't imagine why someone would do this either. Then again, I'm not much of an artist. ;-) The images almost certainly serve no useful function, and you're right about increasing the size of the HTML files per download (although, the amount by which you increase the size is probably negligible with the ubiquity of high-speed connections today). I'm also not sure it can properly be labeled a "fad"â€”I haven't seen this nearly often as other social fads like crocs and iPods . There's no way this would deter people from ripping off HTML and site designs. If you have no conscience that stops you from blatantly ripping off people's designs and source, you'll have absolutely no reason not to yank out the giant comment block at the top, whether it has a pretty design or not. It's probably best to think of this like an "easter egg" in a traditional software program. Relatively few people are likely to see it (the average person rarely looks at a page's source code), but it's the programmer's way of leaving their individual mark on their work.
