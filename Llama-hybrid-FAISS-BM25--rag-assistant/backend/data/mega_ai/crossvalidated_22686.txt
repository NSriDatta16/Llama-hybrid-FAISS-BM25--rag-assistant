The time you have to wait till the next one is a geometric variable $X\sim\mathcal{G}(p)$ with probability parameter $p$, i.e. $$ \mathbb{P}(X=k) = (1-p)^k p \quad k=0,1,2,\ldots $$ Fitting your distribution to the data presumably means estimating $p$ by $\hat p$ and using the pluggin distribution $\mathcal{G}(\hat p)$ for all purposes. If you do not want to run a Bayesian analysis (with prior $\pi(p)=1/\sqrt{p(1-p)}$), estimating $p$ from your proportion of $1$'s along the Bernoulli sequence is indeed an unbiased estimator.
