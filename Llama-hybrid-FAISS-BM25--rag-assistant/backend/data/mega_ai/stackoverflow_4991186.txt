No, not really, even if you use views to partially or completely reduce query size your execution plan will still look the same in the end (and execute just as fast/slow). If you have to traverse 5 joins then you have to traverse 5 joins, the only cure is "shorting" the model by introducing links between say merchant and activity or merchant and campaign. You can accomplish this by either introducing the M2M table between them (at the cost of manual maintenance), but I would not recommend it unless retrieval is really an issue. If this query is too slow you should check for existence of indexes on all join FK fields.
