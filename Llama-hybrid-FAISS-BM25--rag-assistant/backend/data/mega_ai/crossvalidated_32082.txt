I really don't get why the author says that the probability of relative risk of coronary heart disease being 1 could be vanishingly small basing his analysis solely on a Confidence Interval; this is plain wrong. To me, it looks like he's using a frequentist setting, but he is reasoning bayesianly (which is pretty common). The only thing linked to a C.I. are classical significance tests but, as we all know, if $H_0:$ { There is no link between second hand smoking and coronary heart disease }, they give you $p(D_e|H_0)$ (where $D_e$ denotes "data at least as extreme as what we observed"), not $p(H_0|D)$ (where $D$ is the data), which is what he claims, and what is linked exactly to what you point out; you have to incorporate prior knowledge about that particular link! This comes from the fact that: $$p(H_0|D)\propto p(D|H_0)p(H_0),$$ by Bayes Theorem, where $p(H_0)$ is the prior probability on $H_0$.
