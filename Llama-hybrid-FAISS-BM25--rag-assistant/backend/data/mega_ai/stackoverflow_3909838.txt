Working with multi-column sortable Items in jQuery

Here's my dilemma - I have a two-column list of elements (styled s) that I need to make sortable. With elements that live in one or the other column, this is easy - I just set up two columns, place my elements where they need to be initially, mark them as "sortable," and let jQuery do its magic. However, I have two elements in the list that need to span both columns. This, unfortunately, breaks the usability of the model. If I stick with my standard 2-column setup, I run into situations where the wide elements overlap or underlap with elements in the other column. I also tried iterating through both columns to reposition elements so there would be no overlap, but then I realized another issue: my second column (on the right) has no knowledge of the elements positioned in the first column (on the left). Here's a stripped down example of my markup: ... ... ... ... ... The way this should line up is something like this table: ------------------- | item 1 | item 4 | | item 2 | | item 3 | item 5 | ------------------- And each item can be dragged and dropped anywhere else, with items 1, 3, 4, 5 moving interchangeably between the two columns, and with item 2 moving up and down as necessary. Realistically, you should also be able to end up with something like this: ------------------- | item 1 | | | item 2 | | item 3 | item 5 | | item 4 | | ------------------- But with a standard column model (i.e. the stock jQuery examples, the only resources I can find from several days of Google searches, and every attempt I've made thus far) this won't work. So what can I do to implement this kind of layout with the jQuery UI Sortable plug-in so I can continue building my UI?
