Trying to calculate the Average of the non zero rows in a column in an RDLC

Is there any way to caculate the average of the non zero rows only for a column of data in a table in an RDLC for Microsoft report viewer? ie 0 0 0 5 5 = 5 not 2 I tried Count( fields.n.value > 0 ) to get the count of non zero rows, but it returned the count of all rows. Thanks! Eric-
