How to find out if a person likes some type of clothing?

Imagine, I want to build a more or less intelligent agent, which finds out, which clothing a person likes. Clothing has certain characteristics like type (shirt, T-shirt, pants, skirt etc.), color and style. Let's assume that first I want to find out, what types of clothing a person likes. For that purpose, I show to him or her several items of different types (i. e. several shirts, several T-shirts etc.) and ask him to tell me, if he or she likes that piece. At the end, I will have following information: Type of clothing Number of times a piece of clothing of that type was presented to a person Number of times the person liked a piece from that type From that information, I need to find out, if that person likes that type of clothing or not. How can I test the hypothesis like User X likes shirts apart from using cumulative binomial probabilities (see below) ? Are there other, better ways to do it? Binomial probability method At highschool I learned that such hypotheses can be tested using the Binomial probability . In order to test, whether the user like a particular type of clothing, I do following: Calculate the cumulative binomial probability. If cumulative binomial probability is higher than 50 % for a particular data set (number of times the user saw the picture, number of times she liked it), then I regard the hypothesis "User likes type of clothing X" as confirmed. If the probability is less than or equal to 50 %, then this result may have occured by accident. Example. Let's say I have shown 10 different shirts to a user. I assume that the success (user likes a particular shirt) is equal to 50 %. The table below shows different situations, which may occur - from when the user did not like any of the shirts to the one, where she liked all of them. The column "Bin. prob. > 50 %" shows whether in that particular situation I regard the hypothesis that the user likes shirts as confirmed. The cumulative binomial probabilities are calculated using Google Docs function =BINOMDIST(A2,10,0.5,TRUE) .
