NSView Not updating?

Im working on a drag n' drop view and found some handlers for drag and drop actions on the web. I want to make it so it turns blue when the user drags a file over the drag and drop area and gray again when they exit the drag and drop area. The issues is its not updating when you drag your mouse over it or exit it. Heres some of the code: - (void)drawRect:(NSRect)rect { NSRect bounds = [self bounds]; [[NSColor grayColor] set]; [NSBezierPath fillRect:bounds]; } - (NSDragOperation)draggingEntered:(id )sender { NSRect bounds = [self bounds]; [[NSColor blueColor] set]; [NSBezierPath fillRect:bounds]; return NSDragOperationCopy; } - (void)draggingExited:(id )sender { NSRect bounds = [self bounds]; [[NSColor grayColor] set]; [NSBezierPath fillRect:bounds]; } Thanks for any help.
