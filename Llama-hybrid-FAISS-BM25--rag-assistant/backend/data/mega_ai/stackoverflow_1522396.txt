Is there a holy grail solution for organizing classes? Maybe a different paradigm? No, that is a basic flaw of class based oop. It's subjective. Functional programming (Not to be confused with procedural programming) has less problems with this matter, mostly because the primary building blocks are much smaller. Classless oop also deals better, being a hybrid of oop and functional programming of sorts.
