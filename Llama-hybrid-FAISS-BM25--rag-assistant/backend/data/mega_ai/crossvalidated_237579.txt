Certainly not. Suppose you have a predictor $p$ with a coefficient estimate of $\hat{\beta}$ in your logistic regression. If you flip the sign on this predictor, i.e., include $-p$ instead of $p$ in the logistic regression, the estimated parameter will also flip signs to $-\hat{\beta}$. The signs of estimated coefficients depend on the encoding of the predictors. Whoever made that statement likely misunderstood something. If you want to make them happy, simply flip the signs on all regressors that have positive estimated coefficients. (Or better yet, educate them.)
