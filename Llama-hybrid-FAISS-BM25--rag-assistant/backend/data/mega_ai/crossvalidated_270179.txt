Since the hazard depends on the covariates, so does the survival function. The model assumes that the hazard function of an individual with covariate vector $x$ is $$ h(t;x) = h_0(t) e^{\beta'x}. $$ Hence, the cumulative hazard of this individual is $$ H(t;x) = \int_0^t h(u;x) du=\int_0^t h_0(u) e^{\beta'x} du = H_0(t)e^{\beta'x}, $$ where we may define $H_0(t)=\int_0^t h_0(u) du$ as the baseline cumulative hazard. The survival function for an individual with covariate vector $x$ is in turn $$ S(t;x) = e^{-H(t;x)}=e^{-H_0 e^{\beta'x}}=S_0(t)^{e^{\beta'x}} $$ where we define $S_0(t) = e^{-H_0(t)}$ as the baseline survival function. Given estimates $\hat\beta$ and $\hat S_0(t)$ of the regression coefficients and the baseline survival function, an estimate the survival function for an individual with covariate vector $x$ is given by $\hat S(t;x)=\hat S_0(t)^{e^{\hat\beta'x}}$ . To compute this in R you specify the value of your covariates in the newdata argument. For example if you want the survival function for individuals of age=70, do plot(survfit(fit, newdata=data.frame(age=70))) If you, as you do, omit the newdata argument, its default value equals the average values of the covariates in the sample (see ?survfit.coxph ). So what is shown in your graph is an estimate of $S_0(t)^{e^{\beta'\bar x}}$ .
