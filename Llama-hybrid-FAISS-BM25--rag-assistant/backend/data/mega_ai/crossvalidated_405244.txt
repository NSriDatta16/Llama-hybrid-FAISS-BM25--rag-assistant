TraMineR does not propose any aligning algorithm. It offers plenty of dissimilarity measures that can be used to compute pairwise distances between sequences as well as distances from each sequence to a reference sequence. The proposed methods include "aligning methods" that set the distance between two sequences as the cost of transforming one sequence into the other. This latter transformation can be seen as an aligning operation. You do not explain how you would identify the representative patterns or clusters from your aligned sequences. Probably you will first compute dissimilarities between aligned sequences, and then input the pairwise dissimilarities into a cluster algorithm. Since computing the dissimilarities does not require to first align all sequences, you could do the same with dissimilarities computed by means of TraMineR. I illustrate below with you small example data set and using the LCS distance based on the length of the longest common subsequence between the two considered sequences. First we define the sequence object and compute the matrix diss of pairwise dissimilarities. library(TraMineR) dat We observe that the greatest distance is between sequences 3 and 4 that differ by the greatest number (9) of elements (events). The closest sequences are 2 and 4 that differ by 3 elements only. Now, we can use the dissimilarity matrix to identify the smallest set of representative sequences (here the smallest set that covers 60 % of all sequences with a neighborhood radius equal to 40 % of the maximal distance) seqrep(seq, diss=diss, coverage=.6, pradius=.4) ## [>] number of objects (sum of weights): 5 ## [>] max. distance: 9 ## [>] neighborhood radius: 3.6 ## [>] 2 representative(s) selected, coverage=60% (threshold=60%) ## [>] 5 distinct sequence(s) ## [>] criterion: density ## [>] 5 sequence(s) in the original data set ## [>] 2 representative sequence(s) ## [>] overall quality: -1.85 ## ## Sequence ## [1] A-C-D-G-H ## [2] A-B-C-D-E-F-G The representative sequences are respectively the second and first sequences. We can also input the diss matrix into a clustering algorithm (here hclust ): clust
