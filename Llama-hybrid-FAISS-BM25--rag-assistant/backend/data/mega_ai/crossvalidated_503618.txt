Does Excess Kurtosis Signal Non-Ergodicity?

I have been reading a lot about ergodicity and the main principle behind it seems pretty simple actually. Based on my understanding, something is ergodic if the time average and the ensemble average are the same, or in other words. This definition of it makes me think of kurtosis. Specifically in that, one could say a distribution is gaussian or normal, if the median (observed/time average) matches the mean(ensemble/calculated average) or the excess kurtosis is 0. Does this mean that, if a distribution has significant skew in either direction so that the mean and median are drastically different and there is a significant amount of excess or deficit kurtosis, the distribution is non-ergodic? Is this a correct understanding of the idea, and how it relates to other statistical metrics (mainly kurtosis) that can be used to highlight how what we observe in the sample can be different than what the sample calculates?
