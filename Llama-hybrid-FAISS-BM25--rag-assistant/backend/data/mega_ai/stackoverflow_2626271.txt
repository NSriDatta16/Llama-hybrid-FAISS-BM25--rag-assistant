SO what RDF database do i use for product attribute situation initially i thought about using EAV?

i have a similar issue as espoused in How to design a product table for many kinds of product where each product has many parameters i am convinced to use RDF now. only because of one of the comments made by Bill Karwin in the answer to the above issue but i already have a database in mysql and the code is in php. 1) So what RDF database should I use? 2) do i combine the approach? meaning i have a class table inheritance in the mysql database and just the weird product attributes in the RDF? I dont think i should move everything to a RDF database since it is only just products and the wide array of possible attributes and value that is giving me the problem. 3) what php resources, articles should i look at that will help me better in the creation of this? 4) more articles or resources that helps me to better understand RDF in the context of the above challenge of building something that will better hold all sorts of products' attributes and values will be greatly appreciated. i tend to work better when i have a conceptual understanding of what is going on. Do bear in mind i am a complete novice to this and my knowledge of programming and database is average at best.
