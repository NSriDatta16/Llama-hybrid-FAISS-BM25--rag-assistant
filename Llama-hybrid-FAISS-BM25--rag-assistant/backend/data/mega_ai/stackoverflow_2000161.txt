Combo box slows down Flex

I did the following code. I know it's horribly written, but it's only a box with two combo boxes and a textinput bellow being added to a VBox, whose id is "garage". The problem, is that, however I do it, when I open the combo box the program slows down so much it's unbearable to use it any longer. I'd like to know if you have any idea on what's behind the ComboBox and the possible causes for this "slowing down" when I open the ComboBox... Perhaps the rendering or something? Anything to try or to look for will be we welcome thanks.
