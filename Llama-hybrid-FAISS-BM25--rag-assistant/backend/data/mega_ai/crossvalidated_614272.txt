Here's a very good overview and full proof In the more general case, note that the sample mean is not the same as the population mean. One's sample observations are naturally going to be closer on average to the sample mean than the population mean, resulting in the average $(x−\bar{x})^2$ value underestimating the average $(x−μ)^2$ value. Thus, $s^2_{biased}$ generally underestimates $σ^2$ with the difference between the two more pronounced when the sample size is small.
