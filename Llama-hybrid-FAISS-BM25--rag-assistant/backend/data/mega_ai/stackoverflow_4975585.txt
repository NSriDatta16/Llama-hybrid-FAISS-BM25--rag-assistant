How can I read user input to an array in VB.NET?

OK, so I am trying to make a program using Visual Basic that will allow the user to add links to web pages (such as www.google.ca ) to a list in the program and make it so that they do not dissapear once the program is closed. So to get into more detail, I have a text box, a listview, and a button. When the user types a link into the text box it needs to be put into an array (called "addlink") and then when the user presses the button, the link is typed into the listview as an object. Then if the user clicks on that object in the listview, it will open up the browser using the WebBrowser command. How do I set the text in the textbox to an array once the button is clicked? This program greatly resembles most Internet browser's bookmarking feature. :D Specifications: OS: Windows 7 Ultimate Edition Software: Microsoft Visual Basic 2010 Express Experience with Visual Basic: Average
