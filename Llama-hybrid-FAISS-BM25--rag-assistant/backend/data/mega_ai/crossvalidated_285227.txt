Just use the metadata features as features for the SVM. Typically the features that you feed into the SVM would be the $n \times k$ document-term matrix $\mathbf{T}$. You also have the $n \times j$ matrix of metadata features $\mathbf{M}$ (not including the category). So you want to give your SVM algorithm the combined $n \times (k + j)$ matrix $$ \left( \array{\mathbf{T} & \mathbf{M}} \right)$$
