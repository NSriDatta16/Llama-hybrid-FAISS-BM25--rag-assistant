I think if you can leverage the graph traversal algorithms, it is worth using the Boost Graph. Creating and using custom vertices is pretty easy. The examples included with BGL were useful for learning how to use it. I agree with Clifford, I've used GraphViz to help visualize the graph during development and found it very useful.
