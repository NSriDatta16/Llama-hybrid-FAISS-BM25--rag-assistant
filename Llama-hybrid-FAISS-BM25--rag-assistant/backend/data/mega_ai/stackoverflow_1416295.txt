As Robert stated there is no specific event associated with 'X', but you basically have two options which can be used to solve your probelm. (i) Form Closing - This event occurs when you click the 'X', but before closing the form. So you can use this event handler to do some stuff just before closing the form. For example, you can stop the form from being closed / destroyed by using e.Cancel(); (ii) Form Closed - This event occurs when the form is closed. Regards
