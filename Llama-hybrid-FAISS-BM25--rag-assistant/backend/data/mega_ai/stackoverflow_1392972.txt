SimpleDB as Denormalized DB

In an environment where you have a relational database which handles all business transactions is it a good idea to utilise SimpleDB for all data queries to have faster and more lightweight search? So the master data storage would be a relational DB which is "replicated"/"transformed" into SimpleDB to provide very fast read only queries since no JOINS and complicated subselects are needed.
