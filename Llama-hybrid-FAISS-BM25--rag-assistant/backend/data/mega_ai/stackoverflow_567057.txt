I think it's important to point out the the people who answered mentioning "toString" notice the lowercase "t" are generally talking about Java, and the people who answered mentioning "ToString" are generally referring to C#. Of course, this doesn't apply to all of the responses. In my own observation (I use both daily), programmers in C# are encouraged to override "ToString" to display a useful textual representation. Whereas, in Java, I don't see this nearly as much. In fact, I rarely see this. -JP
