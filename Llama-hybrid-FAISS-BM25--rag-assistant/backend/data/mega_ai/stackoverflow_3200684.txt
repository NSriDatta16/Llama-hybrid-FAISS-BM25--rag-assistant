zipimport should work just fine for you -- I'm not familiar with Python for Delphi, but I doubt it disables that functionality (an embedding application can do that, but it's an unusual choice). Just remember that what you can zip up and import directly are the Python-coded modules (or just their corresponding .pyc or .pyo byte codes) -- DLLs (even if renamed as .pyd s;-) need to be on disk to be loaded (so if you have a zipfile with them it will need to be unzipped at the start of the app, e.g. into a temporary directory). Moreover, you don't even need to zip up all modules, just those you actually need (by transitive closure) -- and you can easily find out exactly which modules those are, with the modulefinder module of the standard Python library. The example on the documentation page I just pointed to should clarify things. Happy zipping!
