Interesting question. I'd think your way is reasonable though I'm curious to see if someone can suggest a better way. In particular whether there is a way to relax the assumption behind the choice of a sigmoid functional form. One similar problem that comes to mind is the kernel density estimates in probability distributions that remove the need to assume a particular functional form. One other question I might ask is whether the red, black and blue points are truly * independent* simulation outputs? Or is one derivable from the others. Also in case there is a mismatch between the transition point suggested by each of those metrics what would be a good selection strategy? An average?
