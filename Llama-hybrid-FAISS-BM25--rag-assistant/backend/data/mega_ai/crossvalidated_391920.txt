It is indeed incorrect in that the EM algorithm usually operates outside the Bayesian paradigm and hence posterior probabilities are not defined there. What is correct is that the E step for mixtures is equivalent to computing the conditional probability of an allocation of observation $i$ to component $j$ : $$\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{I}_j(Z_i)|X_i=x_i,\theta]=\mathbb{P}(Z_i=j|X_i=x_i,\theta)=\dfrac{p_j f(x_i|\theta_j)}{\sum_\nu p_\nu f(x_i|\theta_\nu)}$$ This probability is both conditional on $X_i=x_i$ and on the value of the parameter $\theta$ . The posterior probability that $Z_i=j$ would be conditional on the sample $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ only, integrating $\theta$ out.
