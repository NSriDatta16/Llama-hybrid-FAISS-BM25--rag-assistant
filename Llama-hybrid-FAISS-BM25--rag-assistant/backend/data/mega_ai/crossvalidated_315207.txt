Visualizing duration (time) estimates

Question: What is the best way to visualize time estimates? Which graph type should one choose? I have time estimates how long did it take different people to finish the same task. An estimate might be 16 units of time as well as a rough estimate 15 to 20 units of time. I can assume that the values will be positive integers ranging from 1 to 50 and there are 50 datapoints in total. Example data might look like: person 1: 7 time units person 2: 1 to 3 time units person 3: 42 time units ... What is the best way to visualize such data? One possible solution would be to take averages of the time intervals (rough estimates) but is there a smarter way of visualization? A am a programmer so I do not care about the input format. Also I do not have a preference what software should be used, although open-source is a plus. I would go with Python, R, Gnuplot or LibreOffice Calc, but I do not know which type of graph to choose. Edit: The goal is to see how much time did the task took on average and what was the distribution. Sorry for possibly wrong question, but I am new to plotting and statistics.
