Google WebToolkit + Google App Engine: is it really for free?

I'm considering to use google web toolkit to develop my web application. It is not clear if the service is completely free for web storage under 500 mb. Can I use google web toolkit to develop my own app, and use my own server for it ? Am I going to have some issues if I do this ? Could you give me some feedback ? Thanks
