Convert line-broken paragraphs into single paragraphs? (Folding text?)

I have searched everywhere for an answer to this, but I think I must not be using the right lingo... I have text like this: This text is actually just one paragraph, but every few words are broken to a new line, and that's annoying as hell, because I have to go to each line and fix it by hand... Then there's a second paragraph which does the same thing. I would like to convert that to: This text is actually just one paragraph, but every few words are broken to a new line, and that's annoying as hell, because I have to go to each line and fix it by hand... Then there's a second paragraph which does the same thing. I've tried as many regex techniques as I could think of in TextMate, and can't find any macros or commands to re-wrap the text... The text in question is a result of content editors on one of my sites pasting from Word... I think they may even type this way (holdover from typewriter days!).
