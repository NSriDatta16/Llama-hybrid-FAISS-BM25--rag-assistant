Judge by yesterday's weather. How long did it take last time? Are you trending longer or shorter? Each shop is different. Most agile shops need a lot less time, have drastically fewer defects, and quicker time to resolve them because of TDD. Even so, most agile shops have some measurable time spent with testing/QC. If this is the first test run for this application, then the answer is "lets see" followed by an attempt. It depends on how quick you can get questions answered, - how testable it is, - how many features/functions - how many defects are discovered, - how quickly issues are resolved, - how many times the code cycles through testing, and - how many times testing is blocked by bugs. There is no way to tell. You could call it 50% or 175% or more, and not be wrong. Why not make a rough guess and multiply by Pi? It won't be much worse than any other answer you can make up. You should ( must ) know how long it takes now and whether it's getting faster or slower, and whether the coverage is increasing or decreasing. With those three bits of information, you should be able to guess quite well.
