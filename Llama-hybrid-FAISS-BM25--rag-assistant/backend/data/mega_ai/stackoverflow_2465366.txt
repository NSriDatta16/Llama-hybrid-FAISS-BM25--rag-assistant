I don't think there is any great solution to this problem, I faced the same rebuffering issue implementing drag and drop since the controls had to be temporarily removed and then re-added in the new spot in the visual tree, causing the MediaElement to rebuffer. In case anyone else has this problem, my best workaround has been to use the VideoBrush on the actual controls with all the corresponding MediaElements being added to a hidden panel at the application-level. If the control temporarily leaves the visual tree (due to UI Virtualization or drag and drop) only the VideoBrush is removed and the actual MediaElement stays on the hidden panel, so no rebuffering occurs.
