Challenging question. Groups of feature variables are likely to show some deeper dependencies. You have a large search space and the optimal classifier is really difficult to find. The discriminative performance of your classifier is the only criterion that is useful in determining whether a subset of features predict your categorical outcome well. My suggestion is that you perform a parallel search for the most well-performing feature subsets in terms of classifier performance. On such approach is that by Siedlecki and Sklansky. They developed a promising genetic algorithm approach for walking through the feature space. You can use their approach to feature selection with for example neural networks - or random forest classifiers. Reference Siedlecki W., & Sklansky J. (1989).
