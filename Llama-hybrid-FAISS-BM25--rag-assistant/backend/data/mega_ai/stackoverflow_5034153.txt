SQL Server Tree Query

I need some help is MS SQL Server Query. Iâ€™m not much of a DBA. I have an application with an Organization Table which is made up of a parent-child relationship: CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Organizations]( [OrgPK] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, [OrgParentFK] [int] NULL, [OrgName] [varchar](200) NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT [PK__Organizations] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED Sample data looks like this: OrgPK, OrgParentFK, OrgName 1, 0, Corporate 2, 1, Department A 3, 1, Department B 4, 2, Division 1 5, 2, Division 2 6, 3, Division 1 7, 6, Section 1 8, 6, Section 2 I'm trying to generate a query that returns an org path based on a given OrgPK. Example if given OrgPK = 7 the query would return 'Corporation/Department B/Division 1/Section 1' If give OrgPk = 5 the return string would be 'Corporation/Department A/Division 2' Thank you for your assistance.
