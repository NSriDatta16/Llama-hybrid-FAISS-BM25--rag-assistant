How to obtain p-values when using glmer - mixed model logistic regression GLMER?

I have performed a mixed model logistic regression using glmer and used afex::mixed to obtain the correct pvalues. mixed(model_9, data = ReversalTaskData, method = "PB", test_intercept = T, family = "binomial") but I receive this message Formula (the first argument) converted to formula. Numerical variables NOT centered on 0: Stimulation, Block If in interactions, interpretation of lower order (e.g., main) effects difficult. I was wondering if lmertest can be used as well obtain p-values in case of logistic (thus, non-linear) mixed model regression. do you have any other suggestion, otherwise?
