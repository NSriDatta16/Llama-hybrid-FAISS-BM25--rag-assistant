Pitfalls of using random forest/GBM on proportion data?

I have a set of data with a dependent variable which represents a proportion, and many of the samples contain a response of 1. I would like to build a random forest or GBM regression model on the data, with my main concern being the out of sample performance of E[y|x]. Are there any pitfalls to simply minimizing a squared error cost function over proportion data?
