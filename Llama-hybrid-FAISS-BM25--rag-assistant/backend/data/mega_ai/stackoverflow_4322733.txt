I'll admit, that article was a bit tl;dr for me. But I will say one of the easiest and most elegant ways I've seen to create finite state machines in C is from this post Here is a snippit #define FSM #define STATE(x) s_##x : #define NEXTSTATE(x) goto s_##x FSM { STATE(x) { ... NEXTSTATE(y); } STATE(y) { ... if (x == 0) NEXTSTATE(y); else NEXTSTATE(x); } } Some people may balk at the use of goto in any circumstance, but I think this is one implementation which really uses it quite beautifully. So to answer your question, yes, not only do I believe that function pointers may be overkill for a FSM, but it also tends to obfuscate the code.
