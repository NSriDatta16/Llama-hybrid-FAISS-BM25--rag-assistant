Is it possible to build a neural network without a target?

I have a dataset that describes the performances of a car depending on three parameters. Let me call for simplicity the three parameters $A$ , $B$ and $Z$ , and a performance index $l$ , which the lower the better. Each entry is made of a value for $A$ , $B$ , $Z$ and $l$ . I would like to build a neural network that takes as inputs $A$ , $B$ and outputs the best $Z$ , i.e. the one that would have the lowest $l$ . I thought that I could use $l$ as a loss function but I do not have a target $\hat{Z}$ and I do not kown how to proceed. Is it possible to build a neural network like this, or the only way is to compute $\hat{Z}$ in a separate way? I would appreciate also suggestions that make use of other machine learning techniques to compute $Z$ or $\hat{Z}$ , thank you.
