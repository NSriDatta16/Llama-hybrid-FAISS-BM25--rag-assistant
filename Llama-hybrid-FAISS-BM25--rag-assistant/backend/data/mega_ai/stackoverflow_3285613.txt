Although you likely have already researched this, I personally would discourage the use of Django on App Engine. You have to use App Engine's database api, so you can't use Django's awesome ORM. App Engine queries are fairly limited (at least last I looked), as in you can only return a limited number of records for any query, and you can't do much in terms of full text search, or things like LIKE %query%. You're very locked into App Engine. While it is a great system, you never know what you'll want in the future. Though I haven't done actual benchmarks, the overhead should be minimal. You'll just be using Django's URL routing, view system and template engine. If you insist on using App Engine and you like Django's "Model-Template-View" system, I say go for it.
