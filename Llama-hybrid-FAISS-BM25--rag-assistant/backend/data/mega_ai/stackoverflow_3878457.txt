confusion: xauth or oauth or my own auth?

i'm logged in to a.com now i'm on b.com b.com accesses my localstorage and sees that i'm logged in to a.com and asks me if i want to download my pictures from a.com 1- what if i don't want b.com to know that i have all those accounts on my local storage? 2- if a.com specifies the sites that can see the token how the hell a.com supposed to know, what sites their users will go to? 3- what prevents b.com not authorizing itself without asking me (it already has access to whatever token is stored by a.com), if my token is only a weak one, - what's the use of it except letting b.com know that i'm logged into a.com? - if no authorization can occur with this token how can xauth can be compared to oauth. Because with oauth i have to go back to a.com and specify that i want b.com to access my photos and post to my wall but it can not send me emails. where and when does this interaction occur with xauth? 4- do you think that oauth and xauth are crappy interim solutions that will be replaced by something totally new or do you think o/xauth 10.0 will be THE solution for connected web? 5- what would be your suggestion to a.com to give access to b.com - invest time and do o/xauth, or just write a function that produces two tokens and be done with it? Thanks. ps: i'd really appreciate answers from people who have implemented one or both of these solutions.
