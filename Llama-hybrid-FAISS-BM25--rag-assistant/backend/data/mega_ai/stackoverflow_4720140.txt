Using new Layout Handle globally, defined in Mage_Page, of Magento

Dear Experts, I am mentioning what all I have done so far in one of my projects using Magento version 1.4.2, but PLEASE correct me if any of my process seems wrong. I will be more than grateful to you all. I have got some very different look for my product page, so much so that it may not be wise to use the default available page layout handles. So I thought of using another layout handle " page_product_list " than the available ones (like " page_two_columns_left ", " page_two_columns_right "). For using it, I defined a block of XML in the file " config.xml " (located in the folder " /app/code/local/Mage/Page/etc/ "), just like the other layout handle blocks. The code for my custom layout handle is:- Product List Page page/product-list.phtml page_product_list So now what I want is to load this layout handle instead of the " page_two_columns_left " & " default " layout handles, whenever any user tries to see the details page of any Category. But it's not working. Can somebody please guide me as to what can be done in order to achieve this properly in Magento way?
