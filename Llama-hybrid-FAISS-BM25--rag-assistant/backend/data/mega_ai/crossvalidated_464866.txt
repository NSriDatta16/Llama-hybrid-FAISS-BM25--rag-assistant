I'm concerned there is a flaw in my code. Quick inspection led me to notice there appears to be no negative relationship of age shown in the plot (we would expect more darker blue regions where age is close to 0. Maybe someone with experience with this type of visual can advise on my implementation. About the true relationship: In the answer below I assume that your question relates to the apartments dataset from the DALEX package. Your dataset might be slightly different, but I guess that it will still work You are right that there is not much influence from the age when you fit with only a linear term. Note that the dataset is specifically generated to relate to the effect of Anscombe's quartet (It is artificial data). From the R documentation for the DALEX package: Structure of the dataset is copied from real dataset from PBImisc package, but they were generated in a way to mimic effect of Anscombe quartet for complex black box models. And the true relation is: $$\begin{array}{rcl} \text{price} &=& 5000 + 600 \cdot \underbrace{(\vert \text{year}-1965 \vert > 30)}_{\llap{\text{this is a logical variable}}\rlap{\text{ with values 0 or 1}}} \\ && - 10 \cdot \text{surface} - 100 \cdot \text{floor} - 50 \cdot n_{\text{rooms}} + 1.5 \cdot \text{district} \end{array}$$ So, while there is nearly zero correlation between price and age, there is still some some sort of quadratic relationship between price and age. When you fit a linear model with only a linear term for age then the coefficient will be close to zero. But with a quadratic term for age you should get some curved function. Examples of fits with different models Linear models $$\mathbf{\text{price} = a + b \cdot \text{surface} + c \cdot \text{year}}$$ $$\mathbf{\text{price} = a + b \cdot \text{surface} + c \cdot \text{year} + d \cdot \text{year}^2}$$ $$\mathbf{\text{price} = a + b \cdot \text{surface} + c \cdot (\vert\text{year} - 1965\vert > 30)}$$ Random forest model: Support Vector Regression
