Your first derivation is correct! Because we haven't observed "Starts" or "Moves", "Ignition" is independent of "Gas". What you are writing here is just the factorisation of the joint distribution, not how to compute a the probability of a specific node given a set of observations. What the Markov Blanket says, is that all information about a random variable in a Bayesian network is contained within this set of nodes (parents, children, and parents of children). That is, if we observe ALL OF THESE variables, then our node is independent of all other nodes within the network. For more information about dependency within a Bayesian network, look up the concept of D-separation .
