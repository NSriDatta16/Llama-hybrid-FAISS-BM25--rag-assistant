As far as I can tell, you can't start a drag with any view other than the one the drag was initiated on. For those that have access, take a look at the autoscroll WWDC 2010 project. They basically start a drag on the table cell's view and then allow you to drag that TableCell off the tableview. It works well and will probably be the route I'll be taking.
