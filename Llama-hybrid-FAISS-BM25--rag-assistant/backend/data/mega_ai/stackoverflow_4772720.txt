The answer is Yes. Having many ModelVisual3ds will be orders of magnitude slower than using a Model3DGroup My understanding is that ModelVisual3D is more akin to a UIElement , i.e. more of a heavy weight object. MSDN says about ModelVisual3d : "Provides services and properties that are common to all visual objects, including hit-testing, coordinate transformation, and bounding-box calculations." So if you wanted to 100 clickable 3d objects in your scene you would need 100 ModelVisual3d elements. Model3DGroup (along with GeometryModel3D ) on the other hand is a Model3D - the building blocks of 3d models. A single Model3D can appear as the content for several ModelVisual3Ds . Model3Ds are more lightweight than ModelVisual3D . If you wanted to construct 3d models from building blocks (like Lego), you could define several GeometryModel3Ds , then combine them together using a Model3dGroup . Yes, the class naming is horribly confusing, and I don't think the Daniel Lehenbauer sheds any light on the subject for the average human.
