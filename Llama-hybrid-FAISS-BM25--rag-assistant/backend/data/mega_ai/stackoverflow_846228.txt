I would agree with Rex M. You don't need to start from scratch. Leverage an open source product that is already available and build on it (if you even need too). The added benefit of that is from a collaborative perspective when you build some interesting functionality into your version of the software and then share that back with the community. Chances are if you need to build something and find it useful that other folks somewhere have close to the same needs and would welcome your features and enhancements. That's the beauty of open source.
