If you get NaNs there might be lots of reasons. But it is certainly part of the library, not of neural networks per se. One tip is to make sure that your input data does not contain extreme values. Thus, make sure to scale them either to have mean 0 and unit variance, or scale them between 0 and 1. If that does not solve your problem, contact the author of the library.
