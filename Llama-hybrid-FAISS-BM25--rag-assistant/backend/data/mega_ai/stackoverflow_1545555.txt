Is there some way to determine the client to my HTTP SOAP API currently?

I know that user agent can be faked easily when connecting through HTTP. I want to ensure access to my SOAP API only from iPhone devices. We don't know how many users will be using this when it is released but it might be a lot and we can't handle traffic from outside of the devices. Any other means to prevent this?
