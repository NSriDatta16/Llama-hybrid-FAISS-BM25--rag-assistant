I have almost the exact design as you and hit a similar issue (not sure about a crash, though!). If I remember correctly, even though the ValidationFault is a common class when the Fault travels over the wire the type is specific to the WCF interface. I think this is because of the namespace qualifiers on the web services (but this was a while back so I could be mistaken). It's not terribly elegant, but what I did was to manually re-throw the exceptions: try { DoStuff(); } catch (FaultException fe) { HandleFault(fe); throw; } ... private void HandleFault(FaultException fe) { throw new FaultException (fe.Detail as ValidationFault); }
