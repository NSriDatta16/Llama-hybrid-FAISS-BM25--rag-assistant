ExtJs4 + IE9 = Object doesn't support property or method 'createContextualFragment'

I'm working with ExtJs on IE9.. and i almost always get this error.. Microsoft JScript runtime error: Object doesn't support property or method 'createContextualFragment' What dose it means? What 'createContextualFragment' is needed for? And how to fix this?
