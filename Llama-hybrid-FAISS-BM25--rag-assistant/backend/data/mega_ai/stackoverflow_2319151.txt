I looked again at the example code in the jQTouch demo package and saw that they were adding a target="_blank" attribute to their email link. I did this to my link, and it began working (popping up the mail client window). However, the link that's in a standard web page works as well, but without the target="_blank" attribute... I'm puzzled, but adding that attribute seems to solve this problem if your mobile page is using jQTouch.
