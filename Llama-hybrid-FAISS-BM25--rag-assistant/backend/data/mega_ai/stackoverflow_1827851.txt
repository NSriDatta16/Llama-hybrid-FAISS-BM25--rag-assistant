css float problem

I have about 8 paragraphs which I would like to float left, but some of the paragraphs have more text than others. So when I view in a browser, I get the left to right floating that I want, but I get multiple short paragraphs in a column when some paragraphs are longer and some are shorter. What I want is for each new paragraph to be in a new column. Can I do this with css, or will I need to use a table structure? Sorry, I would show this visually but the inline html doesn't work quite as expected.
