Logistic regression with low event rate

I'm trying to build a logistic regression model to predict 90+ Days past due(DPD) events. The size of the database is 96000, with an event rate of 6%. We ran the entire data set through the info value process, and converted it into Weight of Evidence (WOE) bins. When I try to build the model using 60% of the data (for development data, the other 40% are held out for validation), the logistic regression model gives me 7 significant variables with a very high wald score for the intercept. Below, I give the results from the model: The overall model is significant (P ROC 0.84. The Hosmer and Lemeshow Test is significant (P The accuracy of this model is poor, and has a correct classification rate of 21%. Please tell me your views on this, specifically: . Are there any ways/methods that can help improve performance on the HL Test, since we need use the probability for the prediction? . Can I ignore a few good loans based on some business rules? . Is there a different methodology we should try? I'm fairly new to the credit risk modeling and looking forward for your view. Thank you in advance
