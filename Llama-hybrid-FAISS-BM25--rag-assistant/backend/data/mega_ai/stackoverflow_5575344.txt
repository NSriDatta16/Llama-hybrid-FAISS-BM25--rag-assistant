Designing a media server application

I'm looking into designing a media server application for a school project and was wondering what the best way to go about it would be. It's going to be n-tiered with the logic tier taking care of all the indexing, user authentication, file storage and the rest. Here are the options I've come up with so far... Java back-end, Adobe Flex front-end WCF service back-end, ASP.NET front-end C# back-end, Silverlight front-end I'm not sure if I'm going along the right path for a media server application. Do any of the options listed above seem fine or should I be looking into another technology?
