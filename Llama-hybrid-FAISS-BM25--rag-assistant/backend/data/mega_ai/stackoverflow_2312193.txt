Even though you say portability isn't an issue, you never know for certain what the future holds, so I'd encourage you to reconsider that position. For example, I was once asked to port an editor that was written (by someone else) from Unix to DOS. The original program wasn't expected to be ported and was written with Unix specific calls deeply embedded in the code. After reviewing the amount of work required, we abandoned the task as too time consuming. I have used exec calls in PHP; however, I had no other way to accomplish what I needed (I had to call another program written in another language with no other bridge between the languages). However, IMO, exec calls which aren't necessary are ugly. As others have said, they can also create security risks and slow your program down. As you said yourself, you need to document the exec calls well to be sure they'll be understood by programmers. Why create the extra work? Not just now but in the future, when any changes to the exec call will also need to be documented. Finally, I suggest you learn PHP and its functions a bit better. I'm not that good with PHP, but in just a matter of minutes with Google and php.net , I think I accomplished the same thing you gave as an example with: $search_results = preg_grep($search_string, file($file_name)); foreach ($search_results as $result) { echo $result . "\n"; } Yes, it's a bit more code, but not that much, and you can put it in a function if appropriate ... and I wouldn't be surprised if a PHP guru could shorten it.
