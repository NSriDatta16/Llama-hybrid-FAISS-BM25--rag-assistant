calculating R square for a logistic regression

can anyone help me with how to calculate R-squared for a logistic regression- How do I use the deviance for this Purpose ? Additionaly, the question in matlab: I am calculating a psychometric function using the "glmfit" function in matlab, with 'probit' parameter. It returns "dev" variable, and I do not understand how to calculate from this value the goodness of fit of the model - R-squared. Any advice?
