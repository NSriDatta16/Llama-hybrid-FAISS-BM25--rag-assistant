I'm not sure if there is a "best" solution, whether or not you store the images in the database is a tradeoff. Storing images on the server's filesystem and keeping the file's path information in the database will keep your DB smaller, but it will also add one more folder/location that you need to keep backed up and can provide security problems (if the image storage folder is not properly secured, it can be easier for an attacker to pull images off of a filesystem than extract them out of a database).
