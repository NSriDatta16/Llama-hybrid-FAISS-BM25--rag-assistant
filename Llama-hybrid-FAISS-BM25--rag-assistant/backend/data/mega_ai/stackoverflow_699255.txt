Don't forget, when uploading files, that there are actually two directives you need to pay attention to in php.ini. One is upload_max_filesize, but the other is post_max_size. Generally, post_max_size should at least be equal to, and probably greater than, upload_max_filesize. You can't upload a file greater than post_max_size, regardless of what you set your upload_max_filesize. An AVI file won't match the mime types you have listed in your permitted array. After doing your $sizeOK and $typeOK checks, check to see what values they hold, and how your script handles those values. That might hold the key to the behavior of your script.
