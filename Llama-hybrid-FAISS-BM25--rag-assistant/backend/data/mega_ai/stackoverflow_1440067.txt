I would not use main methods in all classes for testing purposes too. First, to follow the separation of concerns rule (using and testing are different concerns) and because we have elegant solutions for testing. Second, and that hasn't been mentioned so far, if each and every class has a main method, it's pretty hard to find the 'real' entry point into the application. If I see a class with a main method, I expect that this will let me 'use' the class in its intended way. I don't expect, that this will start a test case (maybe with serious side effects). Ah, just a third aspect that comes to my mind: the main methods are always public, so user of your library is free to use these methods at any time, even from during execution of his own application. This can have terrible side-effects, especially in multi-threaded environments.
