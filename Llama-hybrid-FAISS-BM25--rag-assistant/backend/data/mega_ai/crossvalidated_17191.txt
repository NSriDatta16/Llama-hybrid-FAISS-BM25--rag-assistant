I am a Bayesian by inclination, but generally a frequentist in practice. The reason for this is usually that performing the full Bayesian analysis properly (rather than e.g. MAP solutions) for the types of problem I am interested in is tricky and computationally intensive. Often a full Bayesian analysis is required to really see the benefit of this approach over frequentist equivalents. For me, the trade-off is basically a choice between Bayesian methods that are conceptually elegant and easy to understand, but difficult to implement in practice and frequentist methods, which are conceptually awkward and subtle (try explaining how to interpret a hypothesis test accurately or why there isn't a 95% probability that the true value lies in a 95% confidence interval), but which are well suited to easily implemented "cookbook" solutions. Horses for courses.
