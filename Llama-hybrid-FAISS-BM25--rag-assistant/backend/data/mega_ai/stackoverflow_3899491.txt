PHP / MySQL Frameworks for a basic CRM System

Perhaps, using the word CRM is a bit of a misnomer, essentially, I'm looking for a fast and easy way to create a front-end so that others in my organization can utilize a MySQL database that I've created that manages lists of respondents to marketing research surveys. I would need to do the following through the proposed front-end: Update/Add/Remove contact information Add notes to a contact's "file" Import/Export data from/to csv My experience with PHP is not extensive so I would like something that is simple and straightforward (read: I'm not looking for something that tries to do everything or is over complicated). An answer to this question will be accepted if you can outline the reason(s) for your recommendation. Database Schema: Table 1: Contact Information ID, Name, address, email, etc... Table 2: Surveys Table 1 ID, Field 1,2,3,4,5 (Logicals 0/1) Table 3: Notes Table 1 ID, Date, Note, etc... Table 4: Select Survey Data Storage (Demos for easy survey sampling) Table 1 ID, Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4...etc
