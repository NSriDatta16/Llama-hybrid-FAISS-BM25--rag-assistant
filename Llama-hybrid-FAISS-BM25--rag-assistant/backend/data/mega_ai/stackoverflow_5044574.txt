How scalable is distributed Erlang?

Part A: Erlang has a lot of success stories about running concurrent agents e.g. the millions of simultaneous Facebook chats. That's millions of agents, but of course it's not millions of CPUs across a network. I'm having trouble finding metrics on how well Erlang scales when scaling is "horizontal" across a LAN/WAN. Let's assume that I have many (tens of thousands) physical nodes (running Erlang on Linux) that need to communicate and synchronize small infrequent amounts of data across the LAN/WAN. At what point will I have communications bottlenecks, not between agents, but between physical nodes? (Or will this just work, assuming a stable network?) Part B: I understand (as an Erlang newbie, meaning I could be totally wrong) that Erlang nodes attempt to all connect to and be aware of each other, resulting in an N^2 connection point-to-point network. Assuming that part A won't just work with N = 10K's, can Erlang be configured easily (using out-of-the-box config or trivial boilerplate, not writing a full implementation of grouping/routing algorithms myself) to cluster nodes into manageable groups and route system -wide messages through the cluster/group hierarchy?
