Can MAE be higher than MSE?

I am using Mean Absolute Value(MAE) and Mean Squared Error(MSE) as my evaluation parameters for the regression model. I am trying to predict the future values for time series model and have used CNN fro the same. However, my CNN model is giving very low values for MSE compared to MAE. On such example is MAE:0.04978915070122473, MSE:0.004155844765967494 I know for sure that MAE has to be always less than MSE since we are squaring the coefficients in MSE.
