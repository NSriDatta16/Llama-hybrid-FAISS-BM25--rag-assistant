TeamCity has an extensibility feature where you can output special commands to the console and the TeamCity agent will capture the commands and publish the results within TeamCity. If you get StatLight running on your desktop - do a regular console-run. Then do another run by giving it the "--teamcity" parameter. Notice the difference in the output? In TeamCity you can setup a Command Line Build Runner Command executable: " " Command parameters: "-x=%system.teamcity.build.checkoutDir%\PathToXap\SilverlightClient.Tests.xap --teamcity" Hope this helps.
