Bayesian Model Averaging: How to use in this example?

Let ${M_1, M_2}$ denote two competing forecasting models. With Bayesian model averaging we can get $p(y_{T+h}|y_{1:T}) = \sum_{j=1}^2p(y_{T+h}|y_{1:T},M_j)*p(M_j|y_{1:T})$ $1:T$ represents the training set and $h$ the h-ahead forecast of a out-of-sample set $N$ My problem is now to compute the j-th posterior model probalitites (PMP): $p(M_j|y_{1:T}) = \frac{p(y_{1:T}|M_j)*p(M_j)}{\sum_{l=1}^2p(y_{1:T}|M_l)*p(M_l)}$ Assuming equal prior weights the function reduces to $p(M_j|y_{1:T}) = \frac{p(y_{1:T}|M_j)}{\sum_{l=1}^2p(y_{1:T}|M_l)}$ My problem is now, that I dont know how to compute $p(y_{1:T}|M_j)$. I have the densities/histograms of the training-data (realized data) as well as from both models for the training-data. Is this enough to compute the above marginal likelihood for each model? Are there any useful approximations? Can I use maybe use BIC for the weights?
