If you are sure there is a pattern you could try machine learning techniques. But your data-set to set up and train the "machine" is quite small (only 10 each). Further more you need a prediction, so several algorithms will not work for you like clustering, classification, association mining. Neural networks would be such a kind of technique. It's an option you can actually try out. Unfortunately I'm no machine learning/data mining expert and can't tell you the way. For Java have a look at WEKA .
