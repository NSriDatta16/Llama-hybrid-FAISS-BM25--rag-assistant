If you are using the file:// protocol, you should note that TortoiseSVN doesn't support it : Although in theory it is possible to put a FSFS repository on a network share and have multiple users access it using file:// protocol, this is most definitely not recommended. In fact we would strongly discourage it, and do not support such use. One reason that TortoiseSVN doesn't want to support this scenario is that if one person upgrades their TortoiseSVN and someone they are working with doesn't, it can cause all kinds of problems.
