I suggest that it depends on what your factory is producing. There are certainly many examples of "cliche" code whose production can be automated, allowing the development teams to focus their creativity on the parts of the code that really take human intelligence. It is also important (and entirely possible!) to organize the constructed artifacts with call-backs or other extension points; again the key is to make sure that the developers are able to see that your work is supporting them, rather than displacing them. The above mean that you (and your teams) will be forced to do more up-front planning to achieve the coordination with a minimum of friction and "oh-we-forgot-that-we-also-need..." events. That will likely produce a bit of grumbling. However, if you do it right, you'll get to step up at some point and handle some external demand by tweaking the factory, with no interruption to their own work. At that point, more of them should begin to see you as an ally.
