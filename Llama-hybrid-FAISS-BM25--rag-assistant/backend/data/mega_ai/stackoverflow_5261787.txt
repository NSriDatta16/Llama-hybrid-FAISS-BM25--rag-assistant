It seems as though the key here us many documents (pdf, .docx etc.) . By many we can assume your data will grow large very quickly. You can use both approaches technically. You should consider that if you use database back-end for storage and your database backend is sql express you have size limits of the database to worry about. So you should probably use Sql Server Professional or Enterprise to avoid this. Also if you must use database, use a separate database than your main db. My recommendation is: 1. use the file system 2. only store links in the database to your files 3. backup the files on the filesystem regularly as well as your database 4. secure the directory you store the files in to prevent unauthorized read or download of files If database is used for storage it has the advantage that when you backup the db, you have everything backed up, so migrating data is easier, but the benefits of storing on the File system given your requirement outweigh such advantages.
