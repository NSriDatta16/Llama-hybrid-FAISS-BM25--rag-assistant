Here is a good discussion of this problem. PCA when the dimensionality is greater than the number of samples I would not add a bunch of random vectors to the data set, that will add a lot of noise, and your resulting PCA will not be the real principal components. If you have 2 million vectors, why not just do PCA on a subset (much larger than 20, larger that 200 as well) and plot the PCA transformation of the 20 original data points you want to plot?
