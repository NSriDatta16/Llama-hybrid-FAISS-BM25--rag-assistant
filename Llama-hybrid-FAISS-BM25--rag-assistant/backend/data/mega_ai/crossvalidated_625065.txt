Problems with GMM (Generalized Methods of Moments) in R

I am interested in performing an analysis using a GMM model for a panel dataset. I am conducting the analysis in R, using the pgmm package. My code is the following: GMM_results Now, my results are robust for autocorrelation: AR (1) signficant results and AR(1) not significant. But for the Sargan test for overidentification restrictions, I receive this: Sargan test: chisq(47) = 877.707 (p-value = In fact, this result remains unchanged, even when I switch to a system GMM (instead of difference GMM), if I change the effect to individual or if I perform onestep only. Also, if I include more or other instruments - my Sargan test is always significant. In my understanding, this means that the set of instruments is not valid. Is there any way I can change my code (e.g. including more lagged values) in order to change my Sargan value?
