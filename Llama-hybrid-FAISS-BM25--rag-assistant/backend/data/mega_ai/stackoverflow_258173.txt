Viewing selected columns

I'm doing .NET 3.5 programming in VB for a class. I have a .mdb database with 3 related tables, and a table adapter with some queries on it that look like this: SELECT PropertyID, Street, Unit, City, Zip, Type, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Area, MonthlyRent FROM tblProperties Then in a form i have a DataGridView. What i want to do is take the data that is returned from the query and display it in the DGV. However, when i do this, it displays all 35 columns in the database, not the 10 i selected (The ten are the only ones that have data in them however... so it's basically a table with a bunch of blank columns). My current, inelegant solution is to return the query to a DataTable, then iterate through the table's columns, deleting the one's i dont want. This is not robust, efficient, and does not like me delete the primary key column. My TA suggested trying to use an untyped databinding... he said this should display only the data I pull, but neither of us has been able to figure this out yet. Thank You! UPDATE I'm not sure what you mean by the .aspx/.aspx.vb pages, but this is the query code i have from the table adapter SELECT tblRent.PaymentID, tblTenant.TenantName, tblProperties.Street, tblProperties.Unit, tblProperties.City, tblRent.AmountPaid, tblRent.PaymentDate, tblTenant.Telephone FROM ((tblProperties INNER JOIN tblRent ON tblProperties.PropertyID = tblRent.PropertyID) INNER JOIN tblTenant ON tblProperties.PropertyID = tblTenant.PropertyID) and here is where i use it in code: Public Sub getRent() propView.DataSource = TblPropertiesTableAdapter.GetAllRentReceipts() propView.AutoResizeColumns(DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnsMode.AllCells) propView.ReadOnly = True End Sub propView is a DataGridView that does not have a DataSource selected at load
