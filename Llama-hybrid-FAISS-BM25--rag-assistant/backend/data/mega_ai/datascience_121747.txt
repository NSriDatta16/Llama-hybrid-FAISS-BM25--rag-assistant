There might be multiple reasons that might be the reason for overfitting some of which are: 1.) Scaling the data 2.) You have not mentioned which parameter values you have selected in the Tfidf vectorizer. Some of them might help to reduce overfitting. ngram_range and max_features are 2 which you can play around with. 3.) Make sure you are using fit_transform on the train set only and not on the test set for both tfidf and scaling. Use only transform for the test set. 4.) Try to tune the hyperparameters of other models such as RandomForest and SVC . 5.) Use other word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec , Glove or Fasttext as they capture the word context as well as opposed to just the word frequency (which is happening in the case of tfidf). 6.) Try different models. You are just testing 4-5 models when in fact there are so many classification models out there. Try as many as you can to see which one gives the best result. 7.) Last but not the least,increase the data size. Since you are down sampling the data (I don't know by how much), this also might be a factor in overfitting. Try to implement all of the above points and let me know whether results improve. Cheers!
