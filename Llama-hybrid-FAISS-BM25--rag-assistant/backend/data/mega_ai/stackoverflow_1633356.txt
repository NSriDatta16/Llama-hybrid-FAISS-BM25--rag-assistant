JSON sounds like a decent solution to what you're doing, given the client restriction requiring a flat file. If you use PHP's built-in jsonencode() and jsondecode() functions, you shouldn't have any trouble with paragraph-length data. You won't have the same query ability that you'd have with a relational database like MySQL, but if you only need so search and modify within a single file at a time, that would be pretty easy to do in PHP after using jsondecode() and some of PHP's array functions. To search through many files at once would be fairly challenging though, and I'd recommend a searchable database rather than flat files for something like that. To open files in PHP, check out the functions file_get_contents() and file_put_contents(). http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.file-put-contents.php All that said, unless you really need to use a flat file, the other posters are correct that a database would be a much more versatile approach. JSON and XML are used much more for transporting data than storing data these days. MySQL has a number of pre-built interfaces (like PHPMyAdmin) that allow you to search and modify the data without using SQL queries.
