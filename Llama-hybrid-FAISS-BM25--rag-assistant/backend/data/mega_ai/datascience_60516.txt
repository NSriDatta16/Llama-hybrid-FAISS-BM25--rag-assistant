Part of the confusion comes from different prediction processes used for training and serving. Softmax is used during training to make predictions for the 1 million video categories. The softmax makes the training of the neural networks gradients easier and works well within deep learning libraries. Those 1 million video categories also happen to be embedded into 256-dimensional space. During serving, prediction is now a nearest neighbor search. Nearest neighbor search is faster, since it is a dot product operation and can use general purpose libraries.
