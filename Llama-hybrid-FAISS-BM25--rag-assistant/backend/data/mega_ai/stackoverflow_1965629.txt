In terms of code organization: The differences are nil, as you can map subdomains to any directory. In terms of browser security: JavaScript access across subdomains is possible but has obstacles (see document.domain and consorts). I do not know of anything on the JavaScript side that is completely impossible when working with different sub-domains. Opinion: I personally tend towards directories and against subdomains for public addresses. The general public have become used to web addresses beginning with "www." and it creates unnecessary confusion to break this pattern. You will notice that very often people, when given a subdomain to type into the address bar, will automatically start typing in "www." and they will be surprised to learn that an address can be without. To me, the only good way to use subdomains is for internal purposes to facilitate, or prepare for, the use of different servers (e.g. static.example.com, images.example.com etc.)
