It's not clear from your question if the set of points is static and you need to find what points are above a given elevation many times, or if you only need to do the query once. The easiest solution is to just store the points in an array, sorted by elevation. Finding all points in a certain elevation range is just binary search, and you only need to sort once. If you only need to do the query once, just do a linear search through the array in the order you got it. Building a fancier data structure from the array is going to be O(n) anyway, so you won't get better results by complicating things. If you have some other requirements, like say you need to efficiently list all points inside some rectangle the user is viewing, or that points can be added or deleted at runtime, then a different data structure might be better. Presumably some sort of tree or grid. If all you care about is rendering, you can perform this very efficiently using graphics hardware, and there is no need to use a fancy data structure at all, you can just send triangles to the GPU and have it kill fragments above or below a certain elevation.
