Stop-Gap? Would it be possible to use the Windows Media Encoder as a compression method for the raw video Silverlight provides? After capture to ISO Storage , encode w/ WME and send to the server via the WebClient . Two big issues are: Requires a user to install the encoder WME will no longer be supported It seems like that might be a stop-gap solution until something better comes along. I haven't worked w/ WME before though so I don't know how feasible this would be. Thoughts?
