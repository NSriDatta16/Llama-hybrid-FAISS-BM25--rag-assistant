tion. "If you're just talking about the code, then there is not a big percentage that has been modified," Caselles-Dupré said. "But if you talk about working on the computer, making it work, there is a lot of effort there." Posts on the project's issue tracker show Obvious members requesting that Barrat provide them with support and custom features. On the same day that Edmond de Belamy was sold, Barrat posted two images of comparison between Edmond de Belamy and his "outputs from a neural network [he] trained and put online *over a year ago*" on Twitter, writing that they used his code only to later sell the results. Mario Klingemann wrote that "You could argue that probably 90 percent of the actual 'work' was done by [Barrat]." The piece has also been criticized for whether it is real "art" or not. Art critic Jonathan Jones did not acknowledge Edmond de Belamy as art. The piece has been placed within a tradition of works calling into question the basis of the modern art market. Research has used Edmond de Belamy to show how anthropomorphizing AI can affect allocations of responsibility and credit to artists. In an interview, Caselles-Dupré said: "We are in the middle of a storm and lots of false information is released with our name on it. In fact, we are really depressed about it." The "false information" that he was pointing to was that the painting was the first portrait that was generated by AI. The head of Christie's prints and multiples department said he is no expert on AI, having learned about Obvious after reading an article about a collector's purchase of one of Obvious's previous works for around €10,000. == References ==
