This is a DRM problem essentially. If you had some technique that you could put content on the web without having it redistributable, the music industry would love you. It is possible to try to prevent redistribution. One technique you could try is embedding a signature of some sort into the feed for each user who you require to sign up. If the content is found on the web, you can identify and ban the user who redistributed your content. This is avoidable too, by getting multiple accounts and normalizing the content to remove fingerprints. For the would-be pirate, this requires more effort than they may be willing to put in. Your signature could be a unique whitespace pattern, tiny variances in the timestamps on posts, misplaced pixels in videos, or any other thing you can vary slightly without end users noticing.
