If there are in principle absolute minimum and maximum limits then it may make sense to use those instead of the observed minimum and maximum, particularly if you wish to compare two or more datasets with similar flavour. There are several more or less obvious reservations here. If you don't know any such, you can't apply them. For example, in household data, the minimum number of children is clearly zero, but who knows what the maximum number is? One simple strategy is not to normalize at all in this circumstance. Advice to normalize data in this way seems immensely more common in machine learning circles than in mainstream statistics. It's not that people in the latter group are unaware of the difficulties of mixing variables with quite different magnitudes and units of measurement. Rather, the art lies in recognizing and tackling that otherwise. For example, in regression, coefficients will have different units and magnitudes if predictors do, but those coefficients typically can or should bear substantive interpretations. In principal component analysis, a mixture of variables implies using the correlation matrix as the basis for calculation (not that solves all the problems of comparing results from similar but different datasets).
