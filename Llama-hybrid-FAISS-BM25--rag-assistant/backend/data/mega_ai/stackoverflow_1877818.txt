Dragging links from the browser around seems to be a little magic. Apparently the browser only handles dragging a link into a folder where an appropriate shortcut will be created. Passing the link around as an argument doesn't seem to be possible. You can also notice this when dragging links into other applications. It won't work. So I'm afraid there is no way how you can accept dragged links from a browser window.
