What is the essential difference between a neural network and nonlinear regression?

Artificial neural networks are often (demeneangly) called "glorified regressions". The main difference between ANNs and multiple / multivariate linear regression is of course, that the ANN models nonlinear relationships. So what is the difference between an ANN and a multiple / multivariate nonlinear regression model? The only thing I can think of, is the graph-like structure of the neural network, that allows for an efficient parameter learning procedure (backpropagation), and other advantages (flexible stackering of layers in deep networks allowing for feature learning, etc). Can they be effectively called 'glorified nonlinear regressions'? Or is there more to it? EDIT: Found a good discussion on this here https://www.quora.com/Is-Machine-Learning-just-glorified-curve-fitting where essentially it is agreed that the differences are mostly nuiances, but the approach being similar. I understand that in that case, the answer is more of a subjective nature, and this question is not appropiate for stackexchange.
