Which language should I use for Artificial intelligence on web projects

I have to do one project for my thesis involving Artificial intelligence, collaborative filtering and machine learning methods. I only know PHP/mysq/JS, and there is not much AI stuff examples in PHP. There are some books on AI on internet but they use Java , Python. Now I have to apply AI techniques on web application. Which language should i choose java or python. I searhed on internet that I can call java classes inside my php so that can help as as I am very good at php I have also seen that python can also be used with php as well So which way should I go and roughly how much it will take me to learn java I have done java basics but that was 6 years ago
