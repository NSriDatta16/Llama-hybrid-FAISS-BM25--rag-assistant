UPDATED - I would suggest using the suggestion by Rune below rather than this option! I assume that you want something like the following spat out: Movie Game Book which you could do with an extension method something like the following: public static string DropdownEnum(this System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper helper, Enum values) { System.Text.StringBuilder sb = new System.Text.StringBuilder(); sb.Append(" "); string[] names = Enum.GetNames(values.GetType()); foreach(string name in names) { sb.Append(" "); sb.Append(name); sb.Append(" "); } sb.Append(" "); return sb.ToString(); } BUT things like this aren't localisable (i.e. it will be hard to translate into another language). Note: you need to call the static method with an instance of the Enumeration, i.e. Html.DropdownEnum(ItemTypes.Movie); There may be a more elegant way of doing this, but the above does work.
