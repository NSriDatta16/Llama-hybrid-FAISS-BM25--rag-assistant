How to use linear interpolation estimate current position between two Geo Coordinates?

I have the following available: last reported lat,lon w/timestamp target lat,lon estimated time to target heading How can I interpolate an estimated position over time? I know that's enough to calculate the required average velocity for the remainder of the trip. Given a straight-line distance, it's pretty trivial. I know it has to do with vectors but I'm a bit rusty and thought it better to consult some experts. The reason I need this update rate is limited, so to show smooth animation I need to guess at the current position between updates. The target platform is a Google Maps application so I have available some basic functionality like a Geo-correct function for distance between two coordinates. Language is unimportant as I know many and can port or adapt any examples if needed. General solutions would be preferred however. Is this simply two independent vector calculations? lat estimate = lat start + (Δ lat * P) lon estimate = lon start + (Δ lon * P) Where: t estimated = the reported estimated time to target t elapsed = time since last time estimate P = t elapsed / t estimated Δ lat = lat reported - lat target Δ lon = lon reported - lon target
