How to write a simple Ping method in Cocoa/Objective-C

I need to write a simple ping method in Cocoa/Objective-C. It also needs to work on the iPhone. I found an example that uses icmp , will this work on the iPhone? I'm leaning towards a solution using NSNetServices , is this a good idea? The method only needs to ping a few times and return the average and -1 if the host is down or unreachable.
