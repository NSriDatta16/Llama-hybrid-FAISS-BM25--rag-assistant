display icons (or content) on mouseover

In twitter, when you hover your mouse over a message a star and a reply icon appears on the right. Similarly, in facebook when you hover your mouse over to an update, the little 'hide' icon appears on the right also giving a little context menu. I want to have a similar approach in my project for drag & drop handles. What I can decide is the what the most efficient way is it to accomplish this goal. is it that everytime I hover the mouse onto a div with an id, do I just inject the html with .append() or similar? or do I show/hide the already existing html.. or is there a better way?
