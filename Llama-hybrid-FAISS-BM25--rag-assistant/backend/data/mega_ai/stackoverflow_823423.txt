First, the ID shouldn't be being used for anything anyway, so disregarding the incrementation is a good reminder. I would prefer to deal with the primary question, however, cnnceptually, everything else being equal. Is the user in fact establishing a different set of questions with their edits? Then save them as a new set. Or is the original set intended to retain its conceptual identity? Then update/delete/insert. Which seems to be more the case. In terms of securing the integrity of the question/answer set, I think of sessions having that responsibility. You should consider validating the question set against that associated with the session.
