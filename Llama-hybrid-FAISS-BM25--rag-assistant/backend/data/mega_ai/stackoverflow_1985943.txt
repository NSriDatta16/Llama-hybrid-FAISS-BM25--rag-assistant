Assuming from your answers that you do not have any compiler installed. In order to compile Delphi code you would need a compiler. There are no free versions available of Delphi anymore so unless you can find an old one you would have to buy Delphi. Delphi comes with a commandline compiler like gcc and can compile programs without an IDE. Delphi 2006 and before win32: dcc32 YourProject.dpr Delphi 2006 and before .Net: dccil YourProject.dpr Delphi 2007 and after: msbuild YourProject.dproj This will result in a compiled binary and in case of an EXE you can run it like you are used to. Robert Love explained perfectly how to write code to display a GUI without using the designer in the IDE. This will save you no money since you will have to buy the IDE anyway in order to get the commandline compiler. There are free alternatives to Delphi like FreePascal and their free IDE Lazarus . I haven't checked for myself but I am pretty sure it comes with a commandline compiler as well.
