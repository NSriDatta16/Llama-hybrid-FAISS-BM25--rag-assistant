Can I customize the Magento app/code/core folder without affecting future upgrades?

I found a guide on how to add new attributes to users, it explains that for this operation I must modify some files in the app / code / core / Mage directory (the directory that contains Magentoâ€™s modules). But if i make some changes in that folder will this affect future upgrades? Will an upgrade will delete my changes? Should I limit the changes only to my modules to not have problems with updates?
