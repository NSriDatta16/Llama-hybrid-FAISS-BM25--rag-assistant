Subject to the comments above about assumptions such as smoothness etc. You can do Bayesian nonparametric density estimation using mixture models with the Dirichlet process prior. The picture below shows the probability density contours recovered from MCMC estimation of a bivariate normal DP-mixture model for the 'old faithful' data. The points are coloured IIRC according to the clustering obtained on the last MCMC step. Teh 2010 provides some good background.
