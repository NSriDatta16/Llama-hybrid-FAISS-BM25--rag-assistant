perfect separation logistic regression

in continuity to the post stepwise logistic regression non significative variables(high p-values) and as demanded by matthew this is a post explaining the data i have and the problem in fact i have a data composed of 46274 values and 68 variables one y=(0=normal cell/1=abnormalcell) and 67 quantitative variables what i want is doing logistic regression y~ (other variables) but i have the following warnings gg=glm(y~.,data=datf,family=binomial()) Warning messages: 1: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge 2: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred and what surprises me is that all variables are significant according to summary in addition the accuracy of confusion matrix is equal to 0.99 Call: glm(formula = y ~ ., family = binomial(), data = datf) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -8.49 0.00 0.00 0.00 8.49 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.795e+16 4.304e+07 -417170033 then after doing stepwise regression all the variables(33 variables) of selected model were non significatives the warning messages persist and accuracy was equal to 1 Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 3.945e+04 3.178e+04 1.241 0.215 a1 -2.499e+02 1.938e+02 -1.289 0.197 p3 2.908e+01 2.391e+01 1.216 0.224 cont 1.279e+04 1.016e+04 1.259 0.208 h 5.125e+04 3.948e+04 1.298 0.194 c1 -2.490e+05 1.871e+05 -1.331 0.183 c2 -3.996e+02 2.989e+02 -1.337 0.181 c7 -5.221e+01 3.932e+01 -1.328 0.184 .... (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 6.4149e+04 on 46273 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 2.4470e-02 on 46240 degrees of freedom AIC: 68.024 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 25 what conclusion should i put or what correction should i do thanks a lot in advance for any help
