Using log4net as a logging mechanism for SSIS?

Does anyone know if it is possible to do logging in SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) via log4net? If so, any pointers and pitfalls to be aware of? How's the deployment story? I know the best solution to my problem is to not use SSIS. The reality is that as much as I hate this POS technology, the company I work with encourages the use of these apps instead of writing code. Meh.
