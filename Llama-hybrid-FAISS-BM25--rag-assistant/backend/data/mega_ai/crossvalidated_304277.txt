What to do if not all theoretically related variables are loaded highly on the same factors using EFA?

I'm using EFA to generate regression factor scores for subsequent regression and ANOVA analyses. I want to do use regression factor scores instead of averaging the scores, as I've read in multiple sources (for example; DiStefano et al., 2009) this is the better way. For this analysis I got 13 variables, which theoretically represent four constructs. When I run EFA (in SPSS) however, only three factors are created when following the eigenvalue>1 rule. Consequently, some variables are combined which theoretically are different ones. If I give SPSS the notion that I want four factors, there is still some mixing of certain variables. Which I guess is due to measurement error. I've read (Black et al., 2014 p126) that it's okay if it's slightly lower but some are (even after rotation) mixed. Now I'm wondering if it is (still) allowed to seperately run factor analyses for each contruct. My main purpuse being to (summarize) the scores of the variables into one main variable (so four variables, one for each contruct). Even without this mixing it is still a mystery for me if for this purpose the EFA should be run multiple times for each construct once to create regression factor scores (so you know which one is which and the correct factor is used to represent the correct factor), or all in once. For this I have to note that I'm aware of the following as stated by Black et al. (2014; p130) " The one key characteristic that differentiates a factor score from a summated scale is that the factor score is computed based on the factor loadings of all variables on the factor, whereas the summated scale is calculated by combining only selected variables. " On a side note: Two of these variables are DV and IV, and two are only IV. and I'm thinking of using Barlett's method to save the regression factor scores. So basically, these are the questions: In order to create regression factor scores, does for each construct (if theoretically known) need seperate EFA's (in spss) be run? What to do if variables from the same theoretical construct load on different factors? References: Hair, Black, Babin and Anderson (2014) Multivariate Data Analysis. 7th Edition.
