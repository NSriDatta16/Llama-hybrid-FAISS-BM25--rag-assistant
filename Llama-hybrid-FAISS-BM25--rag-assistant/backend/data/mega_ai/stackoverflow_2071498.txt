Storing and retrieving images with MVC and Sql Server

I am designing an prototyping an app the needs to store images, similar to facebook. This will be a public facing site and I am not sure how many users I will end up with but what I am looking for is a way to efficiently retrieve them. So far I am thinking of storing them in SQL Server varbinary columns. Is this a good idea? I have the upload code and the storage code for that. My concern is retrieving them. I can retireve and build the image tag on the fly but I am worried about having to hit the database for each one. I have been thinking about getting all images for a user and caching them in the asp.net cache for 10 to 30 seconds. I have never had to do something like this so I would be interested in hearing a few different approaches. Obviously the images can vary in size and I was thinking about defining a size limit, but I haven't gotten that far yet. Thanks for your help. Paul Speranza
