Where should I store an image selected on the iPhone?

I want to take a picture or select an existing picture from the users existing photos. What is the best way to do this? Specifically I am concerned where I should to store the image. The storage location should be private to the application. I need to be able to reuse the image as a background every time the application opens. Thanks!
