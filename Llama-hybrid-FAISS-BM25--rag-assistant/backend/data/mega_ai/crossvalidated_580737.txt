Visualization for univariate binary logistic regression with a categorical independent variable

I am performing a univariate logistic regression where the outcome is obviously 0 or 1, and the independent variable has 18 different levels. I am looking for a way to graph the results of this regression, but most visualizations seem to be based around the assumption that the outcome is numerical. Are there any common visualizations for this type of model that I am somehow missing in my searching?
