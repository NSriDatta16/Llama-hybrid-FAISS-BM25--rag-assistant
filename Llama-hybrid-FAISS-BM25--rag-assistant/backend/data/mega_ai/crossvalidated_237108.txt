For axial data, say $ \omega \in [0, \pi) $, it is common to compute $ \theta = 2 \omega $ so that $\theta \in [0, 2 \pi)$ is circular. Then, we can perform any analysis in the circular statistics toolbox. Finally, we may backtransform results if desired for interpretation. Therefore, little attention has gone into obtaining moments for axial data, or generating any analyses specifically for axial data, for that matter. Keeping the "doubling the arrows" approach, we could compute the first moment of $ \theta = 2 \omega $ by first finding $ E( e^{i 2 \omega} ).$ If we take the argument of that moment, and halve it, we will have a first moment for our axial data, where the argument is the mean direction and the modulus is the resultant length.
