What does it mean when your adjusted odds ratio is higher than your unadjusted odds ratio (logistic regression)?

My adjusted OR for my variable of interest from my multivariate logistic regression is around 3.20. My unadjusted OR from my univariate logistic regression for my variable of interest is 2.75. This is almost a 20% increase. Does this mean there is confounding? If so, how do I proceed? Do I have to rebuild the model, making sure that my adjusted OR is not greater than 10%? Do I look for interaction terms?
