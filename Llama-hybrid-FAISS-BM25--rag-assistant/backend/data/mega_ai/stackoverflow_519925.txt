Deserialize a byte array to a struct

I get a transmission over the network that's an array of chars/bytes. It contains a header and some data. I'd like to map the header onto a struct. Here's an example: #pragma pack(1) struct Header { unsigned short bodyLength; int msgID; unsigned short someOtherValue; unsigned short protocolVersion; }; int main() { boost::array msgBuffer; Header header; for(int x = 0; x Will this always work assuming the structure never contains any variable length fields? Is there a platform independent / idiomatic way of doing this? Note: I have seen quite a few libraries on the internet that let you serialize/deserialize, but I get the impression that they can only deserialize something if it has ben previously serialized with the same library. Well, I have no control over the format of the transmission. I'm definitely going to get a byte/char array where all the values just follow upon each other.
