Measuring code reusability

I am trying to measure how much of the code produced in our organisation is actually reusable and I'd like to set some guidelines. I'd like to have some reference to outer world: How much code is typically reused in a single application ? More specifically - if we consider all the code of a complete end-user product (and eventually exclude 3rd party libraries), how many functions and methods are called from more than one place ? What metrics are used to measure code reusability ? Are there any available numbers or studies for opensource and/or closed source software ?
