Try this web site, http://www.quarkruby.com/2007/10/21/sessions-and-cookies-in-ruby-on-rails . It appears to have a pretty comprehensive coverage of the subject. One suggestion that I would have would be to not only use SSL but also encrypt and encode (Base 64) the session and other cookies that you send. Include a nonce (random value) with the session id so that the encrypted/encoded version changes every time you send it. If you are genuinely concerned about the session being hijacked you could also regenerate the session id periodically to limit the exposure of a hijacked cookie, although encrypting it should protected you if the cookies aren't persistent. You should be able to use the encryption/encoding idea even if you use query parameters for the session id instead of cookies.
