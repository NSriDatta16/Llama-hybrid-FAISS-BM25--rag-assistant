I think you need a server or a PC with a large amount of RAM in order to handle your dataset. There are companies, such as Amazon, that sells online server accounts. As for a model/algorithm, a good starting point might be the Random Forests (RF) algorithm (see the original paper here http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1010933404324 , for me it's free of charge). You can find an implementation of RF on the randomForest package of R. Hope this helps.
