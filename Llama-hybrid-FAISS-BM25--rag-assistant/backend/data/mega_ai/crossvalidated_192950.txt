Resources for understanding Gaussian processes

I want to learn about Gaussian processes (I have a special interest in Gaussian processes for classification). Do you know some resources / references from which I can learn (aside of the "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning" book )? I have a basic knowledge of calculus and probability.
