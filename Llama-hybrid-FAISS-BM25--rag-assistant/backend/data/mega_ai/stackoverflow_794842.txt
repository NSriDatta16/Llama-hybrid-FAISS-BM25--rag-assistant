The phrase "multipart/form-data" was something that I had missed completely. When I Google'd that phrase, I found my answer. Something similar to this example below is how I solved my problem from a perl script: use HTTP::Request::Common; use LWP::UserAgent; $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $response = $ua->request( POST 'http://machine1/cgi-bin/myscript.pl', Content_Type => 'form-data', Content => [ uploadthis => ["C:\myfile.txt"], ] ); if ($response->is_success) { print "Success."; } else { print "Failure."; }
