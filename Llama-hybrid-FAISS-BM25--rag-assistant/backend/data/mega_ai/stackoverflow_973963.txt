For software performance it's easier if all opcodes are the same length, so you can have one gigantic switch statement and not have to examine various option bits that might have been set by preceding modifier opcodes. Two matters that I think you didn't ask about are ease of writing compilers that translate programming languages to your VM code and ease of writing interpreters that execute your VM code. Both of these are easier with fewer opcodes. (But not too few. For example if you omit a divide opcode then you get an opportunity to learn how to code good division functions. Good ones are far harder than simple ones.)
