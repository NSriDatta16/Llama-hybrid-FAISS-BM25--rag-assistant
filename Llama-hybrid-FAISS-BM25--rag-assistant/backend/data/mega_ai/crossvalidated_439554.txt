An easy way to do this would be to take the pre-season projections use them to create the prior. For instance, you say that one team is projected to win 41 of 82 games. Thus, your prior for the proportion of games won, $\theta$ for that team could be $$\theta \sim \operatorname{Beta}(\alpha, \beta) = \operatorname{Beta}(41,41)$$ Note here that $\alpha$ is the number of games won and $\beta$ is the number of games lost. If after $n$ games $x$ have been won, then the posterior is $$\theta \vert x \sim \operatorname{Beta}(41+x, 41 + (n-x))$$ Simply add the number of wins to $\alpha$ and the number of losses to $\beta$ . Things become tricky when you have multiple seasons. Ignoring affects of trades and time, we can assume that the team's $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are somehow distributed. Our model would then be $$(\alpha, \beta)^T \sim p(\alpha, \beta) $$ $$ \theta \vert \alpha, \beta \sim \operatorname{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$$ $$ x \vert \theta, \alpha, \beta \sim \operatorname{Binomial}(\theta, n)$$ A closed form for the likelihood exists, but you'll need to likely use R or python to evaluate some of the expressions. The model I've written above is actually very similar to Gelman's rat tumor example. I've written some documentation on how to perform inference on this model for PyMC3 here . That link shows how to perform inference on data using an uninformative prior for the joint distribution of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . You could even go one step further and perform inference for all teams simultaneously by placing a hyper prior on the hyper prior for $alpha$ and $\beta$ . In short, each team's $\alpha$ and $\beta$ come from some population distribution. The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are then used to draw a teams' win ratio for any given season, which is then used to draw a number of wins. Of course, there is no reason to be Bayesian. You can fit a beta binomial model in R with gamlss. EDIT 1: You ask: Also, could you speak to the post linked below? I don't think I will. There is already an accepted answer with multiple upvotes. Could you expand on how using a hierarchical prior could improve the analysis? If you had one pre-season projection, you could construct a prior as I have outlined in the beginning of this answer. Since you have multiple pre-season projections, you need a way to combine that information to inform the choice of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . The hierarchical model I have posted here achieves that. An implementation is shown in the link I have provided.
