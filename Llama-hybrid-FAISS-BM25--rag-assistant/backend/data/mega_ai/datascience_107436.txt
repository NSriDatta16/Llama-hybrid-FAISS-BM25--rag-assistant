I don't think you need a machine learning model for this. There's no data as such, which the machine can learn and give better predictions. If the user needs 70 % healthy meals in 14 days, we simply need to maintain a count of the healthy meals and the total meals consumed by the user. As we need 70 % healthy meals, the user must be prompted to have a 'healthy' meal everyday with a probability of 0.7. Considering a random variable $X$ , such that $X \sim U( 0 , 1 )$ , and if $X then prompt the user to have a 'healthy' meal. By the law of large numbers , as the number of days increase, the user will have completed 70% healthy diets, $$ P( \text{healthy} ) = 0.7 = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{\text{number of healthy meals in the first N meals}}{N} $$ In our case, as $N$ would never approach $\infty$ , but would approach $14$ , $$ P( \text{healthy} ) \approx 0.7 \approx \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{\text{number of healthy meals in the first N meals}}{N} $$ For better understanding, here's a plot which depicts the probability of having 70 % healthy meals in 60 days. Observe that as the number of days increase, we approach a better approximation of $P( \text{healthy} )$ ,
