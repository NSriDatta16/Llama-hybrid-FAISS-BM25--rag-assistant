Per above, in a time-series forecasting context, I would always look at the time series and its associated plots, and consider any explanatory variables only as a second step. Transformations of IV are no problem at all, I would consider splines . However, there is very little visible relationship between your calls and your sales. If at all, it seems like sales may be highest for calls around 2 or 3. (Whatever a fractional call is.) Splines may be able to capture this relationship. I recommend: Do not consider $R^2$ , which is not a good indicator of prediction accuracy. It's a measure of in-sample fit, which is notoriously misleading in terms of prediction accuracy. Do consider a holdout sample. In your time series context, this should be taken from the end of the time series. Compare your model(s) (with a linear predictor of calls, or a spline transformation) against the very simple historical mean model, and perhaps a simple automatically chosen time series forecasting model. These can be surprisingly hard to beat. Learn more about the relationship between calls and sales. If these are calls made by salespeople, then it stands to reason that they might make more calls in situations where they think sales are more likely. That is, calls are endogenous . If so, it would not make a lot of sense to tell them to increase the number of calls to drive sales, at least not in the context of this model.
