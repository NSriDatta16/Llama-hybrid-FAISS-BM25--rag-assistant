Read Scaling Lucene and Solr . Define your needs from Lucene (for example: you are indexing PDFs - do you need to store the full text, just to make it searchable, or not at all?) Make a small-scale experiment - index a few documents, see whether retrieval is good enough. Try to index the whole thing (considering the paper's tips for quick indexing and for indexing for retrieval speed) - Is retrieval good enough? Is performance good enough? Iterate.
