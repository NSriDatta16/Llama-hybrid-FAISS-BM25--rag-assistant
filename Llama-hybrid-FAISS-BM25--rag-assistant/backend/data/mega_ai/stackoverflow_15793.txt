I previously organised my DDL code organised by one file per entity and made a tool that combined this into a single DDL script. My former employer used a scheme where all table DDL was in one file (stored in oracle syntax), indicies in another, constraints in a third and static data in a fourth. A change script was kept in paralell with this (again in Oracle). The conversion to SQL was manual. It was a mess. I actually wrote a handy tool that will convert Oracle DDL to SQL Server (it worked 99.9% of the time). I have recently switched to using Visual Studio Team System for Database professionals . So far it works fine, but there are some glitches if you use CLR functions within the database.
