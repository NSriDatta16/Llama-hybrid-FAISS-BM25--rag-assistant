Avoid storing strings that need to be translated in the database. Did that myself and regretted it. Use external files that you can send to translators. Use strings in your preferred language as the keys. So as for your example $lang('Please contact us for more information') is the way to go. A text change in the English probably means a corresponding change in the translations so yeah it's a maintenance headache. Plus there's more to it than just string translations. There are currency symbols and formats, number formats (decimal, digit grouping symbols, where the symbol appears), date formatting. Name formatting - in some locales people often have middle names in others they usually don't. Text reading left to right vs right to left as well. ugh. For a web app it's sometimes just much simpler to have the web pages separated into language-locale directories and deal with it that way. You do have all you business logic separate from the view code right? This is where embedding business logic directly within html ala the typical PHP approach really starts to hurt.
