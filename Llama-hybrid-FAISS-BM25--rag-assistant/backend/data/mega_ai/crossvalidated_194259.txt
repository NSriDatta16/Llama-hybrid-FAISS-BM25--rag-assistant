Time series regression coefficient interpretation with differenced independent variable

I'm working on a project on time series regression. The independent variable was non stationary so I took first differences to stationarize it. Now when I regress it against the dependent variable the coefficient is significant. How does one interpret a series regressed against another which has been differenced? So for instance I have $$ Income_t= c + 0.10 \Delta GDP_t+\varepsilon_t. $$
