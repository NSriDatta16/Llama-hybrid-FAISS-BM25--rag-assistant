If I understand the question correctly, you have 36 class and 1 sample/class. Then I believe it's impossible to use Machine Learning for this dataset to predict the label. Reason: When you split train/test set, there will some classes that only appear in test set and not train set. The model doesn't learn about them at all. A major assumption in Machine Learning problems is that the train set and test set must have the same statistical distribution.
