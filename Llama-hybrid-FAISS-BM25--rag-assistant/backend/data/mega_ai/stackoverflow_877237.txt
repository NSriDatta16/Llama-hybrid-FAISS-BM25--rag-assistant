The second approach, I believe, matches the FlyWeight pattern: the objects don't aggregate their children directly, they just know how to get to them. When working with databases, you won't need all hierarchy present all the time, so in this context, I would prefer the dumb approach. The FlyWeight can, however, be enriched with some caching, to avoid multiple retrieval of the same data.
