Next, we will add a module for your custom macros. Right click on "MyMacros" in the Project Explorer, click Add->Add Module..., type in an appropriate name then click "Add". Now paste the function inside the module, making copies for any other tags you want Save and close the macros IDE To hook the macro up to a button: Click Tools->Customize... Click New..., type in an appropriate name, click OK. An empty toolbar should be visible (you may have to move the window to see it) Click the Commands tab, and select "Macros" in categories Find the macros created before and drag them over to the toolbar Right click the buttons to change settings (such as displaying an icon instead of text)
