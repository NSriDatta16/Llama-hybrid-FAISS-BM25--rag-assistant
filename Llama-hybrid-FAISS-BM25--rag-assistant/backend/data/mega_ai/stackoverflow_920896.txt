jQuery HTML select drop down need two values but display/submit one. Second value used to select another drop down option

Ok here goes: I have a SELECT drop down option with US state names california utah michigan but I also need to associate another value with this that's hidden to the page view. I can not use class, name or id to populate the second value as they are used already. and can only have one value in the value attribute cause this is being added to a database. Is there another attribute I could pass the second value in as a place holder or something? the true, false and undecided values are associated with the states in a database and need to be associated together. I guess I could also do a hidden SELECT element but then the question is how to I relate the hidden SELECT to the other two SELECTS? california utah michigan ohio arizona wash dc Now with the second value added (somehow) to the first SELECT drop down I need a way to select a second SELECT drop down based on the first SELECT drop down option selected. true false undecided so if the user selects "wash dc" the second SELECT drop down should be defaulted to false. I'm using jQuery for JavaScript if this helps and I think I could do the second part of this problem but how do I do the first part?
