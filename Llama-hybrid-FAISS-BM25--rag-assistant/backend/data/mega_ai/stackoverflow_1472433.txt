How can jQuery be used to handle timer in click, dblclick separation

I am using the jQueryFileTree at http://abeautifulsite.net/notebook/58 and I want to distinguish between the dblclick and click events as a click is always triggered by a dblclick. Googling about led to be a technique in which click is handled by a timer which kicks in when a dblclick does not cancel it. Is there some way this can be used with jQuery and the jQuery example in an elegant manner?
