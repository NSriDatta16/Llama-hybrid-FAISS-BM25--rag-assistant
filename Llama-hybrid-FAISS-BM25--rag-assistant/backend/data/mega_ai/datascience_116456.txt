Difference between sklearn's LogisticRegression and SGDClassifier?

What is the difference between sklearn's LogisticRegression classifier and its SGDClassifier ? I understand that the SGD is an optimization method, while Logistic Regression (LR) is a machine learning algorithm/model. I also understand that SGDClassifier is a linear classifier that is optimized by SGD (per this answer: per this answer but how do these two models below differ? SGDClassifier(loss='log') and LogisticRegression(solver='sag') ?
