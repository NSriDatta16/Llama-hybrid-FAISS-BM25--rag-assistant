Using the terminology "Bayesian confidence interval" in place of "Bayesian credible interval."

In Peter Hoff's "A first course in Bayesian statistical methods," he states: "Most authors refer to intervals of high probability as 'credible intervals' as opposed to confidence intervals. Doing so fails to recognize that Bayesian intervals do have frequentist coverage, often being very close to the specified Bayesian coverage level (Welch and Peers, 1963; Hartigan 1966, Severini 1991)." Is the use of "Bayesian confidence interval" in place of "Bayesian credible interval" accepted terminology? This nomenclature is useful for me, as most non-statistician collaborators and reviewers for the papers I coauthor get confused and are uncomfortable with the "credible interval" terminology, even when they don't have an issue with Bayesian inference itself.
