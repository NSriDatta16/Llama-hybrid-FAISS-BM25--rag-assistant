Adding new row in correct position to a user sorted wingrid with bindingsource

I have a Infragistics UltraGrid using a bindingSource. If I add a new object to my binding list, it adds a row to the bottom of the grid which is fine if there's no user defined sort. Question is if the user clicks on a column header to sort the grid, is there a way for new rows to appear in the proper sorted order instead of always on the bottom? Re-sorting all rows on every insert is too expensive.
