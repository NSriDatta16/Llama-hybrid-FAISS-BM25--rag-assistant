Selectively disabling warnings is possible in GCC while the push/pop features are available since version 4.6. Here's the example from the documentation: [*] #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wuninitialized" foo(a); /* error is given for this one */ #pragma GCC diagnostic push #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wuninitialized" foo(b); /* no diagnostic for this one */ #pragma GCC diagnostic pop foo(c); /* error is given for this one */ #pragma GCC diagnostic pop foo(d); /* depends on command line options */ [*] The imbalanced pop at the end is documented as well: If a pop has no matching push , the command-line options are restored.
