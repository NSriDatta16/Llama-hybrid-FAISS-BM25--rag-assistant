1) If this big amount of zeros somehow affecting the learning process? Have you actually tried. Yes, there are a lot of zeros, but if they are all occurring at night, then they would show up as regular daily seasonality pattern, so they shouldn't effect your ability to predict too much. 2) Is there any way to deal with such sparse data set? What is the purpose of your forecast? Do you need half-hourly forecasts? If not, I would suggest that you aggregate up to a daily level. You will end up with 365 data points, which is a lot smaller than the original data set, but is still enough for fitting a time series model.
