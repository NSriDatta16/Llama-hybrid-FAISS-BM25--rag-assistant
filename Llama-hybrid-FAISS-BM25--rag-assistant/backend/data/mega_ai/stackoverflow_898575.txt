How can I detect if the user just wanted to scroll, and not tap on an UIImageView inside a UIScrollView?

I've implemented an UIScrollView which contains a grid of UIImageView objects. For both, the superview and it's subviews, userInteractionEnabled is YES. As the user scrolls and his/her finger touches an UIImageView, it imediately recognizes a tap on that, which is not what I want ;) Inside of that UIImageView objects I have this method: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if ([touch view] == self && [touch tapCount] >= 1) { NSLog(@"Cooooool! The user touched me!"); } } Is there a way how I could recognize something like "oh no, the user actually wanted to scroll only, so don't take that touch too serious!"? Basically, what I need is the behavior of the home screen, where a finger may touch an icon, but when the user starts scrolling and lifts the finger off, the touched app will not be launched.
