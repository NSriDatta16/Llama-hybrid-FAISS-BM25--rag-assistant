Can't definitely say about your data. But recently I have had a similar dataset, almost 88% belong to one group. Linear SVM did okayish with the AUC score being 0.74 but the result was significantly improved by Random Forest. Later, I proceed with Random Forest. Note: If you decide to go with Random Forest or any other non-parametric method eventually, be cautious about the overfit.
