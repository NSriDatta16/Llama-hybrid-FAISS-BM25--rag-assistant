Best method to make file executable in Objective-C

I need to be able to execute a file via code, which works great, but to make sure it succeeds I first have to set the executable bit on the file. I am currently running chmod +x via an NSTask, but this seems clumsy: NSString *script = @"/path/to/script.sh"; // At this point, we have already checked if script exists and has a shebang NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager defaultManager]; if (![fileManager isExecutableFileAtPath:script]) { NSArray *chmodArguments = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"+x", script, nil]; NSTask *chmod = [NSTask launchedTaskWithLaunchPath:@"/bin/chmod" arguments:chmodArguments]; [chmod waitUntilExit]; } Any suggestions? I have not had any luck finding code examples, and the only other option seems to be NSFileManager's setAttributes:ofItemAtPath:error: with the NSFilePosixPermissions attribute. I'll do the POSIX read and write logic if I need to, but wanted to see if there's a more elegant method out there.
