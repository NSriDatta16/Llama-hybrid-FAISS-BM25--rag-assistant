stark contrast to previous years, the Google Assistant was barely mentioned during the event. The expanded rollout did not include any nations in the European Union (EU), possibly reflecting concerns about compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation. Those with Google Workspace accounts also gained access to the service. Google attempted to launch Bard in the EU in June but was blocked by the Irish Data Protection Commission, who requested a "data protection impact assessment" from the company; Bard was launched in the region and Brazil the next month, adding support for dozens of new languages and introducing personalization and productivity features. An invite-only chatroom ("server") on Discord was created in July, consisting of users who heavily used Bard. Over the next few months, the chatroom was flooded with comments questioning the usefulness of Bard. Google released a major update to the chatbot in September, integrating it into many of its products through "extensions", adding a button to attempt to fact-check AI-generated responses through Google Search, and allowing users to share conversation threads. Google also introduced the "Google-Extended" web crawler as part of its search engine's robots.txt indexing file to allow web publishers to opt-out of allowing Bard to scan them for training. Online users later discovered that Google Search was indexing Bard conversation threads on which users had enabled sharing; Google stated that this was an error which was corrected. In October, during the company's annual Made by Google event, Hsiao unveiled "Assistant with Bard", an upgraded version of the Google Assistant which was integrated with Bard. When the U.S. Copyright Office solicited public comment on potential new regulation on generative AI technologies, Google joined with OpenAI and Microsoft in arguing that the responsibility for generating copyrighted material lay with the user, not the developer. Accenture contractors voted to join the Alphabet Workers Union in November, in protest of suboptimal working conditions, while the company filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against a group of unidentified scammers who had been advertising malware disguised as a downloadable version of Bard. Gemini Rebranding On December 6, 2023, Google announced Gemini, a larger, multimodal LLM. A specially tuned version of the mid-tier Gemini Pro was integrated into Bard, while the larger Gemini Ultra was used for "Bard Advanced" in 2024. The Wall Street Journal reported that Bard was then averaging around 220 million monthly visitors. Google ended its contract with Appen in January 2024, while image generation was added to Bard the next month, using Google Brain's Imagen 2 text-to-image model. On February 8, 2024, Bard and Duet AI were unified under the Gemini brand, with a mobile app launched on Android and the service integrated into the Google app on iOS. On Android, users who downloaded the app saw Gemini replace Assistant as their device's default virtual assistant, though Assistant remained a standalone service. Google also launched "Gemini Advanced with Ultra 1.0", available via a "Google One AI Premium" subscription, incorporated Gemini into its Messages app on Android, and announced a partnership with Stack Overflow. Gemini again took center stage at the 2024 Google I/O keynote. Google announced that Gemini would be integrated into several products, including Android, Chrome, Photos, and Workspace. Gemini Advanced was upgraded to the "Gemini 1.5 Pro" language model, with Google previewing Gemini Live, a voice chat mode, and Gems, the ability to create custom chatbots. Further updates Originally introduced by Google in August 2024, Gemini Live debuted on the Pixel 9 series later that year as the default virtual assistant, replacing the Google Assistant on those devices. It was later rolled out to Samsung Galaxy devices beginning with the Galaxy S25 series in July 202
