It's hard to say how many is too many. It's really very subjective. I think the question you should be asking is not, "Are there too many columns?", but, rather, "Do these columns belong here?" What I mean by that is if there are columns in your User table that aren't necessarily properties of the user, then they may not belong. For example, if you've got a bunch of columns that sum up the user's address, then maybe you pull those out into an Address table with an FK into User. I would avoid using key/value tables if possible. It may seem like an easy way to make things extensible, but it's really just a pain in the long run. If you find that your schema is changing very consistently you may want to consider putting some kind of change control in place to vet changes to only those that are necessary, or move to another technology that better supports schema-less storage like NoSQL with MongoDB or CouchDB.
