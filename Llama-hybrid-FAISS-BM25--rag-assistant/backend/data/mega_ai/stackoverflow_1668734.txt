Reduce aliasing by using __restrict . Help the compiler in common subexpression elimination / dead code elimination by using __pure . An introduction to SSE/SIMD can be found here and here . The internet isn't exactly overflowing with articles about the topic, but there's enough. For a reference list of intrinsics, you can search MSDN for 'compiler intrinsics'. For 'macro parallelization', you can try OpenMP . It's a compiler standard for easy task parallelization -- essentially, you tell the compiler using a handful of #pragmas that certain sections of the code are reentrant, and the compiler creates the threads for you automagically. I second interjay's point that PGO can be pretty helpful. And unlike #3 and #4, it's almost effortless to add in.
