How to evaluate-visualize clusters derived through PCA

the title might not be the best to adress my question. Here is my problem I have a data set with 21 features. and I want to cluster the data to interpret if there are any insights that I can have by clustering the data. I started the process with PCA and reduced it to 2 component and then trained k-means clustering model with 4 central points. When I visualize it, my clusters look nice and tidy based on 2 components. The problem that I can not solve is how I can go from those two components back to the 21 features in my original set. That is important since I need to seee which of those features are important and make an analysis through those features instead of those 2 components. Mehmet
