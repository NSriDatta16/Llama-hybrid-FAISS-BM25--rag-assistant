Information theory has emerged as a means of solving engineering problems related to data compression and communication. Moreover, it is used for solving such problems to this day. It uses probability theory, but it is focused on a different kind of problems, just as probability theory uses calculus, but is not a subfield of calculus. That said, I wouldn't agree with your premise. Information theory is commonly used in statistics in machine learning: for example, KL divergence is a common "loss" function used when training probabilistic models. There are also several statistics textbooks that cover information theory, for example Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms by David J. C. MacKay.
