We have a paper in press that discusses this problem. AFAIK, there is no R package with sophisticated options for block cross-validation, but the paper has some code attached in the appendix that may be useful. Roberts, D. R. et al. (2017) Cross-validation strategies for data with temporal, spatial, hierarchical, or phylogenetic structure Ecography, in press. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.02881/abstract
