You cannot decide if a system (or class) follows the OCP just by looking at it statically, with no contextual information. Only if you know what are the likely changes to a design, can you judge whether it follows the OCP for those specific kinds of changes. There's no language construct that can help you with that. A good heuristic would be to use some kind of metric, like Robert Martin's instability and abstractness (pdf) , or metrics for lack of cohesion to better prepare your systems for change , and to have a better chance of following the OCP and all the other important principles of OOD.
