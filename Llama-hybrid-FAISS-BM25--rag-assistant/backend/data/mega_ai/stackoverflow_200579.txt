There is an open source application called SoapUI( http://www.soapui.org/ ). With this application, you can do 1) manual testing of webservices OR 2) use groovy (a java like scripting) language to do functional testing. It works pretty well and a lot of organizations are using it. They have an open source version as well as a commercial (with more functionality and support) version. Check it out.
