Class instance size isn't a reliable metric of code complexity. An overly complex class that does everything could easily be the same size as a well-designed class that is composed of several smaller objects with clear responsibilities. A class that uses composition can instantiate the composed objects as member variables (resulting in a larger instance size), or it can contain pointers to separate objects allocated using the new operator. The latter approach has benefits, such as physical decoupling, polymorphism, and not paying for features you don't use, but it also has downsides, such as increased memory fragmentation, increased memory allocator overhead, and reduced spatial locality.
