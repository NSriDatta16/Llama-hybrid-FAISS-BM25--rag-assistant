I don't think the service level should have any knowledge of database tables, just like you ideally don't want to see data access code in a controller action or ASPX's code behind. Personally, I prefer to organize my services to match my domain model. If I have Customer , Order , and Item classes, for example, I would have corresponding Customer.asmx , Order.asmx , and Item.asmx services to expose selected methods within those classes.
