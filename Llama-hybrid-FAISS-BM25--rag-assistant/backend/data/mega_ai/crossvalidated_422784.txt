Does a logistic regression maximizing likelihood necessarily also maximize AUC over linear models?

Given a data set with binary outcomes $y\in\{0,1\}^n$ and some predictor matrix $X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ , the standard logistic regression model estimates coefficients $\beta_{MLE}$ which maximize the binomial likelihood. When $X$ is full rank $\beta_{MLE}$ is unique; when perfect separation is not present, it is finite. Does this maximum likelihood model also maximize the ROC AUC (aka $c$ -statistic), or does there exist some coefficient estimate $\beta_{AUC} \neq \beta_{MLE}$ which will obtain a higher ROC AUC? If it is true that the MLE does not necessarily maximize ROC AUC, then another way to look at this question is "Is there an alternative to likelihood maximization which will always maximize ROC AUC of a logistic regression?" I am assuming that models are otherwise the same: we're not adding or removing predictors in $X$ , or otherwise changing the model specification, and I'm assuming that the likelihood-maximizing and AUC-maximizing models are using the same link function.
