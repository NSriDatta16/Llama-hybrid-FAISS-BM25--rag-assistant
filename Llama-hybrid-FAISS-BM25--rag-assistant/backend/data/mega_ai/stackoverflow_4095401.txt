access events when running intraweb application as a service

I'm running my Standalone Intraweb App as a service. Now i need to implement a function that writes a "heartbeat" timestamp to a database table. I've done this in other service app that uses the TService Classm where i can use Events like OnAfterInstall, OnExecute etc. Is there a way i can use that events in a standalone intraweb app running as service ? Thanks for all info Wolfgang
