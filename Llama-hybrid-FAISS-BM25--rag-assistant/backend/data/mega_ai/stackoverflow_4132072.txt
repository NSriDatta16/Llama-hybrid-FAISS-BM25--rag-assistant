i believe the problem here is the way you are packaging your project. i don't think serge jespers' package assistant pro software has been recently updated to handle targeting of android-emulator apks, it will only package android (non emulator) apks. try packaging in manually on the command line using ADT 2.5: adt -package -target apk-emulator -storetype pkcs12 -keystore MyCert.p12 MyApp.apk MyApp-app.xml MyApp.swf ADT (AIR Developer Tool) is located in the "bin" folder of the AIR SDK. i assume you're using Windows? if so, it's called "adt.bat" (on Mac and Linux is just called "adt" without an extension). in the command i wrote above, "adt" is the program you want to execute on the command line, while all that follows (-package, -keystore, etc.) are arguments you are passing to ADT. open your command prompt (cmd.exe). drag "adt.bat" into the command prompt, which will display it's location in quotes. you could also write out its location, but dragging and dropping files is much easier. after that, type -package -target apk-emulator -storetype pkcs12 -keystore , add a space, then drag your .p12 certificate file into the command prompt to log it's location. next write the location you want your .apk file. say you want it on your desktop, so you write the file path "Desktop\myEmulatorApp.apk" (without the quotes), add a space and drag and drop both of your MyApp-app.xml and MyApp.swf, separated by a space to log their locations. when you hit enter, ADT should compile and save myEmulatorApp.apk on to your desktop. you can read more about installing AIR on mobile devices with ADT here: http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WSfffb011ac560372f-5d0f4f25128cc9cd0cb-7ff6.html#WS2d929364fa0b81373f5793e012a24c349f8-7fff if you receive any vague errors messages, you can get a better understanding of the error by looking them up here: http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WSBE9908A0-8E3A-4329-8ABD-12F2A19AB5E9.html
