Is AdaBoost an online classificer only?

I have been using CControl library for classify data. As I understand AdaBoost, it's an online non-linear classifier algorithm and not an algorithm, such as SVM, that gives you weights back were you can use them later to classify new unkown data? Or does AdaBoost train weights were I can use them later? I have made an example that you can run online. https://onlinegdb.com/a3dVQ8row https://godbolt.org/z/MqGz9svsj
