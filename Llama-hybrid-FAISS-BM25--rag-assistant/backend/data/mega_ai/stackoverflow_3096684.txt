If what you're trying to do is show a PDF file inside a DIV, you're going down the wrong path. You either need to: Convert the PDF to Flash (ala Flash Paper ) or Convert the PDF to HTML (like Scribd does using HTML 5). Then you can embed the PDF inside a DIV. But no browser I know of supports directly embedding PDFs. Otherwise you have to put the PDF in an IFRAME, but how this is shown is PDF plug-in dependent.
