Jquery ui - drop is not working all the times

I have been facing a problem with the Jquery UI drag and drop. Please find out my sample code at, http://jsbin.com/ojaji4 In above sample, There are two droppables. I have set [tolerance: 'pointer'] for droppables. In the middle, there are draggable elements. Now, start dragging element from the left side BLUE square and try to drop it over right side droppable (OR, start dragging element from the right side BLUE square and try to drop it over left side droppable). Both above scenarios, won't work! Can anybody please suggest?
