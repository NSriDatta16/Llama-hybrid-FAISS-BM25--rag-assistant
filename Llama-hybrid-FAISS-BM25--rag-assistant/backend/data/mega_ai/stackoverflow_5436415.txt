magento - index management - Cannot initialize the indexer process

I've just moved my Magento site to a new server and I'm trying to re-index my store using the Index Management. I check all the boxes and re-index and I get the following: Cannot initialize the indexer process. I've looked at resetting the file permissions using the Magento Cleanup tool. But nothing I've tried seems to work. Has anyone ever come across this before and how did they get past this? Many thanks
