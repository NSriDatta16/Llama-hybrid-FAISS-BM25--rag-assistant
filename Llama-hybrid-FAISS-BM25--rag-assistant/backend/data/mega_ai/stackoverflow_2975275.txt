How large does a collection have to be for std::map to outpace a sorted std::vector >? I've got a system where I need several thousand associative containers, and std::map seems to carry a lot of overhead in terms of CPU cache. I've heard somewhere that for small collections std::vector can be faster -- but I'm wondering where that line is.... EDIT: I'm talking about 5 items or fewer at a time in a given structure. I'm concerned most with execution time, not storage space. I know that questions like this are inherently platform-specific, but I'm looking for a "rule of thumb" to use. Billy3
