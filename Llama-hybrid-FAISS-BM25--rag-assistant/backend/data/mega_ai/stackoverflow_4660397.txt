How to play video from sd folder

So I hope it's not a repeated question but, from the following code File f = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), TRYVID); Uri uri = Uri.fromFile(f); mc = new MediaController(this); mp.setMediaController(mc); mp.setVideoPath("/sdcard/try2.mp4"); this is part of a function that's called when a button is pressed, what i'm hoping to achieve is that when the user presses a key, the video plays but i've learned that the videoview does not play anything from the raw folder so i copied the video into the sdcard, but then after i press on the button on the emulator, it just crashes says it has to be close unexpectedly. I tried both the .setVideoPath as well as the .setUri but both does not work hmm anyone can point to my problem here?
