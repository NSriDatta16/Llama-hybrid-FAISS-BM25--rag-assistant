I don't think you have to specify t:value , just leave it out. In some cases, you just want to use t:index , that's totally fine. Edit based on comment: Yes, there is no way around declaring a property in the component class. It can look slightly inelegant when you don't do anything with the current iteration value inside the component class, that's true. I tend to use getters and setters instead of the @Property annotation in such cases to avoid the "unused" compiler warning.
