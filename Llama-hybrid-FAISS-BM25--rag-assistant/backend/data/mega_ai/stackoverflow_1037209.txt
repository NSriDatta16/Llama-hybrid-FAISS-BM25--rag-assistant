ANTLR (field=value), how to express this?

I'm a total lexer and parser newbie, so please have some patience. Eventually I want to be able to express LDAP style Query strings, e.g. '(foo=bar)', '(!foo=bar)', '(&(foo=bar)(!zip=zap))' and have a tree in the end which I could use to create the actual database query (or whatever) So I thought to start with the simplest form, to parse expressions like (foo=bar) and (!foo=bar), but already I have some problems of understanding. I just want to express that the fields are separated from value by a '=', but ANTLR seems to eat all characters at once because the identifier looks a lot like a value. What do I have to do to prevent this? grammar FilterExpression; options { language=Java; k=2; } tokens { NOT='!'; } term : '(' NOT? FIELD '=' VALUE ')'; // lexer FIELD : NAME; VALUE : CDATA; fragment NAME : ALPHA+; fragment CDATA : ALPHA*; fragment ALPHA : ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z');
