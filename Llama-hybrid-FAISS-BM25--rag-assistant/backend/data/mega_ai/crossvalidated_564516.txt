For display, it's easiest to see the critical terms in the linear predictor if you use the forms in the Wikipedia page on generalized linear models . You write in general: $$ g(\mu) = X \beta$$ where $g()$ is the link function, $\mu$ is the mean being modeled, and $X \beta$ is the linear predictor. That also seems to be the choice of the equatiomatic package in R, which can convert from several types of R models to LaTeX. In your logistic regression, that would be: $$\text{logit}(p_{bad})=\ln \left( \frac{p_{bad}}{1-p_{bad}}\right)= \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot \text{age} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{gender} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{income} .$$ Be careful with an ordinal model, as you need to check whether you modeled in terms of $P(Y \ge \text{good})$ as in Frank Harrell's comment, or the reverse inequality as in the Wikipedia page section on ordinal models . That page shows additional coefficients added to the linear predictor to represent each of the levels. The equatiomatic vignette shows separate equations with different intercepts for each level, which might be a less confusing display if you don't have too many levels.
