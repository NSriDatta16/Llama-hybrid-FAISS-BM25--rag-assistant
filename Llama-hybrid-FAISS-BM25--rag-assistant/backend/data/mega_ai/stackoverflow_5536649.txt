I think you'll need to find an alternative way of building your UI. Apple explicitly recommend against embedding scroll views inside scroll views : You should not embed UIWebView or UITableView objects in UIScrollView objects. If you do so, unexpected behavior can result because touch events for the two objects can be mixed up and wrongly handled. Without knowing what you're trying to achieve it's difficult to be able to suggest a valid alternative. Tabs? A swipe gesture at the bottom of the screen? Links inside the webviews?
