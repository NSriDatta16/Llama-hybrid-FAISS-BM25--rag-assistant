Have you looked at Lucene ? It's open-source and the Java version is mature. It could greatly help you index and search your organized data. I believe there are versions for .Net , C (with Perl/Ruby bindings), and Python. Regarding documentation - for the Java version at least there are some books out there including this one . I have had good experiences using it to index relational data stored in a database so that it can be searched in an adhoc manner. However, it can also crawl and index file based data.
