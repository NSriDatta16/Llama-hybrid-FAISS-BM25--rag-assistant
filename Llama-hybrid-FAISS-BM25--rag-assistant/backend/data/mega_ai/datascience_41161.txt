It's funny how people mix big data with data science and business intelligence. First, big data means "a lot of data", so much information that it doesn't fit in a conventional database. However, sometimes big data is not even proper "value" information but documents, images and so on. So, to process big data, WE NEED SPEED. Python is out of the league, so R. However, if the task is as easy as to take a CSV and insert into a database, then it's ETL, we don't need programming to do that. And when the information is reduced, then we could apply python, r or whatever you want to. Even Excel. However, in this stage, Big Data is not big anymore but conventional data. IMHO, Java is more suitable for Big Data (for the whole chain) but people take Python as default for some unpractical reason.
