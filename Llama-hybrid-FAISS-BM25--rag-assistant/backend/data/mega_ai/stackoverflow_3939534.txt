Control that filters data in excel

I am working with some data in Excel. I was wondering if it is at all possible to setup a filter that will interact with a drop-down menu. For example: I have a list of all the cities in Illinois and they are organized by which county they are in. Is there a way to add a drop down menu control with a list of counties in it (which I can do) and a filter that will show only one county (which I can do) and then have them interact so that the filter only shows the county selected in the drop down menu (which I have no idea how to do). Any help at all would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
