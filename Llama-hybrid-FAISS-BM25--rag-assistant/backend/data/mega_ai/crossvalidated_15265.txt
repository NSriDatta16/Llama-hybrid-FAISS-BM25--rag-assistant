Maybe you can take a Fourier transform or a wavelet transform, and then flip the signs of the randomly selected components (or shift phases in Fourier space), and then re-assemble the series back. Of course there's also a certain amount of literature on how to bootstrap time series (block bootstrap, mostly), which may or may not be related to what you want to do.
