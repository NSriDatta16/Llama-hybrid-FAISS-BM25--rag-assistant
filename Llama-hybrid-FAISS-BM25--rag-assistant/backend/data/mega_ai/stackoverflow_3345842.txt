A workaround to this problem (because for some reason no one is answering my questions as of recently) was to substitute the default browser scrollbar with a jQuery scrollbar known as jScrollPane. Doing this allows me to use the inserted scrollbar ID as a selector to disable draggable...like so: $('.jScrollPaneDrag').live('mousedown mouseup', function(e){ if(e.type=='mousedown'){ $('.lsidebar').draggable({disable: true}); }else{ $('.lsidebar').draggable({"scroll":false}); }; });
