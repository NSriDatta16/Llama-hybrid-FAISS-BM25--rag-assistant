I agree with everything said by @kjetil b halvorsen, as well as @Frank Harrell @whuber in the comments. Particularly, I agree that with the sentiment that if the researcher believes (for whatever reason) that the normality assumption is invalid for a particular application, something like bootstrapping or Bayesian methods should be used. This being said, I believe it should be emphasized that ANOVA (or more specifically the F-test ) is quite robust to the assumption of normality. For an accessible review and discussion of this topic I recommend Blanca Mena et al. (2017). References Blanca Mena, M. J., Alarcón Postigo, R., Arnau Gras, J., Bono Cabré, R., & Bendayan, R. (2017). Non-normal data: Is ANOVA still a valid option?. Psicothema, 2017, vol. 29, num. 4, p. 552-557.
