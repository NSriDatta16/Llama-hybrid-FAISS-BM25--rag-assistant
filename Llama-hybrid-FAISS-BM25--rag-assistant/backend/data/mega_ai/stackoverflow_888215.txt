JUnit(EE) is what every major project($100mil+) I've supported has used. It's really a fantastic tool and knowing how to use it is invaluable when/if you decide to look for other job opportunities. I supported a government financial system that used no unit testing but after a lot of pushing we finally implemented JUnit. The system I work on now is a large government agency modernization and we use JUnit for all of our unit testing. The two large firms supporting the modernization have essential made JUnit the standard across all of the sub projects. We've got ~200 developers using it without a hitch. It's quick and easy to set up and once you understand it and you can leverage the features it will demonstrate how invaluable it is.
