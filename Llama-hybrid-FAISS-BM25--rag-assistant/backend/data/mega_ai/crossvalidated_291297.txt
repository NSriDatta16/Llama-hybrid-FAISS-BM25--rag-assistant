CountVectorizer as N-Gram presence and count feature

Scikit-learn has a CountVectorizer under feature_extraction which converts strings(or tokens) into numerical feature suitable for scikit-learn's Machine Learning Algorithms. It has a parameter like : ngram_range : tuple (min_n, max_n). If I use : vec = CountVectorizer(ngram_range = (1,2)) Will it incorporate Unigram feature : presence and count, Bigram feature : presence and count ?
