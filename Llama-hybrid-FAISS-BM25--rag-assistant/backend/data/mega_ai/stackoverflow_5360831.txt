Greetings! I know this is an older post, but I found it through Google when searching for "javascript add large block of html as variable". I thought I'd post an alternate solution. First, I'd recommend using single-quotes around the variable itself ... makes it easier to preserve double-quotes in the actual HTML code. You can use a backslash to separate lines if you want to maintain a sense of formatting to the code: var code = ' \ The Header \ The paragraph of text \ \ The quote I\'d like to put in a div \ \ '; Note: You'll obviously need to escape any single-quotes inside the code (e.g. inside the last 'p' tag) Anyway, I hope that helps someone else that may be looking for the same answer I was ... Cheers!
