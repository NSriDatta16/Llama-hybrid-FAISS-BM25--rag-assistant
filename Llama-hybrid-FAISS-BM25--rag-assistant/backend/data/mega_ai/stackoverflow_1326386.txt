I would model it a bit differently: Person Organisation PerOrg: super-type of Person/Organisation, i.e. a LegalEntity Party: either a complex party or a simple party PerOrgPartyAssignment: the relationship between PerOrg and Party, you can have either one or many PerOrgs per Party (but a minimum of one) Case: here you only have PlantiffParty and DefendentParty The PerOrg concept (aka 'Anyone'/'Legal Entity'/'Party'...) is quite a powerful concept for any data models involving commercial relationships. I've used it a number of times and it always end up simplifying the data model when there are seemingly complex relationships.
