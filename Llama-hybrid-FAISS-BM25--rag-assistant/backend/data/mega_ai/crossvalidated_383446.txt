Comparing regression coefficients of different regions

I have to regress the average length of stay in a hospital $(Y)$ against infection risk $(X)$ for hospitals in four different regions with a linear regression model. With the lm function in R, I have found the regression coefficients for each of the regions but now they ask to check if the regression lines have the same coefficients. So I now constructed a model that makes a linear regression model for all the regions by using the following code in R: combinedRegions.model If I now want to check if the regression lines of the different regions have the same slopes, is it good to construct the following model sameSlopes.model and then perform an anova test on these models?
