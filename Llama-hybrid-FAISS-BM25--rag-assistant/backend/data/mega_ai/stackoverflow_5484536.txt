Is this data sharing problem an NP problem?

Here is my problem: There are n peers in the P2P network, which request the same data block; And with some constraint. 1. Peers with its own upload bandwidth, and the average bandwidth is the size of the data block. 2. The peers have different deadline about this data block. If one peer didnt get the entire block before the deadline, it has to search for the server help. 3. A peer can transfer data (partial or entire) only if it has the entire data block. The object is to minimize the server total upload, I cant figure it out if it has an optimal algorithm or it is an NP problem. Deadline first or largest bandwidth first may not deal with some situation Is there some NP problem similar to this? This is like a graph flow problem or an instruction scheduling, but I found that it is difficult cause I have to deal with the deadline and the growth of the suppliers total bandwidth at the same time. I hope that I can get some directions or resource about the solution :) Thanks.
