The answer to you question is yes. K-means can be used as outlier detection. BUT, more attention needs to be given for the definition of outliers. In K-means, using the symmetric distance measure is the key component to define the samples that belonging to the same cluster. symmetric distance measurement gives similar weight to each dimension (feature) this may not always be the case for defining outliers.
