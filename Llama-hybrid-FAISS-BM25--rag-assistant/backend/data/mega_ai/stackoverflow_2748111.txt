I don't know if I'm right about this, but I have been using socalled Structures in VB.net, and wondering how this concept is seen in C#. It is relevant to this question in this way: ' The declaration part Public Structure driveInfo Public type As String Public size As Long End Structure Public Structure systemInfo Public cPU As String Public memory As Long Public diskDrives() As driveInfo Public purchaseDate As Date End Structure ' this is the implementation part Dim allSystems(100) As systemInfo ReDim allSystems(1).diskDrives(3) allSystems(1).diskDrives(0).type = "Floppy" See how elegant all this is, and far better to access than jagged arrays. How can all this be done in C# (structs maybe?)
