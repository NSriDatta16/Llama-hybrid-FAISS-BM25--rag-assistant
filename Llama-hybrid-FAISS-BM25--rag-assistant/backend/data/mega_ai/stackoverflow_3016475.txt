Project Management with Respect to Time and Budget There are a couple of books you should check out: Exploring Requirements: Quality Before Design . Software Project Survival Guide Software Estimation : Demystifying the Black Art Joel Spolsky posted a quick estimation technique . I found this software project management blog. I attended a Project Management class (as part of a Masters in Technical Management) and they used the Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling book. It is a very dry book but has a ton of very useful information; luckily our professors were pretty good at their job (one topic that helped me a lot was dealing with conflict -- but that has little to do with estimation and budget which your question seems to focus on). Product Pricing I think that the book, Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality , discusses that. Basically, you should already have established a relationship with some people that represent your customer base and who have cobbled together a crappy solution. If your software represents an elegant solution that fixes their needs, you ask them 1) would you use this if it was free? If they say yes, then you ask them 2) Would you pay a million dollars for it? At which point they'll say, no way, the most I would pay would be $500 (or whatever) -- that's one way to price your product. :) Management If you are going to be managing people, read these books: Behind Closed Doors: Secrets of Great Management Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams
