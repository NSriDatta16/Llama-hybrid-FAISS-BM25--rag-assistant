I'd do two things: Convert the original text to phonemes by using ISpEnginePronunciation::GetPronunciations . Use a dictation grammar and the pronunciation language model to force SAPI to give you back a set of phonemes - do this by calling ISpRecoGrammar::LoadDictation (L"Pronunciation", SPLO_STATIC). Compare the recognized phonemes to the target phonemes. Note that ISpEnginePronunciation isn't available on SAPI 5.1, so this is limited to Vista and Windows 7.
