I asked about why there was a difference between the average of the maximum of 100 draws from a random normal distribution and the 98th percentile of the normal distribution. The answer I received from Rob Hyndman was mostly acceptable, but too technically dense to accept without revision. I was left wondering whether it was possible to provide an answer that explains in intuitively understandable plain language why these two values are not equal. Ultimately, my answer may be unsatisfyingly circular; but conceptually, the reason max(rnorm(100)) tends to be higher than qnorm(.98) is, in short, because on average the highest of 100 random normally distributed scores will on occasion exceed its expected value. However this distortion is non-symmetrical, since when low scores are drawn they are unlikely to end up being the highest out of the 100 scores. Each independent draw is a new chance to exceed the expected value, or to be ignored because the obtained value isn't the maximum of the 100 drawn values. For a visual demonstration compare the histogram of the maximum of 20 values to the histogram of the maximum of 100 values, the difference in skew, especially in the tails, is stark. I arrived at this answer indirectly while working through a related problem/question I had asked in the comments. Specifically, if I found that someone's test scores were ranked in the 95th percentile, I'd expect that on average if I put them in a room with 99 other test takers that their rank would average out to be 95. This turns out to be more or less the case (R code)... for (i in 1:NSIM) { rank[i] As an extension of that logic, I had likewise been expecting that if I took 100 people in a room and selected the person with 95th highest score, then took another 99 people and had them take the same test, that on average the selected person would be ranked 95th in the new group. But this is not the case (R code)... for (i in 1:NSIM) { testtakers What makes the first case different from the second case is that in the first case the individual's score places them at exactly the 95th percentile. In the second case their score may turn out to be somewhat higher or lower than the true 95th percentile. Since they can not possibly rank higher than 100, groups that produce a rank 95 score that is actually at the 99th percentile or higher can not offset (in terms of average rank) those cases where the rank 95 score is much lower than the true 90th percentile. If you look at the histograms for the two rank vectors provided in this answer it is easy to see that there is a restriction of range in the upper ends that is a consequence of this process I have been describing.
