The Bayes factor is not a likelihood ratio and not even a weighted likelihood ratio except in the most unrealistic case of comparing two fixed values of the full parameter. In general, the Bayes factor is defined by integrating out or averaging the parameter, under each hypothesis, and using the ratio of the integrated likelihoods as a decision tool: $$\mathfrak{B}_{12}(x)=\dfrac{\int_{\Theta_1} f(x|\theta_1) \pi_1(\theta_1)\text{d}\theta_1}{\int_{\Theta_2} f(x|\theta_2) \pi_1(\theta_2)\text{d}\theta_2}$$The Wikipedia entry on this notion is reasonably helpful as an introduction on the topic, before moving to Bayesian textbooks which almost invariably deal with the topic.
