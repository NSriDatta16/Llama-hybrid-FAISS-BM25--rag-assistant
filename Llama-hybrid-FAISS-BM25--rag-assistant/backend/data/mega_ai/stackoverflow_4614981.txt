Flash movie in Firefox intermittently load XML with URLLoader

I have a Flash movie that behaves as follows: Movie loads > tries to load an XML file using URLLoader.load() > uses the data in the XML to load some images into the movie. The requirement was for updates to the XML file to be picked up within 10 minutes, so I have added a querystring parameter to the XML URL which is a timestamp to the nearest ten minutes, e.g. example.com/source.xml**?nocache=2011-0-6_11-40** This all works for me as expected in IE and Chrome, and it works locally for me in Firefox. However, on our production server (IIS) in Firefox, the following behaviour occurs (by observing Firebug): First load: SWF loads > XML Requested and loads > images requested and load Subsequent page loads: SWF Loads > no request for the XML (no request shown in Firebug) Firebug shows the following information about the XML file from the first successful request: Response Headers Cache-Control max-age=31536000 Content-Length 640 Content-Type text/xml Content-Location http://www.example.com/portals/0/flash/slider3/list.xml?nocache=2011-0-6_11-30 Last-Modified Thu, 06 Jan 2011 08:08:12 GMT Accept-Ranges bytes Server Microsoft-IIS/6.0 X-Powered-By ASP.NET ServedBy :9002 Date Thu, 06 Jan 2011 11:38:00 GMT Request Headers Host www.example.com User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 Accept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9, / ;q=0.8 Accept-Language en-gb,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 115 Connection keep-alive __utma=39412577.29609269.1294313877.1294313877.1294313877.1; __utmb=39412577; __utmc=39412577; __utmz=39412577.1294313877.1.1.utmccn=(direct)|utmcsr=(direct)|utmcmd=(none) Cache Last Modified Thu Jan 06 2011 11:38:00 GMT+0000 (GMT Standard Time) Last Fetched Thu Jan 06 2011 11:38:00 GMT+0000 (GMT Standard Time) Expires Fri Jan 06 2012 11:38:00 GMT+0000 (GMT Standard Time) Data Size 640 Fetch Count 2 Device disk Key: http://www.example.com/portals/0/flash/slider3/list.xml?nocache=2011-0-6_11-10 Data size: 640 bytes Fetch count: 2 Last modified: 2011-01-06 11:01:25 Expires: 2012-01-06 11:01:25 I don't understand what would cause URLLoader to not create a request that appears in Firebug. And if it is retrieving the XML from the browser cache, why isn't the movie working (loading the images etc)?
