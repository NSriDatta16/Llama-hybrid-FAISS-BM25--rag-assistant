one way anova to compare each factor against the mean

I have a factor with six levels and then a proportion for each of those levels. I have six months that women became pregnant and then the proportion who smoked during pregnancy, as an example. I used an anova and I know that there are significant differences in the group. I also used a tukey hsd and I looked at the pair-wise differences. I simply want to know if the difference in each factor is significant against the average for everyone. Is that something I can learn with a one way anova?
