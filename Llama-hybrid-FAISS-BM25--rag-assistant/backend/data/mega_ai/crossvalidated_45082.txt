How to calculate class-specific accuracy on PCA?

I have implemented PCA at Matlab. I just did dimensionality reduction (I don't use but I have class labels in my data set). My aim is to calculate overall accuracy and class-specific accuracy. I know that I can calculate overall (training data set and test data set) accuracy with PoV (Proportion of Variance Explained)--if I am wrong you can explain it, you are welcome--but I don't know how to calculate class-specific accuracy. It sounds to me that each class accuracy is the same as overall accuracy.
