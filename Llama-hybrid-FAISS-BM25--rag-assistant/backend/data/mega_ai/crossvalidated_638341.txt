Does the mode of MCMC samples equal the MAP of the posterior?

If I had millions of MCMC samples from a posterior, should the most frequent value among those samples (i.e., the peak of a histogram of those samples) at least in principle always equal the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimate obtained through optimization? In other words, are mode-of-samples and maximum-a-posteriori two ways to target the same quantity or could they be different under some circumstances (does it depend on properties of the sampling algorithm, for instance)?
