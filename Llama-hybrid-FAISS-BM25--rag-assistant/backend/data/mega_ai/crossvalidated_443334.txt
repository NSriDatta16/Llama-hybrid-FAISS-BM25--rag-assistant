Numerical approximation to quantile function for Gamma distribution

I am building a stats/probability library in python and right now I am working on the properties of the gamma distribution. I know that its quantile function (F^-1(x)) does not have a nice closed-form solution, so I am trying to find a numerical method that gives a good approximation. As I'm using the gamma distribution for bayesian statistics, I'm using the rate parameterisation, in case that detail is useful. Can anybody suggest a method with PS: Is there a subfield of numerical methods specifically for statistics? I am struggling to find resources online. PS2: I dug up an old algorithm that can approximate the quantiles of a chi-square function and then convert them to a gamma, but this gamma is parameterised with scale. I am not sure how to do convert it to a gamma parameterised w/ rate.
