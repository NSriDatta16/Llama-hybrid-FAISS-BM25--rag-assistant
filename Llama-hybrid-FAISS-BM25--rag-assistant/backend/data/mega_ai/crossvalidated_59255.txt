There's no correct answer here, it depends on the purpose of your ranking. However, if there are no other variables of interest, then this doesn't seem like a stupid way to go - basically you're ranking ships relative to their expected performance. If you're comparing real ships to an "ideal ship", or standard, then the mean and std. deviation should remain constant (and it might also be more sensible to give the ships a score, rather than a ranking, as that provides more information). Having the standard remain constant also means you can track changes in individual ships, or thoe whole fleet. To figure out how the "ideal ship" performs, you should use all the data that's reasonable to use. That might mean using all the data, or, considering that the ships probably degrade with time, it might mean using the data for every ship, but only for the first few months/years, so that you can see. Unless there is something indicating that the extra ships have a different performance, you should use them, as it will give you better estimates. You can use the data given, if and only if you can assume that the performance is the same, independent of month. For example, if you only have the average of summer data for one ship, and you know that the ships perform better in summer, then that data will bias you mean estimate. Also, make sure to account for the different time spans in your average-of-averages.
