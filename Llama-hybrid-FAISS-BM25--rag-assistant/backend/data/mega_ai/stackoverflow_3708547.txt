How do I run Delphi 7 on Windows 7 without disabling UAC?

I had the bad idea of switching to Windows 7 (32 bit) and now my old Delphi 7 won't work properly. Actually it worked just fine until yesterday but (I suppose) after some MS Windows updates, it crashes if I double click a DPR file. However, it works if I run as administrator or if I start Delphi IDE without double clicking a DPR file (and than loading that DPR). So, obviously it is a UAC issue. I am really pissed of that I switched to Win 7 which is not most different (better) than Win XP. If I have to switch off UAC (and with it the only big improvement that Win 7 brings - the security) than for real I will have no advantage from Win 7. So, how to make Delphi work without disabling the UAC? I hope that other people that had this problem found a solution. :) Update: I have tried already to give Delphi rights to write in its "c:\Program File\Borland\Delphi folder". No luck. I don't want to run it in Admin mode (this includes XP mode) since it will be running at a different level. Some API calls will not fail (since it is running in admin mode). Drag and drop from non-admin program and other similar features will also not work. Security is not a problem. I don't mindlessly download any piece of software I get from random people (read spammers) via email or from obscure web site so I don't get virused. Oh... and I don't use IE for browsing :)
