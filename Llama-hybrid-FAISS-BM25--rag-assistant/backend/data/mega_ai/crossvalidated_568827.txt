What high order lags mean in the VAR/SVAR?

I am new to VAR/SVAR and microeconomics. I learn (from here ) that a k-dimension p-order SVAR can be written as $X_{i,t}=f_i(X_t^{-i},X_{t-1},...,X_{t-p},\epsilon_{i,t})$ , where $i$ indexes the number of variable, $t$ indexes time, $X_t=\{ X_{1,t}, X_{2,t}, ..., X_{k,t}\}$ and $X_t^{-i}=X_t\setminus \{ X_{i,t} \}$ . I know VAR/SVAR are discrete-time models for a continuous-time process (such as microeconomics). However, I am confused about what the order (i.e. $p=1,2,...$ ) of lags means. I list two of my guesses below: Guess 1 Do they stand for the speed of influence? Can I interpret that an order-2 lag represents a slower influence than an order-1 lag? For example, if $X_{0,t}$ have an order-1 lag from $X_{1,t-1}$ and an order-2 lag from $X_{2,t-2}$ . Does this mean the influence from $X_1$ to $X_0$ is faster than that from $X_2$ to $X_0$ ? Guess 2 Or maybe the order of lags means the order of Markov? like an order-1 lag means a MDP (Markov Decision Process)? If this is the case, I think an higher order lag can not show without an lower order lag, right? I find some related answers . But they are about how to decide the optimal order of lags. I hope to learn the detailed literature, so please cite some papers if you can.
