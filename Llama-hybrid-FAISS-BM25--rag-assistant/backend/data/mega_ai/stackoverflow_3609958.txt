Global multidimensional array not being written to [vs c++]

I have a global multidimensional array, g_iAllData[MAX_LEN][MAX_WIDTH] being used in a Form. When I write to it in a function: g_iAllData[iRow][iColumn]= iByte_Count; I can see in a Watch Window that it's contents are not being changed. If I put the array in the function, it works fine. Is there something I'm missing? I am declaring it as global after my #include 's at the top of the Form1.h file. I have multiple functions that are called by buttons being pressed and I need to write and read from the array in each function. It would be easier to keep it as global instead of passing it to each function. UPDATE code: ProgramName.cpp #include "stdafx.h" #include "Form1.h" Form1.h #include #include ... #pragma once const int MAX_LEN = 4033; const int MAX_WIDTH = 21; int g_iAllData[MAX_LEN][MAX_WIDTH]; ... namespace ProgramName{ // later on ReadFile(); void ReadFile(void) g_iAllData[iRow][iColumn]= iByte_Count;
