Time series Prediction as a multi-output multivariate regression for many input and output values for each lag

Recently I am working on time series prediction. My topic is related to wind turbine blades which has many sections in each blade. Now we want to predict some performance and metrics of 51 sections of 10 blades(each section has different values and different behavior) and here we have 22 inputs and 3 targets. All the data has been collected during 600 seconds. So, we have many information in every second. I want to use multi-out regression algorithms like MGPR, MSVR, MGHPR and then find the coefficient of predictors for each target for each time per seconds and then use time series prediction like LSTM for all 600 seconds to predict 3 targets for 600 next seconds. Please help me that my procedure is right or not?
