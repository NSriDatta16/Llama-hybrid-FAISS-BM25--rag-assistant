I don't know if its relevant in your case, but if you want to check for overlaps between your circle and many other circles (let's say thousands of circles), you can try to organize your circles in quad-trees (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree ) and do a tree look-up (based on the bounding rectangle of your circle) in the quad-tree.
