As with any programming question there are a lot of ways to do things. However, by specifying that you are intending to go to a phone, you list of considerations changes. Firstly you need to look at your intended phones to see what they support. Especially in terms of data storage. Xml or some other flat file format will work fine if you don't have too much data and don't want to enable searching and other functions which will access the data in random ways. But if you want to store larger amounts of data or do random access, you need to look into data storage techniques that are more database like. This is where you intended target platforms are likely to impose limits in terms of performance or storage limits. The other alternative is that you design the application so that it's storage os decoupled from the core program. This means that you can apply different types of data storage, depending on whether it's a PC or phone, yet not have to recode everything else.
