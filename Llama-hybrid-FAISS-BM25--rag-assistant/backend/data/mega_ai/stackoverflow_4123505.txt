Video Capture ignoring EXTRA_OUTPUT dilemma

I'm having a pig of a time creating a basic video capture feature in my application. I want to call the default video capture tool my device and had the file saved to a specific location. From the documentation this is achieved by providing a Uri in EXTRA_OUTPUT, however what's happening is this is completely being ignored and the video is actually being written to the usual media store location. My code is very simple : Intent i = new Intent( android.provider.MediaStore.ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE ); String SD_CARD_TEMP = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + File.separator + MEDIA_TEMP ; i.putExtra( android.provider.MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, Uri.parse(SD_CARD_TEMP) ); startActivityForResult( i, ACTIVITY_CAPTURE_VIDEO ); The constant MEDIA_TEMP is set to 'media_temp'. I've also tried using a File rather than a string and using Uri.fromFile() but that made no difference. If anyone has any ideas as to why this code isn't behaving as the docs say it should.. please tell me :-) PS. Development is being carried out live on HTC Desire HD, not emulator.. Thanks, Dave
