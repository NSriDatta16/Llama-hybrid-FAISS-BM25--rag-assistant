How to list Magento sub categories and their products on category/view.phtml

I am pretty new to magento and have gotten my design implemented, but I am struggling with a category/product listing issue. My categories are like this Parent Child Grandchild 1 Product 1 Product 2 Grandchild 2 Product 1 Product 2 I have the top level nav with a drop down listing the children available on all pages, but once you navigate to the child I want it to list each grandchild category and the relevant products. The store is going to be kept pretty small so we're talking about 5-10 products per grandchild category. The site is at http://gasworksparkkiteshop.com any advice would be massively helpful. I am also using customizing a copy of the Modern theme.
