I suggest you to take a look at XMLPatterns . You won't find "coding style" suggestions, but you will find interesting design patterns (a la GangOfFour) for XML document structure. For "coding style", I would check examples and try to imitate them. When in doubt, try different strategies and find the one that is clear and appealing. My opinion about your example is positive. tag/attribute names can however be an issue: lowercase no spaced, lowercase underscore spaced, camel case, capitalized camel case?
