I have been thinking about this some more and I am concerned that the parameter estimates of the model might be swamped by the larger site. I suggest that after fitting the model, you pay close attention to how the residuals look by site. If your model is basically fitting the big site and letting everything else slide, you should see patterns of residuals if you plot residuals against site. If there is a problem, I was thinking that you could select random samples of items from the big site - sample size to be similar to the other sites - and fit a bunch of models that way. You could average parameter values over the sampled estimates.
