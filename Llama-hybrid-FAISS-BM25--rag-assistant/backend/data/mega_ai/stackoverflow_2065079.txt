Cocoa document-based application with multiple document types

I want to build a document-based app in Cocoa but so that it can create and handle different types of documents. Think Word, Excel, Powerpoint all in one application, only much simpler. But every window will be different based on the type of document. For storage I will use CoreData. I think of adding a field that specifies the type of document since they should all have the same file ending. So without creating several independent apps what would be the best way to go about it? How do I create this in Interface Builder? How do I code this up? I don't need detailed source code or anything, just the general idea of how to do this, I will figure the rest out. Thanks in advance!
