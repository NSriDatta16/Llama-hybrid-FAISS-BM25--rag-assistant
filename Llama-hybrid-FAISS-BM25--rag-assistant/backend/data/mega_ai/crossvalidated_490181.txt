It sounds like you have a response that has a very non-linear relationship to the features you're using. By itself, X may have a weak relationship to the target, but in combination with another feature, it becomes important. If you're using neural nets or random forest (or other decision tree ensembles) that can identify interactions between variables, this type of relationship will reveal itself. With a decision tree ensemble, you can inspect the trees to identify when two variables co-occur, but it is much harder to identify this in a neural network.
