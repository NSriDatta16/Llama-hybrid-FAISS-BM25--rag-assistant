How To Prepare An ActiveX Control For Delivery Over The Web

So i have the misfortune of embedding this proprietary ActiveX control we created into a web page so that it downloads the code from our server and installs as necessary. Our ActiveX requires a host of other files which need to be installed along with the activex control itself. It should also be noted that the activex and all its dependencies are c++-based COM objects (many use MFC). So I read this article about it: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa751974(VS.85).aspx But it leaves a lot of things unanswered. For one thing, my ActiveX is actually embedded in a DLL file that contains other COM interfaces. Also, is it possible to have the mentioned cab file include the ActiveX/SDK installer and run that if the GUID isn't present? For example: [version] signature="$CHICAGO$" AdvancedINF=2.0 [Add.Code] Setup.exe=Setup.exe [Setup.exe] file-win32-x86=thiscab run=%EXTRACT_DIR%\Setup.exe Security is not an issue here as this is an intranet-based solution (not available publically). Also, the article mentioned here seems really old. Is there more up to date info available?
