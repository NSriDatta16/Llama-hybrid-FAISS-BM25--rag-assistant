I can't help with Fluent Validation, but as you've tagged this as fluent-nhibernate I thought I should comment on your NHibernate usage. Your view model should not be using NHibernate in its constructor; in fact, your view model should just be a data structure that gets populated by an external service. Similarly, you might want to do the same with your controller; it's common for people to extract data access into a repository to isolate their controllers (and make testing easier, you are testing aren't you?). If you're using a repository, you can then project your view model from your entity; you can do that either by using NHibernate projections and transformers or by using a tool like AutoMapper .
