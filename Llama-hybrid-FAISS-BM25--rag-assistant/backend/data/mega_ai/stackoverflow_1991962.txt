How to allow users to draw freeform rectangles in Silverlight 3.0 App

The functionality: Users can draw rectangles on a defined area of the screen, by clicking the left mouse button and dragging to create the desired sized rectangle. A similar example would be re-sizing a rectangle in BLEND. I am also open to options where the rectangle already exists, and users can resize using a drag/resize handle. Ideas on how this might be accomplished?
