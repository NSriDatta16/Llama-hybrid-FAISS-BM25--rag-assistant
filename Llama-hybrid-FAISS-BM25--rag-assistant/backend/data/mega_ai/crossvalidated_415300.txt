There is no real limit to the number of ties, with the only complication being that one cannot calculate exact $p$ -values. But the way to handle ties is not to randomly assign ranks but rather to use the midrank (average of all the ranks that breaking the ties would create). The midrank is explicitly used in formulas such as Wilcoxon and Spearman, and no correction is required.
