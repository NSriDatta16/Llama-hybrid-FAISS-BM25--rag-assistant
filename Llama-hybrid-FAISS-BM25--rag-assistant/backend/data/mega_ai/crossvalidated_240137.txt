What is the difference between accuracy and precision?

I read the material on the difference betweeen accuracy and precision, but it makes me feel confused. Can I define accuracy as: \begin{equation} accuracy=\frac{TruePositive+TrueNegative}{TruePositive+TrueNegative+FalsePositive+FlaseNegative} \end{equation} So in machine learning, what is the difference between accuracy and precision?
