Stochastic volatility: particle filter vs Metropolis-Hastings

In many of the papers on particle filter I've read (e.g. Douc, Moulines and Olsson, 2007), stochastic volatility is a common example to show that a newly-proposed filter is working. At the same time, I find that many papers in the time series literature (e.g. Cogley and Sargent (2005) and papers that followed) rather make use of e.g. Jacquier, Polson and Rossi (1994) or Kim, Shephard and Chib (1998). Can anyone reference a study conducting a comparison of particle filter-based methods vs non-particle filters for stochastic volatility models? Is there some other reason why the Jacquier, Polson and Rossi (1994) or Kim, Shephard and Chib (1998) approaches are often favored over particle filters? (I am not claiming they are favored in general, but within e.g. the VAR literature.)
