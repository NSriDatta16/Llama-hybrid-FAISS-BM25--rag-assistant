Optimizing Android testing effort

4 major OS versions: 1.5, 1.6, 2.1 and 2.2 (I guess we can safely ignore 1.0 and 2.0 now) 3 screen densities: ldpi, mdpi, hdpi 3 screen sizes: small, normal, large Lots of system testing scenarios. Is there are way to optimize the testing effort for an app that has to target all Android devices? What's the minimum number of emulators that are needed to cover the most cases? Dealing with this lately and I'm very interested to know how others are doing their Android system testing.
