Sidak or Bonferroni?

I am using a generalized linear model in SPSS to look at the differences in average number of caterpillars (non-normal, using Tweedie distribution) on 16 different species of plants. I want to run multiple comparisons but I'm not sure if I should use a Sidak or Bonferroni correction test. What is the difference between the two tests? Is one better than the other?
