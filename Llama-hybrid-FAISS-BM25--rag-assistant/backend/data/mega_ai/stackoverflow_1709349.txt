Associate an angle with each point (relative to an interior point), and then moving around is trivial. To calculate the angle, find a point in the middle of the shape, for example, (average_lat, average_lng) will be in the center. Then, atan2(lng - average_lng, lat - average_lat) will be the angle of that point.
