Inferring sample size from proportions

How would one infer the number of people that took a test based on the percentages of people that got particular questions correctly. For example 1. 85% 2. 25% 3. 95% 4. 15% 5. 35% $ n = 20 $ A caveat is that these percentages actually come with some noise, therefore you cannot be sure that something like 35.6% is 89/250 is a better answer than 7/20 (In fact the larger the estimate of N the less likely the estimate is true). I hope this question is clear and I assume this will require Bayesian methods. (Using Python if that matters)
