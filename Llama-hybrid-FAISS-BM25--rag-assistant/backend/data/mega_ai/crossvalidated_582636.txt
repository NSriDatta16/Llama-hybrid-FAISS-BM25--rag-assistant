Converting effect size from linear and logistic regression

I want to calculate a same effect size from a linear regression and a logistic regression to be able to compare them. More specifically, I would like to calculate standardized mean-difference (SMD). I used the same variables (1 binary and 1 continous) for both linear and logistic regression when trying to check if my SMD calculation was right. I thought that I would get the same SMD since it's the same variables but it is quite different (0.08 vs. 0.22). Is it because my calculations are wrong or is it normal to have a different SMD since the models are different ? Here's my converting formulas : For logistic regression : In appendix A from this document https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.4073/cmpn.2016.3 effect_size_log For linear regression : Equation (10) from this article https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17944619/ effect_size_lin Here's my binary variable "var_b": > table(data$var_b, useNA="always") 0 1 1473 205 72 And my continuous variable "var_c": > epi.descriptives(data $var_c)$ a n mean sd q25 q50 q75 lower upper min max na 1 1750 0.01432374 1.558977 -1.057936 0.008730964 1.075398 -0.05876815 0.08741564 -4.102222 5.69762 16 From logistic regression : > mod_1 odds.ratio(mod_1) Waiting for profiling to be done...
