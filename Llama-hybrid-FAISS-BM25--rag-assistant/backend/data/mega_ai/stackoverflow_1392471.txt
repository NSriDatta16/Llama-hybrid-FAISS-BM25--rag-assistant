An interesting device in this area is the OCZ Neural Input Actuator (NIA). This device is a headband incorporating an electro-myogram, electro-encephalogram, and electro-oculogram which connect to a USB port by way of small black box (said to run hardware FFT ?). The contraption is originally aimed at translating eye movements, facial muscle movements, and brain waves into computer/game input, but has since attracted the attention of a few hackers who've broaden the scope and either on their own or with OCZ are working on developping drivers and APIs, some in Open Source project. See this link for pointers on some of these initiatives. Also, I believe some folks are also tinkering with the hardware for example by cutting the headband cable and connecting true (medical-type) EEG sensors instead.
