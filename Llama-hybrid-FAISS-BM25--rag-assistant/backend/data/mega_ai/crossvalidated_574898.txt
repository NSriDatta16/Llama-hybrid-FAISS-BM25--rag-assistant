Mathematic modelling vs. machine learning

As a biologist with some background in mathematics I am really interested in mathematical modelling of biological processes, like tumor development or therapy responses. However, looking at recent publications especially machine-learning algorithms seem to very popular. As a matter of fact, I don't really understand the difference between machine learning and mathematic modelling. Which one is superior? As I see, machine learning algorithms can be used even by people without big knowledge in maths as long as they can code on a basic level. Mathematic modelling seems to be harder... What are the exact differences?
