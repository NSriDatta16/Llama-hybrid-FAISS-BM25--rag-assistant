SQL questions - Medium difficulty

I am struggling on Q10 - http://sqlzoo.net/a1m.htm What I don't understand is how to calculate the average hours of each staff member and I would also need to bring in the occurs table into this right? ERD diagram is here - http://sqlzoo.net/a1.htm Any help would be appreciated!
