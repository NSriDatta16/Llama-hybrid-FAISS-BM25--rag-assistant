Rare categoricial values have indeed no chance of being chosen in a good decision tree. Mapping them to "other" can be worth a try, but I wouldn't expect this to improve results much unless you have reason to believe that "being other" is predictive if your class label (e.g., predicting rare classes). Dropping attributes that were never chosen by a random forest clearly shouldn't affect the quality of the classifier, but improve training time.
