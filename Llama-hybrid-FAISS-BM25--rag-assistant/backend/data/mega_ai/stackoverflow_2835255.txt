No storage engine for MySQL supports CHECK constraints. Nuff said. "For other storage engines, the clauses are parsed but ignored. The CHECK clause is parsed but ignored by all storage engines." "The reason for accepting but ignoring syntax clauses is for compatibility, to make it easier to port code from other SQL servers, and to run applications that create tables with references" - http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/alter-table.html No enhancements for this in MySQL 5.4 or 5.5 according to the manual. Please note that InnoDB does support FOREIGN KEYs.
