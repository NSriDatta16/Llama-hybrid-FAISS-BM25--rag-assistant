Observations weight-age in a Machine Learning model

I want to know is there any way in R/Python to specify to the model to emphasize its learning more on specific subset of data , while it considers the whole data. For example - i have sales behavior data from 2011 to 2016 and i am predicting likelihood to buy in 2017 - i want the model to emphasize more on 2015-2016 data ( i.e. capture new learning - which may not be very evident when you consider the whole data from 2011 ). I can always build a separate model for for that time period or consider a time year variable for it to capture the effect , but is there some way to specify to the model that focus more on rows ( x to y ) as in give more weight-age to the learning from this subset from whole data.
