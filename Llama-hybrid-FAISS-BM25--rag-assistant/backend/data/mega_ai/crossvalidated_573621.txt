To add to Ben's great answer, since Nelder and McCullagh's GLMs (1983) is mentioned, I think it's fair to say that one important development after that was the extension of the GLM idea to other families of distributions, that generalize the single parameter exponential family. Important examples include both Beta and Dirichlet regressions, which are not GLMs in the N&M sense (see Why Beta/Dirichlet Regression are not considered Generalized Linear Models? ). Both are important to analyze continuous compositional data, in univariate and multivariate senses, respectively, as alternatives to log-ratio analysis. Here are the respective references: Ferrari, Silvia, and Francisco Cribari-Neto. "Beta regression for modelling rates and proportions." Journal of applied statistics 31, no. 7 (2004): 799-815. Hijazi, Rafiq Hamed. Analysis of compositional data using Dirichlet covariate models (thesis). American University, 2003. The Bayesian treatment of conditional models is much more direct, but only more recently the machinery (i.e. software and hardware) made it accessible to be used by most (BUGS was release in the 90s, for example). I cannot pinpoint a single reference for this however, but reading on Bayesian GLMs can be of help.
