How to parse the "request body" using python CGI?

I just need to write a simple python CGI script to parse the contents of a POST request containing JSON. This is only test code so that I can test a client application until the actual server is ready (written by someone else). I can read the cgi.FieldStorage() and dump the keys() but the request body containing the JSON is nowhere to be found. I can also dump the os.environ() which provides lots of info except that I do not see a variable containing the request body. Any input appreciated. Chris
