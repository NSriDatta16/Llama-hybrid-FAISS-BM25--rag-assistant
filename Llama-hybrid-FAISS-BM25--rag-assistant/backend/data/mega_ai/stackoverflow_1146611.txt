Linq to WMI looks pretty good. I just downloaded it and had a look at it. It basically wraps the ManagementObjectSearcher class of the System.Management namespace, builds an expression tree using the visitor pattern, executes your query and returns an IQueryable. Simple and elegant, the code is a joy to look at. http://linq2wmi.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=15434
