Show the posterior distribution is multivariate Gaussian

It is a Bayesian Regression, y and X are observed data, the response and the feature matrix respectively. \begin{eqnarray*} \mathbf y \mid \mathbf X,\mathbf w,\sigma^2 &\sim& N (\mathbf X \mathbf w, \sigma^2 \mathbf I ) \\ \mathbf w\mid \lambda &\sim &N(\mathbf 0, \lambda \mathbf I) \\ \sigma, \lambda >0 \end{eqnarray*} How could I show that $\mathbf w \mid \mathbf X , \mathbf y , \lambda , \sigma^2$ is multivariate Gaussian? And what is the mean vector and variance-covariance matrix? I have been looking into this for many days and dont know how to solve it at all. Thanks!
