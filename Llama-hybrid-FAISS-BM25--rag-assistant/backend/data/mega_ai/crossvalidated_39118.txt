I don't think I know more than you do, but the links you posted do suggest answers. I'll take http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/publications/supervised_kmeans-08.pdf as an example. Basically they state: 1) clustering depends on a distance. 2) successful use of k-means requires a carefully chosen distance. 3) Given training data in the form of sets of items with their desired partitioning, we provide a structural SVM method that learns a distance measure so that k-means produces the desired clusterings. In this case there is a supervised stage to the clustering, with both training data and learning. The purpose of this stage is to learn a distance function so that applying k-means clustering with this distance will be hopefully optimal, depending on how well the training data resembles the application domain. All the usual caveats appropriate to machine learning and clustering still apply. Further quoting from the article: Supervised clustering is the task of automatically adapting a clustering algorithm with the aid of a training set consisting of item sets and complete partitionings of these item sets. . That seems a reasonable definition.
