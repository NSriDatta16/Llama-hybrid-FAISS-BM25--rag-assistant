Time series for Intermittent (1 month per year) data in R

I am going to analyze some data for an intermittent operation using R. Let's say I operate a Xmas tree stand from Black Friday to Christmas Eve every year. Let's say I operate 150 different Xmas tree stands every year. Let's say I have data for revenue-per-day for these 150 Xmas tree stands for the last 6 years. I want to analyze this data to figure out how to maximize my profit. Trends that I expect to exist include Daily trends in volume (higher volume on weekends, etc) Trend of # of days before Xmas (start low, max somewhere then decrease probably) Which day of week Xmas is probably has an affect Year over year (should show Great Depression of 2008, then recovery etc) I want to know how many stands to operate, and if I would do better with half the stands but move them around to different locations on different days to capture max revenue with minimum costs. For instance, I might find that for year when Xmas is on Wednesday, Location A should not be manned until 3 weeks before Xmas, should be manned on Thursday, Friday and Saturday for that week, and only on Tuesday and Saturday for the next 2 weeks. Bad example, but hopefully shows what I'm looking for. I want to try this in R. My limited understanding of time series is stumped when I have ~335 days between data sets which require a resolution of 1 day. Should I instead add dummy variables of day of week, days before Xmas, year and just try to fit on them? Any insight would be appreciated.
