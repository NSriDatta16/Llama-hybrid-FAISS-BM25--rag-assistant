WPF: Resizing a circle, keeping the center point instead of TopLeft?

I'd like to resize a circle on my canvas with the help of a slider. This circle can be moved around on the canvas by some drag&drop stuff I did in code behind, so its position is not fixed. I have bound the slider's value to an ellipse's height and width. Unfortunately, when I use the slider, the circle gets resized with its top left point (actually the top left point of the rectangle it's sitting in) staying the same during the operation. I would like to resize it with its center point being constant during the operation. Is there an easy way to do this in XAML? BTW, I already tried ScaleTransform, but it didn't quite do what I wanted. Thanks a bunch! :-) Jan
