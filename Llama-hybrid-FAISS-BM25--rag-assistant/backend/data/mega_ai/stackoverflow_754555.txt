Not only are bug reports a suggestive measure but they are not really comparable. How "large" is the bug? One big bug may be worse than having 5 small ones... on the other hand it may not be. So you would need to get into the specifics of each individual bug (which is going to be a nightmare). You could go with how long it takes to fix each bug, but that can be easy to play - add a simple bug, fix it quickly, which counteracts the time it took to fix an honest to goodness bug that was harder to fix. You can use lint tools and unit tests to improve the code quality without being punitive. The lint one is a relativley simple process change that you work at over time (start off with X warnings on an existing code base and then reward the people that remove the most warnings over a period of time - turn it into a positive rather than a negative). Unit tests are another thing, reward the code with the fewest bugs and the most tests (if the tests are properly written then odds are the best tested code will have the fewest bugs). Again this is a positive reward and an encouraging thing for developers. The tests make the code better, and people are not penalized. There are many other things like this, but off the top of my head those will have a noticeable impact (and are impartially measurable) on the quality of the product - which is the end goal.
