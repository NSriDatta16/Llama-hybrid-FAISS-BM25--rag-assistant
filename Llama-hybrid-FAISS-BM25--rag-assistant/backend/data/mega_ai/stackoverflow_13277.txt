All of the following we use and integrate easiy in both our Maven 2.x builds and Eclipse/RAD 7: Testing - JUnit/TestNG Code analysis - FindBugs, PMD Code coverage - Clover In addition, in our Maven builds we have: JDepend Tag checker (TODO, FIXME, etc) Furthermore, if you're using Maven 2.x, CodeHaus has a collection of handy Maven plugins in their Mojo project . Note: Clover has out-of-the-box integration with the Bamboo CI server (since they're both Atlassian products). There are also Bamboo plugins for FindBugs, PMD, and CheckStyle but, as noted, the free Hudson CI server has those too.
