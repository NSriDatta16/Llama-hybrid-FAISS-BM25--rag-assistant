How to implement indoor navigation on the iPhone

I would like to locate the iPhone in a building to build an application with similar features as the iPhone app of the American Museum of Natural History . There is no good GPS reception as there are also rooms in the cellar I would like to cover. What can save me is that there is good wifi coverage in the whole area, so my idea was to triangulate the position based on the wifi base stations in range, whose positions are known. However I found no public API to find out which base stations are in range. Questions Do you have an idea how the app mentioned above manages to get the correct location indoors? Could one add the wifi base stations manually to Apple's database and use the usual CoreLocation? Do you have other ideas how to implement it? Any help is very much appreciated! Boundary conditions The indoor navigation is only used during an event to guide guests new to the building, so no complex infrastructure should be installed. There are approximately 14-18 rooms to be covered. They are in different parts of the building, so wiring everything up would be very costly. The preferred solution would not require a server backend of any kind and would work with a list of wifi access points and their corresponding locations.
