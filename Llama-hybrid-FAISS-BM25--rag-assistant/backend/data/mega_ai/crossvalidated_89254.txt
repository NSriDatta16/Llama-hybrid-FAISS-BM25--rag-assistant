CLT can be used for weighted sum of different Bernoulli variables?

Suppose $$ z_i \sim Bernoulli (p_i) $$ Can we use CLT for the following weighted sum? $$ S = \sum_i w_i z_i $$ i.e. can $S$ be approximated with a normal distribution? If yes, with which theorem? (I suppose the classical CLT holds only for average of iid variables)
