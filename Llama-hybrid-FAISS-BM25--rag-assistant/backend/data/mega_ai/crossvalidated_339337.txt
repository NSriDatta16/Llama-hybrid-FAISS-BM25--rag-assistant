The answer to my question became clear after we attempted to write the LME invocation in R. In the rotated coordinate system resulting from the PCA, we no longer have a direct representation of the response variable. There's no way to predict something you can no longer express! This told me my conception of the problem space was completely wrong. Then I realized that the supposed variance problem I described above is not really a problem. Here's the visualization that made it all come together for me: Consider the (pre-PCA) 3-D space that includes both explanatory variables and the response variable. The original sample set is a collection of vectors in this space with both explanatory and response variables as components. A linear correlation between explanatory and response variables implies that they fall roughly near a plane cutting through this space. Now consider the 2-D subspace formed by all positions in our 3-D sample space whose response value is zero. To project the samples onto this 2-D plane, we take just the explanatory components of our sample vectors, replacing all the response coordinates with zeros. This plane and the projected sample values in it is an embedded replica of the 2-D space formed from the explanatory variables alone. Finally, consider a PCA performed on the explanatory variables alone. If we find that PC1 explains 95% of the variance, we're saying that in the 2-D space with only explanatory variables, all samples are clustered near the PC1 axis. Remembering that this space is identical to the 2-D subspace of projected samples described above, we can infer that the original samples in the full 3-D space are also clustered around PC1, in the explanatory dimensions. We know this because of the shape of the shadow they cast onto the explanatory subspace. We still don't know for sure that the plane that roughly describes the samples in 3-D is not highly tilted, but since we never stray very far up or down that tilt, we're basically betting on a tilt that is not so extreme that a slight variance in PC2 will throw off the response values very significantly.
