Mediawiki: configuring the entry page, adding a new page

Have a wiki installed in our organization, and want to start using it. Failed to find the answers for the next 2 basic questions: How do I configure the entry page to show a list of all existing pages How do I create a new page (!). Only succeeded doing it by typing a url of an non existing page. Guess there are nicer methods for this Thanks Gidi
