Issue with custom loss function including parameters in keras autoencoder

I am writing an Autoencoder that tries to find parameters for 3D Meshes. For example, how bent an object is. I input the Mesh vertices but would like to include the true parameters versus the Autoencoders latent space in the loss function. I already wrote this function after some searching around but I don't know how to index from the current batch to get the right parameters from the numpy array param_true. So basically what I would like is to get the same batch from the param_true array as the Autoencoder is using at the moment so I can calculate the loss from the right elements. At the same time, I do not want to use the parameters as inputs. Thanks in advance!
