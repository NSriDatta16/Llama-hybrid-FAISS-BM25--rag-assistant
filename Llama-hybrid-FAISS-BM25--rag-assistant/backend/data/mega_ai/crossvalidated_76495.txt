1) This is a multiple regression. Presumably there are other variables. It may be the case that the specific variable in question has an effect on the response, but in the presence of the other variables its effect is not significant. I'd use partial least squares pairing the variable in question with the other variables to determine which other variables are "explaining away" the effect of the target variable and report my findings back to the contentious party, in addition to teaching them a little bit about multiple regression. 2) Investigate variable selection and dimensionality reduction methods. I'd start with lasso and PCA. If there's a large class imbalance in our small sample, I'd consider oversampling the minority case.
