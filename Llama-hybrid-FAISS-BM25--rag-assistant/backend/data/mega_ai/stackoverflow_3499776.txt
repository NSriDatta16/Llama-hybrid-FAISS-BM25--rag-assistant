Test Driven Development in Flash

I've recently been working on some bigger projects in Flash and would really like to be able to use Test Driven Development but haven't found a great way to do so. I'd imagine its a bit harder to do in flash as most of its projects require heavy user interactivity (drag and drop with mouse, keyboard input to move etc...). Does anybody know how I could effectively use this?
