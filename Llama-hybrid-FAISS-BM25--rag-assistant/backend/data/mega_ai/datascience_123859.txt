I build my first neural network! What's next?

For an assignment we are given a dataset and we need to build a neural network to make new predictions. Personal milestone; I built my first neural network! I followed the following steps on my own data set: https://machinelearningmastery.com/tensorflow-tutorial-deep-learning-with-tf-keras/ The initial set-up of a neural framework is fairly straight forward when following the steps in the tutorial. The next step is to tune the hyper parameters and here is where I get stuck. Important to note that my data set contains 22.000 observations with 160 parameters. There parameters are continuous variables, but also dummy variables. I learned about the number of layers, the size of a layer, the activation function within a layer and the batch size. There are so many possible combinations and that's where the problem arises. Preferably I do a grid search and let my machine run overnight, so that I can find out which combinations of hyper parameters works the best. However, then I still need to have a basic idea about the ranges of the parameters and the choices of the activation functions. What did I do myself?: I searched for autoML libraries and found the following: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/10-python-libraries-for-automated-machine-learning-that-you-should-think-to-use-in-2023-730a2694f221 I am considering using autosklearn.classification , but is it advised to do so? My question is: I have 0 intuition about tuning the hyper parameters (this is my first encounter with ML), how do I choose the right hyperparameters? It is advised to use the following code?: import autosklearn.classification cls = autosklearn.classification.AutoSklearnClassifier() cls.fit(X_train, y_train) predictions = cls.predict(X_test) Any advice would be very much appreciated!
