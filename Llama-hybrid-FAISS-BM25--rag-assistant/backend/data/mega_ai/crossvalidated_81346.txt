Trying different methods seems wise to me for the sake of understanding any differences in the results you receive from different analyses. Baron & Kenny's approach has received a fair amount of criticism (e.g., Pardo & Rom√°n, 2013 ; Hayes, 2009 ; Zhao, Lynch, & Chen, 2009 ; Krause et al., 2010 ), so alternatives to that would seem particularly worth exploring, ideally with attention to the problems that necessitate alternatives. [This may be an incomplete answer to your first question...] If you are interested theoretically in the mediation question, it makes sense to incorporate it into your introduction and discussion. I would argue that you should have (and communicate) some justification for every path in a model based on prior theory, but in some cases, the question may be simple, such as, "Will variable $a$ predict variable $b$ in roughly the same manner as previous researchers have found?" or, "Will the model fit adequately if I fix this path to one/zero?" Questions like these aren't really interesting so long as the answers are affirmative, so I would only recommend explaining why you're modeling these potentially (even probably, I'd hope) uninteresting paths the way you are (probably to reflect some well-supported theoretical assumption), and discussing any problematic results if they arise. By comparison, a novel question of mediation is probably more interesting regardless of whether the result is problematic: even a "null" result is still a result!
