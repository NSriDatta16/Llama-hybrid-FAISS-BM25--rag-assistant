I think this is an interesting question (+1), not because of Excel but because of the fact that it points out that there are two different definitions of $R^2$ and apparently Excel mixes both! As I said in my comment, because of the 'problem' described in Can the coefficient of determination $R^2$ be more than one? What is its upper bound? , there are two definitions of $R^2$: Let us first introduce some notation: your data are denoted as $y$ for the dependent variable and $x$ for the indpendent variable. You estimate a coefficient with the trend on the graph and with the linest function, you find $9.4382$. So you find that you can ''approximate'' $y$ by $\hat{y}= 9.4382 \times x$. So with your values for $x$ you find $\hat{y} = (509.66, 235.95, 132.13, 66.07)$. Obviously, $\hat{y}$ will not be identical to $y$ and you have a residual $\hat{u}= y - \hat{y} = (-51.66, 59.04, 71.86, 51.93)$. Further we will need the average of $y$, let's call it $\bar{y}=268.75$. $R^2$ for a model with an intercept: The 'usual' defintion of $R^2$ is computed as follows: take, the residuals $\hat{u}$, square them, and add them up, tis is the residual sum of squares, in your case you find $RSS=$14016.96; From each value of $y$, subtract the average, square all these numbers and add them up, this is the total sum of squares, in your case you have $TSS=63422.75$; $R^2$ is now equal to $1-\frac{RSS}{TSS}=1-\frac{14016.96}{63422.75}=0.7789$, this is approximately the value you find in your graph (the difference is probably due to rounding errors). $R^2$ for a model without an intercept: Because of the problems with $R^2$ in a model without an intercept (see Can the coefficient of determination $R^2$ be more than one? What is its upper bound? ), there is another defintion of $R^2$ for such a model: Take your $y$ values, square them, and add up these squares, you find $352329 $; Do the same for $\hat{y}$, you find, $337255.4384$; The $R^2$ is the second divided by the first, you find $0.957$, which is up to rouding errors your other value for $R^2$ that you have mentioned. As you see, excell has the first value in the graph for the trendline, and with 'linest' it has the second value. As the second value is the one for a model without an intercept, I would say that 'linest' is closer, but in general I would say that you should avoid models without an intercept. EDIT: because of your question in the comments I added this: @jake mcgregor You asked "could you explain your last statement a bit?", I assume that this means ''why should I avoid models without an intercept?'' The regression model $y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$ makes several assumptions, and when these assumptions are fullfilled then the estimated values of the $\beta_i$ have ''nice'' properties like unbiasedness ('right' on average), consistency (better and better as sample size increase) and efficiency (smallest variance). One of the assumptions is that the error term $\epsilon$ is has a mean that is equal to zero. If that assumption is not fullfilled then these 'nice' properties can not be shown. The assumption that $\epsilon$ has mean zero is not very restrictive, at least if your model has an intercept: indeed if the mean of error would not be zero , than, by adding the mean to the intercept $\beta_0$ it will be zero ! If you do not have an intercept, then this does not work, so if you do not include the intercept in your model, you have to be certain that the errors $\epsilon$ are zero on average, in other words you will have to have some theoretical result that 'guarantees' you that your line will pass through the origin (note these are two restrictions: 'line' and 'through the origin'), so you have to be sure about the functional form and the 'through the origin'. If you have no theoretical or other justfication for 'function through the origin' then it's just an assumption, but if your assumption is violated then the estimates of the coefficients may be biased.
