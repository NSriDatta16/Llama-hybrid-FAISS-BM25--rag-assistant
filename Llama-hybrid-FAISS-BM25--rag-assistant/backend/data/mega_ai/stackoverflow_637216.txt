I have Visual Web Developer 2008 (VWDExpress) and I was having same problem on dragging and dropping Silverlight controls. Based on advise from n8wrl, I closed VWDExpress and deleted all .tbd files from C:\Documents and Settings\\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\VWDExpress\9.0 folder. Started VWDExpress again and it works like charm.
