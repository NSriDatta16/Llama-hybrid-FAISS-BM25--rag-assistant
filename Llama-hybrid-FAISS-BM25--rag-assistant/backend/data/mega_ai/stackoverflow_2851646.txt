If you're dragging the form into another div on the drop function you'd want to reference the dropped item. You'd need to setup your drop area similar to this in order to get that items value. $("#dropArea").droppable({drop: function(event, ui) { var num = ui.draggable.val(); } }) The ui.draggable would be the dragged element. I didn't test the code with the .val() but I know this is how you would get the element being dropped so play around with it.
