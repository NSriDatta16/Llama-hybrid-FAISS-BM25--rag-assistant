So what I hear you saying is that, while you're really interested in the effect of the treatment $T$ on the outcome $O,$ there is another variable age, $A,$ that you think is likely confounding the results. You're absolutely right. Here is a causal diagram, as per Judea Pearl's ideas: There is a backdoor path from $T$ to $O:$ $T\leftarrow A\to O.$ Therefore, you must condition on $A$ to obtain the correct causal effect of $T$ on $O.$ You can use the backdoor adjustment formula: $$P(O=o|\operatorname{do}(T=t))=\sum_aP(O=o|T=t,A=a)\,P(A=a).$$ Here the first expression is saying, "What is the probability that I would get outcome $o$ if I set $T=t?$ That's what that ' $\operatorname{do}$ ' operator expresses. In words, you need to adjust, or condition, on the age to get the correct causal effect of the treatment. For more details, I would strongly encourage you to take a look at The Book of Why , by Pearl and Mackenzie, Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer , by Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell, and lastly, Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference , by Pearl.
