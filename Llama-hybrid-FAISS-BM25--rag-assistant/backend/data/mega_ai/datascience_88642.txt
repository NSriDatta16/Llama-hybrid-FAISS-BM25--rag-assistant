From a Machine Learning perspective, the answer would be to let the non tech users annotate a sample of products with scores and then train a model which predicts scores for all the products. Then the model could be refined and updated by regularly repeating this process, possibly using active learning in order to select the most useful instances and minimize the number of required manual annotations. Many variants are possible: users could be asked to just say whether they think a score is too high/low, or compare two products and say which one should have a higher score, etc.
