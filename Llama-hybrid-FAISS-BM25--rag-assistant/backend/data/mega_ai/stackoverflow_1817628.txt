Clicking the mouse down to drag objects on Mac

I've been using the following code to issue clicks programmatically on a Mac void PostMouseEvent(CGMouseButton button, CGEventType type, const CGPoint point) { CGEventRef theEvent = CGEventCreateMouseEvent(NULL, type, point, button); CGEventSetType(theEvent, type); CGEventPost(kCGHIDEventTap, theEvent); CFRelease(theEvent); } void Click(const CGPoint point) { PostMouseEvent(kCGMouseButtonLeft, kCGEventMouseMoved, point); NSLog(@"Click!"); PostMouseEvent(kCGMouseButtonLeft, kCGEventLeftMouseDown, point); PostMouseEvent(kCGMouseButtonLeft, kCGEventLeftMouseUp, point); } Now, I'm trying to click down to be able to drag objects, like a scroll bar or an application's window. I'm using the following: PostMouseEvent(kCGMouseButtonLeft, kCGEventMouseMoved, point); NSLog(@"Click Down!"); PostMouseEvent(kCGMouseButtonLeft, kCGEventLeftMouseDown, point); When i ran the code above something interesting will happen, when the left mouse down is issue nothing seem to happen, I move my mouse and the window doesn't move, however when I added a mouse up event then the window jumped to the location where I supposedly dragged it. this is sort of OK, however, how do I can make the mouse click down and drag an object? Note: I do have a whole method to see when the mouse stopped moving so I can click up. please post code. Thanks
