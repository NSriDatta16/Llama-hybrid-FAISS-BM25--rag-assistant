Big-O notation's definition

I really want to know the real definition. I have tried to read a book, but couldn't understand it. O: Big-O notation worst case. Θ: Theta notation average case. Ω: Omega notation best case. Why does Wikipedia represent the speed of algorithms just in Big-O including its average, best and worst cases? How come they did not replace with those formal keywords?
