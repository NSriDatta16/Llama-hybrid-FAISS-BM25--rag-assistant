a couple of datapoints: both GWT and jQuery ultimately execute as JavaScript inside the browser. they don't have any access to the network stack beyond being able to initiate AJAX requests (HTTP). SQLite isn't a server, it's a library embedded inside an executable. Most modern scripting languages (like PHP, Python, Ruby, etc) embed it in some library (either core or external). both HTML5 and Google Gears use SQLite to provide client-side data storage to client-side JavaScript apps; but it's all running inside the browser and therefore fully client-side. so.... there's no 'direct' route between GTW/jQuery to server-side SQLite
