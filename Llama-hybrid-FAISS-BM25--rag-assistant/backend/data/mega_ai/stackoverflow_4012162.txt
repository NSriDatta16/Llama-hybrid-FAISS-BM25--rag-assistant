How to avoiding writing switch-case too long?

In my current project, there are lots of code using switch statements with too many cases. Switch(c) { case CASENUMBERONE: //50-100 lines of code in each code ... case CASENUMBERTWENTY: .. } //thousands of lines of macro definition in another file #define CASENUMBERONE 1 ... #define CASENUMBERTWENTY 20 ... It seems not reasonable programming style. How to avoid this?
