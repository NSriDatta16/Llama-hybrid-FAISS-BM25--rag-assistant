i assume by instant you mean after every user edit action (or keypress or whatever)? it depends on what data you have here. if you have only text documents i see no reason why not to directly interact with the server but i would add some sleep time like for example: if the user edits something set a switch to edited = true, if the last commit is longer than 10 seconsd ago, commit the current state (the document may have changed in this time, use current state) set last commit switch to current time. i think a local buffer is very complicated and probably brings more pain than its useful. however if you decide to the common way to do it is to fill the buffer at a higher frequency (but using the method described above), and let it transmit to the server at a lower frequency (also using the methods above). a timestamp/incrementid is passed from the first to the second to the third buffer etc. when restoring the content from all buffers or storage servesr is fetched and the latest version (with the increment id from the first buffer) is used.
