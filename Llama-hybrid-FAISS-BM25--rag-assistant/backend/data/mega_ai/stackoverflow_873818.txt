Firstly, you want to use [self setWantsLayer: YES] . Also, it's only important to call -setLayer: before -setWantsLayer: if you want to provide a specific CALayer subclass (such as a CAScrollLayer); if you just want a regular CALayer you just call -setWantsLayer: and it'll be created for you. Even better, just check the 'wants layer' option in Interface Builder. Secondly, the entire point of using a layer-backed view is that you can continue to use the regular NSView methods and get the free CoreAnimation 'tweening' effects. If you want to use CoreAnimation as your only means of moving items around, then the correct way to do so is to create a layer backed view which contains your pure-CALayer presentation hierarchy. I've not looked at any freely-available CoreAnimation tutorials, but I can definitely recommend the Pragmatic Programmers' book on the subject . They also have a screencast available by the book's author.
