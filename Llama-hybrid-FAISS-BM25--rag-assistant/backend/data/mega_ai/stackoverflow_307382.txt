How do I get the Visual Studio Load Test Agent to use the servers second CPU

I am running a Visual Studio Load Test using an Agent on one of our servers. This server has two CPU and I have a licence for the Test Agent to use both. My question is how do I configure the Test Agent service to use the second cpu?
