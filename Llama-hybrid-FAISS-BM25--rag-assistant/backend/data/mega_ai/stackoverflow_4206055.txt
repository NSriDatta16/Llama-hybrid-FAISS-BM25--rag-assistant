I think software like you describe is not strictly thrown away but may have to be refactored beyond all recognition, probably after first writing a bunch of tests to make sure nothing breaks during the process. At that point, was it thrown away or not? I would say yes, although the final EXE name and visible operation may be the same. In short, I think this may be more a matter of semantics, and pragmatism in the face of real-world constraints, than actual best practice.
