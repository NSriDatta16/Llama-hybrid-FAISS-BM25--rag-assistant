Text Clustering using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity

I am attempting to perform hierarchical clustering using (Tf-Idf & cosine distance) on about 25,000 documents that vary in length between 1-3 paragraphs each. With the method above, my question is, should I leave all terms in my matrix and perform the TF-IDF calculation? I understand a lot of times with these situations, removing sparse terms reduces your matrix substantially, however isn't the less frequent words the ones it would give more weight to?
