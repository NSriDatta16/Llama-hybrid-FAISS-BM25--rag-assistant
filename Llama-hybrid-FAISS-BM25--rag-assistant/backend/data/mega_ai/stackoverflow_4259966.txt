The #xxx fragment identifier is not sent to the server by the browser (you would have to check if that's the practice only or required by some RFC/standard). So for your case you can't read the #xxx part in Acegi/Spring Security. It's not clear why you would want to do this, but you could always try to read the value in JavaScript (client-side) and have it sent to the server in other way.
