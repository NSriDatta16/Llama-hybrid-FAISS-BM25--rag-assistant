Those are the information that I found. Some of them might be valuable to You: Theory: Woflrams Information about matrices and additional ones on Wikipedia Matrices by Pam Norton - very good book, available at Google Books for free. Orthographic and perspective projections 3D transformations at MSDN (Searching for "Matrices" at Google books gives You lots of lecutures, some of which are directly connected with transformations - this is one of the first results, but I cheer You to check more.) Articles like this one , or maybe this or this are easily found with help of Google, so I will not post more. There were also few questions about matrices on StackOverflow.com : Using 3d transformation matrices and How to apply a transformation matrix? are just first few examples, You can find more looking for the matrix or math tags. I also encourage (I don't know if this is the right word, I am just learning English) You, to look for this kind of information in one of those books (though they are not free, but You can find large parts of older ones on Google Books): Game programming gems 7 Game programming gems 6 Game programming gems 5 Game programming gems 4 Game programming gems 3 Game programming gems 2 Game programming gems Each of those has section about math gems - and there are lots of neat tricks there. Those books are worth every cent. There are also GPU Programming gems, so You might try them too. Practice: OpenGl Book at Wikipedia has section about matrices in OpenGl (also, using matrices in OpenGl is described here and here ) Drawing 3D room in DirectX + info about matrix transformations. If I will find more, I will edit and add links here, but to be honest - I found those links in about 10 minutes of using google. World's most popular browser stores data about everything - and yes, "everything" means matrices too. Cheers, Mate.
