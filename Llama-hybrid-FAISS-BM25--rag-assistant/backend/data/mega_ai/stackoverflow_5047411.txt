So, after more digging, I found out that Visual Studio (2008 in my case) has a load test setting called WebTest Connection Model under the Run Settings. It is set to Connection Per User by default. I changed it to Connection Pool . The average page response time has gone down to the point where it is similar to HTTP traffic, and I do not see any handshakes after the initial connections. More about the WebTest Connection Model setting.
