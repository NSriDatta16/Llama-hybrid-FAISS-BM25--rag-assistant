A different approach is to use ping and arp tools. Since ARP packets can only stay in the same broadcast domain, you could ping your network's broadcast address and every client will reply with an ARP response. Each of those responses are cached in your ARP table, which you can view with the command arp -a . So the rundown: rem Clear ARP cache netsh interface ip delete arpcache rem Ping broadcast addr for network 192.168.1.0 ping -n 1 192.168.1.255 rem View ARP cache to see if the MAC addr is listed arp -a Some of these can be done in managed code, such as in the System.Net.NetworkInformation namespace. Note: Clearing the ARP cache may have a marginal affect on network performance by clearing cached entries of other local servers. However, the cache is usually cleared every 20 minutes or less anyway.
