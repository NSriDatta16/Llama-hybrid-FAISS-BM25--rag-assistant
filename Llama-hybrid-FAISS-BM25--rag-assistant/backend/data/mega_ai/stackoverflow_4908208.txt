Node* revHead; // ... while(current != NULL) { //check if it's the first one being added if(revHead == NULL) You don't initialize revHead but you use it. (I hope it is already clear to you that revHead is a local variable used to store a memory address, and not something that exists outside the method/procedure) The Storage Class of revHead is automatic (aka in the local scope-body). In C++ when you do a declaration like that, there is not guarantee that the value will be 0 . (unless the storage class is of type static or the variable is global where it is automatically initialized to 0 if no other value is provided. In your case the variable has storage class of type auto which means it is locally defined in a function, and when declaring a local variable, without specifying a value, the value is garbage. Keep in mind that with the next C++ Standard C++0x the keyword auto has a new meaning). The value in your case is garbage which makes the if fail. See more Information here : Link Do a Node* revHead = NULL; Keep in mind that maybe you may have errors like that in other part of your code as well.
