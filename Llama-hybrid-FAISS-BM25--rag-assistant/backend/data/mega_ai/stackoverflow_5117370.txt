Frustration at trying to output two specific values from an Array

I am doing my head in trying to do a simple retrieval for specific arrays within a script so I have an original associative array: $vNArray ['Brandon'] = $item[3]; $vNArray['Smith']= $item[4]; $vNArray ['Johnson']= $item[5]; $vNArray ['Murphy']= $item[6]; $vNArray ['Lepsky']= $item[7]; Which outputs a common result for most values: foreach ($vNArray as $key => $value){ if(!empty($value)){ $result .= "\t\t\t\t $key " .$value. " \n"; } But then I want two of these arrays to render differently so I added another script suggested by someone: $display_id=array('Brandon', 'Murphy'); foreach ($vNArray as $key => $value){ if(!empty($value)){ //Looks into the display_id array and renders it differently if (in_array($key, $display_id)) { $result .= "\t\t\t\t $key $value \n"; } else { $result .= "\t\t\t\t $key $value \n"; } } } The problem is that i want the result for these arrays to contain both within the first result but when I tried to output $result .= "\t\t\t\t $key[1] ".$value[1]." \n"; PHP thinks that the index is the value's character index, so I'm having major syntax issues like id="/" r . I have also tried $result .= "\t\t\t\t $key[1] ". $display_id['Murphy']$value." \n"; But I am still getting wrong syntax issues...like syntax error, unexpected T_VARIABLE Or some other error like this. Could someone please help? EDITED I have made the syntax corrections but I still need to specify the index: The result from result .= "\t\t\t\t " . $key[1] . " ". $display_id['Murphy'] . $value." \n"; Needs to be (Note how each value is on the same output depending on what I'm targeting): Brandon Murphy Value Right now it ignores the index value of . $display_id['Brandon'] . $value. or . $display_id['Murphy'] . $value." all together and just repeats: Brandon Brandon Value Murphy Murphy Value
