It helps when you are trying to optimize for the hardware you are targeting. Take a hard drive for example, it helps to write software that takes advantage of locality to minimize seek time. If you just treat a hard drive as 'it works', and stick files and data all over the place, you will run into severe fragmentation issues and result in lower performance. A lot of this is taken into consideration when designing an operating system since you are trying to maximize performance. So in short, learning something about it can help, and certainly can't hurt in any way.
