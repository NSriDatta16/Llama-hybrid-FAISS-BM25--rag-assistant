"Rotations" is an approach developed in factor analysis; there rotations (such as e.g. varimax) are applied to loadings , not to eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Loadings are eigenvectors scaled by the square roots of the respective eigenvalues. After the varimax rotation, the loading vectors are not orthogonal anymore (even though the rotation is called "orthogonal"), so one cannot simply compute orthogonal projections of the data onto the rotated loading directions. @FTusell's answer assumes that varimax rotation is applied to the eigenvectors (not to loadings). This would be pretty unconventional. Please see my detailed account of PCA+varimax for details: Is PCA followed by a rotation (such as varimax) still PCA? Briefly, if we look at the SVD of the data matrix $X=USV^\top$, then to rotate the loadings means inserting $RR^\top$ for some rotation matrix $R$ as follows: $X=(UR)(R^\top SV^\top).$ If rotation is applied to loadings (as it usually is), then there are at least three easy ways to compute varimax-rotated PCs in R : They are readily available via function psych::principal (demonstrating that this is indeed the standard approach). Note that it returns standardized scores , i.e. all PCs have unit variance. One can manually use varimax function to rotate the loadings, and then use the new rotated loadings to obtain the scores; one needs to multiple the data with the transposed pseudo-inverse of the rotated loadings (see formulas in this answer by @ttnphns ). This will also yield standardized scores. One can use varimax function to rotate the loadings, and then use the $rotmat rotation matrix to rotate the standardized scores obtained with prcomp . All three methods yield the same result: irisX This yields three identical outputs: 1 -1.083475 0.9067262 2 -1.377536 -0.2648876 3 -1.419832 0.1165198 4 -1.471607 -0.1474634 5 -1.095296 1.0949536 Note: The varimax function in R uses normalize = TRUE, eps = 1e-5 parameters by default ( see documentation ). One might want to change these parameters (decrease the eps tolerance and take care of Kaiser normalization) when comparing the results to other software such as SPSS. I thank @GottfriedHelms for bringing this to my attention. [Note: these parameters work when passed to the varimax function, but do not work when passed to the psych::principal function. This appears to be a bug that will be fixed.]
