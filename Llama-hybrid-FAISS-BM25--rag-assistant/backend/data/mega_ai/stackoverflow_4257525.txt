I found a solution! problem was a bug in IE 6/7/8/9 and maybe older version, where when using a secure connection ssl, loading of swf file doesn't succeed because a bug in IE. I've solved this problem by overriding the cache with a filter in my application: hresponse.setDateHeader("Expires", -1); hresponse.setDateHeader("Last-Modified", System.currentTimeMillis()); hresponse.setHeader("Pragma", ""); hresponse.setHeader("cache-control", "must-revalidate"); hope will be useful for someone else! Thanks
