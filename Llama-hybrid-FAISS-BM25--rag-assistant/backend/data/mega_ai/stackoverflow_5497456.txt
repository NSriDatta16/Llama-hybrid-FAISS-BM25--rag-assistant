Should I store all my Product information in Product objects or split it between Product object and CMS Page?

I have a CMS app I'm building and I'm adding ecommerce functionality. I'm pondering a design choice and wondered if anyone had thoughts? I have product model objects, and a page in the CMS which is describing each product. Logically I'm wondering if all information about a product should go in the product model or if some should go in the CMS page. Either approach will work no doubt, I'm just wondering if anyone has thoughts on which may be best and why. Storing the information in separate Product model and CMS Page models seems more logical, as some information belongs to the product and some information belongs to the page. So the Product stores things which are inherent properties of the product. Eg: Name, Price Images, Features, and the Page stores things which are for selling the product. Eg, benefits, how it works diagram, sales info. But I think storing all the info in the one model is more pragmatic. If I have a separate CMS page and product, a user will need to enter and maintain information in two places, a user could also end up unintentionally tying the wrong product to the wrong page, and to take a product offline would require disabling two things. I think I sometimes spend way too long thinking about these things. Any thoughts? I think I'm favouring the pragmatic approach.
