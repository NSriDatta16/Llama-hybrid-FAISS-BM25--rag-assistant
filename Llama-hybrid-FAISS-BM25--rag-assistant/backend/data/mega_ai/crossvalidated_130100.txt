As mentioned in the comments, the model you're looking for is Bayesian linear regression . And since we can use BLR to calculate the posterior predictive distribution $p(r_t|t, \mathcal{D}_\text{ref})$ for any time $t$, we can numerically evaluate the distribution $p(\text{CAR}|\mathcal{D}_\text{event}, \mathcal{D}_\text{ref})$. The thing is, I don't think a distribution over $\text{CAR}$ is what you really want. The immediate problem is that $p(\text{CAR} = 0|\mathcal{D}_\text{event}, \mathcal{D}_\text{ref})$ has probability zero. The underlying problem is that the "Bayesian version of hypothesis tests" is comparing models via their Bayes factor , but that requires you to define two competing models. And $\text{CAR} = 0, \text{CAR} \neq 0$ are not models (or at least, they're not models without some extremely unnatural number juggling). From what you've said in the comments, I think what you actually want to answer is Are $\mathcal{D}_\text{ref}$ and $\mathcal{D}_\text{event}$ better explained by the same model or by different ones? which has a neat Bayesian answer: define two models $M_0$: all the data in $\mathcal{D}_\text{ref}, \mathcal{D}_\text{event}$ is drawn from the same BLR. To calculate the marginal likelihood $p(\mathcal{D}_\text{ref}, \mathcal{D}_\text{event}|M_0)$ of this model, you'd calculate the marginal likelihood of a BLR fit to all the data. $M_1$: the data in $\mathcal{D}_\text{ref}$ and $\mathcal{D}_\text{event}$ are drawn from two different BLRs. To calculate the marginal likelihood $p(\mathcal{D}_\text{ref}, \mathcal{D}_\text{event}|M_1)$ of this model, you'd fit BLRs to $\mathcal{D}_\text{ref}$ and $\mathcal{D}_\text{event}$ independently (though using the same hyperparameters!), then take the product of the two BLR marginal likelihoods. Having done that, you can then calculate the Bayes factor $$\frac{p(\mathcal{D}_\text{ref}, \mathcal{D}_\text{event}|M_1)}{p(\mathcal{D}_\text{ref}, \mathcal{D}_\text{event}|M_0)}$$ to decide which model is more believable.
