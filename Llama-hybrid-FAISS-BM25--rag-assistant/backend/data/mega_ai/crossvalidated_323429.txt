In principle as a first indication you could do a t-test comparing e.g. the mean age of those that opt for the comfortable option with the mean age of those that do not. This will tell you whether the average traveller in the comfortable option is older than the one in the uncomfortable one. A similar procedure can be followed for journey time. Incidentally I prefer boxplots to visualize these individual differences. There is, however, a bit of a problem with that approach because it doesn't account for the effects simultaneously (which seems to be what your after). Suppose that the people that are older are also mostly the ones that travel longer, then the reason why you find a difference in say the t-test for age might well be that older people are also the ones with more travel time. Fron the question I gather you want to estimate whether the probability of selecting a comfortable option increases with age and journey time. You can do so with binary choice models where you model how the probability of selecting one option changes with other variables. That would allow you to account for the effect of age and journey time simultaneously. The two basic approaches in that field are called logit and probit. Although more advanced this will give you a more complete picture. There is no need to reshape your data, in the code below I analysed your original dataframe, which I find simpler. #Replace your "type"character variable with a numeric one (you could use a factors if you wanted to) df$Type Chi) 1 530 344.80 2 528 336.97 2 7.8274 0.01997 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Using a likelihood ratio test you see that your model as a whole is significant. Now let's look at the model and its coefficients summary(model1) Call: glm(formula = Type ~ Times + Age, family = binomial(), data = df) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.7409 -0.4999 -0.4177 -0.3628 2.4482 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Given that this is a logit model we cannot interpret the coefficients directly but we only see that the probability of taking transport type 1 increases with age. If you want some more meaning you can calculate the odds ratio: exp(model1$coefficients) (Intercept) Times Age 0.0275972 1.0163903 1.0252242 The odds (NOT the probability) of taking transport type 1 are multiplied with 1.02 for each additional year of age. Or calculate the marginal effect. I typically use the mfx package for that: require(mfx) logitmfx( Type~Times+Age, data = df) Call: logitmfx(formula = Type ~ Times + Age, data = df) Marginal Effects: dF/dx Std. Err. z P>|z| Times 0.00138519 0.00091086 1.5208 0.12832 Age 0.00212254 0.00096313 2.2038 0.02754 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 At the mean time and age in the dataset, an additional year of age increases the probability of taking type 1 transport with 0.002. Significant, but not a terribly large effect. If you use ggplot you can visualize your results as well. #Create a new dataframe with Times set at the mean df2 Which gives you this: Finally, if you want to read up on these things there are many resources around the web, with varying degrees of technicality, such as these: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EocjYP5h0cE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cFYlMjEz-c https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9P888Lxde8 More examples and tests can a.o. be found here: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/logit.htm
