Simulation of Poisson data with a endogenous regressor

My simulation setup goes like this: I draw my dependend variable as $Y\sim \text{Poi}\left(\lambda\right)$ where $\lambda = \exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2z + u\right)$ and $z = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1x_1 + v$ $u\sim N(0,1)$, $v\sim N(0,1)$ The endogenous regressor $z$ within the $\lambda$-equation is now being created by letting $\text{Cov}(u,v)=p$ using a Cholesky-Decomposition approach. The issue I'm currently facing seems to be silly but even if I set $p=0$ I'll get a biased estimate of $\beta_0$. This seems strange as $v,u$ are chosen such that they are zero on average. Why is there a bias within $\widehat{\beta}_0$?
