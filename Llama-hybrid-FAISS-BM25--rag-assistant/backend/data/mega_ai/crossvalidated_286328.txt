Literature reference on average ranking

Does anyone have a literature reference on application of average (weighted) ranking in scientific publications (biology, chemistry)? An example is this paper, with application in algorithm ranking: http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/pdf/specific/congreso/brazdil00comparison.pdf Here the algorithms are ranked by three different measured error rates from 1 to last. Then, an average rank is calculated from these three, which gives some kind of "total rank".
