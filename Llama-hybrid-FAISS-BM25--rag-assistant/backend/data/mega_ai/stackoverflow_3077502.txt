Organizing django-tagging tags or assigning properties to tags?

I'd like to categorize my tags. Here's an example of the tags I have now: css, internet-explorer, firefox, floats Each of those are separate tags ( 4 in total obviously ). I would like to mark the internet-explorer and firefox tags as browsers. Does django-tagging offer some sort of way for doing this or do I have to manually edit the schema? I really don't care if I have to either tag tags or add a new column to the tags table, whichever is the easiest way in accordance with the plugin.
