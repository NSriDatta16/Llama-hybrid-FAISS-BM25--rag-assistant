Why does isna()/isnull() function show different values compared to value_counts()?

I am quite new to Machine Learning/Data science so I started doing my first Kaggle competition problem from here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques I was cleaning the training dataset and filling some categorical features with mode values and after sometime I noticed something very strange. I filled the missing values of column 'MasVnrType' with mode and it turned out it filled all of them with None Values even though isna().sum() shows only 8 missing values. Is there some understanding that I'm lacking?
