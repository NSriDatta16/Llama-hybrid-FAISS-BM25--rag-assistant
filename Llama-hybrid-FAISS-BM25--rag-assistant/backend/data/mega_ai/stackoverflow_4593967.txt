How do I check if an IsolatedStorageFile exists?

We have code like: try { streamOptions = new IsolatedStorageFileStream( “FileName”, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read); } catch ( FileNotFoundException ) { this.userSettings = new UserSettings(); load = false; } This make Visual Studio break into the debugger often when I am debugging, therefore I wish to protect the above code with a “if”, so it only runs when the IsolatedStorageFile exists. However it is not clear how to use IsolatedStorageFile.FileExists() to check for the file that IsolatedStorageFileStream is about to open , e.g. what options do I have to give when I "new" a IsolatedStorageFile object.
