I am about to create a complex feature in a Ruby on Rails app, what's a good way to organize it out on paper before coding?

I am new to rails but have read a book and created small features before. I'm now about to create a big new feature for an application (it really just involves a lot of forms and relationships) and I was wondering if anyone has a good/consistent strategy for pre-coding.
