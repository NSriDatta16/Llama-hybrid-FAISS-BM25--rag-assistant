Browser capabilities redirect in asp.net mvc

I want to detect certain browsers (IE6) and redirect them to a page that tells them to get a better browser. Same thing for detection of Javascript being enabled, if the browser has it disabled I want to send them to a page which explains this fact. Is there an elegant or preferred way to do this in mvc?
