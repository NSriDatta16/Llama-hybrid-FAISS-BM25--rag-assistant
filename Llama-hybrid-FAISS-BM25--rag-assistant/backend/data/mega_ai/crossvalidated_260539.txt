Encoding random variables with binary strings

It is said that a random variable $X$ with a uniform distribution over 4 outcomes needs a binary string of 2 bits to encode (eg, Cover & Thomas 2nd Ed., p.5; and it corresponds to the entropy of $X$, the fundamental lower bound in the length of the encoding string). But I am wondering what prevents us from using the following encoding scheme which uses only 1.5 bits on average: String '0' for the first outcome String '1' for the second outcome String '00' for the third outcome String '01' for the fourth outcome Thanks!
