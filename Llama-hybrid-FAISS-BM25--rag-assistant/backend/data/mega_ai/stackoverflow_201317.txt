How would you notifiy clients about changed data on the server using .Net 2.0?

Imagine a WinForms client app that displays fairly complex calculated data fetched from a server app with .Net Remoting over a HTTPChannel. Since the client app might be running for a whole workday, I need a method to notify the client that new data is available so the user is able to start a reload of the data when he needs to. Currently I am using remoted .Net events, serializing the event to the client and then rethrowing the event on the side of the client. I am not very happy with this setup and plan to reimplement it. Important for me is: .Net 2.0 based technology easy of use low complexity robust enough to survive a server or client restart still functional When limited to .Net 2.0, how would you implement such a feature? What technologies / libraries would you use? I am looking for inspiration on how to attack the problem. Edit: The client and server exist in the same organisation, typically a LAN, perhaps a WAN/VPN situation. This mechanism should only make the client aware that there is new data available. I'd like to keep remoting for getting the actual data to the client since that is working pretty well. MSMQ comes with windows, doesn't it? So it should be ok to use it, but I'm open to any alternative.
