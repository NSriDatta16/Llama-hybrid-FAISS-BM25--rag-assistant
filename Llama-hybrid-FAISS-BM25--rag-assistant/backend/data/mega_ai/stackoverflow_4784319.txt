styling with css (chrome problems)

Hello I've got this weird problem with css. I'm displaying an unordered list PMI GRANDS COMPTES associations PME ecoles privees organisme test now this is accompanied by these css rules: .align-right{ float: right; } .align-left{ float: left; } On chrome, the bullet point from the list is actually UNDER the text for the bullet point. Why did I do this, I want the images to be aligned from top down. here are screenshots of the problem thanks in advance.
