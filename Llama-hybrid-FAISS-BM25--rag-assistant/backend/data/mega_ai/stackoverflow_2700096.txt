Thanks for your help, it helped a lot finding the issue. The hint with the path helped me "seeing what is going on" and finding the troublemaker. BTW, this snippet config = ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(ConfigurationUserLevel.PerUserRoamingAndLocal) config.FilePath is useful finding the storage location. My problem was that I called Reset() before Reload(). Actually my test case checks whether the objects are stored correctly, so it saves and reloads the settings. I was unaware of the fact, that Reset() "resets and saves on disk" - I was assuming it only resets in memory. I must only call Reload(). Since all test cases have their own directory, the settings have to be created (saved) within the test case.
