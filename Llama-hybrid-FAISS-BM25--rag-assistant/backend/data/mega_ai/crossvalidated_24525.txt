I can give you few hints: You could use dynamic time warping to extract similarity between your sequences. Please see : Can someone please explain dynamic time warping for determining time series similarity? Cave plot (visualization as you have stated) is another option. http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/departments/sia/project/misc/caveplot.html If you use R, http://www.rdatamining.com/examples/ts-mining may give you some hint You may want to see a discussion on similar topic at Time series 'clustering' in R
