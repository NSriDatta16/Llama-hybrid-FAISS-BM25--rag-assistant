ASP.NET Web Application Instant Messanging Options

I'm looking into building an IM feature into our internal website (so this is not going to be a commercial application) and I was hoping I could get some ideas regarding already available sort of off-the-self solutions I could use. I found the Google Jabber.NET code that I could leverage if I put an AJAX wrapper around it but I haven't downloaded the code yet to see how feasible it would be. Beyond this and the obvious Google searches I haven't done anything yet. So, have you ever had to develop a web-based IM client into an ASP.NET web application? And if so - what did you use.. I'm only interested in off-the-self solutions since I'm already aware of the alternative of rolling my own which is what I will do if there isn't anything available that I could use. The idea is that since this an internal tool we'd like to spend as little time on it because nobody is paying for the development :p Many thanks! P.S. Something like the Ajax IM Framework Project is what I'm looking for, but for .NET
