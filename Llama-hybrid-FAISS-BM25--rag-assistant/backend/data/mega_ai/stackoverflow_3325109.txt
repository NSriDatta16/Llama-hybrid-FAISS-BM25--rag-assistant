Localstorage is for saving data client side so that it can be accessed even if the client is offline, in which case it is accessed, as you said, using JavaScript. PHP sessions store information on the server. Using localStorage is also a bad idea because it can be modified by the client, so the client could claim to be logged in as a different user which is obviously a security issue. Is there a problem with your PHP configuration? Is there a timeout value for the PHP session cookie that you can change?
