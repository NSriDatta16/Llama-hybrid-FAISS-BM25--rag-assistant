Apparently @WilliamMorgan and I think alike. I just released last night to Github what I now see is a similar library to Trollop (Named how?) after having done a search for OptionParser on Github, see Switches There are a few differences, but the philosophy is the same. One obvious difference is that Switches is dependent on OptionParser.
