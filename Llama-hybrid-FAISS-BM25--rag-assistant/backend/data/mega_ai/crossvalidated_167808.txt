The term data science is applicable here. I do this sort of work a lot, and although it doesn't contain very difficult statistical models, it gives your stakeholders new insights thanks to data. When you do a proper job and end up with a clean data set, your data will be so useful that you suddenly see opportunities to use them in models at the end. Some more terms that I use: data gathering for the scraping data cleaning data exploration for figuring out what you would like to show ( I would not use the term data mining here, it is not applicable ) dashboard, that is the most common term for the end product you are building ( although I dislike the term, lots of people are familiar with it. ) For a reference of terms, you can maybe check out the coursera classes of John Hopkins ( https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=spark_cdp_sidebar ) They have around 10 modules, each with a step of your process. The names of these modules might help you. Hope this made sense / helped.
