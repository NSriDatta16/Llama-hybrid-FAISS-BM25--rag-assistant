You quote from the quantitative finance industry, and coincidentally I worked in QF so I think my experience should be useful. In the past, we call the QF statisticians as " quant ", now we call them " data scientist ". Classical "quant" knowledge include C++ programming, but nowadays companies prefer Python/Ruby/Scalar/R. C++ programming would be better reserved for professional software engineers. Indeed, there is little market for statistical development in new QF models. Companies have money for a FINCAD license, so why should they hire a quant model developer? Black Scholes is done. The exotic option models once dominated the model disappeared after the credit crisis, as the financial industry prefer simpler vanilla products. Don't worry ... there're lot's of jobs on the market. Open up your favourite career website, and you will see tons of data scientist positions. Good statistics knowledge is important for data science. The future for statisticians is bright, in finance and also many other areas. Strong knowledge in statistics and computing will make you a strong candidate. Candidates with only programming experience won't be a good data scientist. Have you scanned our questions? We have tons of questions asked by programmers, they could write R-scripts but they wouldn't have any idea how to interpret the results. This site is flooded by unqualified software programmers, and you don't want to be one of them. Distancing yourself from them will make you useful for jobs like: Machine learning development and validation Big data analytics Biostatistics Precision medicine Automatic driving Mobile apps analytics many more... Future statisticians need good computing skills .
