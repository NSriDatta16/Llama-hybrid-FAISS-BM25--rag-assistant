magento https/http redirection

Is there a way to redirect domains based on its parameters in magento. Eg: if user trying to load https://stage.domain.com/ the system should redirect it to http://stage.domain.com/ , if user trying to load https://stage.domain.com/all_access_profile the system should redirect it to http://stage.domain.com/all_access_profile , But the rest can goto its actual link what user actually requested. I have got this one from @stackoverflow RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. RewriteCond %{HTTPS}s ^on(s)| RewriteRule ^ http%1://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301] This one is always redirecting. How this needs to be changed to get url parameters based redirection. Thanks
