Android Widgets can only contain Layout-Widgets supported by RemoteViews . See this list : A RemoteViews object (and, consequently, an App Widget) can support the following layout classes: FrameLayout LinearLayout RelativeLayout And the following widget classes: AnalogClock Button Chronometer ImageButton ImageView ProgressBar TextView > Descendants of these classes are not supported. Pay attention to the last sentence. You can not change this behaviour, it is hard coded in android.
