Open Source FIX Client Simulator

I want test a FIX gateway for our company and was wondering if anything in opensource already exists that I can use or perhaps leverage to complete this task. I am currently looking at QuickFix but I am not sure if it has a client that can be used against any standard FIX gateway. Also links to any learning material that exist on this topic would be appreciated.
