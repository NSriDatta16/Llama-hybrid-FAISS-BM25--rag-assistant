Update: look at spring-mobile Original answer: It would be pretty simple to create a custom ViewResolver that resolves views based on the User-Agent header. here is a list of mobile user agents (page removed from wikipedia). Check the header against it, and resolve a mobile view. if the user-agent is not a mobile, then return null , thus letting other resolvers resolve a view. make sure your resolvers are defined (in the spring xml) in the proper order, so that the mobile resolver is consulted first.
