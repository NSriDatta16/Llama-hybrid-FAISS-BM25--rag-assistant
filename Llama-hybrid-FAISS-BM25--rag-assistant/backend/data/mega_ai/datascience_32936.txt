As indicated by @hssay, your way seems to be PoS tagging and then removing verbs. If you don't want to get your hands dirty, you might prefer to use the off-the-shelf Google natural language web API . If you try the UI, click on the Analyse button, and then under the Syntax tab, look for Part of Speech and VERB. Another similar toolkit that you could use as an API is StanfordNLP .
