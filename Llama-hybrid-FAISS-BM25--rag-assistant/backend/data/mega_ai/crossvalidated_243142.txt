Why is my ARIMA forecast so poor?

I have a time series going from 2013 until late 2016. I am using the auto.arima function in R to forecast the next 12 months. I get the following where the black line are my observations and the blue line is my prediction. fcast However when I use this custom arima function I get a much better result fit Why is the auto.arima function not producing a result that doesn't seem anywhere near as good. I know they are using different parameters but I would have thought that auto.arima would have found the best parameters and forecasted using those?
