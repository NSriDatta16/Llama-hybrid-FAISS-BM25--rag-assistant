Trying to understand the mathmatics behind the matlab equations in anamolous detection in Andrew's machine learning

Basically I do not understand the mathematics behind the follow in Andrew machine learning on anomalous detection. X = bsxfun(@minus, X, mu(:)'); p = (2 * pi) ^ (- k / 2) * det(Sigma2) ^ (-0.5) * ... exp(-0.5 * sum(bsxfun(@times, X * pinv(Sigma2), X), 2)); The P signifies the multivariate Gaussian distribution
