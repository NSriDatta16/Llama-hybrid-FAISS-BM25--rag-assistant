From the looks of your code, you're probably already "caching" the chosen size of the image. That is, Magento doesn't have to invoke GD to resize the image on the fly. However, the 500 images still have to be requested from Apache, which is going to be a complete pain the first time no matter what you do. Make sure that Apache is configured to allow browser-size caching of media such as those JPGs for a pretty long period of time and you shouldn't have to re-download the images on every page load. Aside from that, you may want to devise a strategy to use fewer images and request more only as they are needed. It's unlikely that a user can really focus on 500 images in any meaningful way. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
