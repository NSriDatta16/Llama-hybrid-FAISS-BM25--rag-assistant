Why does differencing once remove not only linear but also nonlinear trends?

Applying first differences to a time series removes linear trends. See e.g. Can I detrend and difference to make a series stationary? I can understand the motivation. And also, why you would need to difference twice to remove quadratic trends. But for a simple quadratic, differencing only once already completely removes the trend. xx And it also works for non-linear trends. yy.complicated Why does this work?
