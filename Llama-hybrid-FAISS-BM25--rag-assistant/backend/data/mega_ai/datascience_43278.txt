How to train millions of doc2vec embeddings using GPU?

I am trying to train a doc2vec based on user browsing history (urls tagged to user_id). I use chainer deep learning framework. There are more than 20 millions (user_id and urls) of embeddings to initialize which doesnâ€™t fit in a GPU internal memory (maximum available 12 GB). Training on CPU is very slow. I am giving an attempt using code written in chainer given here Please advise options to try if any.
