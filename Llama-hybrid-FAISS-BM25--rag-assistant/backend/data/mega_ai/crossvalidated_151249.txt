Trend Visualization of N time series

I have about 500 time series with different trends, and each time series represents a given nb of transactions. (Volumes follow a long tail distribution). I would like to plot a summary graph on which I can quickly see trends off all my series and the volume information. I ended up with mean vs max scatter plot where each point corresponds to 1 time series and the circle size is proportional to the volume. (The computation of the trend is not critical here, could be the slope of my time series, weighted average on last point vs full series, etc..) Here is my current result which is not really readable: Do you have any idea? Thanks;
