To extend on the point made by @Azam , if you don't want to render the html on the page, you can set the return type to something else such as xml and do a response.write like I have in the code below. During the GET I want to send back the html, but during the POST I send back some XML over the wire. Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache) If Request.HttpMethod = "GET" Then 'do some work and return the rendered html ElseIf Request.HttpMethod = "POST" Then 'do some work and return xml Response.ContentType = "text/xml" Response.Write(" ") Response.End() Else Response.StatusCode = 404 Response.End() End If End Sub
