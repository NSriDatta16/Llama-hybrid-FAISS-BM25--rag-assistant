It can be a paired t test using columns 'Planned' and 'Actual', or (equivalently) a one-sample t test using column 'Difference'. I wrote your differences into the vector d below. (Maybe check my typing.) d = c(140, -660, -60, -110, 195, 455, -140, -110, -210, -30, 0, 40, -60, 230, 65, -55, -90, -235, - 35) The first question is whether these differences are normally distributed. A normal probability plot is "mainly" linear with a few exceptions, especially the lowest (-660) and highest (455) values . qqnorm(d); qqline(d, col="green2") These extreme values show as 'outliers' in a boxplot of the differences. boxplot(d, horizontal=T, pch="|") Nevertheless, a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality does not (quite) reject the null hypothesis (normal data) at the 5% level. shapiro.test(d) Shapiro-Wilk normality test data: d W = 0.91394, p-value = 0.08748 Various statisticians have different favorite ways of judging normality and tolerance for departure from normality in a one-sample t test. A one-sample t test on the differences, does not find the average difference $\bar D = -35.26$ in the sample mean to be significantly different from $0$ at the 5% level of significance. [If you had done a paired t test in R, the output would have looked much the same; the first step of the paired procedure would have been to find the differences used in the output below.] t.test(d) One Sample t-test data: d t = -0.68782, df = 18, p-value = 0.5003 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -142.97372 72.44741 sample estimates: mean of x -35.26316 If someone disbelieves the accuracy of the t test (on account of non-normality), they might say a nonparametric paired Wilcoxon test (equivalently, one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test) would be better. An objection to using this Wilcoxon test is that the data are not symmetrical. (Look at the boxplot.) However, the Wilcoxon SR test also fails to reject the null hypothesis that subjects deviated significantly from plan. (P-value above $0.05 = 5\%.$ % wilcox.test(d) Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction data: d V = 66.5, p-value = 0.4203 alternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 0 As often happens in practice, neither test is perfect. But arguments can be made for using either. And in the end, neither test finds a significant difference from planned work time. Pick one of the two tests an use it. Neither test shows results anywhere near the borderline for rejection. Some of your workers aren't very good at sticking to plan, but they do not show a strong trend in either direction--above or below plan. Note: For completeness: one possible additional test comes to mind. It's called a sign test. Out of $n = 19$ observations, you have $n^\prime = 18$ non-zero results. Of these non-zero tests 6 are positive and 12 are negative. The probability of 6 or fewer positives or of 12 or more negatives out of 18 is the P-value $0.2379$ of the sign test--nowhere near significant at the 5% level. There are also objections to the sign test because data are not symmetrical and because looking just at signs 'throws away' too much information.) sum(dbinom(c(0:6,12:18), 18, .5)) [1] 0.2378845 By way of confirmation, Minitab statistical software shows the following results for a sign test on your data: Sign Test for Median: d Sign test of median = 0.00000 versus â‰  0.00000 N Below Equal Above P Median d 19 12 1 6 0.2379 -60.00
