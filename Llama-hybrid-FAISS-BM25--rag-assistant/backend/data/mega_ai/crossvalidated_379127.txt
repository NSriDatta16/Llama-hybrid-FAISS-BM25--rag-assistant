VAR(p) Model Covariances and Moment Equation

I'm currently going through the book Analysis of Financial Time Series by Ruey S. Tsay and reached the following statement (The book can be found here , with VAR(1) included in the preview): Where: $r_t$ is a time series ${a_t}$ is a sequence of serially uncorrelated random vectors with mean 0 and covariance matrix $\Sigma$ $\Phi_j$ are k x k matrices I have been trying to obtain the given bullets by following along with the techniques for VAR(1) provided in the text. There, they do the following for VAR(1): $$ \widetilde{r}_t=\Phi\widetilde{r}_{t-1}+a_t=\Phi a_{t-1} + \Phi^2 a_{t-2} + \Phi^3 a_{t-3} + ... $$ So for VAR(p) I tried to follow the same concept: $$ \widetilde{r}_t= \Phi_1\widetilde{r}_{t-1}+\Phi_2\widetilde{r}_{t-2}+...+ \Phi_p \widetilde{r}_{t-p}+a_t= $$ $$ (\Phi_1 a_{t-1} + \Phi_1^2 a_{t-2}+...)+(\Phi_2 a_{t-2} + \Phi_2^2 a_{t-3}+...)+...+(\Phi_p a_{t-p} + \Phi_p^2 a_{t-p-1}+...)+a_t $$ From there, since $a_t$ is serially uncorrelated, the book states that $Cov(a_t,r_{t-l}) = 0$ for $l > 0$ , the first bullet; however, I am unsure of how one thing leads to the other in this case. Then, for VAR(1) the text states by post-multiplying the expression by $a_t'$ , taking the expectation, and using the lack of serial correlations in he $a_t$ processes we obtain that $Cov(r_t, a_t)=\Sigma$ , the first bullet. I am still working out the third one. For VAR(1), it states that by post-multiplying $\widetilde{r}_{r-l}'$ to $\Phi \widetilde{r}_{t-1}+a_t$ , taking expectation, and using $Cov(a_t,\widetilde{r}_{i-j})=E(a_t\widetilde{r}_{i-j}'=0$ for $j>0$ yields: $$ E(\widetilde{r}_{t} \widetilde{r}_{t}') = \Phi E(\widetilde{r}_{t-1} \widetilde{r}_{t})' $$ and therefore it follows that $$ \Gamma_l = \Phi \Gamma_{l-1} $$ and I already have concerns about how that would be a result that comes about for VAR(p) since there's so much more involved in the VAR(p) model.
