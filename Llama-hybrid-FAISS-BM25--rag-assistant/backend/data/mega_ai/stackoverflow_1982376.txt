Contextswitchdeadlock Error in C# while reading xml files

I have a strange error: Managed Debugging Assistant 'ContextSwitchDeadlock' has detected a problem in 'C:\Documents and Settings\Lena G\My Documents\SchoolStuff\IR Information\Home Work\FianlProject\finalProject\finalProject\bin\Debug\finalProject.vshost.exe'. Additional Information: The CLR has been unable to transition from COM context 0x3407968 to COM context 0x3407ad8 for 60 seconds. The thread that owns the destination context/apartment is most likely either doing a non pumping wait or processing a very long running operation without pumping Windows messages. This situation generally has a negative performance impact and may even lead to the application becoming non responsive or memory usage accumulating continually over time. To avoid this problem, all single threaded apartment (STA) threads should use pumping wait primitives (such as CoWaitForMultipleHandles) and routinely pump messages during long running operations. In this error I can just continue the run or break and if I continue then it runs ok but still that worries me. I have a program that I read an xml file that has some texts, place the words in a hashtable and then write from the hash to a regulat text file. Appriciate if someone can help me to solve this problem. Thanks in advance, Lena
