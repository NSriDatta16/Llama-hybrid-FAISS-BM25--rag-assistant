How to use a RBF kernel to create a "Kernel Space" using the similarity of each pair of point?

I am trying to use Semi-Unsupervised clustering using reinforcement learning following this paper. Assume I have n data-points each of which has d dimensions. I also have c pairwise constraints of whether two elements are supposed to be in the same cluster or not. The paper states that "the original input dimension of the dataset is appended to a kernel space with a similarity metric to each pairwise point in the set of constraints" creating a d + 2c dimensional space. They also say the kernel they use is an RBF. Can anybody explain to me what do they mean? how can you use the similarity of a pair of elements to generate a whole new dimension for every data point in the dataset? what is a "kernel space" exactly in this case? if I try to google it I only get results relevant to operating systems kernels.
