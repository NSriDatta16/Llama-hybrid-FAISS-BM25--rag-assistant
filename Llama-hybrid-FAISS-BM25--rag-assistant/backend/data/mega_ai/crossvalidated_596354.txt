Which one to choose: subject-wise or record-wise

I want to do some classifications on open access "Activity Recognition Using Wearable Physiological Measurements" data set. In this dataset, there are 40 subjects whose Electrocardiogram (ECG), Thoracic Electrical Bioimpedance (TEB), and Electrodermal Activity (EDA) information have been recorded for activity recognition. For each subject, there are 28 row samples for each activity. I want to do classification using a Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM. So I tried to split the data into the test and the train data to measure the accuracy of the models. But I'm unsure whether I should split by subjects or just by the records. Would you please help me figure this out?
