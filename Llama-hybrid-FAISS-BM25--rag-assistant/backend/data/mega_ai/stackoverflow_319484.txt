Heres a point the other posters may not have noticed that I found out experimentally: On some installations, the default behaviour is to save a full copy of the images colour profile along with the image. That is, the device calibration map, usually SRGB or something similar, that tells using agents how to best map the colour to real world-colours instead of device independant ones. This image profile is however quite large, and can make some of the files you would expect to be very small to be very large, for instance, a 1px by 1px image consuming a massive 25kb. Even a pure BMP format ( uncompressed ) can represent 1 pixel in less. This profile is generally not needed for the web, so, when saving your photoshop images, make sure to export them without this profile, and you'll notice a marked size improvement. You can strip this data using another tool such as gimp, but it can be a little time consuming if there are many files.
