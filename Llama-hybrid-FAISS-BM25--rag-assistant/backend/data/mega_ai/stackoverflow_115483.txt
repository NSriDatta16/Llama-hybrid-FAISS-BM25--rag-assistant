We're in the process of moving all the databases to source control. We're using sqlcompare to script out the database (a profession edition feature, unfortunately) and putting that result into SVN. The success of your implementation will depend a lot on the culture and practices of your organization. People here believe in creating a database per application. There is a common set of databases that are used by most applications as well causing a lot of interdatabase dependencies (some of them are circular). Putting the database schemas into source control has been notoriously difficult because of the interdatabase dependencies that our systems have. Best of luck to you, the sooner you try it out the sooner you'll have your issues sorted out.
