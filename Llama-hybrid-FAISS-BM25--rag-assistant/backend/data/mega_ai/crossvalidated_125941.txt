It means that the analysis has a Bayesian interpretation, but that doesn't mean that it might not also have a frequentist interpretation as well. The MAP estimate might be viewed as being a partialy Bayesian approach, with a more complete Bayesian approach being to consider the posterior distribution over the parameters. It is still a Bayesian approach though, as the definition of probability would be a "degree of plausibility", rather than a long run frequency.
