I guess your question is: within background preference 'the difference between Machine Learning and Statistical modeling', what's the meaning of 'learning'. Seems like it is still necessary that everything should be clearly defined by us. But the word 'learning' here is not about subjective initiative. System preference is very important for the answer of your question as like the algorithm or strategy of a specify task. In this context, learning means that the algorithm has potential to accelerate its performance continually based on the same dataset and past experiences (without any change of algorithm, and forget about the capacity upper limit relating to parameters), which is the difference between Machine Learning and traditional Statistical modeling algorithm.
