train accuracy is about 100% but in test i get accuracy about 52% This is definitely overfitting. Usually we want the performance on training and testing almost the same. In addition, in most cases, we do not want training accuracy to be 100% since training data may contain noise and we want the model more "general" than training data. My answer here gives a guidance to use learning curve for over-fitting diagnosis. How to know if a learning curve from SVM model suffers from bias or variance?
