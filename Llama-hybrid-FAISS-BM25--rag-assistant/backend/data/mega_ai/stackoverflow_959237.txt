I previously had this problem, however had issues with other programs reorganizing what I coded, and trying to clean it up usually ended up doing more harm than good. To solve this, I am starting to learn the ins and outs of Code Igniter , a basic PHP framework that uses the MVC approach to splitting HTML and PHP. I haven't tested much, but it looks like much less hassle than writing HTML and PHP straight into the single file.
