Without dealing with the time series apparatus, if you have two vectors x and y and want to "return a series which contains data on how many days x is higher/lower than y," simply compare them: # Make up some data x y) x.lesser The key to this is that when you sum a logical vector e.g. (x>y), R coerces TRUEs to 1 and FALSEs to 0.
