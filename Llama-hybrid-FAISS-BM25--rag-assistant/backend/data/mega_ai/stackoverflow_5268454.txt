PHP 301 Redirect, Impossible?

I have been trying to do a proper 301 redirect and have failed to do so. No matter what i try, its always a 302 redirect. Returns a 302: http_redirect("urlgoeshere", '', false, HTTP_REDIRECT_PERM) Returns a 302: header("HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently"); header("Location: urlgoeshere"); Can anyone explain why these are coming back as 302's and not 301's? Server OS is linux, running PHP/5.2.14. Try it yourself. I will give you guys a URL to try. I am testing using YSlow and Googlebot. Should be 301: http://www.fantasysp.com/player/mlb/Albert_Pujols/1486349
