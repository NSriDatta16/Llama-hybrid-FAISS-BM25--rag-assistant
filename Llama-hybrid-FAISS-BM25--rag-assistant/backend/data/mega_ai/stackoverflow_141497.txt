Someone mentioned the Intel compiler has C99 support. There is also the Comeau C/C++ compiler which fully supports C99. These are the only ones I'm aware of. C99 features that I do not use because they are not well supported include: variable length arrays macros with variable number of parameters. C99 features that I regularly use that seem to be pretty well supported (except by Microsoft): stdint.h snprintf() - MS has a non-standard _snprintf() that has serious limitations of not always null terminating the buffer and not indicating how big the buffer should be To work around Microsoft's non-support, I use a public domain stdint.h from MinGW (that I modified to also work on VC6) and a nearly public domain snprintf() from Holger Weiss Items that are not supported by Microsoft, but will still use on other compilers depending on the project include: mixed declarations and code inline functions _Pragma() - this makes pragmas much more usable
