Whenever Magento's behavior is confusing me, I start hacking on the core source (a development copy, of course) to see what it's doing and why not doing what I think it should. I haven't done much playing around with the Admin UI stuff so I don't 100% understand your question, but take a look at the getOption function File: /app/code/core/Mage/Eav/Model/Entity/Attribute/Source/Abstract.php public function getOptionId($value) { foreach ($this->getAllOptions() as $option) { if (strcasecmp($option['label'], $value)==0 || $option['value'] == $value) { return $option['value']; } } return null; } I'd add some Mage::Log and/or var_dump calls in there for the values of $option['label'] and $option['value'] and see why your comparison is failing.
