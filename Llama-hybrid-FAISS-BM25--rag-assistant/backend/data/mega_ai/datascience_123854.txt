You can try simpler methods before word2vec type shallow neural networks. for example: Create User product matrix, transpose it to get product-user matrix. Weight them with TF-IDF. Then by applying dimesionality reduction you can take products to lower dimensional space and calculate similarities. User-product matrix can be used to find similar users to later apply collaborative filtering on. Another way is to get product-product matrix and UP`.UP. Then calculate Pointwise mutual information as weighting on that matrix to calculate similarity. Here"s a sample notebook you can appropriate to your own purpose.
