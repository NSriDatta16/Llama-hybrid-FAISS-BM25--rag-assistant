Xcode: iPhone screenshots no longer work

I can't be sure when this stopped working because I haven't used it for a while, but it was possibly since I upgraded to the 3.2 SDK. In Organizer, when I select the "Screenshots" tab and press "Capture", nothing happens. I've tried this with three different devices and I've restarted my Mac. What's happened, and how can I fix it?
