Time Series pattern recognition and classification problem

I have some labeled sensor data. Now, I would like to know how to extract features from time series using DFT, DWT, and HAAR transforms. I know that the transformations above transform a signal to frequency or time frequency domain, but how can I get average frequency for this non stationary signal?
