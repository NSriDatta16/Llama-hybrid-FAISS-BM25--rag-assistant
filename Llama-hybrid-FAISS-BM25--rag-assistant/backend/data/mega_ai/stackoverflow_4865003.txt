Change embedded video size based on mobile device orientation

Using a combination of HTML and JS, how could I detect whether a device is in landscape or portrait and then change the size of an embedded video accordingly? I know a fairly easy way to detect the screen orientation is to compare the width to the height and see which is larger. But how could I then use these variables in the code for embedding the video? The code is from Vimeo: RCE: A Different Kind of Experience from John D. Low on Vimeo .
