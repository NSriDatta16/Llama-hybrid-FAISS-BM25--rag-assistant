It won't stretch REALLY high, because it will look bad, but this can get you out of dodge, create a stretchable image which uses a graphic of the original header (any iphone template png/psd has these readily extractable). Then UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"tableHeader.png"]; UIImage *stretchImage = [image stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:5.0 topCapHeight:2.0]; UIImageView *backgroundImage = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:frame]; [backgroundImage setImage:stretchImage]; and either return that as part of the UIView you construct in your: - (UIView *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView viewForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section{ method or (better still) add it as the background of whatever UIView subclass instance you're returning in that method. Clearly, any width works, I've found I can get it up to 55pixels high without looking naff. Best answer is to replicate the gradient.. I'm too nooby for that though :)
