RBAC Access Control in tree structure

I am implimenting role based access control in a tree structure (organization) that normally would be stored in LDAP but this time is in MySQL. Part of my requirement is to give people acccess to part of the tree. In LDAP I would use a ACI to filter part of the tree. I am just not sure on the best way to do this in PHP/MySQL. What is the best way in a LAMP application to create a way for the permission to be applied to collections of objects as well as to individual entities within the hierarchy? Thanks in advance,
