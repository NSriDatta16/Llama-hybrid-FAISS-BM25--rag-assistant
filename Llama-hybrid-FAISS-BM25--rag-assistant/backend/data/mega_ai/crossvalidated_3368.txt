Does averaging across multiple time series render higher Nyquist frequency?

Suppose I have three time series with the same length and the same temporal interval. If I upsample each of the three time series through interpolation, that will cause aliasing. However, if I'm interested in the information embedded in the average of the three time series, is such an upsampling justified? In other words, does the above upsamping and then averaging among three time series increase the Nyquist frequency by three times? Thanks!
