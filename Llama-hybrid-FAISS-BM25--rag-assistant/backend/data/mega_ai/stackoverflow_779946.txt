How to allow duplicate SKU in Magento

I have a customer who retails third party batteries, and some batteries can replace several OEM models. For instance, 3rd party SKU 12345 may replace Toshiba N23 and HP 53214, thus my customer would like to create two products with the same SKU in front end (they are essentially the same product). However, Magento by default does not allow duplicated SKU. My current solution is to set SKU to not required from the backend, and add another attribute called Model that allows duplicated values, and display the Model in front end. Is there a better way to do this? Or is it possible to allow duplicated SKU? Tian Bo Noble Technologies
