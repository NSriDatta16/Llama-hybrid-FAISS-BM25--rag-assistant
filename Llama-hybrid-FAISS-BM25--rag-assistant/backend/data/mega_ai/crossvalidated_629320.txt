If you are doing a single chi-square test (which seems like what you are doing) then there are no multiple comparisons to correct for. If you actually are doing several tests, then, as Jacob Cohen said, long ago "this is a subject on which reasonable people can differ." Remember that, when you correct for multiple comparisons, you lose power. Also remember that it's an interesting question what "multiple" means. Is that all the tests in one paper? Or all the tests anyone has done on this topic? Or all the tests you will ever do in your life? Or what? I'm not a fan of correcting these, in general, partly because I am not really a fan of p values. But it partly depends on the field and your research. In general, in my work and that of my clients, there was very strong reason to suspect that the null was false. Call this a prior if you like, go full Bayesian if you like, but I just use it to further my antipathy to p values. OTOH, if you are really doing purely exploratory work, where you genuinely don't have much idea whether the null is true, then p values are useful (this is what Fisher was often doing, trying out all sorts of fertilizer on crop yields).
