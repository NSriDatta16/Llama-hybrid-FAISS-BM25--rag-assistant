R caret package question

library(car) library(caret) trainIndex The above was discussed here How to train and validate a neural network model in R? Does caret package run many times for combinations of decay and size? If so, what is the default # of iterations? What is the final choice of decay and size? When I do summary(prestige.fit) , the decay is 0.5 and size is 5. Is that the final combination that caret chose as best option?
