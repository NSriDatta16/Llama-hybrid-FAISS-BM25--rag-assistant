First of all, to compute distance between two latitude-longitude points refer to this stackoverflow question . Here are two ideas for your question: For each point $(X,Y)$ in $A$, find the $k$ points in $B$ that are nearest to $(X,Y)$. Then compute the distances between $(X,Y)$ and each of these points and then average these $k$ distances to find a measure of how much $(X,Y)$ is near to the points in $B$. This approach is similar to KNN algorithm in data mining. Here $k$ is a parameter which you should choose according to your application. Cluster the points in $B$ using a density-based clustering approach such as DBScan, or a grid-based clustering such as STING, or a partitioning-based algorithm such as k-means. Then, for each point $(X,Y)$ in $A$, find the cluster which this point belongs to, and compute the distance between $(X,Y)$ and the center of that cluster. Alternatively, you can compute the average distance between $(X,Y)$ and all points in that cluster.
