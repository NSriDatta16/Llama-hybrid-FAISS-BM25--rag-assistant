Given a regular datetime field, you can do this in query with the MySQL function UNIX_TIMESTAMP (): $posts = mysql_query("SELECT * , UNIX_TIMESTAMP(Created) FROM Posts ORDER BY Created DESC"); you also should know that the PHP function mysql_fetch_array returns both numeric associative keys for a query result. I find this redundant, so I like to be more more specific and use: $array = mysql_fetch_array($posts, MYSQL_ASSOC); Also, and as @Paolo Bergantino indicated, quoting your echo would be a good decision: echo $array['Created']; One last comment, you're using "SELECT *" -- it is worth reading discussion on the pros and cons of "SELECT *" syntax .
