To do it with Apache you can use a rewriteRule together with a RewriteCond on %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} . The RewriteCond accepts RegExp, so you have to use a pattern there, which matches all those bots(you should find informations how to build the pattern on the page linked by acme). But be careful: Search-engines may penalize pages that deliver different contents to the bots and to the others clients.
