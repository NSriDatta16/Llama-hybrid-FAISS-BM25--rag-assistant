Questions about use of snapshot in Maven2

I am writing a POM file for a in-house jar artifact. The artifact depends on several other in-house artifacts which our team writes. When declaring the dependencies of the target, should I limit those dependencies to fixed release version or leave them to SNAPSHOT version. If too many other SNAPSHOT versions of depended modules, it creates uncertainties in testing, if I limit to fixed release version, I cannot leverage the bug fixes of the depended modules. Whats the practice out there? Secondly, how do you name the snapshot version> 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT or 1.0-SNAPSHOT.
