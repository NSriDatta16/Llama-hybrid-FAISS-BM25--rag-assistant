How do I have mod_perl reload source files on change?

I am developing an application with mod _ perl and restarting the server every time I change code is a huge drag. I'd like to still use mod _ perl for development because it's what I plan on using for the live server. I didn't see anything in the documentation about how to do this. Thoughts?
