Mixed vs Fixed effects model

I'm currently weighing up the most appropriate of two models, one including individual as a random effect and the other discarding it: - ~score + (1|individual) + region ~score + region score is a continuous/numeric variable and represents a measure of disease severity in a piece of tissue, individual is the unique individual identifier, and region is one of two regions the tissue was obtained from within the same organ. The underlying data is hundreds of measurements of a gene's activity from individual cells within that particular sample of tissue. The purpose of the model is to understand if the activity of the gene changes with the disease severity score. There are 11 individuals and 22 samples. Overall, the available data is as below (with n representing the number of observations/cells/values from each sample): - individual region score n A X 0.490 310 A Y 0.293 520 B X 0.334 105 B Y 1.377 272 C X 0.299 224 C Y 0.261 321 D X 0.740 338 D Y 0.322 273 E X 1.588 115 E Y 2.327 297 F X 1.753 397 F Y 3.288 606 G X 0.059 508 G Y 0.297 350 H X 0.462 189 H Y 0.337 127 I X 1.247 290 I Y 0.769 721 J X 0.889 269 J Y 0.646 316 K X 0.740 545 K Y 0.204 537 My initial thought was to include the (1|individual) term as in model 1; however, I have some reservations. Firstly, the disease severity score is unique for each sample, e.g. the only observations of a disease severity score of 0.490 are the 310 cells from region X of individual A. I'm concerned that while this first model seems to account for the relatedness/possible correlations between samples from the same individual, the co-linearity between the score and individual may undermine the results. Secondly, the second model's performance (excluding the individual effect) is superior when validated against a new dataset of unseen individuals. Any pointers would be much appreciated!
