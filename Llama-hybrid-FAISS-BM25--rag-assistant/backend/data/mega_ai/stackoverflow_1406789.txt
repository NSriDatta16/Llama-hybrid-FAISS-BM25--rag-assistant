built in Soap extension php5 passing in params as associative array

I have this xml I'm wanting to pass to this web service function myuser password sdadasdsa ','',array(),'document', 'literal'); I'm using the soap extension buit in php5. Is this what I'm supposed to be passing in the soapcall function as parameters? array('CreateNewUser' => array( 'UserName' => 'sc', 'Password' => 'i82372', 'Registration' => array('username' =>'new','password' =>'ss'));
