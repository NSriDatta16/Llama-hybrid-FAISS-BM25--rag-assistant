Layer notation for convolutional neural networks

When reading about convolutional neural networks (CNNs), I often come across a special notation used in the community and in scientific papers, describing the architecture of the network in terms of layers. However, I was not able to find a paper or resource describing this notation in detail. Could someone explain to me the details or point to where it is described or "standardized"? Examples: input−100C3−MP2−200C2−MP2−300C2−MP2−400C2−MP2−500C2−output ( source ) input−(300nC2−300nC2−MP2)_5−C2−C1−output ( source ) A good guess seems that x C y are convolution layers ( x is number of filters? y is one side of square kernel?). MP z is max-pooling layer (pool size z × z ?). But instead of guessing, I would love to have a reference (which I could possibly also reference in a paper).
