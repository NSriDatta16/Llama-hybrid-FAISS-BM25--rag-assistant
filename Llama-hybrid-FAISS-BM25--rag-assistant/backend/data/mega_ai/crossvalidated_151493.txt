If the covariates explain the response properly, they should lower deviance statistically significantly. Deviance analysis can be performed using anova() . In the output table, Null Deviance is where only the intercept is added to fit while Residual Deviance is from the fitted model. The difference follows the chi-squared distribution and, if it is statistically significant, the fitted model can be considered to improve model fit - it can be simply done using anova() as shown below. Here deviance analysis can be performed as the null and fitted models are nested - only some covariates are added to the null model. If a non-nested model (eg time series model) is to be compared, an information criterion can be used. AIC and BIC are popular and AIC is shown by default. counts Chi) #1 8 10.5814 #2 4 5.1291 4 5.4523 0.244
