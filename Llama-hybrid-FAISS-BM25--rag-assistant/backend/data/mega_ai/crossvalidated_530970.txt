Auto-correlation means how a series correlates with a delayed copy of itself. Lag is the timesteps you move a copy of the series behind to compare against. For example, consider a time series xT where T is the time step, then a lag of 1 will be: x0 x1 x2 x3 -> x0 x1 x2 x3 So now when you correlate the two series, you look at the span where they overlap: x1 x2 x3 x0 x1 x2 And see how well they vary with each other. Then, for example, a series with lag 0 will have perfect correlation (because lag 0 means the same series). Similarly, a periodic series (for e.g. a sine wave) with a lag equal to its period will have a perfect correlation. A correlation of 1 means positive linear correlation, -1 means negative linear correlation, and 0 means no linear correlation. For e.g. consider a series 1,2,3,4,5 . When you autocorrelate it with a lag of 1, you are comparing 1,2,3,4 with 2,3,4,5 . You can see it is a linear correlation. That is, if you plot 1,2,3,4 vs 2,3,4,5 , it'll be a straight line.
