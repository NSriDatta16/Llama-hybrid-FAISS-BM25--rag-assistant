Using apply on a multidimensional array in R

I am wondering how to use apply on a multidimensional array. I have something like the following: A I would like to take the average of those slices to get a single 2 by 2 matrix. Any way I come up with is pretty kludgy. I was hoping to be able to use apply, like I would if I wanted the average say of the columns of a matrix: B But this doesn't seem to work the way I think it might with 3D arrays: A.mean I appreciate your suggestions.
