The only part of this expression that you need a custom factor for is the function $1/(1+\exp(-Sigma(x)))$. This is a function from a scalar to a scalar, so should be relatively easy to implement using quadrature. For examples of this approach, see section 13.8 of Bayesian Data Analysis (third edition) or section 1.4 of EP: A quick reference .
