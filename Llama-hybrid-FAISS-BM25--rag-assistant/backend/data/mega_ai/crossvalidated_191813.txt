It is easy to show (see Daphne Koller's course ) that Logistic Regression is a restricted version of Conditional Random Fields, which are undirected graphical models, while Bayesian Networks are directed graphical models. Then, Logistic Regression could also be viewed as a single layer perceptron. This is the only link (which is very loose) that I think could be drawn between Bayesian Networks and Neural Networks. I have yet to find a link between the other concepts you asked about.
