Standard Android menu icons, for example refresh

The Android SDK offers the standard menu icons via android.R.drawable.X . However, some standard icons, such as ic_menu_refresh (the refresh icon), are missing from android.R . Is there any way to get the original icons, maybe by extracting them from the applications? I already checked the Android source, but it's a bit too huge to look everywhere for the images. I know the Android Drawables website, but I would like to get the correct hdpi , mdpi and ldpi version, preferable the original ones.
