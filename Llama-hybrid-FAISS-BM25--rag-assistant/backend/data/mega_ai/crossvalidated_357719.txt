How to stretch a time series to any length, $n$ , without padding? The $x$ , $y$ and $z$ values are the coordinates of a person that is being tracked. So the time series is tracking the movement and actions of a person in a room . Using curve fitting with hysteresis on the $z$ . The use of history to confine the $x$ and $y$ complicates things but enhances accuracy. Prior knowledge of the dimensions of the room is better than history of movement but might be different to obtain. If they go outside they are most likely to travel the same paths as other persons and least likely to walk through solid objects (but those might move over a period of time, confusing the algorithm which must be able to cope with such things, including rearranging the furniture). This method assumes that they can't walk (or chainsaw) through walls or fly but permits them to walk through doorways and use stairs, yet still produce a smooth track of their position (subject to tracking error). By using hysteresis to confine and predict you can both speed up and enhance the quality of the tracking and run into trouble when you hit an extrema .
