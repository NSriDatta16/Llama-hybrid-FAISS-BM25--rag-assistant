Items 1 and 2 seem to be logging information - i.e. there's no obvious requirement to refer back them, unless you want to keep their search terms. So just write it to a log somewhere and forget about it? I could store this in the view state I'm guessing that's a asp.net thing - certainly it doesn't mean anything to me, so I can't comment. it is my understanding that the session state can be used to store such information Yes - it would be my repository of choice for item 3. does not this also result in the same information being transferred to the user and stored in their cookie? No - a session cookie is just a handle to data stored server-side in PHP (and every other HTTP sesion imlpementation I've come across). This leaves me with either a server-only-session storage system or a mem-caching solution memcache is only really any use as a session storage substrate. Whether you should use memcache as your session storage substrate....on a single server, there's not a lot of advantage here - although NT (IIRC) uses fixed size caches/buffers (whereas Posix/Unix/Linux will use all available memory) I'd still expect most the session I/O to be to memory rather than disk unless your site is overloaded. The real advantage is if you're running a cluster (but in that scenario you might want to consider something like Cassandra). IME, sessions are not that great of an overhead, however if you want to keep an indefinite history of the activity in a session, then you should overflow the data (or keep it seperate from) the session to prevent it getting too large.
