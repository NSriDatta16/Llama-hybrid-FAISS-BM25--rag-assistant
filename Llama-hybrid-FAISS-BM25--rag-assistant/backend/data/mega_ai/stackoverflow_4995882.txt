Thanks to Gael for encouraging me to look at capitalization again. The key to this is the document is taken from a larger parent. Although the small document above is printed exactly as the JS console sees it - with all element names in lower case, the larger parent it is taken from uses initialLowerCase for the element names. Even though I'm querying the smaller fragment, I still need to use the casing of the parent rather than the casing of the child. accountxml.evaluate('//ns2:customerId',accountxml,myNS,XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE,null).singleNodeValue; I'm not sure if this is a Chrome bug or an expected behavior.
