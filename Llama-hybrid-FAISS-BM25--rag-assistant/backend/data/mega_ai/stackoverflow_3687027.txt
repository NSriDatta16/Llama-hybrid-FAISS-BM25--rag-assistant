I am not familiar with UltraGrid, but from what I just read at: http://devcenter.infragistics.com/Support/KnowledgeBaseArticle.Aspx?ArticleID=1753 I believe you can simply get your value like I would from a VB.NET datagridview. dim obj as object = UltraGrid1.Selected.Rows(0)..Cells.FromKey("Name of Cell").value This should be a close proximity of what you need.
