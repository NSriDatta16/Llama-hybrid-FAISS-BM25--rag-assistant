I started reading a book that might be close to what you are looking for. Measuring The User Experience - Tom Tullis and Bill Albert I was hoping - when I purchased the book - that it would provide a simple way to score site usability. After starting it though, it is clear that it is targeted towards teams doing user testing - helping you measure the results of your testing. If you are looking more towards the "Don't Make Me Think" type books (that one is awesome) you might also try " Designing the Obvious " by Robert Hoekman. The research papers that Jakob Nielsen's group publishes are also very valuable. These studies can be pretty pricey, but if you compare the costs of actually doing the research, they are relatively inexpensive. Another pretty comprehensive resource would be at usability.gov . There is a pdf file on that site that contains a large number of usability guidelines based on research.
