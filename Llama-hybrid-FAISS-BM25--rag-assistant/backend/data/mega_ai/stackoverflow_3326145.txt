Similarity search between time series in Matlab. Possible ? I cant find R-tree implementation in matlab

I would like to implement similarity search in matlab. I wanna to know is it possible ? My plan is to do use 2 popular similarity measurement which are Euclidean Distance and Dynamic Time Warping. Both of these will be applied on time series dataset. My question at this point is how can I evaluate both of these two measurement performance and accuracy ? I seen some literature saying i should use K-NN algorithm. Then, I plan to apply dimensionality reduction on the time series dataset. After reducued the dimensionality of the dataset. I will need to index the dataset using R-tree or any indexing techniques available. However my problem is that to do this, I need R-tree matlab code which I hardly able to find any in the internet ... I do realised that most of the implementation for similarity search are in C++, C and Java ... But im not familiar with those. Im hoping I could implement these in Matlab ... Any Guru could help me with this ? Also what kind of evaluation can I make to evaluate the performance for each algorithm. Thanks
