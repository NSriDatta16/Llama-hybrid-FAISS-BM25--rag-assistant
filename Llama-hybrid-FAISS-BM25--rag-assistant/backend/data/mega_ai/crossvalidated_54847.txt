This is an unsupervised learning task. Here is a very simple idea which if incorrect I hope someone else points out. Feed your ten variables into a PCA to extract 2 PCs. Use the two principal components in a 2-mean clustering algorithm to define boundaries for the assignment to each of two groups. Examine the PCs, and name them Tablet and Laptop if it makes sense to do so. You now have a criterion based on a linear combination of your 10 variables. The main problem I see with this is that you won't necessarily end up with a definite "laptop" versus "tablet" prediction algorithm. To get something like that you would ideally have at least a few data points with outcomes to train on.
