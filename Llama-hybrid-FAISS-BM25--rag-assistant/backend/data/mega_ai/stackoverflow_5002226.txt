How do i setup a step-by-step process

I'm creating an application that has to handle the construction cases of a small company. In order for the employees to create a new case, I want to put them through a step-by-step process. How do i setup up such a process? I've tried putting them on panels instead, but this still seams like a not so elegant way to solve this problem. Right now i'm hiding/showing lots of textboxes and listboxes individually. Is there some smarter(more correct) way to group these. Or could someone suggest another approach to this? I'm building it in c#.
