What is the best way to test a group of interaction effects in a GLM?

I have a binary outcome Y and predictors a, b, c, and d. I have a logistic regression model which includes all the predictors, plus all the interactions between all the predictors. What is the right approach to determining whether all the interactions can be removed from the model? My thought was that a partial F-test would be suitable: partial_f_test However, calling "partial_f_test" returns Resid. Df, Resid. Dev, Df, Deviance. I'm not sure how to interpret the results I got, namely Df = 9 and deviance = 2. Is a partial F-test even the right approach here, and if so, how do I interpret the results?
