NSMutableURLRequest and redirection

So I am trying to create a request that will automatically follow the redirects in its process. For some reason this is not working, this is what my delegate method looks like. Do I need to do anything else for this to function properly? Thanks! -(NSURLRequest *)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection willSendRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request redirectResponse:(NSURLResponse*)redirectResponse { NSLog(@"RedirectResponse:%@", [redirectResponse URL]); NSLog(@"send request:%@", [request URL]); NSHTTPCookieStorage *cookieDict = [NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage]; NSLog(@"CURRENT COOKIES: %@", [cookieDict cookies]); /*NSHTTPURLResponse *httpResponse = (NSHTTPURLResponse*)redirectResponse; if ([redirectResponse respondsToSelector:@selector(allHeaderFields)]) { NSDictionary *dictionary = [httpResponse allHeaderFields]; NSLog([dictionary description]); }*/ NSURLRequest *newRequest=request; return newRequest; }
