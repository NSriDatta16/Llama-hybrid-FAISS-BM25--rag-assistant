My own answer: What I want to do is close to one-shot image recognition. One interesting article I found is: Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition by Koch, Zemel, and Salakhutdinov. I also found that Caffee supports Siamese networks. The wikipedia article about the subject is One-shot learning .
