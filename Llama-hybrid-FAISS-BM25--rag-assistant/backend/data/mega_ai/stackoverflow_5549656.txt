Agreed that you'll only need unconfigured sendmail for outbound. You could use PHP's Mail function but I would recommend looking at Pear::Mail and Pear::Mail_Mime packages for PHP. They can be configured to use Sendmail for outbound, and are also great for embedding images as well as implementing native multi-part MIME email format support. This is ideal if you want your messages to have embedded HTML, Images, and as well as have the ability to gracefully degrade to straight plain-text. Also, something else to consider. You should add a SPF record on your domain for the webhost that's doing the mailing, and also add a TXT record so you don't trip SPAM filters on the recipient side.
