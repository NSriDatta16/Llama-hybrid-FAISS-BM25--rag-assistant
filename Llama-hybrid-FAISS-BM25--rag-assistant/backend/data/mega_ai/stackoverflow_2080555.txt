A couple of considerations: transaction management; backup and recovery. These are general easier to marshal with a database than with a file system. But probably the hardest thing is to synchronise a file system backup with a database's roll forward (redo) logging. The more transactional your application, the more these factors matter. It appears from your question that you are not intending to make any use of normal database functionality (relational integrity, joining). In which case you should give strong consideration to a third option: store your data in the file system and, instead of a database, use a file-based text retrieval engine like Solr (or Lucene) , Sphinx, Autonomy, etc.
