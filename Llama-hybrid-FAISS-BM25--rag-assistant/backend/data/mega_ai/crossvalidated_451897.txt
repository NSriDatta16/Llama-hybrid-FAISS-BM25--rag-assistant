Bayesian comparison of differing model size

This issue is related to a real problem, but I've boiled down to a minimal example. Simplest version Suppose I get to observe two variables, $X_1$ and $X_2$ . We can think of these data being generated by a mixture/hierarchical model, in which they have a 50% chance of actually being the same uniform(0, $\alpha$ ) and 50% chance of being two independent draws from a uniform(0, $\alpha$ ), where $\alpha$ is known in advance. We can more formally define this as $Z \sim \text{Bern}(0.5)$ If $Z = 0$ , $X_1 = X_2 \sim \text{Unif}(0, \alpha)$ If $Z = 1$ , $X_1 \sim \text{Unif}(0, \alpha), X_2 \sim \text{Unif}(0, \alpha)$ and we observe $X_1, X_2$ but not $Z$ . Now let's suppose we observe $X_1 = X_2 = \alpha/2$ . This case, we should know that they must have come from the same uniform variable (i.e., $Z = 0$ ), as the probability that two continuous variables are exactly equivalent is 0. But what happens to the posterior? If we want to calculate $P(Z = 0 | X_1 = X_2 = \alpha/2) =$ $\frac{P(Z = 0 \land X_1 = \alpha/2 \land X_2 = \alpha/2)}{ P(X_1 = \alpha/2 \land X_2 = \alpha/2)}$ Here's definitely where the issue lies, but as we normally apply Bayes Theorem, we would switch to density functions for $X_1$ and $X_2$ . In that case, we would get that $f_{X_1, X_2|Z = 0}(x_1, x_2) = \alpha^{-1}$ if $x_1 = x_2 \land x_1 \in [0, \alpha]$ . Similarly, $f_{X_1, X_2|Z = 1}(x_1, x_2) = \alpha^{-2}$ if $x_1, x_2 \in [0, \alpha]$ . If we plug that back into our original problem, we get something that is clearly wrong: $P(Z = 0 | X_1 = X_2 = \alpha/2) = \frac{0.5 \times \alpha^{-1}}{0.5 \times \alpha^{-1} + 0.5 \times \alpha^{-2}} = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha^{-1}}$ Not only is that not 1, it approaches 0 as $\alpha$ approaches 0! Above has a clear answer and you can at least reason with it by saying that the issue is that $x_1 = x_2$ is infinitely more likely if $Z = 0$ ...but directly looking at the density functions does not make this obvious. In general, how should I have recognized this type of error when comparing two models of differing dimensions?
