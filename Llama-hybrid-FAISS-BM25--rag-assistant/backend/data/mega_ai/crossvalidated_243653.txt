Reduce dimensionality of predictors for model building

I am trying to build a classification model. I have 600 variables to start with and was trying to reduce it a considerable set of variables to pass it to my model (like Logistic regression). Did some research and it looks like PCA or Factor Analysis can be performed. But, I need to the importance of each variable. That is, I don't want to pass components or factors to model. Actual variables needs to be the predictors. I am mostly working on SAS and there is a procedure called VARCLUS which can help in identifying the significant variables. Are there any other procedures which are recommended?
