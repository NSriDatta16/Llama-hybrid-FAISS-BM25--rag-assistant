UI Development Depends on the game- is it animated, or a board-style game? Generally, UI assets are created as images, sprites, or storyboards. Data Again, depends on the game type. Realtime games need FAST access, so you want to store your data in a local database and cache it as much as possible. Local file-based databases tend to be the norm, either custom or off-the-shelf, such as SQLLite. Engines There are tons of engines out there for 3D, board, etc. Popcap has made their C++ game engine open source. Others include Unity, Ogre3D... J2ME I wouldn't target this platform for games. Don't know much about "Open 3D Web" but it sounds very browser-dependent, so mileage may vary across browsers. You can play with 3D with Google Sketchup and Caligari Truespace. Truespace was bought by Microsoft and made free. Again, tons of engines out there for networking. Example: Microsoft's XNA framework has some networking bits you can leverage. Not sure what you mean there. There are physics engines built into some of the gaming engines I've mentioned, and external ones you can use. Once upon a time, realtime custscenes were pre-rendered with 3D Studio Max or Maya. These days in-game rendering is often good enough for cutscenes: look at the latest Halo 3:ODST game. All cutscenes use the in-game engine. Market I looked into game development earlier this year. Casual games look to me like a growth industry- high volume, relatively low development cost. Big Fish Games for the PC is a good example there- they publish a few titles and resell most. I think mobile game development is a huge potential market but the barriers to entry are high because it will be a crowded space. iPhone games are the 800lb gorilla but Android is coming up. PSP and others have a limited audience and are notoriously difficult. The most important thing I learned in my research is that game development is a labor of love. It's hugely multi-disciplinary: you need programming, art, concept, production. It's more like making a movie than anything else. It's also rough to make a profit because of all that overhead. If you want to get into it, I recommend joining a game developer to learn the business. Once you have experience you can carry it forward to larger gigs at larger publishers. Eventually you can get to work on a major AAA title, after which you can really write your own ticket.
