Evidently this is a discrete time series and $h>0$. I don't know what the subscript $k$ on $\gamma_k$ is for but, anyway, just use the bilinearity of covariance: \begin{align} {\rm cov}(Y_t, Y_{t+h}) &= {\rm cov}(X_t - X_{t-1}, X_{t+h}-X_{t+h-1}) \\ &= {\rm cov}(X_t, X_{t+h}) - {\rm cov}(X_t, X_{t+h-1}) - {\rm cov}(X_{t-1}, X_{t+h}) + {\rm cov}(X_{t-1}, X_{t+h-1}) \\ &= \gamma_k(h) - \gamma_k(h-1) - \gamma_k(h+1) + \gamma_k(h) \\ &= 2 \gamma_k(h) - \gamma_k(h-1) + \gamma_k(h+1) \end{align} If the stationary variance of $X_t$ is $\sigma^2$ then the variance of $Y_t$ is $2\sigma^2 - 2 \gamma_k(1)$ so divide through by that to get the correlation. This was quick and dirty so check my work. Good luck.
