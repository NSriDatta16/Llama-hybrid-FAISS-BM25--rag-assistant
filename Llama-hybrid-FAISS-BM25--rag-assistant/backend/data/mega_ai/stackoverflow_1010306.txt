Look at the application cache in html5, that does basically exactly what you want (it's also what you want to use if you want to support completely offline web applications). Alternatively you could (somewhat ugly)daw the image to canvas, then to canvas.toDataURL() to get a data url for the image, which you can then store in the normal database or offline storage apis.
