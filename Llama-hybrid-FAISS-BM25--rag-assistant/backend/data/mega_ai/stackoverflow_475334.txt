Since you already known python, PL/Python should be something to look at. And you sound like you write SQL for your database queries, so PL/SQL is a natural extension of that. PL/SQL feels like SQL, just with all the stuff that you would expect from SQL anyway, like variables for whole rows and the usual control structures of procedural languages. It fits the way you usually interact with the database, but it's not the most elegant language of all time. I can't say anything about PL/Python, since I have never used it, but since you know python it should be easy to flip through some examples and see if you like it.
