i believe the answer is actually neither 1/18 nor 1/10 :) take one of those old high school scantron quizzes/tests instead of a reading test.. remember the multiple-choice questions that you'd fill in with a #2 pencil? question #1 of the multiple choice quiz has two possible answers. if you flipped a coin to answer question #1, you'd have a 50% chance of guessing correctly. so people who don't know the answer and blindly guess will average 50% on this question. question #2 has nine possible answers. so among people who attempt question #2 but don't know the answer to question #2 and blindly guess..they'll average 11.111% correct on this question. but not everyone will get here! two groups of your test-takers will have the opportunity to get here: 100% of the test-takers who knew the correct answer to question #1 and 50% of the test-takers who guessed at random. here's a critical piece of information: what share of your test-takers will know the correct answer to question one but randomly guess on question #2? if 100% of your test-takers don't know the answer to either question, then i think the probability of answering both questions correctly is 1 out of 18. but a certain proportion of your test-takers will know the answer to your first question but not your second question..and they're going to throw off this probability calculation.
