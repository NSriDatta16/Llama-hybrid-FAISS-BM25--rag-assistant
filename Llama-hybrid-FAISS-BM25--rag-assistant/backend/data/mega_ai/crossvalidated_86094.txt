What is a density function?

I know about histograms and also know that if we connect the mid-points on the top of bars in a histogram we will get a frequency polygon. This polygon could then be 'smoothed' in a way that it generates a frequency curve like in normal distribution, Poisson distribution, etc. What is smoothing? How is it done? I have heard about the 'filtering techniques' and 'removing noise' but I don't understand the terms. Googling yields things like Kalman filter, moving average filter, low-pass filter, kriging, convolution, etc but they are very abstract concepts for me. Is there any good resource to start learning about these things from scratch?
