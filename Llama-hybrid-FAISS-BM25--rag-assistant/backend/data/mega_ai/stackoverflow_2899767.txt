I just recently wrote a post about how to use static blocks. Here is the meat of it: Step One: Create Static Block in Your Magento Admin Magento Admin Panel—>Static Blocks—>Add New Block 1) Name your Static Block, in this case Custom footer Links 2) Label the Identifier (This is the link you will use to call the block later) in this case, custom-footer-links 3) Choose what store view you would like it to render in 4) Set Status to Enabled 2)Now for the fun part! Add your navigation links to the block. Make sure to use to make them match your sites color and theme. Step Two: Inserting Code to Call the Static Block This part is going to require you to FTP into your Magento site and modify footer.phtml app—>design—>frontend—->default—>(your template)—>template—>page—>footer.phtml Find where in the footer you want your navigation links to display and insert: getLayout()->createBlock(‘cms/block’)->setBlockId(‘custom-footer-links’)->toHtml(); ?> Now most of the time the Static block should display just fine but in some cases you are going to have do some extra steps to have the block display. 1) Instead of inserting: getLayout()->createBlock(‘cms/block’)->setBlockId(‘custom-footer-links’)->toHtml(); ?> Use: custom-footer-links 2)Modify catalog.xml app—>design—>frontend—>default—>f002—>layout—>catalog.xml Add under custom-footer-links
