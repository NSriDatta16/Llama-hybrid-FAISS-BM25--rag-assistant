Validity of BIC for Dirichlet process mixture models

I am implementing clustering using Dirichlet process mixture models via scikit learn's Variational Bayesian Gaussian Mixture model . I arrived at the appropriate priors iteratively, and I am able to plot the graph of inferred cluster count to prior belief in number of clusters. However, I am unable to understand if and why the BIC technique is not applicable for these types of models. The newer version of the scikit API removed the support for BIC for this class of models. Any pointers are much appreciated.
