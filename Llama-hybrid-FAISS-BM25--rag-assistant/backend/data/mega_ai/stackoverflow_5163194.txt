You don't mention which contexts you're using Redis and Memcached in (or why you're using both, or how ), but I'm guessing you're thinking about session data and caching (based on this earlier question: Rails and caching, is it easy to switch between memcache and redis? ) In either case, there's no real value to not use the APIs that Rails provides, unless you have a particularly distinct use case. If you absolutely must use both , just tell Rails which storage engine you wish to use for which function. If you're doing something else, perhaps a bit more information would help people give more useful answers.
