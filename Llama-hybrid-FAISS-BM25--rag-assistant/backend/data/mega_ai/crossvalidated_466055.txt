How can I know if there is a breakpoint in a time series analysis?

I am trying to find a breakpoint in a time series. I have a set of prices from January up to now. I want to know if some trend was interrupted at a specific date. E.g.: I believe that in March the price started to drop because of the covid-19 crisis. How can I statistically check this hypothesis? I saw some drop, but that might be happening just by chance. What I found up to now: By looking at some forums/blogs I found the Chow test. I got the script in Python ( https://github.com/jtloong/chow_test ). However, I'm not sure that's what I need. The script requests two series, I only have one (meat price). Can anyone help?
