You could make the directories that your modules exist in read-only for the user that the Python interpreter is running as. I don't think there's a more elegant option. PEP 304 appears to have been an attempt to introduce a simple option for this, but it appears to have been abandoned. I imagine there's probably some other problem you're trying to solve, for which disabling .py[co] would appear to be a workaround, but it'll probably be better to attack whatever this original problem is instead.
