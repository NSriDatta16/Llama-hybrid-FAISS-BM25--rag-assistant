The Internet of Musical Things (also known as IoMusT) is a research area that aims to bring Internet of Things connectivity to musical and artistic practices. Moreover, it encompasses concepts coming from music computing, ubiquitous music, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, gaming, participative art, and new interfaces for musical expression. From a computational perspective, IoMusT refers to local or remote networks embedded with devices capable of generating and/or playing musical content. Introduction The term "Internet of Things" (IoT) is extensible to any everyday object connected to the internet, having its capabilities increased by exchanging information with other elements present in the network to achieve a common goal. Thanks to the technological advances that have occurred in the last decades, its use has spread to several areas of performance, assisting in medical analysis, traffic control and home security. When its concepts meet music, the Internet of Music Things (IoMusT) emerges. The term "Internet of Musical Things" also receives numerous classifications, according to the use of certain authors. Hazzard et al., for example, uses it in the context of musical instruments that have QR code that directs the user to a page with information about this instrument, such as manufacturing date and history. Keller and Lazzarini, use this term in ubiquitous music (ubimus) research, while Turchet et al. define IoMusT as a subfield of the Internet of Things, where interoperable devices can connect to each other, aiding the interaction between musicians and the audience. Like the IoT, the Internet of Music Things can encompass a variety of ecosystems. But generally, it is marked by being employed in musical activities (rehearsals, concerts, recordings, and music teaching) and relying on service and information providers. In addition to the technological and artistic advantages that this field offers, new opportunities are still arising for the music industry, providing the emergence of new services and applications capable of exploiting the interconnection between logical and physical devices, always keeping the artistic purpose in mind. Musical things A musical thing is formally defined as a "computational device capable of acquiring, processing, acting, or exchanging data that serves a musical purpose." In short, these objects are entities that can be used for musical practice, can be connected in local and/or remote networks, and act as senders or receivers of messages. They can be, for example, a smart instrument (instruments that use sensors, actuators and wireless connection for audio processing), wearable devices or any other capable of controlling, generating or executing musical content over the network. Unlike traditional audio devices, such as microphones and speakers, musical things are not useful by themselves, thus the need arises to insert them into a chain of equipment. Thus, the need arises to think about standards, protocols and means of communication between them. These challenges will be analyzed below. The challenges of creating musical things The first challenge concerns the hardware used in musical things. First, one should keep in mind that these devices are not analog. Because of this, they can be reprogrammed and must have internet connectivity and/or another possibility to communicate with other equipment. Secondly, they are not traditional computing devices. This means that they are programmed for a general purpose, not only to perform certain tasks, as is the case with smartphones and personal computers. Finally, it is important to note that they will be employed in an artistic and musical context. In this way, the aesthetic characteristics are as important as the computational ones. That said, the hardware challenges are clear, and these include the processing capacity, as well as the storage and power consumption of musical things, which mus
