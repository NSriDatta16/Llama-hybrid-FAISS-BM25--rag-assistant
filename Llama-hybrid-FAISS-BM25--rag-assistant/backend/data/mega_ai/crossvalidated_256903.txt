Without knowing why you want to create an interaction it's hard to give you a full answer, so I will give you a general one. Creating dummy variables out of interval data usually needs some theoretical (or technical) reasoning behind it. So if $x_5$ is delay in minutes of trains, you might want to create a dummy in which: $x=\begin{cases} 1, &\text{if x > 5}. \\ 0, &\text{else}. \end{cases}$ If a delay of 5 minutes or more is penalized by the train authority. In this example, any delay between 0 and 5 minutes have no real difference. The cut-point is what we care about. An interaction is the multiplication of two variables, which means that we have a reason to believe that the effect of $x_1$ on $y$ is varies according to the values of $x_2$. In such a case, we may say that (using a common example) that the effect of adding sugar to water ($x_1$) on sweetness ($y$) varies depending of stirring ($x_2$). Using a base variable ($x_5$) and interacting it with a dummy version of itself ($x_{5cat}$) doesn't make very much sense. Assume we are regressing a continuous, a dummy and interaction variables: $\hat{y}=a+\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_{12}x_1x_2$ the meaning of $\beta_1$ is that this will be the addition (or raise in log odds or whatever) to $\hat{y}$ with every unit increase in $x_1$, when $x_2=0$ (because of the interaction term). $\beta_2$ is the average difference between category $1$ and category $0$ when $x_1=0$. So here is the problem. If $x_2$ if a dummy of $x_1$, than $\beta_2$ is not defined because category $1$ does not exist when $x_1=0$
