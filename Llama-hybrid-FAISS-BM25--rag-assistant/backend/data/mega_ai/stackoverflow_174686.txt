In an interpreted language you might have a chance of evaluating the string using the interpreter. In C# you need a parser for the language the string is written in (the language of mathematical expressions). This is a non-trivial exercise. If you want to do it, use a recursive-descent parser. The early chapters of the "Dragon Book" (Compilers: Design, etc. by Aho, Sethi and Ullman - 1st ed 1977 or 2nd ed 2007) have a good explanation of what you need to do. An alternative might be to include in your project a component written in perl, which is supposed to be available for .NET now, and use perl to do the evaluation.
