Perl has some design principles that are based on how humans process natural languages (see http://www.wall.org/~larry/natural.html ). That's a different thing from syntactical hacks to make code read like sentences in English or some other language. I'm not entirely convinced that those are useful. As an analogy, I can also make ASCII art with my code, but that doesn't mean that my language is based on principles of visual composition. To give an example of where it may not be useful,suppose this does what it looks like it does in some rubyish/smalltalky language: 3.times say "hello!" That's nice, it makes my code a bit more readable, and there's a similar sort of fun in it to having a parrot that can talk, but it's only useful if I know the underlying rules of the computer language. The fact that it happens to look like English gives me no extra leverage or insight. I can't use the English grammar processing engine in my brain to generate sentences like the following: // The dot looks like misplaced punctuation // in the "English" above, but it's essential in // the computer language 3 times say "hello!" // syntax error // In a natural language, a reordering might make // sense, but it's impossible here because the word // order was essential to carrying the parameters // to the method invocation in the right order. say "hello" 3 times // syntax error
