Thanks to John Kruschke for helping me with this. All the model above requires to run is to change the specification of the likelihood from mu[sid[oIdx]] to mu[oIdx] . Plotting histograms of the mcmc chains for muChng1 and muChng2 reveal that the model has retrieved the higher-level group changepoints we programmed into the data very well. The advantage of this model over a single-level model is that we can get estimates of changepoints for each individual as well as for each group.
