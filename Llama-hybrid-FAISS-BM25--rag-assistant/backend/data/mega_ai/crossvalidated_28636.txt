Have you read [3] yet? It can add to your understanding of both SVM and relevant features you might want to use on each image point. For each image point if you generate features on a neighbourhood around given point you should be able to distinguish between eg grass, gravel and tarmac. This will be computationally expensive though. Other things I can think of is to use some edge detection algorithm, eg convolve the image with Sobel kernels to get X and Y gradients, prewitt or canny. Also try out different blob detection algorithms. After that you can use the hough transform[1,2] to find curves with different parameters (polynomials or splines perhaps). In the hough space graph you would probably find curves matching road edges and lines in the middle of the road. I recommend you read the book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by C. M. Bishop, Springer, 2007 and a book on computer vision of which I'm not the right person to suggest. Weka is good to test different machine learning algorithms. For production use I recommend libSVM. Please improve this question with references and be more specific on what you aim to accomplish. There can be lots of stuff on/in a road. I'm sorry for the formatting, it's written on my phone.
