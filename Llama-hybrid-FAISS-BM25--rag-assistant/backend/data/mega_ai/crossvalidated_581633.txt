Compute the Likelihood of binomial data

Say we have to following data: p = 0.95 -> rate of true positive result of pcr test. q = 0.1 -> rate of false positive result of pcr test. s = 0.2 -> rate of total patients in the population Our goal is to estimate the parameters p , q and s with Bayesian methods I generated data of 1000 people who come to check and I got data with zeros and ones. Something like that: really Now, I to compute the likelihood of these parameters in order to calculate the posterior later. After my research, I realized that likelihood is simply the pdf calculated with our data. So, I want to know if I understand.. Does it make sense for likelihood to look like this: $\\f(data|p,q,s) = \prod p^{data}(1-p)^{1-data}q^{data}(1-q)^{1-data}s\\$
