copied all the system files from the FTP to my hard drive. This one makes me a bit suspecting. Magento has case-sensitive folders in the media folder. There would be, for instance, an 'a' folder and an 'A' folder in the same location. If you downloaded your files unarchived (file by file) via FTP to a Windows machine, this would cause a conflict and would omit up to half your images.
