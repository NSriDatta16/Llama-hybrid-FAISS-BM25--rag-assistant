I have conditionally formatted some cells, and I have observed the behavior you describe. You can only change: the font style (regular/italic/bold/bold italic) whether it is underlined the color. I conditionally formatted the cells so that it turned red if the cell equals 10. I later went back and changed the regular formatting of the cells so that they were all Arial 12 point. The cell with 10 remained red. I don't think this is a bug, but rather a more subtle way to encourage you to make better font choices. You can underline it or turn it red, but it seems like Excel won't let you make it a 40 point Haettenschweiler. Edit: You mentioned that these were Excel 2003 spreadsheets that you are working with in Excel 2007. Have you been saving the spreadsheets in .xls or in .xlsx format? The inconsistent spreadsheet behavior you observe may be caused because Excel is trying to preserve Excel 2003 behavior. I recommend that you save it to Excel 2007 format (.xlsx) and see if the conditional formatting works better. (See comment trail for the full story.)
