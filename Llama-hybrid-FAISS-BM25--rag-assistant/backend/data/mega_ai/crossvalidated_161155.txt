Time Series Data Unobserved Components Model

I am using the Unobserved Components Model to decompose metal price data in Stata. i am using a model with three terms trend, cycle and irregular. I specif the model below: ucm copper, model(strend) cycle(1, frequency(1.5)) cycle(2, frequency(2.5)) my first cycle is of order 1 and the second is of 2 (as shown in the stata manual) what does the order of the cycle mean? Can i specify both cycles to be of order 1?
