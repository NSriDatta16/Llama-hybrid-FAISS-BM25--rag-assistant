GUESS or the corresponding R package R2GUESS is available for variable selection of multivariate response. The reference is: Liquet, B., Bottolo, L., Campanella, G., Richardson, S., & Chadeau-Hyam, M. (2016). R2GUESS : A Graphics Processing Unit-Based R Package for Bayesian Variable Selection Regression of Multivariate Responses. Journal of Statistical Software, 69(2), 1â€“32. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v069.i02 The R package MBSGS, available on CRAN ( link ) can perform variable selection for multivariate response using a Spike and Slab prior. It is backed by the following paper, which is not yet available unfortunately: B. Liquet, K. Mengersen, A. Pettitt and M. Sutton. (2016). Bayesian Variable Selection Regression Of Multivariate Responses For Group Data. Submitted in Bayesian Analysis. Note that the package is intended for cases where the design matrix has a group structure.
