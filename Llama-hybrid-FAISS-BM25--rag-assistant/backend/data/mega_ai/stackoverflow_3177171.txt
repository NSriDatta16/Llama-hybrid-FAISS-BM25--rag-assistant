Hashing Using SHA1

I am doing an enhancement on our system and there is this other application that is already doing the hashing / ecryption but nobody knows what algorithm was used and we do not have access to the code. I have to do the same hashing using java or javascript for our system because I need to perform a search so I need to pass the correct hashed/encrypted value. I only have the sample data saved in the database of the other system which is already hashed/encrypted. Sample text data to be hashed : 4539780225622033 I need to convert it to this value: gjfFIfHf1JsVMHbD7lwPaT43rsA= I found this site which you have to enter the text and it will generate all possible hashed values using different hashing algorithm. http://www.insidepro.com/hashes.php?lang=eng I found 4 results under SHA-1. I know how to get RESULTS 1 and 2 but I don;t know how to arrive with RESULTS 3 and 4. SHA1 Results: RESULT 1: 99a37385d70a8f383f51f70e148d9a115f1beed5 RESULT 2: maNzhdcKjzg/UfcOFI2aEV8b7tU= RESULT 3: 8237c521f1dfd49b153076c3ee5c0f693e37aec0 RESULT 4: gjfFIfHf1JsVMHbD7lwPaT43rsA= I hope you can help me with this. Thanks you very very much in advance. Bing
