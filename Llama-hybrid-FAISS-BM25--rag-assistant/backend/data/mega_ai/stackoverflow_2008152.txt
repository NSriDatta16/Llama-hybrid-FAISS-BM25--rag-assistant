When running on flash systems, make sure your filesystem is designed properly to maximize the life of the flash memory (wear levelling). JFFS and, I believe, others are now capable of doing this effectively. If you use such a system, you shouldn't be overly concerned about using the flash, but certainly if you're writing a constant stream of data you'd want to avoid doing that on the flash. Using a RAM filesystem is a good idea. Better yet is to avoid filesystems entirely if the system design will let you. To that end you mention POSH. I've never tried it, but we've found Pyro ("PYthon Remote Objects") to be an elegant and effective solution in some similar cases. And of course there's the standard library multiprocessing module, which bears some similarities in terms of how it communicates between processes. I'd start there for any new development in this area, and go elsewhere only if it failed to pan out.
