Back transform the endpoints. Quantiles are preserved if the transformation is monotonically increasing, so the probability coverage of $[e^L,e^U]$ on the untransformed scale is equal to the coverage of $[L,U]$ on the log scale. The interval will not be the shortest possible interval, but it will have the required coverage.
