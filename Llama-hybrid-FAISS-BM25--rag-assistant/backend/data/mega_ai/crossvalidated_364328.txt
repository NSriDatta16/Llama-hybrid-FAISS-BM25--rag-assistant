Late in the game but there are some new developments in this front, for example LIME and SHAP . Also a package worth checking is DALEX (in particular if using R but in any case contains nice cheatsheets etc.), though doesn't seem to cover interactions at the moment. And these are all model-agnostic so will work for random forests, GBMs, neural networks, etc.
