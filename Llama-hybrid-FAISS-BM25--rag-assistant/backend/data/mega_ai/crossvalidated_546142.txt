First, let's define some terms: $$ \mu: \text{overall mean}\\ \mu_i: \text{mean for region } i, \space i\in \{1,2,3\}\\ \tau_i = \mu_i-\mu $$ You're interested in understanding whether there are differences in average monthly salary between the three regions. Therefore, you're hypotheses are: $$ H_0: \tau_1=\tau_2=\tau_3=0\\ H_1: \tau_i\neq0 \text{ at least for one }i $$ You can test this hypothesis by carrying out an analysis of variance (ANOVA). In R: # simulate some data set.seed(1) regions Output: region salary south 20821.22 north 18389.22 north 17359.06 east 20021.30 south 17785.30 # carry out an ANOVA aov_regions Output: Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) region 2 148320705 74160353 25.05 7.04e-07 *** Residuals 27 79923237 2960120 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 In this case, we reject $H_0$ at the 0.1% significance level and therefore conclude that there are differences in average salary between the three regions (note we already knew that because we simulated the data that way). For completeness' sake, imagine that the three regions didn't have different salaries: # simulate some data set.seed(1) regions_equal Output: region salary south 21642.44 north 19389.22 north 18359.06 east 16021.30 south 15570.60 # carry out an ANOVA aov_regions_equal Output: Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) region 2 3074875 1537438 0.432 0.653 Residuals 27 95989044 3555150 --- Now the p-value is $0.653\gg 0.05$ so we couldn't reject the null hypothesis of equal salaries in this case.
