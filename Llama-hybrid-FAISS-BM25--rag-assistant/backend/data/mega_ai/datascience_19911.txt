What could be the value of having a business analyst in a data science team?

Correct me if I am wrong, but while business analysts are often an important role in software delivery teams, but it seems not the case in the data science field. Commonly available data scientist skill sets state also importance of story-telling skills and understanding customer's business, but is that enough?
