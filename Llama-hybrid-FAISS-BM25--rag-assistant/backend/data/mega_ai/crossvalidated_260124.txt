Automated forecasting of 1000 weekly time series (food product retail)

I have a set of 1000 time series with weekly data. These time series data are concerning the sales of food product retail. Can anyone suggest me the best/correct way to make good forecasts of this set of time series with R? Obviously I can't analyze them one at a time because there are too many of them! Anybody have a few pieces of advice for me, please?
