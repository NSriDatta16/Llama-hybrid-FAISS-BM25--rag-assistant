Often you call the dynamically added methods like list(), findAll(), findByFooAndBar(), etc., but you can always add your own. So in your case you'd create something like this: class ShopCategoryPageTab { ... List findAllProductsByXYZ(x, y, z) { ... } } Name it however you like of course, and the implementation will be a criteria query or an HQL query via executeQuery().
