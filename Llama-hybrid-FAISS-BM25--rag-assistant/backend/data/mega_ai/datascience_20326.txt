Why Matlab neural network classification returns decimal values on prediction dataset?

I have an input dataset (matrix 25x2275) which is normalized to values between 0 and 1. I also have a binary formatted output matrix (3x2275) like 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1, 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ... I imported both files in matlab nntool and it automatically created a network with 25 input and 3 output nodes as I wanted. After I trained this network using feed-forward backProp, I tested the model in its training data and each output nodes returns a decimal value like (0.9999 0.978 1 0 0.99 0.59368 0.38359 0.31435 1.0604). Why it doesn't return discrete values like 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1? Is there any thing that I must set in nntool to get such values?
