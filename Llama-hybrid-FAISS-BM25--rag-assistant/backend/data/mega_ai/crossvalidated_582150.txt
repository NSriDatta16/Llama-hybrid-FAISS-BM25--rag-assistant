You have to learn a possibly multimodal distribution $p(Y|X=x)$ for each $x$ . Ordinarily, one presumes that the distribution $p(Y|X)$ is normal and has a variance that is independent of $x$ : $$ p(Y|X=x) \sim N(\mu(x), \sigma^2). $$ In your use case, this changes and you have to learn a distribution that is more complex, e.g. a mixture of Gaussians: $$ p(Y|X=x) \sim \sum_{i=1}^k \pi_i(x) N(\mu_i(x), \sigma_i^2(x)). $$ This is often done using density networks which are neural networks that do not just learn the mean of a distribution but actually all the parameters of a more complex distribution. I.e., in the above example of a Gaussian mixture, those neural networks are also called "mixture density networks" and they would learn the parameters $\pi_i(x), \mu_i(x), \sigma_i^2(x)$ .
