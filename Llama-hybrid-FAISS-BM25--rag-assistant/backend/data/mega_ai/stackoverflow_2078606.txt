Dynamically adding listeners in Google Maps where iframe src is set differently for each marker

Hi I've read the articles and the excellent piece on scope and closures by Robert Nyman. However i cannot get this to work. I'm trying to assign a mouseover event to various markers and then set an iframe src depending on the marker moused over. I get the infamous last entry for every mouseover event. I've played with it for the better part of a few days and not even the 'thinking fluid' is helping :). Any guidance appreciated for(var i=0; i var latlngr = new google.maps.LatLng(mylatd,mylongd); markerno = "marker_"+i; markerarray[i] = new google.maps.Marker({ position: latlngr, map: map, title:myname }); google.maps.event.addListener(markerarray[i], 'mouseover', function(markerno) {return function() { mysrc = 'http://adds.aviationweather.gov/metars/index.php?submit=1&station_ids='+myicao+'&chk_metars=on&chk_tafs=on&std_trans=translated'; alert (mysrc); $('#weather').attr({src: mysrc}); }(markerno) }); }
