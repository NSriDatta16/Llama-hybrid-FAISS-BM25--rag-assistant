Help with .htaccess rewrite

I'm having some issues trying to set up the .htaccess to have the Magento URLs the way I want. I want to redirect URLs like so: domain.com/fr/store loads from domain.com/store?__store=france domain.com/fr/store/category.html loads from domain.com/store/category.html?__store=france domain.com/fr/store/category/product.html loads from domain.com/store/category/product.html?__store=france Here is what I have so far: RewriteRule ^fr/store(.*)$ /store/$1?___store=france [L,P] It works to redirect everything to the main store, but I can't access sub-directories or pages.
