Multilabel Tweet Classification

I need some general advice and possible ideas. Problem statement goes like this -- We are given a tweet and we have to specify associated labels for it like generalized hate, support, oppose, refutation, allegation, sarcasm. The training data is ~6k tweets. However, there is very high class imbalance. Almost 90% of classes have 0s and rest are one. The approach I have tried: Classical BoW with a generic tweet preprocessing trained using SVM, XGB, Naive Bayes etc. Although accuracy is good (due to class imbalance) but AUC is very poor ~0.52. Sophisticated techniques like LSTM, GRU with Glove embedding, BERT is performing even poorer AUC What I figured out that the BERT vocab is not recognizing most of the words and mapping it to zero. What other approaches should I try? Any leads are appreciated.
