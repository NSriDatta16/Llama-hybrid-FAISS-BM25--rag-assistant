Minimize number of clicks Uniform look(text size, buttons.. and other controls ) Minimize free edits... (ex: in an address entry... provide states in a dropdown...etc etc) In a drop down for country list... list the residing country first...(how many of you frustrated with USA being listed at the bottom and you have to scroll down?) General drop downs can be ordered as the users choice No Spelling msitake ;) at all Pay attention to labeling text: for email address (have the caption as email... believe me... i have seen it as e_mail address:) Currency symbol for amounts. uniform digit display in amount.. ex: $12.15 ==> $12.15 $10.9 ==> $10.90 9.Progress/Status bar Buddy label to indicate the error field before the user clicks OK/Save button(ex: for an email address if there is no "@" there is no need to wait until user clicks OK then tell them invalid email Address) Avoid repeated inputs... (ex: remember me option in login screen) global application option to let the user continue from where left off in the previous instance) when showing data on a grid... excel style filter options default values for inputs. Folks...feel free to flush down any of the point above with the valid reasons!!!
