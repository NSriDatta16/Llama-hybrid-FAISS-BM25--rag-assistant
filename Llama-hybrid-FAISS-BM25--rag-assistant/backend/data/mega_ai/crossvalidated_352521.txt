You do not bring new information, only treat it differently, so the final forecast will not be better. If you think about some thing in line of AdaBoost, you will train 365 weak learners (the temperature of a given day) on 100 points, then find the better weighted average for the 365 weak learners. You will get something that is not very far of the average over 100 years for the 365 weak learners and for the weight the daily variation. AdaBoost, and other boosting methods, are efficient because there is no obvious global method.
