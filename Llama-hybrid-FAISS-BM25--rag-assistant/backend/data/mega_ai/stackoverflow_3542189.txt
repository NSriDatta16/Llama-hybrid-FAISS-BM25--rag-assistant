I'm trying the same thing. Though in my case captureStillImageAsynchronouslyFromConnection take 0.5 seconds to return, so maybe you are doing some processing in the completion handler? If that's the case, I came up with 2 options, both of which are not sufficient for me, but might do for you What I came up with is either: * call stopRunning on the capture session when the completion handler is called (again, 0.5 seconds in my case), and then after processing call startRunning again. * have an UIImageView on top of the overlay, and store the last picture taken, either from camera or video stream in this imageview while you are doing your processing. What discouraged me from both solutions was that they both add a couple of seconds to the process. But I hope it helps, or gives a direction. Cheers, Oded.
