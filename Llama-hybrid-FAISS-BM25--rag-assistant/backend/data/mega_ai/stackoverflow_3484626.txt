There's a lot of info you didn't include, but should think about: 1.) Are you storing integers or floats? What is the typical range of the numbers? For example: storing small comma-separated integers in ascii, such as "1,2,4,2,1" will average 2-bytes per datum, but storing them as binary would require 4-bytes per datum. If your integers are typically 3 digits, then comma-separated vs binary won't matter much. On the other hand, storing doubles (8-byte values) will almost certainly be smaller in binary format. 2.) How do you need to access these values? If you are not concerned about access time, compress away! On the other hand, if you need speedy, random access then compression will probably hinder you. 3.) Are some values frequently repeated? Then you may consider a Huffman encoding or a table of "short-cut" values.
