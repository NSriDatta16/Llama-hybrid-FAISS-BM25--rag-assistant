I think this is very annoying, and I think it is arrogant to call a feature "useless" because it has problems dealing with certain use cases. The biggest problem with the glibc approach is that it hard-codes paths to system libraries (gconv as well as nss), and thus it breaks when people try to run a static binary on a Linux distribution different from the one it was built for. Anyway, you can work around the gconv issue by setting GCONV_PATH to point to the appropriate location, this allowed me to take binaries built on Ubuntu and run them on Red Hat.
