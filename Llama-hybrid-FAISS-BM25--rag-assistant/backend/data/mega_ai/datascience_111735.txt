Can I use Sentence-Bert to embed event triples?

I extracted event triples from sentences using OpenIE. Can I concatenate the components in the event triple to make it a sentence and use Sentence-Bert to embed it? It seems no one has done this way before so I am questioning my idea. I'm using news headlines to predict next day's stock movement. For example, there are two news headlines, the first is "U.S. stock index futures points to higher start" , I used openIE to extract it and there are two event triples, [('U.S. stock index futures', 'points to', 'start'), ('U.S. stock index futures', 'points to', 'higher start')]. (There are repetition in the openIE extracted event triples and I don't know how to avoid it.) Since it contains events I'm interested in (stock index), I will embed these two events and take their mean as the the embedding. The second headline is "STOCKS NEWS US- Economic and earnings diary for Jan 4" , it contains no events as it is only contain nouns. So I will embed it as 0 vector in this case.
