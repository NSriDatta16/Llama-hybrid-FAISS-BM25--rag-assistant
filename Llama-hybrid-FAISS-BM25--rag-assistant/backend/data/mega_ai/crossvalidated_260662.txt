Traditional Random Forest uses "Gini Gain" splitting criterion in assessing Variable Importance, which is biased towards factor variables with many levels/categories. In contract, cforest function creates random forests not from CART trees, but from unbiased classification trees based on conditional inference, which gives much more robust results when multifactorial variables are involved, particularly when the function is used with subsampling without replacement. Here's a good paper that explains the differences more in depth: Bias in random forest variable importance measures: Illustrations, sources and a solution . Strobl et al. (2007)
