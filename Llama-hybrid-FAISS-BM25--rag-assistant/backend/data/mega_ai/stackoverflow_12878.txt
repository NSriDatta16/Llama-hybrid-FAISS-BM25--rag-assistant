You could do essentially the same code with Hashtables (or some other Map): Hashtable > schedule = new Hashtable >(); schedule.put("A", new Hashtable ()); schedule.put("B", new Hashtable ()); schedule.put("C", new Hashtable ()); schedule.put("D", new Hashtable ()); schedule.put("E", new Hashtable ()); schedule.get("A").put("Winter", "M"); schedule.get("A").put("Spring", "tTS"); // Etc... Not as elegant, but then again, Java isn't a dynamic language, and it doesn't have hashes on the language level. Note: You might be able to do a better solution, this just popped in my head as I read your question.
