Your data structure being aligned so that your int falls on word boundries, which for your target might be 32 or 64 bits. You can reorganize your struct like so so that this won't happen: struct thestruct { int var6; unsigned char var1; unsigned char var2; unsigned char var3[2]; unsigned char var4; unsigned char var5[8]; unsigned char var7[4]; };
