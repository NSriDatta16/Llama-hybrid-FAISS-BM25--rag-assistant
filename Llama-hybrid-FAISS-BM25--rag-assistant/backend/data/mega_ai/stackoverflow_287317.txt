There are some Profilers available but, frankly, I think your approach is better. The profiler approach is overkill. Maybe the use of profilers is worth the trouble if you absolutely have no clue where the bottleneck is. I would rather spend a little time analyzing the problem up front and putting a few strategic print statements than figure out how to instrument your app for profiling then pour over gargantuan reports where every executable line of code is timed.
