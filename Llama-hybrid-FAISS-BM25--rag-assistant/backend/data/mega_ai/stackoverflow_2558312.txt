Dependency between multiple classes

I am confuse between the best way to organize dependency between multiple classes assume i have the following classes Employee, Salary, DataAccess Should i go for: Option1 Employee emp = new Employee(); Salary sal = new Salary(); DataAccess data = new DataAccess(); sal.Calculate(emp); data.Save(emp); or Option2 Employee emp = new Employee(); Salary sal = new Salary(); sal.Calculate(emp); //once salary has been calculated salary object will initialize data access class to do the actual saving. or Option 3 Employee emp = new Employee(); emp.Calculate(); // employee object will encapsulate both the salary and data access object
