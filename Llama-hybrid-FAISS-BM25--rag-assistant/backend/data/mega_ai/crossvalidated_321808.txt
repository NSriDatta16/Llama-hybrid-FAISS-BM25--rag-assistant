Interesting issue! I think the first idea did not come through the integration of complex formula; rather, the result of applying the asymptotics in combinatorics. Pen and paper method may take several weeks; not so tough for Karl Gauss compared to calculation of pie for his predecessors. I think Gauss's idea was courageous; calculation was easy for him. Example of creating standard z table from scratch- 1. Take a population of n (say n is 20) numbers and list all possible samples of size r (say r is 5) from that. 2. calculate the sample means. You get nCr sample means (here, 20c5=15504 means). 3. Their mean is the same as population mean. Find the stdev of sample means. 4. Find z scores of sample means using those pop mean and stdev of sample means. 5. Sort z in ascending order and find the probability of z being in a range in your nCr z values. 6. Compare values with normal tables. Smaller n is good for hand calculations. Larger n will produce closer approximates of the normal table values. The following code is in r: n Probability of z falling between 0 and positive value q below; compare with a known table. Manipulate q below between 0 and 3.5 to compare. q
