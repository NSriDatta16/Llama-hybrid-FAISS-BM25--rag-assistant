I'd probably go with MFC. Although MFC itself does nothing to support DirectX graphics, a few people have written various classes to create an MFC view that uses DirectX for the display. While none of these is particularly new, little seems to have changed -- I haven't tested all of them, but (for example) the first link (to CodeProject) built fine in 32-bits with VS 2008, and needed only one trivial change to work as 64-bit code as well (change GetClassLong to GetClassLongPtr, and GCL_CURSOR to GCLP_CURSOR). Another possibility would be to consider something like Ogre3D , which at least one person has successfully integrated with MFC.
