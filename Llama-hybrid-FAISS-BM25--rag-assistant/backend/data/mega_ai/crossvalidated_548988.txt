Test whether expected shortfalls of two distributions are equal

I have paired samples of size 1000 from two distributions. I would like to test a null hypothesis that the 2.5% expected shortfalls 1 of the two distributions are equal. How can I do that? (This is a special case of another problem that deals with overlapping observations and some additional complications.) 1 $q$ % expected shortfall is (the negative of) the expected value of the observations belonging to the left tail that is cut off at the $q$ % quantile level. Synonyms of expected shortfall are conditional value at risk (CVaR), average value at risk (AVaR), expected tail loss (ETL), and superquantile.
