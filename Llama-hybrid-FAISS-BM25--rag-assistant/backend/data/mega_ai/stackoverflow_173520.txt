How can I change the 259 char limit inside WinForms Treeview LabelEdit?

My VB.Net Winforms app is a tool to allow hierarchical data to be edited in a tree, then stored in a database. I am using a treeview control. Content is drag-dropped from other documents onto the treenodes, or the nodes can be edited directly. if I edit the database field directly, and enter a bit of content (a thousand characters long or more!), the treeview will happily display it.. but, when I drag drop, the data is being truncated at 259 characters. If I edit directly, the maximum edit 'window' is also 259 characters. 259 seems like a really strange number to stop at, so I am wondering - where does this size come from, and can I change it programmatically?
