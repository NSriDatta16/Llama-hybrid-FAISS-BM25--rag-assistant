There is a good reason for still having both, which is that a good craftsman will want to select the best tool for the task at hand, and both Bayesian and frequentist methods have applications where they are the best tool for the job. However, often the wrong tool for the job is used because frequentist statistics are more amenable to a "statistics cookbook" approach which makes them easier to apply in science and engineering than their Bayesian counterparts, even though the Bayesian methods provide a more direct answer to the question posed (which is generally what we can infer from the particular sample of data we actually have). I am not greatly in favour of this as the "cookbook" approach leads to using statistics without a solid understanding of what you are actually doing, which is why things like the p-value fallacy crop up again and again. However, as time progresses, the software tools for the Bayesian approach will improve and they will be used more frequently as jbowman rightly says. I am a Bayesian by inclination (it seems to make a lot more sense to me than the frequentist approach), however I end up using frequentist statistics in my papers, partly because I will have trouble with the reviewers if I use Bayesian statistics as they will be "non-standard". Finally (somewhat tongue in cheek ;o), to quote Max Plank "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."
