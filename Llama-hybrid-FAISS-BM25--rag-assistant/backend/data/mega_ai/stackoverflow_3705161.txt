What is the security surrounding these files ? Objects in a database may be easier to secure, and audit access to. Also, have a look at SecureFiles / DBFS and deduplication Basically, if you store a lot of copies of the same file, the database will realize that and only have one physical copy. The equivalent of symbolic links. Write performance for SecureFiles is better than a regular filesystem With DBFS you can also mount the database as a filesystem. That can make it very easy to switch between a 'regular' filesystem storage and database storage.
