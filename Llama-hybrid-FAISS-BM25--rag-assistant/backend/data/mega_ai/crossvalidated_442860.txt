Asymptotic confidence intervals on 'small' samples can have wider than nominal coverage, narrower than nominal coverage, or a mixture of bothâ€¦ sometimes a complicated mixture of both wider and narrower coverage. (This is a broad question, so this answer is similarly broad.) The particulars of wider vs narrower vs a mixture of both will depend on the specific distribution and the sample size in question, as well as by the specific form of CI. As one example, Figure 4 from Agresti & Coull (1998) below illustrates the empirical coverage probabilities based on simulations using two asymptotic CIs (left and center), and the exact CI (right) for a proportion (the $p$ of a Bernoulli distribution) at sample sizes 5 and 10. As you can see, the Wald CI produces narrower than nominal coverage for virtually all values of $p$ , the adjusted Wald CI appears to have less bias than the Wald CI when averaged across all values of $p$ , but has a mixture, and the exact ('non-asymptotic') has strictly wider coverage. Also of note is the heterogeneous patterning of the biases across values of $p$ . So the answer is in effect it depends .
