Python 3.0 urllib.parse error "Type str doesn't support the buffer API"

File "/usr/local/lib/python3.0/cgi.py", line 477, in __init__ self.read_urlencoded() File "/usr/local/lib/python3.0/cgi.py", line 577, in read_urlencoded self.strict_parsing): File "/usr/local/lib/python3.0/urllib/parse.py", line 377, in parse_qsl pairs = [s2 for s1 in qs.split('&') for s2 in s1.split(';')] TypeError: Type str doesn't support the buffer API Can anybody direct me on how to avoid this? I'm getting it through feeding data into the cgi.Fieldstorage and I can't seem to do it any other way.
