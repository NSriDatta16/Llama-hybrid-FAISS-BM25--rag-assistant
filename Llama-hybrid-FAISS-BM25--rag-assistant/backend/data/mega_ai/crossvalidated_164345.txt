For an exponentially WMA you would get a flat forecast. My answer is derived from the information at http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411avg.htm . Say you are using an exponentially Weighted Moving average for a series $\{Y_t\}$. You can write it as $$ S_{t}= \alpha Y_{t}+(1-\alpha)S_{t-1} $$ Your smoothed value $S_t$ is the point forecast for the next time period, i.e. $\hat Y_{t+1}=S_t$. Thus $$ \hat Y_{t+1}= \alpha Y_{t}+(1-\alpha)\hat Y_{t} $$ The only thing that you can do if you wanted to forecast 2 periods into the future is substitute in $\hat Y_{t+1}$ for $Y_{t+1}$ $$ \hat Y_{t+2}= \alpha \hat Y_{t+1}+(1-\alpha)\hat Y_{t+1}=\hat Y_{t+1} $$ and so $\hat Y_{t+1}=\hat Y_{t+2}=\hat Y_{t+3}=\hat Y_{t+4}=...$ and so on. It is not that you can't forecast farther into the future, rather the forecast is flat. A flat forecast is not necessarily a bad forecast either. The random walk without drift is a flat forecast, and for certain time series, like crude oil for example, it outperforms most all other time series models some of which are very sophisticated.
