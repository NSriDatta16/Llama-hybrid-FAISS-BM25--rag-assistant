You have a couple of options: Remove the out-of-the-box ROOT/ directory from tomcat and rename your war file to ROOT.war before deploying it. Deploy your war as (from your example) war_name.war and configure the context root in conf/server.xml to use your war file : The first one is easier, but a little more kludgy. The second one is probably the more elegant way to do it.
