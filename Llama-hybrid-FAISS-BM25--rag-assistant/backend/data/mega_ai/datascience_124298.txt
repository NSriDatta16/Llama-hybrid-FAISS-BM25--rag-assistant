What does maximize average log probability mean?

In the word2vec paper ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf ) that introduces the skip-gram algorithm we encounter this phrase: which says that we maximize the average log probability. Can someone help me understand how this formula maximizes? I don't have the intuition of what maximizing the probability means and why doing a sum over it would maximize it. The only way I can think of maximizing is in the context of maximizing likelihood which you calculate using a probability density function.
