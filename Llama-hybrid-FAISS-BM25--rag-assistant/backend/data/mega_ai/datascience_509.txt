For example...if u have an agricultural land then selecting one particular area of that land would be feature selection.If u aim to find the affected plants in that area den u need to observe each plant based on a particular feature that is common in each plant so as to find the abnormalities...for this u would be considering feature extraction.In this example the original agricultural land corresponds to Dimensionality reduction.
