I have all negatives in (some) of my folds in cross validation. Seeking best way to calculate AUC using R in this scenario?

Problem The title explains my problem. I cannot calculate AUC as things currently stand because some of my data sets have only negatives. I have three possible solutions and I need input from more experienced statisticians. I am still a learner and my research has not revealed to me an appropriate methodology to address this issue. Further Details I am doing k fold cross validation in R where k = 1 . I have 12 independent data sets (which recorded the same observations). Therefore, I will have a fold that looks like this which will give me problems: training: 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 testing: 4 I've got some R code to calculate the AUC. Given the above, I use the training for my trainingDataSet . The testingDataSet is comprised of data set 4. model The error it gives is as follows: Error in prediction(p, testingDataSet$a) : Number of classes is not equal to 2. ROCR currently supports only evaluation of binary classification tasks. This is because my testingData only has negative numbers. I'll provide the following R code to show you. Please see: testingDataSet$a . > unique(testingDataSet$a) [1] 0 Perhaps a more robust way to show you is to show you the entire training set variable we are trying to predict for: > testingDataSet$a [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Thus, we have a training set that is comprised of all negatives. I have another fold that is similar. Question I have three solutions that I believe can solve the issues I am facing. Clearly, the last two proposed solutions I think are very poor solutions, but some I have read in data science forums and included them here to be thorough. That said, I feel they are very ill advised. Throw out k cross validation for k = 1 and k = 2 . I have two datasets that have all negatives. I need testing and training validations that have both negatives and positives. I can then choose k = 3 and k = 4 for instance. Remove the datasets that have all negative results. (Bad idea) Compute AUC as 5.0 when given a data set with all negative results. (Bad idea) This is the first time I have encountered this problem. I deeply appreciate your mentorship and assistance to a learner and what is considered best practice in this scenario. I think I have found it above, but definitely open to further suggestions or more formal statistical methodology here that I am not aware of. Thank you for your time and for reading this question.
