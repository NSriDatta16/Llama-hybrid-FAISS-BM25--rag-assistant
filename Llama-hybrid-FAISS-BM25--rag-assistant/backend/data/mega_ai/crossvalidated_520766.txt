The z- and t-test have convergence properties that can make up for some deviations from normality when sample sizes are large. I question if the mean should be the value of interest when distributions are funky, however, and you’re right to wonder how big of a sample size is necessary for the convergence theorems to kick in. More important, though, is that z-testing seems inappropriate for your task. It sounds like you have age bins (not ideal to bin ages, but if you don’t have the original ages, you must work with what is available) and a binary variable of vegetarian/not. This sounds like a good place to use a chi-squared test or a G-test. They’re almost the same, and chi-squared is the more mainstream method, though G has an elegance that I like. A more sophisticated approach might treat the age bins as ordinal.
