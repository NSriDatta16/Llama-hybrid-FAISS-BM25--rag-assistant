Maybe this is what you are looking for. Here are the steps: 1) Locate the "php.ini" file. In my case, I found it at this path: C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.0\php.ini Don't use the WAMP system tray icon to edit this file. It didn't work when I tried - you have to manually locate it. 2) Find the following line, in bold: ; http://php.net/phar.require-hash;phar.require_hash = On ; http://php.net/phar.require-hash ;phar.require_hash = On 3) Uncomment the ";phar.require_hash = On" line by removing the semi-colon. 4) Change "On" to "Off". ; http://php.net/phar.require-hash phar.require_hash = Off 5) Save the file. After I performed those steps, "go-pear.bat" began working normally again.
