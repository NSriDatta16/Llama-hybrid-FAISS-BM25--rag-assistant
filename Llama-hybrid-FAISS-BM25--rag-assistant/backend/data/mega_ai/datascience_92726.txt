In my experience, some notes that I can share. I wouldn't trust SMOTE to the extent to create test instances. Profoundly, it may create artificial data that is too similar to each other, hence, the high accuracy. Thus, I would create SMOTE samples only in the training set. Since your dataset is small I would use something like a " leave one out " cross-validation. I assume to create artificial samples for all the classes is to make your model more accurate. Again you can try with only the train data but in machine learning similar (statistical sampling) approaches are integrated into the classifiers (e.g., bootstrapping, random forest etc) to make the classifiers perform better. Speaking of which since your dataset is small you could try a decision tree implementation.
