How can I take multiple vectors and recode their datatypes in R?

I'm looking for an elegant way to change multiple vectors' datatypes in R. I'm working with an educational dataset: 426 students' answers to eight multiple choice questions ( 1 = correct, 0 = incorrect), plus a column indicating which instructor ( 1, 2, or 3 ) taught their course. As it stands, my data is sitting pretty in data.df , like this: str(data.df) 'data.frame': 426 obs. of 9 variables: $ ques01: int 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ... $ ques02: int 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ ques03: int 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 ... $ ques04: int 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ ques05: int 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ ques06: int 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ ques07: int 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 ... $ ques08: int 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 ... $ inst : num 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... But those ques0x values aren't really integers. Rather, I think it's better to have R treat them as experimental factors. Same goes for the "inst" values. I'd love to turn all those int s and num s into factors Ideally, an elegant solution should produce a dataframe—I call it factorData.df —that looks like this: str(factorData.df) 'data.frame': 426 obs. of 9 variables: $ ques01: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 ... $ ques02: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ ques03: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 ... $ ques04: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ ques05: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ ques06: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ ques07: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 ... $ ques08: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 ... $ inst : Factor w/ 3 levels "1","2","3": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... I'm fairly certain that whatever solution you folks come up with, it ought to be easy to generalize to any n number of variables that'd need to get reclassified, and would work across most common conversions ( int -> factor and num -> int , for example). No matter what solution you folks generate, it's bound to be more elegant than mine Because my current clunky code is just 9 separate factor() statements, one for each variable, like this factorData.df$ques01 I'm brand-new to R, programming, and stackoverflow. Please be gentle, and thanks in advance for your help!
