Bayesian updating of a constant probability using one data point

A reformulation of a question that came up in a model: Imagine a toy store that sells $K$ toys, where our prior is that each toy has equal probability $1/K$ of being purchased by a customer. Then you have a customer come in and buy a teddy bear. Can we use Bayesian updating to find a new probability estimate of a customer buying a teddy bear?
