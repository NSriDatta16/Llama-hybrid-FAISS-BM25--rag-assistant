mod_python includes the FieldStorage class which allows you access to uploaded form data. In order to use it, you'd put something like the following in your Python script: req.form = FieldStorage(req) description = req.form['fdesc'] Since fdesc is a text input, description will be a string (more precisely, a StringField , which you can treat as a string). file_field = req.form['fname'] Since fname is a file input, file_field will not be a string (or StringField ), but rather a Field object which allows you access to the file data. The attribute file_field.file is a file-like object which you can use to read the file's contents, for example like so: for line in file_field.file: # process the line You could use this to copy the file's data somewhere of your choosing, for example. file_field.filename is the name of the file as provided by the client. Other useful attributes are listed in the documentation I linked to.
