A time series represents a temporal sequence of data - and generally for sequential data LSTM is the preferred DNN algorithm as it handles sequences much better . CNN generally becomes useful when you want to capture neighbourhood information like in an image. having said this , please refer this article on how to use CNN for multivariate time series : [https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-convolutional-neural-network-models-for-time-series-forecasting/#:~:text=%5B%5B101.67965%5D%5D-,Multivariate%20CNN%20Models,Multiple%20Parallel%20Series]
