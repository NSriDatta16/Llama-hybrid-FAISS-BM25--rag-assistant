Use a HTML parser to get the first paragraph, flattening its structure (i.e. remove decorating HTML tags inside the paragraph). Search for the position of the nth whitespace character. Take the substring from 0 to that position. edit: I removed the regex proposal for step 2 and 3, since it was wrong (thanks to the commenter). Also, the HTML structure needs to be flattened.
