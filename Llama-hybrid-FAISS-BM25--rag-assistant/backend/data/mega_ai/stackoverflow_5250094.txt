I'd previously built Android APKs with Ant 1.8.2 but only from the command line, never in Eclipse. I'm letting it import the main_rules.xml from the Android SDK, so that all the Proguard targets get included automatically. I'm running Windows not Linux and have Ant in my path. I thought I'd see if it can be built using the Eclipse plugin. I've had success doing the following: 1) As Raghuram suggested, set the Eclipse Ant preference runtime to the folder where your 1.8 is. If you try and build an Android build.xml (imported into Eclipse) it will fail saying that it can't find the the Ant setup task. 2) I then added the AndroidSDK/tools/lib/antasks.jar into the Global entries for the classpath under the Eclipse/Preferences/Ant/Runtime preferences. The Ant view in Eclipse still says it can't find the classpath, but I ignore it and select the target and run it. It builds just fine. The only snag is that the Ant view doesn't tell me what particular build.xml it is. That might be because I don't have the project name in my build.xmls, as I have it in the build.properties file, so that I can use the same build.xml fro different projects.
