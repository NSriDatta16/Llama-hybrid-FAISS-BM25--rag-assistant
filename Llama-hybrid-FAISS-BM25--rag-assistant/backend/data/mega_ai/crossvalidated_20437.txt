Why should we care about rapid mixing in MCMC chains?

When working with Markov chain Monte Carlo to draw inference, we need a chain that mixes rapidly, i.e. moves throughly the support of the posterior distribution rapidly. But I don't understand why we need this property, because from what I understand, the accepted candiate draws should and will concentrated in the high density part of the posterior distribution. If what I understand is true, then do we still want the chain to move through the support ( which includes the low density part) ? In addition, if I am using MCMC to do optimization, do I still need to care about rapid mixing and why? Thank you for sharing your thoughts!
