Since the log-normal distribution has two parameters, you can't satisfactorily fit it to three constraints that don't naturally fit it. With extreme quantiles of 2.5 and 7.5, the mode is ~4, and there is not much you can do about it. Since the scale of the errors for a and b is much smaller than for c , one of them will be pretty much ignored during the optimization. For a better fit, you can either pick a three-parameter distribution, for example the generalized gamma distribution (implemented in the VGAM package), or add a shift parameter to the lognormal (or gamma, ...) distribution. As a last note, since the distribution you are looking for is clearly not symmetric, the average of the two given observations is not the right value for the mode. I would maximize the sum of the densities at 3.0 and 3.6 while maintaining the extreme quantiles at 2.5 and 7.5 - this is possible if you have three parameters.
