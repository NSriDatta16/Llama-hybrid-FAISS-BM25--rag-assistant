Fourier transform in Machine Learning

I want to know what are the specific areas in which Fourier methods are used in machine learning. Apart from feature extraction and spectral analysis, I want to know if there are any learning algorithms that are based on Fourier methods. I also want to know if there is any motivation for using Fourier methods for probabilistic graphical models.
