I'd say a streaming server is your best bet, something like FMS or Red5. There are a couple of transcoders from WAV to MP3, this being an example: http://code.google.com/p/flash-kikko/ All the examples I could find of encoding on the client use Alchemy, which leverages C or C++ code and compiles it into your swf, if this sounds like fun to you good luck, otherwise I'd look at the server options I mentioned first.
