.Net sln structure

I have been working on variety of projects at my work. I am thinking to organize all the projects within solutions in the following tree structure: [Common Libraries] -- virtual and real folder project1 project2 .... -- projects or folders [Application Group1] [Application1] project1 -- console application as example projectLib1 -- project library for project1 [dependency libraries1] projectLib1_1 -- dependency project for upper projectLib1 .... Basically, the top folder contains all the common libraries and its dependency projects. Virtual folders (real folder as well) are used as a way to group projects and sub-groups. In this way, projects can only see or reference projects in the same level and upper level. Any comments or other alternative way to organize projects?
