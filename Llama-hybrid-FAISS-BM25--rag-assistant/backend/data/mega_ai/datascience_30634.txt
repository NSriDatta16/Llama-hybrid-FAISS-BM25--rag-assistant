This is discussed in stackoverflow , just to recap: Define your your customized cost function, e.g.: def new_cost(y_pred, y_true): # perform calculation for new cost return 'new_cost', score Then pass it to the feval argument (see official doc ) for training like: model = xgboost.train(params, dtrain, num_rounds, watchlist, feval=new_cost) There are many examples out there if you search harder for more concrete use cases.
