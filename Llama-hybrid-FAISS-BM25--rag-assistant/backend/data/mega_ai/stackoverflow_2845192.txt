How do i render a web cam filter instead of video file in directshow?

How do i render a web cam filter instead of video file? I am looking at the vmr9compositor example included in the directshow sdk. It renders a video file. I would like to stream in the feed from the webcam. It SEEMS like this should be possible, but I dont have much of a grasp on directshow. It uses this method call currently: hr = g_graph->RenderFile( pFileName, NULL ); Looking at the playcap example in the sdk which can display the web cam feed in a window, I see that it uses hr = g_pCapture->RenderStream (&PIN_CATEGORY_PREVIEW, &MEDIATYPE_Video, pSrcFilter, NULL, NULL)); to display the web cam stream. pSrcFilter is an IBaseFilter. How can I can swap the video file in the vmr app with the web cam feed? Windows XP, Visual Studio 2008 C++
