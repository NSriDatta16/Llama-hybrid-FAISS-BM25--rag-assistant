Yes, you need to call the method to resize your content after the scroll view's animation is complete. You can do that in the scroll view delegate's scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation: method. Set your controller as the delegate, and implement that method. - (void)scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation:(UIScrollView *)scrollView { [scrollView setContentSize: newSize]; } You don't need a timer or a table view for this.
