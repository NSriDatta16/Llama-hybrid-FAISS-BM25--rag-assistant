In Erlang, as in other languages, you can print your variables, no matter if they are a list, a tuple or anything else. My feeling is that, for printing, you're doing something like (just a guess): io:format("The value is: ~p.", A). This is wrong, because you're supposed to pass a list of arguments: io:format("The value is: ~p.", [A]). Where A can be anything. I usually find comfortable to use: erlang:display/1 to print variables. Also, tracing functions is usually a better way to debug an application, rather than using printouts.
