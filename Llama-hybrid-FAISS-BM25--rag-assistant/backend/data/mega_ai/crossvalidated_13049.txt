Your edited question sheds new light on the issue, thanks! My first thought is that you'd want to do some kind of Chi-squared test to determine if the output is random. If the test indicates that is is not random (actually not pseudo-random, of course), then you'd have to attempt to model it as a time series or in other ways, perhaps trying to model possible letter generation algorithms. I'm not expert enough to go beyond this, and am not sure if a time series approach (ARIMA, etc) will work without external data.
