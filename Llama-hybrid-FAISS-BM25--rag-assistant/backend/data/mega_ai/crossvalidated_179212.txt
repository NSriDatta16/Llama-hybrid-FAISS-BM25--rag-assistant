Seasonal naive in forecast package with multi-step prediction

I am working on predicting a time series of daily data for one month that looks like this: As can be seen, the time-series has a weekly seasonality. I am trying to predict the next week's data (horizon=7), updating my forecasts every day, so at each time-step, I am getting forecasts for the next 7 time-steps. I have tried a number of methods but I would expect at least the snaive method to give me something reasonable. The code I am using is (tseries is an XTS object with the daily data): for (t in horizon:(length(a)-horizon)) { # Every day timeseries The method consistently gives me flat predictions, looking like this: Has anyone had any similar problems? Is it because I set frequency=7 for my daily data?
