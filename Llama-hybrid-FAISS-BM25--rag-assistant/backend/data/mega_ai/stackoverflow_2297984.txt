My idea would be to do this by using a pixel-level collision detection. There are some open-source frameworks for this (try http://www.coreyoneil.com/Flash/CDK/documentation/ ), which returns a percentage of coverage. You can compare the drawn lines with the whole surface, and check if there is full coverage. You would have to check the documentation for a complete script, but this would be my way to go.
