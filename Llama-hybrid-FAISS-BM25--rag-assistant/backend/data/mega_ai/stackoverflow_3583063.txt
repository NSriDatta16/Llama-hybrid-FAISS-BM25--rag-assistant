If you go to the Android SDK site ( ADT Plugin page ) they say that their plugin for Eclipse is only supported for Ganymede(3.5) and Galileo(3.6). If you're trying to use the ADT plugin in Helios your problem could be that you're trying too new of a version of Eclipse. EDIT:There also seems to be a problem with the plugin in 3.6 right now so you should be using 3.5
