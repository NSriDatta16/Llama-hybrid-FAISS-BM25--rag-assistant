Remember that indexes are for sorting and finding rows. The error message you got sounds like it is talking about the 1000 byte Prefix Limit for MyISAM table indexes. From http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/create-index.html : The statement shown here creates an index using the first 10 characters of the name column: CREATE INDEX part_of_name ON customer (name(10)); If names in the column usually differ in the first 10 characters, this index should not be much slower than an index created from the entire name column. Also, using column prefixes for indexes can make the index file much smaller, which could save a lot of disk space and might also speed up INSERT operations. Prefix support and lengths of prefixes (where supported) are storage engine dependent. For example, a prefix can be up to 1000 bytes long for MyISAM tables, and 767 bytes for InnoDB tables. Maybe you can try a FULLTEXT index for problematic columns.
