No. 1) Simply by looking at all 2-dimensional projections of a dataset, you can not understand any relevant interactions of groups of more than 2 features. Although I do not assume so, it is possible that your classification problem is linearly seperable in a higher dimensional space. 2) Although plotting a dataset can help understand potential issues, I would not recommend to use a plot as the only decision support. *) The images you linked only show two colors (red/blue) whereas in your question you mention three classes/values. Instead of estimating how well your problem could be solved with machine learning models, you should instead try. Use some standard libraries such as scikit-learn in Python, implement different methods (such as SVM, Random Forest) and evaluate them.
