In Visual Studio, I have seen this happen when you drag a UserControl onto the Source view of an ASP.Net .aspx page. Be sure you are dragging the UserControl onto the Design surface. Edit: This fellow was able to solve his problem by reinstalling Visual Studio. Not a happy thought, but if you're using a recently-installed version, it might be worth a try.
