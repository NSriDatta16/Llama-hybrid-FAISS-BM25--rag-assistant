As you've discovered, if a class does not have the @XmlRootElement annotation, then you can't pass an instance of that class to the marshaller. However, there is an easy way around this - wrap the object in a JAXBElement , and pass that to the marshaller instead. Now JAXBElement is a rather clumsy beast, but what it does is contains the element name and namespace of the object that you want to marshal, information which would normally be contained in the @XmlRootElement annotation. As long as you have the name and namespace, you can construct a JAXBElement to wrap your POJO, and marshal that. If your POJOs were generated by XJC, then it will also have generated an ObjectFactory class which contains factory methods for building JAXBElement wrappers for you, making things a bit easier. You'll still have to use the JAXB_FRAGMENT property for the repeating inner elements, otherwise JAXB will generate stuff like the XML prolog each time, which you don't want.
