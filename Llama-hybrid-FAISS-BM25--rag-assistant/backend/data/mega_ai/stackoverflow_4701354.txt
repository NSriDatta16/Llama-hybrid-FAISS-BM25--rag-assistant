database partitioning explanation

I just read about database partitioning and still have some confusion about it. So anybody please give me some explanations about what were changed in term of disk storage(like data file, index file, ...) behind a database partitioning, the pros and cons. I prefer MySQL with innodb but another db is welcome for comparison.
