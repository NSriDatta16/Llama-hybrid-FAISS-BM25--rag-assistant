Interpret predictions of black box models

I am using currently random forest and SVM for a binary classification problem. Especially with random forest it's easy to get the importance of all variables. But is it also possible to get the relevance for each variable in individual predictions? I don't need a detailed rule how the result was calculated, but which variable to look at would be very useful for example when using the model for fraud prediction or predictions of failures.
