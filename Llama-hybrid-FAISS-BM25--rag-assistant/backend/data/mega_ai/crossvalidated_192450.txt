Yes you can totally do it. Those methods are called 'ensemble methods' and the one you want to use is called 'pasting' for example http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html . It's possible that your model will have same or even better accuracy as the normal model. However usually you will train multiple classifiers and let them vote, not to average the models.
