Inelegant/improper use of attributes?

I have a class which I am using as a descriptor for an object. In that descriptor, there are several Type references for classes that are to be instantiated for different operations involving that object. I was thinking of pulling those references out and replacing them with attributes on the descriptor class. From this: class MyDescriptor : BaseDescriptor { public Type Op1Type { get; } public Type Op2Type { get; } } To this: [Op1(typeof(foo))] [Op2(typeof(bar))] class MyDescriptor : BaseDescriptor { } I use attributes very rarely. Would this be considered a bad use of them?
