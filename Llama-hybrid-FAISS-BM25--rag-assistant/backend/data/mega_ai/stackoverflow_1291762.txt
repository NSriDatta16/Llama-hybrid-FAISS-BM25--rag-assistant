I'm guessing that the execution context under which your CGI is running is unable to complete the read() from the serial port. Incidentally the Python standard libraries have MUCH better ways for writing CGI scripts than what you're doing here; and even the basic string handling offers a better way to interpolate your results (assuming you code has the necessary permissions to read() them) into the HTML. At least I'd recommend something like: #!/usr/bin/python import sys, serial sys.stderr = sys.stdout ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyS0', 2400) html = """Content-type: text/html Real Time Temperature Real Time Temperature: %s """ % ser.readline() # should be cgi.escape(ser.readline())! ser.close() sys.exit(0) Notice we just interpolate the results of ser.readline() into our string using the % string operator. (Incidentally your HTML was missing , , , and (paragraph) tags). There are still problems with this. For example we really should at least import cgi wrap the foreign data in that to ensure that HTML entities are properly substituted for any reserved characters, etc).
