If you have 2 channels per frame, you cannot have bytesPerSample as the size of the frame. Since the terminology is a bit confusing: A sample is a single value at a given position in a waveform A channel refers to data associated with a particular audio stream, ie, left/right channel for stereo, a single channel for mono, etc. A frame contains the samples for all channels for a given position in a waveform A packet contains one or more frames So basically, you need to use bytesPerSample * mChannelsPerFrame for mBytesPerFrame , and use mBytesPerFrame * mFramesPerPacket for mBytesPerPacket . Also I noticed that you are using 32-bits for your sample size. I'm not sure if you really want to do this -- usually, you want to record audio using 16-bit samples. The sound difference between 16 and 32 bit audio is almost impossible for most listeners to hear (the average CD is mastered at 44.1kHz, 16-bit PCM), and it will spare you 50% of the I/O and storage costs.
