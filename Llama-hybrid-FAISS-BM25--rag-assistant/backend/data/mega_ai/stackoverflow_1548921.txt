MySQL ordering SELECT by associated column

I'd like to select some Addresses from a MySQL DB. Addresses can have a Contact , an Organization , or both. (A Contact can have many Addresses . So can an Organization .) Let's say I want to get all of an Organization 's Addresses . That's no big deal. But what if I want to ORDER them by Contact.last_name ? Some of the Addresses don't have a Contact . I did some experimenting and discovered that if you ORDER BY contacts.last_name , then only those Addresses that have a Contact will be returned. I tried ORDER BY contacts.last_name, addresses.street1 , but still only Addresses that had an associated Contact were returned. Is there a query that will find Addresses by Organization.id , order the results by Contact.last_name , and include all the Organization 's Addresses , even ones that don't have a Contact ? Table structure addresses --------- id contact_id organization_id street1 contacts -------- id last_name organizations ------------- id name Solution: Returns all the Organization 's Addresses : SELECT a.* FROM addresses a LEFT JOIN contacts c ON a.contact_id = c.id WHERE a.organization_id = '8283' ORDER BY c.last_name OK, great the above query solved it.
