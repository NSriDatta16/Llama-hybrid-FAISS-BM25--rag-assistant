In Bayesian terms we could have two models ($M_1$ for having mastery, and $M_2$ for not having mastery). Using your assumption, the model priors are $p(M_1) = p(M_2) = 1/2$. Initially we have a odds ratio of 1:1, ie, $\frac{p(M_1)}{p(M_2)} = 1$. What you like to know is how many $c$ correct answers in $N$ questions do we need to answer to have the ratio of the model posteriors $\frac{p(M_1|c)}{p(M_2|c)} \geq 19$, since 95% means a 19:1 odds. By Bayes theorem: $p(M_i|c) = \frac{p(c|M_i)p(M_i)}{p(c)}$. The likelihoods $p(c|M_i)$ are binomials where you plug your initial answering probabilities accordingly for $M_1$ and $M_2$. By dividing both posteriors, $p(c)$ and $p(M_i)$ simplify and you get your formula.
