QWebview/webkit disable selection of text

I have a QWebView which loads some webpage, but the problem when mouse is pressed and dragged it selectes everything which comes in its way. Is there any way I can get rid of this?? I dont want text and other items to be selected., If I restrict mouseMove and mousePress then it other functionality with these event also gets restricted which is what I dont want. I tried alot to find any way in QWebView/Qwebpage but doesnt find any, do i need to do something in webkit? Please help
