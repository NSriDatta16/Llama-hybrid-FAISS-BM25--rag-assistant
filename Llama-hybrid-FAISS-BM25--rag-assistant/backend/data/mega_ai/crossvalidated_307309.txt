Any ideas for how to let an Agent create new actions?

If we break 'make coffee' down into discrete actions there is practically no end to how minute actions can become. To Make Coffee do: To Open Drawer do: To Move Hand to Drawer do: To Raise Hand 30 inches do: To Engage Arm, Shoulder, and Back muscles do: And so on. When our high level functioning brains want to make coffee we don't consider all our choices of how to wrap our fingers around the drawer handle, as it has been practiced many times. Has anyone thought about how to let Agents create their own actions as strings of previous actions? I guess some obstacles would be: Ways to let the Agent interrupt a drawn out action based on state change. Ways to transfer value to another action while using a neural net. Ways to increase/cull action spaces.
