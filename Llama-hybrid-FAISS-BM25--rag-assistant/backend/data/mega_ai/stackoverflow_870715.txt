Yield/iterator corner cases

On this article ( http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/13/8854601.aspx ), there is a pop question about iterators and one concerning a corner case: Exercise: Consider the following fragment: foreach (int i in CountTo100Twice()) { ... } Explain what happens on the 150th call to MoveNext() in the above loop. Discuss its consequences for recursive enumerators (such as tree traversal). I haven't run this code, but I am assuming that this is a question supposedly with an answer from the articles (all links provided below), but I can't find the answer in the knowledge shared by the article or in the comments for this particular article. Does anyone know what the answer is? What other corner cases are there? 1) http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/12/8849519.aspx 2) http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/13/8854601.aspx 3) http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/14/8862242.aspx 4) http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/15/8868267.aspx Thanks
