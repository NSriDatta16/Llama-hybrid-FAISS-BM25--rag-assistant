You could check navigator.userAgent like this: if(!navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i) || !navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i)) { //bind your mouseovers... } but you would have to check for blackberries, droids, umpty other touchscreen devices. You could also bind the mouseovers only if the userAgent contains Mozilla, IE, Webkit, or Opera, but you still need to screen for some devices because the Droid, for instance, reports its userAgent string as: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.0.1; en-us; Droid Build/ESD56) AppleWebKit/530.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/530.17 The iPhone's string is similar. If you just screen for iPhone, iPod, iPad, Android and Blackberry you might get the majority of handhelds, but not all of them.
