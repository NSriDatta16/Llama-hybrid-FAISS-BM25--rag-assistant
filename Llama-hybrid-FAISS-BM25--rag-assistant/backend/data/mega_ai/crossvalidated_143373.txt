Folklore among forecasters is (to my knowledge) that it is usually empirically better to combine "very different" models. So instead of combining all possible exponential smoothing forecasts , it may be better to combine an exponential smoothing forecast, an ARIMA forecast (noting that some ARIMA and smoothing algorithms are more-or-less equivalent), a neural network forecast, a simple benchmark and a judgmental forecast. Or, in your case where smoothing is likely not very good for real estate cycle prediction, use different econometric models, a neural network and a number of different analysts' judgmental forecasts. However, I can't back this folklore up with references. It seems like a simple unweighted combination, possibly after trimming or winsorizing point forecasts, may already be pretty hard to beat by more complex weighting schemes ( Kolassa, 2011 - note shameless self-promotion - and Claeskens et al., 2016 on the "forecast combination puzzle"). If you include judgmental forecasts, it may even be hard to determine weights for weighting schemes, since judgmental forecasts don't come with information criteria, in-sample fits, degrees of freedom and so forth.
