document.getElementsByClassName('changeme').id = pagenum; This line of code does not set the id of elements with the class changeme . getElementsByClassName returns a NodeList containing the elements. You are setting an id property on the NodeList . Obviously, this is not reflected on the elements within the list. To do this, work on the elements themselves. If you have one element with the class, that is simple: document.getElementsByClassName('changeme')[0].id = pagenum; If you have more elements, you'll need a loop: var els = document.getElementsByClassName('changeme'); for (var i = 0; i However, it's probably a bad idea to change an element's id . Using a class might well be a better idea here. Edit To explain why your second alert works, it is because the same NodeList is returned by the call to getElementsByClassName . From the spec : When the method [ getElementsByClassName ] is invoked on an HTMLElement object again with the same argument, the user agent may return the same object as the object returned by the earlier call.
