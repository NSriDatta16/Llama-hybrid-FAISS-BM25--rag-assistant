We had similar problem in our app, which used django admin. There is many to many relation between users and groups and one can't easily add users to a group. I have created a patch for django, that does this, but there isn't much attention to it ;-) You can read it and try to apply similar solution to your pizza/topping problem. This way being inside a topping, you can easily add related pizzas or vice versa.
