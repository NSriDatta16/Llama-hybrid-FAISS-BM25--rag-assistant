The missing quines: Visual Basic (for Applications)

Today I surfed some random geek-stuff articles on wikipedia to get my daily dose of useless knowledge. I stumbled accross quines, which are programs that print their own source-code. I found that a great way to make my brain hurt, so I began working on a quine in VBA. I had two good reasons: I couldn't find a quine written in VBA VBA encourages you to write awkward code which makes your brain hurt Here is my masterpiece: Sub q() c = "Sub q();c = #;Debug.Print Replace(Replace(c, Chr(59), vbNewLine), Chr(35), Chr(34) & c & Chr(34));End Sub" Debug.Print Replace(Replace(c, Chr(59), vbNewLine), Chr(35), Chr(34) & c & Chr(34)) End Sub My challenge: Can you make it even shorter (and preferably more awkward)?
