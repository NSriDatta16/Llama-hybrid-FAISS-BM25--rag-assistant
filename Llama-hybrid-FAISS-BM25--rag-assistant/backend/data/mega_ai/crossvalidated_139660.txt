Detecting changes in time series (R example)

I would like to detect changes in time series data, which usually has the same shape. So far I've worked with the changepoint package for R and the cpt.mean(), cpt.var() and cpt.meanvar() functions. cpt.mean() with the PELT method works well when the data usually stays on one level. However I would also like to detect changes during descents. An example for a change, I would like to detect, is the section where the black curve suddenly drops while it actually should follow the examplary red dotted line. I've experimented with the cpt.var() function, however I couldn't get good results. Have you got any recommendations (those don't have to necessarily use R)? Here is the data with the change (as R object): dat.change
