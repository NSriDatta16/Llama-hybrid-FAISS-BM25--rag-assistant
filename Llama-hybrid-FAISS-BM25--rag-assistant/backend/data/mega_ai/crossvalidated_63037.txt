Interesting question, I'm grappling with the same issue at the moment! It depends on how you define 'best', i.e., are you looking for some average single value for the spread, or for the correlation between the data, etc. I found in Press, S.J. (1972): Applied Multivariate Analysis, p. 108 that the generalized variance, defined as the determinant of the covariance matrix, is useful as a single measure for spread. But if it's correlation that you are after, I will need to think futher. Let me know.
