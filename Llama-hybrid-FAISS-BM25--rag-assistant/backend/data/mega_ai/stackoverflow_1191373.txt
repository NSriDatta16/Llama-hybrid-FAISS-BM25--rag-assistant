Reading from Java JTextArea

Okay, thus may seen kind of odd, but I wanted to get some suggestions from everyone here. I am a beginning Java developer (after 2 years of ASP.NET web development) and I have recently began working on my first Java project - a calculator. I realize that their are tons of calculators out there, but I thought it would be a good beginner project. Anyway, here is what I need help with. Currently, I am using a Scrolling JTextArea for display (instead of a simple JTextField) that is approximately 5 rows tall. I want the user to be able to scroll through the list to see previous entries and such. The format of the box will be equation on one line and the program will generate the answer on the next and so on. My real question is, how is the best way to implement this? My fist idea was to read through the JTextArea when equals is pressed, down to the last line and try to search that line for the operator (+, -, etc.) and the operands. Is this the best way to go about this? Although, this would work would work, I think it could get cumbersome and sounds very inefficient. I am open to any suggestions, even possibly replacing the JTextArea is some other component would work better. Thanks!
