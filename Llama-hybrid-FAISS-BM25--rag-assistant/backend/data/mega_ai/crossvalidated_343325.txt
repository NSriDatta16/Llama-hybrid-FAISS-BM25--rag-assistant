Question on the Projection Theorem

My question concerns the second sentence in the last paragraph i.e. 'The projection theorem guarantees that there is at least one solution of $\phi_n$ of (2.3.9)'. If a vector is uniquely defined by $\phi_n$ how is it that there can be more than one solution of $\phi_n$? Also, how does the singularity of $\Gamma_n$ imply that there are infinitely many solutions for $\phi_n$?
