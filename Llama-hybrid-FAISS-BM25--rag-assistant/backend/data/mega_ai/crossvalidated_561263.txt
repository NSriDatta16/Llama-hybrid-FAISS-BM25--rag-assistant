Poisson or Binomial distribution for modeling?

I want to model the change in rate of an event in a sampled population. The populations are grouped according to some grouping variable. Each individual observation is of one organism, and the sample can either return as positive or negative (+/-). My resulting parameters are: -number of positive samples (+) -total number tested per grouping variable Should this be modeled using a Poisson or binomial distribution? My sample parameters are meant to estimate the true rate value in an overall larger population.
