Bayesian optimization is better, because it makes smarter decisions. You can check this article in order to learn more: Hyperparameter optimization for neural networks . This articles also has info about pros and cons for both methods + some extra techniques like grid search and Tree-structured parzen estimators. Even though it was written in order to show pros and cons of different methods for neural networks the main knowledge is generalizable for any other machine learning domains
