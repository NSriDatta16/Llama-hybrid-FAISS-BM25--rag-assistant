I'm not exactly understanding the manager concept. Is a manager an employee or an organizational unit? Depending on your answer I'd have a ManagerEmployeeId or a ManagerOrgUnitJobId property on OrgUnit and/or OrgUnitJobs. I would add PrimaryJobId to the Employee. That guarantees an employee only has one primary job. So I guess in both cases I would favor an XxxId-type property over a boolean IsXxx property. An IsXxx property opens the door for multiple managers or multiple primary jobs.
