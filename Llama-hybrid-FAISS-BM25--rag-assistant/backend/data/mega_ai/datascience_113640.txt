How to subset a 'representative sample'?

Sometimes I need to subsample a dataset for my analysis/modelling. What are the strategies/things to check for to select a subsample that's representative of the entire sample? And in addition, how to evaluate the 'representativeness' of the subset taken? I visited this post , but I think its focus is on reducing the volume of the data instead of getting a qualitatively representative sample of the larger set. Besides, I'm asking for non-time series data, which is something more general. I also visited this post , but find it not that relevant. It would be nice to hear how things are done in (industrial) practice. TIA.
