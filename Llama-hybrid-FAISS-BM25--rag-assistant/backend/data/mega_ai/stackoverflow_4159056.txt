Java ArrayList Help

So let's say I have an ArrayList of Strings, called list1, containing the strings, "A", "B", "C", "D", "E". Then I have another ArrayList of type storageUnit, which is a class I wrote, called list2. Please see code below for a better explanation: ArrayList list1 = new ArrayList (); ArrayList list2 = new ArrayList (); storageUnit newUnit = new storageUnit(); for (int i = 0; i wordTable = new Hashtable (); }; Now if I try to print all the categories of all storageUnits in list2, I get [E, E, E, E, E] instead of [A, B, C, D, E]. Could anyone explain why this is happening?
