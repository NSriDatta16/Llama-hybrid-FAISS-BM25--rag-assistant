Neural networks or Deep learning on Item based Collaborative filtering

I have data in the form of grocery item Name, grocery item ID and their respective order ID's. Please find the sample data below : ItemName ItemID OrderID Apple 123 1001 Sugar 092 1001 Knife 112 9890 Spoons 232 9890 Buttercups 234 9890 Ketchup 545 7867 Bottle 787 7867 eggs 543 7867 apple 123 7867 I want to build a recommend-er system where a guest user will be shown items which best matches the item in his current cart depending on the algorithm which sees the past history of items which are frequently bought together . I have already applied priori rules algorithm so I am looking to build a neural network so as to recommend the best matching grocery. I have done research , there is not much information related to this or codes on internet, where should i start or can any one build neural network using some random data or help me to get to the right way ?
