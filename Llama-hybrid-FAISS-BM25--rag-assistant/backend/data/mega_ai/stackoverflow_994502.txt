Generating html for SEO

I found this article http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dcsq25m_04k4cmgfd on generating html on server side for spider. What do you folks think about using this technique to serve different content depending on the user-agent? Any reference articles, or advice you can share on the best way to do seo on gwt? I did read up on pro gwt2.0 techniques, but seem to me to be a bit of overkill.
