Firstly there are plenty of great, existing frameworks for ColdFusion. However, I do understand the desire to roll your own. I agree with some of the statements above where they talk about identifying what is important to you, and to keep it simple. Having been in an organization that had no framework, and attempting to write one and slowly bring it to standard, be prepared for slowly to really mean SLOWLY. Adoption is not quick due to the fact that oftentimes large, older applications have TONS of existing business logic that can be difficult to separate out into "concerns", which is of course what most frameworks do well. I also found it challenging because most devs are too busy actually doing their day-to-day job, and have little time to learn something new, especially with looming deadlines. Good luck in your efforts!
