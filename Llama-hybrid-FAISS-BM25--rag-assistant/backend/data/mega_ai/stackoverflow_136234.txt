I recently ported a PHP app to Python using web.py . As frameworks go it is extremely lightweight with minimal dependencies, and it tends to stay out of your way, so it might be the compromise you're looking for. It all depends on your initial application though, because with a large application the advantages of having a full-featured framework handling the plumbing tend to outweigh the disadvantages involved in having to drag around all the framework code.
