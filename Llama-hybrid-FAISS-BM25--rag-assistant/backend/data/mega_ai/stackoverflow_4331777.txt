How to create a DTO in asp.net?

1) I want to know what is the recommended way to create & return a DTO for an object which has 10 attributes and I only want to return 2 with my DTO object. 2) Should DTO's have their own namespace ? If yes, how do we organize them ? Each DTO inside a single class file or all DTO's inside a single class ? Please provide me some sample code.
