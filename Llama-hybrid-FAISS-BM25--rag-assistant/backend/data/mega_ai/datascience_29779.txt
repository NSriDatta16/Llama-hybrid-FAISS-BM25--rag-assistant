How to plot prediction intervals in seaborn tsplot?

I am plotting a group of time series plots with CI's in seaborn using tsplot: These were produced from 10 traces each: The confidence bars shown (99% confidence) appear to be the CI's for the mean. However I am really after 99% confidence for the prediction interval. For the examples above these should be much wider and cross the red dotted line on occasion. Can I plot 99% prediction intervals in seaborn tsplot?
