WPF - Making an animation's execution conditional on a property of the bound data item

I have a data object -- a custom class called Notification -- that exposes a IsCritical property. The idea being that if a notification will expire, it has a period of validity and the user's attention should be drawn towards it. Imagine a scenario with this test data: _source = new[] { new Notification { Text = "Just thought you should know" }, new Notification { Text = "Quick, run!", IsCritical = true }, }; The second item should appear in the ItemsControl with a pulsing background. Here's a simple data template excerpt that shows the means by which I was thinking of animating the background between grey and yellow. What I'm unsure about is how to make this animation conditional upon the value of IsCritical . If the bound value is false , then the default background colour of #DDD should be maintained.
