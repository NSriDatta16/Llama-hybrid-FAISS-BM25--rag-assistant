Silverlight 4 RIA does not return anything using DomainContext

Just learning Silverlight 4/RIA and i 'm stuck in a weird problem: setup an ASP.NET MVC project as the project hosting the Domain service. In this i tried to get data from the Domain Service which worked fine (i'm using a repository which gets resolved using Windsor Castle). Now i tried to setup a SL4 project. I though i do it the MVVM-way, so i decided to setup a ViewModel Class with the following code: public class ViewModel { OrganizationDomainContext dsCtxt = new OrganizationDomainContext(); public ViewModel() { EntityQuery query = from cu in dsCtxt.GetAllCulturesQuery() select cu; LoadOperation lo = dsCtxt.Load(query); } } The crazy thing about this is .. it doesn't return anything!!! What am i missing here? EDIT: I was not very clear about this issue: i 'm using Windsor Castle to do IoC stuff. Using Fiddler i see that the application tries to resolve something that looks like the name of the Silverlight application. Thanks in advance
