Edit How fast things change? I just heard about Cornelius Fichtner's new project: Project Managment Opinions . It has a section on resources . Already this newly launched site looks like a good meta site. Previously on Stackoverflow.... I don't think there one site for what you want. The resources i use are: Podcasts: PM Podcast - very good. The latest episode on the PMI virtual communities will point you to further resources on SIGs in PMI and how they are changing. PM Lessons Learned - messy site, but worth subscribing and listening to the most recent episodes (very good ones on risk and softskills) Sites: GanttHead - very busy site... i've never used anything from the site but there are a lot of links and forums i think. Groups: PMI - a great resource if you are a member. Also has PM news on it's homepage for everyone. Some of the work in SIGs sounds very interesting. Your local PMI chapter - OK so this is my local chapter. Worthwhile investigating your own. I've had a very small involvement with mine and found them very approachable and useful.
