Silverlight custom control default xmlns

In Silverlight, is it possible to set the default xmlns name of a custom control? By default, each time I drag and drop one of my custom contrl on a window, the assembly and the control is automatically added to the XAML: ... xmlns:my="clr-namespace:MyAssemblyName;assembly=MyAssemblyName" ... Everthing works fine exect that I would like to replace the "my" namespace by something else (MyAssemblyName) without editing the XAML manually.
