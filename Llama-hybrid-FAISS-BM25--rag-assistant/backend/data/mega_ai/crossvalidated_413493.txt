You are conflating linear in parameters with linear in variables. Linearity here refers to the relationship between the variables. Their point in the book is that, if the model is not linear in the variables , then neither the equation $$\text{Total Effect} = \text{Direct Effect} + \text{Indirect Effect} $$ holds, nor the regression coefficient gives you the proper backdoor adjustment directly. Regarding the last case, for instance, consider the conditional expectation $E[Y|x,z] = \beta x + \gamma z$ , which is linear with respect to $X$ and $Z$ . If $Z$ satisfies the backdoor criterion for the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ , then $$ \frac{\partial E[Y|do(x)]}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial E[E[Y|x, Z]]}{\partial x} = \beta $$ That is, the regression coefficient $\beta$ equals the average marginal causal effect. This is what is meant by "regression based adjustment works" in this case, you don't need any extra steps here---all the averaging required for backdoor adjustment is automatically done by regression. Now consider the conditional expectation $E[Y|x,z] = \beta x + \gamma z + \delta (x \times z)$ . Note this is not linear with respect to $x$ and $z$ (although it is linear in the parameters). Note in this case if $Z$ satisfies the backdoor criterion for the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ , then $$ \frac{\partial E[Y|do(x)]}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial E[E[Y|x, Z]]}{\partial x} = \beta + \delta E[z] $$ That is, the correct backdoor adjustment is not given by the regression coefficient on $X$ only. More generally, Pearl is saying that if $Z$ satifies the backdoor criterion, you can use any non-parametric estimator you prefer to compute the post-intervention distribution $ E[Y|do(x)] = E[E[Y|x, Z]]$ .
