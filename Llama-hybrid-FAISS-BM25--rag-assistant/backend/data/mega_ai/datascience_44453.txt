Kera's functional API allows arbitrary models to be combined. One option is to define a "main input" as the image that feeds into a CNN and then define an "auxiliary input" that feeds into a MLP. Both of those sub-models can feed to the same higher layers. The weights of the entire model will be updated during training. The model will learn how to weight the data from csv compared to the image data (in contrast to you picking the relative weights).
