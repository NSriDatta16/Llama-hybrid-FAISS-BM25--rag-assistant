In my opinion, the most important thing to consider is if there are ways in which eyewitness accounts may not capture the full possibilities of the event (or lack of it), i.e., if they are statistically biased in any way, and if so, how. Of course, "eyewitness" can be replaced with any non-human objective measurement obtained through a measurement device or procedure, and the question remains whether the measurement is biased or distorted or noisy, and if so, in what way. A simple example to illustrate the problem is Survivorship bias, i.e., a censored dataset: Let's assume, for argument's sake, continuing the OP's example, that there indeed are aliens and they abduct humans. But furthermore, let's assume that their abductions are very common, and that the vast majority of the humans being abducted are never returned to Earth. To make matters worse, the aliens can analyze human relationships, and they make an effort to abduct humans with very few relationships and relatives, so as not to draw attention to these missing humans. In this hypothetical example, there will be zero eyewitnesses of humans abducted and not returned to Earth, even though the assumption is that this is the event with vast majority. The very few cases of abductions of humans which survive to report them is miniscule, obviously in comparison with humans living on Earth which have not been abducted (as far as they're aware...) So, what would we be able to infer from existing eyewitness accounts if we ignore Survivorship bias? Probably that the existence of alien abductions is questionable. However, if we do take take into account the censored dataset caused by Survivorship bias, we would attach non-negligible probability to alien abductions. Of course this is only in the case where we accept this preposterous hypothetical example and attach to it's existence non-zero prior probability... The example of Survivorship bias of determining reinforcement based on location of bullet holes in the returning aircraft is most illuminating: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias#In_the_military
