Multimodal classification - multiple images for each record

I have a multimodal classification task. In my dataset, each record consists of a text a list of 1 to 4 associated images a label Probably, I'd want to use transformers encoders to represent both text and images and then fine-tune them. In your experience, what is the best way to represent a variable number of images associated with the same record? (I also thought of taking the average of the different image embeddings or similar approaches. I might do so if I froze the encoder, but I want to fine-tune it).
