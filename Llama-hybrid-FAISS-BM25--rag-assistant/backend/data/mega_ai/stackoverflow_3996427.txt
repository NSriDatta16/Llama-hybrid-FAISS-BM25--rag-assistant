Own Shipping Module for Magento - Next step in onepage checkout does not work anymore

Cheers, I created my own shipping module for magento 1.4.1.1. , which so far does not work. After really getting frustrated with this, I exactly copied everything from http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/5_-_modules_and_development/shipping/create-shipping-method-module . As with my own module, it does not work. In the onepage checkout, I cannot go further when entering the shipping adress, and firebug indicates, that my shipping method does not appear in the list of available shipping options. My model class indeed is loaded, I solved this problem earlier. But for some strange reason it will not appear in the frontend and again, I am currently using the exact files from the wiki. Please, does anybody have any ideas what could be going wrong here? Thanks in advance! Edit: this is my config xml: 0.1.0 YourCompany_NewModule_Model YourCompany_NewModule core_setup 1 0 newmodule/carrier_newmodule New Module New Module This shipping method is currently unavailable. If you would like to ship using this shipping method, please contact us. F
