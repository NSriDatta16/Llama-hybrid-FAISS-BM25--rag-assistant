Usually, as for instance in chapter 7 of MASS4 , the response in a binomial generalized linear model is taken as $Y_i = S_i/n_i$ , that is, we use a scaled binomial distribution ( $S_i$ is number successes, $n_i$ the fixed sample size). Then the expectation is $\DeclareMathOperator{\E}{\mathbb{E}} \mu_i = p_i$ . It is just more natural to use $p_i$ as parameter than to use $n_i p_i$ .
