I'm dumb... when I updated IntelliJ I dragged the new application into my applications folder and assumed it would replace the old one. It appeared with the typical greyed-out look because I hadn't started it yet... so I was still using IntelliJ 8.something. and not noticing. Problem solved with version 9 with the addition of the "Fix" and "Create Artifact" features that appear where the error used to.
