Just wanted to add to this because ive been looking into it recently. (what a pita) It seems there are some main choices: Using the quickbooks SDK which means dealing with COM Using one of the poorly implemented libraries available: /n Software QB Integrator to connect and do transactions on QB object (Invoice, Customer). You will need to run a little app while QB is open for this one called QBConnector. There is very limited documentation for this. Dragon Quickbooks Java Connector which is a lower level connector for dealing with the XML responses for Quickbooks. qbXML Using an importer as listed above which really means you have to still do an external step although it can be batched. QODBC as mentioned above which is what I am probably going to go with. You can read and write (but not to all tables) with this. Full QB Table schema for US version I am very surprised at the extremely poor support Intuit is giving small business for integrating their software with QB. If any COM devs are out there that want to design a nice java library I am sure there are lots of small business out there that would happily pay for a well designed one. (More intelligent access mechanism and search ability) Good luck to all your brave QB Spelunkers.
