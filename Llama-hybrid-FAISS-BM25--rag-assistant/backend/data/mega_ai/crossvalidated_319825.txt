The NASA Autoclass employs Bayesian approach to inferring not only the cluster centers but also the most likely number of clusters. A similar tool, NBCTK , uses more modern inference algorithms (e.g. Variational Bayes). Some of the nice features include: Support for mixed data types (e.g. discrete and real-valued features) Handles missing values It works fairly well on relatively small datasets (on my datasets). Some basic understanding how the algorithm works under the hood helps to use the tool to its best potential. Expect time to process even moderate size datasets to be significant. Note: The most likely number clusters are found under the assumptions made by the model. One must not interpret the results as absolute truth.
