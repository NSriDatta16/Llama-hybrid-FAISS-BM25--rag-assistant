Resize an image inside a container dynamically using jQuery

I have a div container, and I call it "content_container". This container is able to drag and resize using jQuery UI . Inside this container, I implemented TinyMCE (content text editor). My problem is: If the user inserts a 2000 pixels x 2000 pixels image, the container max-width is 1000 pixels. Then it will look like this: ____________________ | Container header | ---------------------- | text [image...................image] | [image...................image] |____________________| (I am sorry, I am still developing it in my localhost, and I haven't found a web hosting company yet, thus I can't give you the direct link to see the demo). Okay, the container is still resizeable, just that, the image size is always 2000 pixels x 2000 pixels. My question is: Is it possible when I resize the "content_container", the image will auto resize and fit into the container width? If yes, how do I do it? If no, is there another solution to solve this? Code Before TinyMCE, the container code: The header After the user enters content (for example, insert the image), the container will become: The header some text As you can see, I can only manipulate the inlineEditor class.
