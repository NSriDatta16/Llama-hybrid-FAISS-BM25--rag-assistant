Feature Selection in Multivariate Linear Regression

I have $m$ time series and I partition the time series into two sets: set X and set Y. I want to predict set Y using set X. The time series of set Y are ${\bf y}_t$ and those of the set X are ${\bf x}_t$ . The value of $m$ can be large (greater than 100). To do this I fit a multivariate linear regression model: $$ {\bf y}_t= \bf a+P {\bf x}_t + \epsilon$$ I can then compute some fitting error (using some method). I want to know if there exists a way to determine the best way to select the variables that constitute the set X ( ${\bf x}_t$ ). I want to select only a subset of around 20 variables that can predict the best the other variables using a multivariate linear regression model. We want to select 20 variables to constitute the set X in order to minimize the fitting error. A reference of existing papers on this would help greatly. Thanks!
