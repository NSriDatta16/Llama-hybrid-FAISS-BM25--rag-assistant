One thing you could try would be to use a structured storage system. The concept is simple, you work with a datafile much like you would a disk and folders...thing is that the folders and files are all under your exclusive control. The only issue is that it doesn't exactly scale well to multiple users, but then neither does XML. (a good structured storage library is available on gabr's blog ) For a "multi-user" system, your best option will be to implement using tables. You can probably get a good start at things using Microsoft Access and ADO, which migrates to MS Sql Server very easily. From your brief description, I would expect you to have three tables, NOTEBOOKS, SECTIONS, PAGES. The Pages would have a Foreign key relationship (detail/master) to Sections and sections would have a Foreign key relationship with Notebooks.
