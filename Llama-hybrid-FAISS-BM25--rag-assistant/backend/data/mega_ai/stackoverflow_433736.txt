The code fragment you present is fairly atypical (which might also because you probably made it up): you wouldn't normally have an instance variable (self.c) that is a floating point number at some point, and a string at a different point. It should be either a number or a string all the time. you normally don't bring instance variables into life in an arbitrary method. Instead, you typically have a constructor (__init__) that initializes all variables. you typically don't have instance variables named a, b, c. Instead, they have some speaking names. With these fixed, your example would be much more readable.
