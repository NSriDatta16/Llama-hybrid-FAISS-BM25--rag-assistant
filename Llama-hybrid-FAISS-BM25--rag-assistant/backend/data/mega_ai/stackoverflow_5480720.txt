Per Justin808's answer, the general idea would be like this: if (!cookieIsSet()) { setCookie(); playMovie(); } See the W3Schools site for an example use of cookies similar to what you want to achieve: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp If you are embedding a YouTube video you could do it like this: var link = "http://www.youtube.com/embed/he5fpsmH_2g"; if (!cookieIsSet()) { setCookie(); link += "?autoplay=1"; // append an autoplay tag to the video URL } document.getElementById("videoframe").src = link; // set the iframe src Obviously, you would have to define your own cookieIsSet() and setCookie() functions. See the W3School's site for examples how.
