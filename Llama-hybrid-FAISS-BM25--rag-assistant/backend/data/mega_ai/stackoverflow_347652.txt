Our company is also doing most new development in WPF. It is working fairly well for us. However, it took 2-3 months for the organization to overcome the learning curve and to begin the "WPF Way of Thinking." Similar to Louis' point, I think one of the reasons it is slow to take hold of the industry is that designers are hesitant to learn the Expression suite. Once there are an adequate number of Expression designers out there, I think companies will see more immediate benefit of using WPF. One of the key benefits to WPF is the vector graphics. Because we develop apps that could be used on small laptops and rugged PCs, the ability of the UI to scale to different sizes of monitors is very beneficial.
