interpreting logistic regression coefficients when reversing the reference group

I applied logistic regression to check the relationship between a binary variable that is called FG and few independent variables the reference group for the variable SSE is SSE1 . The OR is 0.48 meaning that the chances for those in SSE2 (from the same age group and the same physiological status) decrease by 52% to be in FG group 1 compared to those from SSE1. However now when considering SSE2 as the reference group : now OR for SSE1 is 2.08 meaning the chances for SSE1 are 108% higher to be in FG group 1 compared to those from SSE2. Is it logical this way or am I making some interpretation error (because I thought that the resulted OR must indicate 52% more of chances) ? Thanks.
