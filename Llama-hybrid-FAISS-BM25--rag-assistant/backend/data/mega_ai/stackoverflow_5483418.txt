Since you cannot use ToString() , you might want to check out how the mono developers implemented this: https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/corlib/System/NumberFormatter.cs The entry point is NumberToString(string, decimal, IFormatProvider) . The interesting part is InitDecHexDigits(uint, ulong) , which gets called like this InitDecHexDigits ((uint)bits [2], ((ulong)bits [1] and does the "bit juggling and shifting" thing to convert the three integers into binary coded decimals ( _val1 to _val4 ), which can then be (trivially) converted into a string. (Don't get confused by the fact that they call it "hex representation". It's binary coded decimal digits.)
