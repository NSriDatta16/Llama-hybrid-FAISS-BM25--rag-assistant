Line of best fit does not look like a good fit. Why?

Have a look at this Excel graph: The 'common sense' line-of-best-fit would appear be an almost vertical line straight through the center of the points (edited by hand in red). However the linear trend line as decided by Excel is the diagonal black line shown. Why has Excel produced something that (to the human eye) appears to be wrong? How can I produce a best fit line that looks a little more intuitive (i.e. something like the red line)? Update 1. An Excel spreadsheet with data and graph is available here: example data , CSV in Pastebin . Are the type1 and type2 regression techniques available as excel functions? Update 2. The data represent a paraglider climbing in a thermal whilst drifting with the wind. The final objective is to investigate how wind strength and direction varies with height. I'm an engineer, NOT a mathematician or statistician, so the information in these responses has given me a lot more areas for research. This is an interesting thread and It would be a shame for the data to be lost and someone in future unable to reproduce the examples, so I'm adding it as a comment here (which is the data from the following link ).
