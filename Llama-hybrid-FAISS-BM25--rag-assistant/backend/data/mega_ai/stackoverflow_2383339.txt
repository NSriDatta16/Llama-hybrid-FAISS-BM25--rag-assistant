You can call Response.AppendHeader() at any time before headers are sent. There are several events before Load that you could call it in. Init would be the obvious one. What are you trying to do exactly? EDIT: From your comment, you should be able to add the headers anywhere, but you should read the documentation for AppendHeader , specifically: If you use the AppendHeader method to send cache-specific headers and at the same time use the cache object model (Cache) to set cache policy, HTTP response headers that pertain to caching (Cache-Control, Expires, Last-Modified, Pragma, and Vary) might be deleted when the cache object model is used. This behavior enables ASP.NET to maintain the most restrictive settings. For example, consider a page that includes user controls. If those controls have conflicting cache policies, the most restrictive cache policy will be used. If one user control sets the header "Cache-Control: Public" and another user control sets the more restrictive header "Cache-Control: Private" via calls to SetCacheability, then the "Cache-Control: Private" header will be sent with the response. So be wary with your cache control headers ;)
