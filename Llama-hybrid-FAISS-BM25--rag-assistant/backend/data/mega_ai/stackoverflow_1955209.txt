I ended up creating a python script that outputs the html I need to work with Shadowbox. I just need to have a folder called "shadowbox" with the shadowbox files in it, a folder called "Full" with the actual images, and a folder called "Thumbs" with thumbnails that have the same name as the full image. Then the script will automatically create a file called "gallery.html". Here's a sample.. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/154234/Images/gallery.html Here's the python script for anyone interested in using it. I'm just a novice programmer, so any suggestions on how to make the code more elegant would be appreciated. Thanks! http://dl.dropbox.com/u/154234/Images/update.py
