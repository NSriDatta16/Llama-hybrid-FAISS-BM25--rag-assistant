repeated measure ANOVA with non-consecutive repeats

I have a somewhat of a repeated measure setup but wanted to check if repeated measure 1-way anova can be applied here (assuming underlying assumptions of normality, sphericity etc are met). Situation: time series data of N subjects self-reporting a binary variable (yes/no), and also providing a continuous measure X with every self report. Hypothesis: measure X is different on days with "yes" reports compared to days with "No" reports. analysis idea: For each subject, separately average measure X for "yes" days and "no" days. X is a repeated measure for each subject. Run a 1-way repeated measure ANOVA. My main question is: if the repeated measure is not consecutively repeated (yes and no days can be in any sequence), seems like it shouldn't matter?
