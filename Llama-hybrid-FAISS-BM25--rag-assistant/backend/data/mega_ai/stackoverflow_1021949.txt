IE8 on Windows Server 2008 is much more stringent with its default security settings. Even disabling IE Enhanced Security Configuration does not allow all functionality. This is to discourage you from logging into the server and perhaps inadvertantly installing an IE addon that compromises security. You really should connect to SharePoint Central Administration from your local machine. Then you won't have the security problems and also will be following Microsoft best practice.
