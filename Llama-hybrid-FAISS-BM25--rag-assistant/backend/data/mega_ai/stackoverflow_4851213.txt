Magento customization - How do I approach this task?

I have been delegated a task to add some custom fields to a Magento (1.4 Community) checkout page. There I should add the following form inputs: Would you also like to have this option? (it costs you an extra $2.00) Yes please. Please select the type you want: [options for type go here] Please enter your phone Then I need to check if the newoption (the checkbox) is set and if so extract the value which is the order id and store the following info into a table: table: newoption, columns: id: auto_inc order_id: the value returned from $_GET['newoption'] or $_POST['newoption'] option_type: the value returned from select phone: the value returned from text input Now, my question is what should I plan to do? add an extension? add a widget? modify existing extension or widget (where)?
