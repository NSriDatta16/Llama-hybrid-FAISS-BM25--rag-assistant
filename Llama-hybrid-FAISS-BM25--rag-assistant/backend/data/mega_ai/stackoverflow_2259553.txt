Use $_POST["x"] directly or to copy to a local variable and then use?

Consider the following pair of snippets, both do the same essentially. Thank you for taking the census! "; echo "On behalf of Sergio's Emporium, we name you: " . $firstName . $lastName . ", conquerer of worlds!"; //Here I'm just pulling it from the POST info. echo "I think that's fitting since you're a " . $_POST["item"]; } else { echo "You didn't write in the necesarry information."; } ?> Which is better to use (from a security standpoint) and which one is encouraged to be used by standards. Since I'm new to PHP this is something that's yanking my chain. Thanks guys! :)
