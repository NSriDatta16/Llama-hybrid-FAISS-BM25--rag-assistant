You could potentially use a Poisson regression to model monthly counts of birds of a particular species as a function of explanatory/independent variables that you think affect the monthly rate of observations, such as linear time trends/calendar month/season/year (potentially supplementing this data with external data sources on things like weather). After estimating the regression, you could then compute probabilities. As Poisson is a discrete probability distribution, you can calculate the probability of X (specify desired count here) of events for specified values of predictors you used in the regression. If you wanted to know the probability of seeing at least one bird, you can compute it as 1 minus the probability of 0 birds seen. Here is another CV Q&A on predicting probabilities with Poisson regression: Poisson Regression : expectation vs probability for each outcome For this type of regression, you would normally be assuming that counts in consecutive months are not correlated, meaning that you do not have autocorrelation. If that assumption is not valid, which it probably is not, given that you have time series data, you can examine this Q&A for potential approaches: Poisson regression with (auto-correlated) time series Poisson regression has a couple of well-known relatives: Negative Binomial and Zero-Inflated Poisson (also zero-truncated Poisson, but that one should not apply here, as you should have a non-zero probability of 0 birds observed). Negative Binomial is needed when the variance of data exceeds the mean in a given month. Zero-Inflated Poisson is used when there are "excess" zeros in the data generated by a separate process.
