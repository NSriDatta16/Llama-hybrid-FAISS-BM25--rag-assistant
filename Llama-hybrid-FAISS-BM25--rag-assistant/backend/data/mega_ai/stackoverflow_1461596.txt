You should use Flash/flex for this. It's storage is a bit hard to clean (have to delete some files in crazy places on the system. If done correctly it may be hard to be discovered by the end user that actually the flash is casting the vote. It is the same plugin and the same data all over user's system Of course if there is no flash support you could always degrade to registration/cookies system with ugly captcha.
