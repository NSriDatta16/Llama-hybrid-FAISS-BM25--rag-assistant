This depends on the total number of customer orders; consider the situation if you have just one order per week. Then you are almost certainly have less than one in any given week. OTH if you have 1000 customers, you will have about 100 ordering "X" each week which is too much. It's also not clear if the 10% is an average or a fixed number; the same is the case for the missing number of orders per week. The most likely way to interpret this question is to assume that each customer order has a chance of 10% of belonging to category "X" - but then we will still need the number of customer orders. If the number of orders is fixed then X the number of orders of "X" per week would be binomially distributed and the question would be solvable. I think it is really questionable to claim that it is "solvable in Minitab" and give no theoretical background. There may be a button in Minisab that takes these numbers and gives an answer, but is it the answer to the question as it is stated here? Short version, I agree with you.
