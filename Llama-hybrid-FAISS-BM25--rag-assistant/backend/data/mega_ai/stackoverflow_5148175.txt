Cannot drag jcrop selection with the mouse

I have this weird issue with jcrop that I have spent hours trying to figure out. The problem is that I cannot drag / move the selection around in the same way as it is shown in the demo . If I try to initialize the script with setSelect so that the image appears with a selection when the page loads, that selection is movable, but once I make a selection with the mouse, this selection (that replaces the initial one of course) cannot be dragged no matter what I do. It can, however, be moved with the keyboard, but I cannot rely on people using the keyboard. I have googled around and the only thing that came close was this post: Cannot drag selection in Jcrop, what could break it? but that doesn't solve the problem for me (and I have no relative positioning that I know of so it wouldn't be the cause of the problem in the first place). I use the following setup using jquery 1.4.2 and jcrop 0.9.8 on a mac (have tried both Firefox and Safari): function updateCoords(c) { $('#x').val(c.x); $('#y').val(c.y); $('#w').val(c.w); $('#h').val(c.h); }; function checkCoords() { if (parseInt($('#w').val())) return true; alert('Please select a crop region then press submit.'); return false; }; $('#jcrop_target').Jcrop({ minSize: [ 620,400 ], maxSize: [ 620,400 ], onSelect: updateCoords, onChange: updateCoords }); but I have also tried using a simple $('#jcrop_target').Jcrop(); to make sure that it wasn't the other functions causing a conflict. Any input will be very, very appreciated. Thanks in advance ! Lars
