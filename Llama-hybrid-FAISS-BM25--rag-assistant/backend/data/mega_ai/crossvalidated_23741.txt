Although not a direct answer to your question, are you sure that the 10-15 technical indicators you have chosen are the right ones or have the right look back periods etc? There are literally hundreds of indicators to chose from, and this combined with the choice of parameters gives you a "universe" of millions of different combinations of 10-15 indicators. Your problem might not be with the NN or SVM per se, but rather that your inputs are basically just random noise. Have you tested each of your chosen indicators separately and confirmed that they are statistically significant in any way? In my experience very few of the "standard" technical indicators pass any basic statistical or Monte Carlo test for significance, predictive ability etc.
