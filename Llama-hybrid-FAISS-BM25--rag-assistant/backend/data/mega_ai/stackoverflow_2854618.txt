Using clojure.contrib functions in slime REPL

I want to use the functions in the clojure.contrib.trace namespace in slime at the REPL. How can I get slime to load them automatically? A related question, how can I add a specific namespace into a running repl? On the clojure.contrib API it describes usage like this: (ns my-namespace (:require clojure.contrib.trace)) But adding this to my code results in the file being unable to load with an "Unable to resolve symbol" error for any function from the trace namespace. I use leiningen 'lein swank' to start the ServerSocket and the project.clj file looks like this (defproject test-project "0.1.0" :description "Connect 4 Agent written in Clojure" :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.2.0-master-SNAPSHOT"] [org.clojure/clojure-contrib "1.2.0-SNAPSHOT"]] :dev-dependencies [[leiningen/lein-swank "1.2.0-SNAPSHOT"] [swank-clojure "1.2.0"]]) Everything seems up to date, i.e. 'lein deps' doesn't produce any changes. So what's up?
