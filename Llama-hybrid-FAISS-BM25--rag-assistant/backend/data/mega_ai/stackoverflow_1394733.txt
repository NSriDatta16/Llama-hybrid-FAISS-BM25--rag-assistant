Declaring such a property in an interface simply means that any classes you define that implement the interface are required to implement that property. Those classes are free to implement the property in any way you see fit (either as automatic properties, or through some other more complex means). Changing your property in the interface to the following: string SayHello { get; } The implementing classes are only required to implement the getter for that property. But no storage allocation is taking place at the interface level.
