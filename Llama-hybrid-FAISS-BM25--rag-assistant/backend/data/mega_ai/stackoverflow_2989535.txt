You can delete old binary logs. Instead of deleting them directly, it is safer to use the MySQL-statement PURGE BINARY LOGS which also updates your mybinlog.index file. This file stores which filenames have been used for binary logging, see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/purge-binary-logs.html Further, you can configure your MySQL-Server to delete old binary logs automatically. Set the variables max_binlog_size and expire_logs_days in your server configuration to appropriate values. The ibdata and ib_logfile files have nothing to do with binary logging. They are used by the innodb storage engine. Do not be mistaken by the fact that they do not seem to grow: If you have innodb-tables on your server, these files are important and deleting them may result in loss of data. You can read more about InnoDB in the docs: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-configuration.html
