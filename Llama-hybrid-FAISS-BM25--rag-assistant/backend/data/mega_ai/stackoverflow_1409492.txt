Read from a growing file in C#?

In C#/.NET (on Windows) is there a way to read a "growing" file using a file stream? The length of the file will be very small when the filestream is opened, but the file will be being written to by another thread. If/when the filestream "catches up" to the other thread (i.e. when Read() returns 0 bytes read), I want to pause to allow the file to buffer a bit, then continue reading. I don't really want to use a FilesystemWatcher and keep creating new file streams (as was suggested for log files), since this isn't a log file (it's a video file being encoded on the fly) and performance is an issue. Thanks, Robert
