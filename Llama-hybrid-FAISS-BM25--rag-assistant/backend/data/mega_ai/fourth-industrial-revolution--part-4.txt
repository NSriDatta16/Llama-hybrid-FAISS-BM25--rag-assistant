nd installing it locally, therefore reducing supplier dependence and reducing the supply lead time. Smart sensors Sensors and instrumentation drive the central forces of innovation, not only for Industry 4.0 but also for other "smart" megatrends, such as smart production, smart mobility, smart homes, smart cities, and smart factories. Smart sensors are devices which generate the data and allow further functionality from self-monitoring and self-configuration to condition monitoring of complex processes. With the capability of wireless communication, they reduce installation effort to a great extent and help realise a dense array of sensors. The importance of sensors, measurement science, and smart evaluation for Industry 4.0 has been recognised and acknowledged by various experts and has already led to the statement "Industry 4.0: nothing goes without sensor systems." However, there are a few issues, such as time synchronisation error, data loss, and dealing with large amounts of harvested data, which all limit the implementation of full-fledged systems. Moreover, additional limits on these functionalities represent the battery power. One example of the integration of smart sensors in the electronic devices, is the case of smart watches, where sensors receive the data from the movement of the user, process the data and as a result, provide the user with the information about how many steps they have walked in a day and also converts the data into calories burned. Agriculture and food industries Smart sensors in these two fields are still in the testing stage. These connected sensors collect, interpret and communicate the information available in the plots (leaf area, vegetation index, chlorophyll, hygrometry, temperature, water potential, radiation). Based on this scientific data, the objective is to enable real-time monitoring via a smartphone with a range of advice that optimises plot management in terms of results, time and costs. On the farm, these sensors can be used to detect crop stages and recommend inputs and treatments at the right time, as well as controlling the level of irrigation. The food industry requires more and more security and transparency and full documentation is required. This new technology is used as a tracking system as well as the collection of human data and product data. Accelerated transition to the knowledge economy Knowledge economy is an economic system in which production and services are largely based on knowledge-intensive activities that contribute to an accelerated pace of technical and scientific advance, as well as rapid obsolescence. Industry 4.0 aids transitions into knowledge economy by increasing reliance on intellectual capabilities rather than on physical inputs or natural resources. Challenges Challenges in implementation of Industry 4.0: Economic High economic cost Business model adaptation Unclear economic benefits/excessive investment Driving significant economic changes through automation and technological advancements, leading to both job displacement and the creation of new roles, necessitating widespread workforce reskilling and systemic adaptation. Social Privacy concerns Surveillance and distrust General reluctance to change by stakeholders Threat of redundancy of the corporate IT department Loss of many jobs to automatic processes and IT-controlled processes, especially for blue-collar workers Increased risk of gender inequalities in professions with job roles most susceptible to replacement with AI Political Lack of regulation, standards, and forms of certifications Unclear legal issues and data security Organizational IT security issues, which are greatly aggravated by the inherent need to open up previously closed production shops Reliability and stability needed for critical machine-to-machine communication (M2M), including very short and stable latency times Need to maintain the integrity of production processes Need to avoid any IT snags, as those would cause expe
