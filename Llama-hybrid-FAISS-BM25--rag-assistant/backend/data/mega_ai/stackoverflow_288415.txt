Cache is generally for saving the results of expensive operations or to optimize retrieval of those results. Pool is used to describe a collection of resources that is available for one or more applications to use but allows for control of the number of these resources. I've not run across the term "cache pool" - but based on a quick review, it appears to used for a pool of cache s, or a collection of caches managed by a pool.
