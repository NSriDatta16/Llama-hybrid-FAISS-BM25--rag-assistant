Linq to SQL with table name ending in "es" creates wrong entity class name

My SQL tables names are all plural - Events, Teams, Campuses, etc... When I drag the tables in to the dbml, it creates an entity called " Campuse " which of course is incorrect. I manually rename that to Campus in the properties page, but it doesnt seem to update all of the auto generated code correctly. For example, the .designer.cs file has the following code: public System.Data.Linq.Table Campus when it should be public System.Data.Linq.Table Campuses Similar problems with association names. I could probably go through all of that generated code, and try to rename everything manually, but that's a pain. Is there a better way?
