Excel Vlookup in macro with range

I'm trying to add a vlookup to a cell in an excel macro, however I can't seem to get the arguments of the function right nor the arguments of the range function Please help me in stating how to write last line of my code: RangeStartRow = 2 RangeStartColumn = 1 + 11 + (3 * (AverageSheetIndex - RowCounter - 1)) RangeEndRow = LastCol RangeEndColumn = 2 + 11 + (3 * (AverageSheetIndex - RowCounter - 1)) ActiveCell.Formula = WorksheetFunction.VLookup(ActiveWorkSheet.Cells(1, c), ActiveSheet.range(Cells(RangeStartRow, RangeStartColumn), Cells(RangeEndRow, RangeEndColumn)), 2, False) I believe the code is straight (never mind the values of the first 4 lines), i wish to do a vlookup on the active cell to look for cell(1,c) in the range of the 4 values declared above. Please let me know how to rewrite the last line of my code. Thanks in advance.
