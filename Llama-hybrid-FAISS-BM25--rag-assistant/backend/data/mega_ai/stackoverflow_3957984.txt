the time taken to read a file

I have a question. How long time does it takes to read a 2 mb file, which is fragmented in 2? If the rotational delay is 4300 rpm And the seektime is 10 ms the transfer time is 10 mb/s and the controller overhead is 0,5 ms. My calculation is: 2*(10 ms + 7 ms ( Is this the right answer or have I done something wrong?
