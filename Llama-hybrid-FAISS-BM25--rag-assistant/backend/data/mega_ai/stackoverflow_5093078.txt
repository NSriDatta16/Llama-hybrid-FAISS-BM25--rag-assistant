You're thinking far too small. There are many uses beyond what you can imagine right now. All workflow frameworks (unless they use some type of object db?) will serialize the workflow state so it can be continued at a later time. Microsoft WF, K2 BlackPerl and many others do this. K2 does it because you can have an item going through workflow v1 and then right in the middle someone will update the workflow to v2 but K2 is smart enough to know that is should continue processing that item under the v1 workflow. Maybe i'm missing your question but it seems like you don't like that it serializes the workflow for storage.
