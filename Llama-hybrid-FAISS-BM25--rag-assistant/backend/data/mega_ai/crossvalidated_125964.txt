If you use the L2 norm, i.e., quadratic penalty on the log likelihood function, penalization is very similar to a Bayesian procedure with a Gaussian prior with mean zero for the non-intercept regression coefficients. But unlike the full Bayesian procedure that factors in the uncertainty about the the amount of penalization (analogous to treating the variance of random effects as if it were a known constant), the penalized maximum likelihood procedure pretends that the optimum penalty was pre-specified and is not an unknown parameter. So it results in confidence limits that are a bit too narrow.
