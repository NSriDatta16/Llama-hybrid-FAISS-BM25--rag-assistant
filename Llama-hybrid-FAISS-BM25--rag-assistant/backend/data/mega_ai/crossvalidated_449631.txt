Understanding the graphical model for a GP for regression, from GPML (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006)

The book Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning (GPML) by Rasmussen and Williams (2006) provides a graphical model for GP regression but does not explain it in great detail, so I have a few questions about it: Is $c$ the number of context points, hence the $c$ subscript for $y_c, f_c, x_c$ ? Does "Gaussian field" refer to the fact that all of the (infinite) function evaluations $f_i$ are jointly Gaussian? Does this recreated and simplified graphical model also make sense, or is there something wrong about it that I'm missing?
