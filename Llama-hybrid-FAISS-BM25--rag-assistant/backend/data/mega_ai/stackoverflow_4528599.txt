localStorage and locking

Since (html5) localStorage and its equivalencies persist in between tabs and windows, I've thought about using it for message passing. The problem is that fetch and store are different operations, and therefore not atomic. I have models that rely on UUID generation, conflict resolutions, and beaconing to do the small subset of what I need to do, but my real question is this: Since the local storage is a shared memory resource, what are the locking mechanisms available for mutual access?
