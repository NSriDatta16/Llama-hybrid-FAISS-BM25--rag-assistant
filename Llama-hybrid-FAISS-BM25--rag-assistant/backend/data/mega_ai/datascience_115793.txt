Algorithm/Library which applies classification then use classification results to apply (conditional) regression

I have a project where I'd like to predict two labels and due to the amount of data available (300~), I'd like to stay away from Neural Networks. Let's take the iris dataset for example. The labels that I want to train with and predict are Species (Classification problem) then Petal.Length (Regression problem). I say then because I'd like to be more precise in predicting Petal.Length. So, if the classifier predicted 'setosa', I'd only run a regression model independently trained on 'setosa' class. Is that reasoning sound, or should I be using 'Species' as a regressor? Either way, I am trying to find an algorithm/package/method for me in either R or Python, without having to build classification and regression models separately. Below is the R-code on what I'm trying to do: library(caret) df
