Which Java CMS can communicate with EJBs deployed on the same application server?

I already asked this question over at serverfault , but perhaps it's better to ask here. We developed a JavaEE6 application. This application is basically something similar like a backend to a webshop (no user interface at all, just calculations/data handling). Now, we're looking for a web CMS with which we can use this backend. So, basically just a web CMS which is user-friendly to the end-user who can then change static page contents using the web CMS, and which we can program to use our backend for doing some calculations. JSF wound be nice ... So I'm asking for suggestions on which web CMS to use, and on how to do the integration. If more clarifications are needed, I'll try to provide them. Thanks for your insight!
