PHP - Plesk - Cron - Allowed memory size exhausted?

ini_set('max_execution_time',0); ini_set('memory_limit','1000M'); These are the first two lines at the very top of my script. I was under the impression if I ran something via cron memory limits didn't apply, but I was wrong. Safe mode is off and when I test to see if these values are being set they are but I keep getting the good ol' "PHP Fatal: Memory exhausted" error. Any ideas what I may be doing wrong? And whats the "more elegant way" of writing "infinite" for the "memory limit" value is it -1 or something?
