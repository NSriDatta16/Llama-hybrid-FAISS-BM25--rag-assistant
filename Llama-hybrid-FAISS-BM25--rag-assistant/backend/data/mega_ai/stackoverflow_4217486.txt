Your query is close. Just remove the WHERE clause that filters everything. SELECT p.product_id, p.name, AVG(pr.rating) AS rating_average FROM products p INNER JOIN product_ratings pr ON pr.product_id = p.product_id ORDER BY rating_average DESC This will return you the averages for each product, sorted with the highest average rating at the top of the resultset.
