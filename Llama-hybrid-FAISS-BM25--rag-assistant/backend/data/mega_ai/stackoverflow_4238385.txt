(1): Depends on if you only want to use this header to interface to the C lib, in that case you can safely ignore it. (If you are translating a whole package to Delphi, and want to generate a DLL based on it, you'll need to add something like {$ifdef LVR_NET_EXPORT} export; {$endif} to the function declarations, and in the main library file (the one that starts with "library") add the function to the "exports" clause (again {$ifdef LVR_NET_EXPORT}) ) In short: ignore (2): Type LPLVR_NET_ALARM_INFO = ^LVR_NET_ALARM_INFO LVR_NET_ALARM_INFO = Record dwAlarmInput, dwVideoLoss, dwMotionDetect, dwVideoCover : DWORD; dwReserve : array[0..15] of DWord; end; TLVR_NET_ALARM_INFO = LVR_NET_ALARM_INFO; // not needed but Delphi style convention This isn't necessarily enough, since the way the record is packed is not defined this way. But the original fragment also lacks information about packing. 3) function LvrNetGetSdkVersion:DWord; or function LvrNetGetSdkVersion:DWord; stdcall; external 'dllname.dll' name 'LvrNetGetSdkVersion'; to import from a dll. Note the "name" part where you can adjust the case of the imported identifier
