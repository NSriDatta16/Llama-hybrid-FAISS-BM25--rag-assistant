How does a Stacked AutoEncoder increases performance of a Convolutional Neural Network in image classification tasks

Stacked Auto-Endocer provides a version of raw data with more promising feature information, that can be used to train a classier with a specific context and find better accuracy than training with raw data . For image classification task, how can a stacked auto-encoder help an traditional Convolutional Neural Network? I recently read the paper http://people.idsia.ch/~ciresan/data/icann2011.pdf but can't understand clearly. I have a little bit question about CNN, any pre-trained step before first convolution operation like Dimensionally Reduction or AutoEncoder output can be used as input image instead of real image data in CNN and how much it affects the performance of Convolution Neural Network in context of image classification tasks.
