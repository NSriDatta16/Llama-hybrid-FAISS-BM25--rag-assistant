Derive MA (Moving average) representation of a first-difference-process

I have a non-stationary AR(1)-process. After taking the first difference, how can I derive the MA representation of the resulting „difference process“ Delta_xt? As an example, consider x t = 1.5x t-1 + e t (x t -x t-1 =) Delta_x t = 0.5x t-1 + e t . How can I convert this process Delta_xt into an MA process?
