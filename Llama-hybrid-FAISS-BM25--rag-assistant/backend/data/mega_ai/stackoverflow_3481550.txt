Magento - Create new user returns SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock' Help?

I'm at my wits end with this one. Everything else on this new live site works flawlessly except this one issue. I can't create new customer accounts without it returning this error. I've tried everything I can think of in my own wheelhouse. Any suggestions? Magento forums are a wash for support.
