Training detector without bounding box data

From what I can see most object detection NNs (Fast(er) R-CNN, YOLO etc) are trained on data including bounding boxes indicating where in the picture the objects are localized. Is there any model that can be trained with image+label data ( without bounding box data ) to predict the bounding box(es) ? I am referring following papers Is object localization for free? â€“ Weakly Supervised Object Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks Self-taught object localization with deep networks These papers are not recent and I am not able to find any recent papers related to this . Please let me know if there are any other resources related to available . Thanks in advance
