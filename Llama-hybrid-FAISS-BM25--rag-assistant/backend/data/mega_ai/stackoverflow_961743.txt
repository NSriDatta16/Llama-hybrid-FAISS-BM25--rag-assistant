Jon Skeet wrote a great article about parameter passing in C#. It details clearly the exact behaviour and usage of passing parameters by value, by reference ( ref ), and by output ( out ). Here's an important quote from that page in relation to ref parameters: Reference parameters don't pass the values of the variables used in the function member invocation - they use the variables themselves. Rather than creating a new storage location for the variable in the function member declaration, the same storage location is used, so the value of the variable in the function member and the value of the reference parameter will always be the same. Reference parameters need the ref modifier as part of both the declaration and the invocation - that means it's always clear when you're passing something by reference.
