The following article might be helpfull to you, as it describes how to evaluate if the effect of a given explanatory factor is invariant over persons, time, or organizations: Paternoster, R., Brame, R., Mazerolle, P., & Piquero, A. R. (1998). Using the Correct Statistical Test for the Equality of Regression Coefficients. Criminology, 36(4), 859â€“866. What they basically say is, that to test the hypothesis that the difference between $b_1$ and $b_2$ (1 and 2 being two samples or times) is equal to zero you can apply the following formula: $\begin{equation} Z= \frac{b_1-b_2}{\sqrt{{SEb_1}^{2}+{SEb_2}^2}} \end{equation}$ SE being the standard error of the respective 'slopes' in your case.
