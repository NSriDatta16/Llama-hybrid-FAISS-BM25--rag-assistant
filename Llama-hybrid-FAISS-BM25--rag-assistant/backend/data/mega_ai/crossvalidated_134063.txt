I'm not sure, if you're still interested in the topic, but I will provide a brief answer for you and other people that are interested in working with quality control charts (QCC), using R language. For a theoretical introduction to the topic, I would suggest reviewing the corresponding section of StatSoft's nice electronic textbook: http://www.uta.edu/faculty/sawasthi/Statistics/stquacon.html . For much more advanced treatment of the topic, I'd suggest this relevant thesis , titled "An investigation of some characteristics of univariate and multivariate control charts" (see links to PDF chapters). Traditionally, R ecosystem offers a wide variety of packages to choose from for a specific domain. This applies to the QCC analysis as well. Most frequently used package for QCC analysis is qcc (Quality Control Charts), however there many other packages with varying ranges of functionality: IQCC : Improved Quality Control Charts MSQC : Multivariate Statistical Quality Control qcr : Quality control and reliability qualityTools : Statistical Methods for Quality Science SPCadjust : Functions for calibrating control charts CMPControl : Control Charts for Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Distribution edcc : Economic Design of Control Charts MetaQC : Objective Quality Control and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for Genomic Meta-Analysis graphicsQC : Quality Control for Graphics in R QCGWAS : Quality Control of Genome Wide Association Study results GWAtoolbox : GWAS Quality Control qAnalyst (removed from CRAN) SixSigma : Six Sigma Tools for Quality and Process Improvement qicharts : Quality Improvement Charts For qcc there is a hard-to-find vignette by Luca Scrucca, which can be complemented by this blog post . For those, considering using QCC in educational setting , there is an interesting paper , describing the process (no code, though). Finally, anyone, interested in using QCC in a larger context of SixSigma and in R environment, the book "Six Sigma with R: Statistical engineering for process improvement" , published by Springer, might be helpful.
