Why isn't my javascript & css caching?

It's appears ONLY javascript and css are not caching ... but images are caching. I am using Firebug and when I refresh the page, I notice in Firebug a lot of 200 HTTP responses for js/css but am receiving 304 HTTP codes (content not modified) for all of my images. So it appears that my JS and CSS are not caching. Also, when using YSlow to help determine the problem with my JS/CSS content not caching, it informs me that: There are 4 components with misconfigured ETags http://www.example.com/css/basic.css http://www.example.com/js/ga.js http://www.example.com/js/dojo/dojo.js Listed below is my .htaccess file Options -Indexes Options +FollowSymLinks # Enable ETag FileETag MTime Size # Set expiration header ExpiresActive on ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 week" # Compress some text file types AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/css text/xml application/x-javascript text/javascript application/javascript application/json # Deactivate compression for buggy browsers BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0[678] no-gzip BrowserMatch \bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html # Set header information for proxies Header append Vary User-Agent Any idea what's wrong with my .htaccess access file preventing it from caching my CSS or JavaScript?
