Check out the documentation for NSURLRequest (and NSMutableURLRequest ): you can use it to make a POST request to your login and registration pages, just like a web browser. You can write the form UI in Cocoa/Objective-C and then send the data to the server. As far as displaying the result to the user, you'll have to figure out a way to either parse the returned HTML (bad idea) or modify your CMS to return JSON or XML to iPhone requests (better idea). Edit: Here's some sample code, taken from an app I'm working on (it submits data to Last.fm using POST ): NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com/"]; NSString *str = @"This is my example data!"; // everything below here is directly from my app: NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:url]; [request setHTTPMethod:@"POST"]; [request setHTTPBody:[str dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]]; [request setValue:kLastFMClientUserAgent forHTTPHeaderField:@"User-Agent"]; [request setCachePolicy:NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData]; [request setHTTPShouldHandleCookies:NO]; *connection = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:request delegate:self startImmediately:YES];
