Passing a Node as an XSL Template Parameter

In an existing XSL stylesheet I was passing a string into a named template. Due to a requirements change, I now need to display four strings, the string I was displaying and its three siblings. Rather than pass the four separate strings into the named template, I'm trying to pass their parent element (PETrailingFund in the code below), Price/Earnings Trailing x but the transformation blows up when I try to work with the "fund" parameter in the named template: NOT PROVIDED NOT PROVIDED &#160; yes last From what I've read, I'm not really passing in a node but a result tree fragment and I need to get it back to a node (or node-set). Is that accurate or am I doing something else wrong? How would I convert it (I'm working in a fairly stock PHP5 environment that I can't change). N.B., I trimmed a good bit of the named template for simplicity's sake.
