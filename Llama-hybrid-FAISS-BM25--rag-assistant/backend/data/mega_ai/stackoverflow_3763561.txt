Magento best-sellers list not updating with cache enabled

For a while now I've been showing a list of best selling products in my footer, using the code below. However, I just realised that when the cache is enabled, the list doesn't get updated until I refresh the cache. Is there any way around that? $_productCollection = Mage::getResourceModel('reports/product_collection') ->addAttributeToSelect('name') ->addAttributeToFilter('visibility', $visibility) ->addOrderedQty() ->setOrder('ordered_qty', 'desc') $_productCollection->load();}
