Does ICA require to run PCA first?

I reviewed an application-based paper saying that applying PCA before applying ICA (using fastICA package). My question is, does ICA (fastICA) require PCA to be run first? This paper mentioned that ... it is also argued that pre-applying PCA enhances ICA performance by (1) discarding small trailing eigenvalues before whitening and (2) reducing computational complexity by minimizing pair-wise dependencies. PCA decorrelates the input data; the remaining higher-order dependencies are separated by ICA. Also other papers are applying PCA before ICA, e.g., this one . Are there any other pros and cons to run PCA before ICA? Please provide theory with references.
