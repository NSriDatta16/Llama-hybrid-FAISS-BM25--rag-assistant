Since you want to predict the amount spent rather than just whether any amount is spent at all, logistic regression won't cut it. You want a model in which the amount itself is a dependent variable, such as linear regression. If lots of subjects don't buy anything, a zero-inflated model could be helpful. You can keep using logistic regression if you use a two-stage compound model in which you predict whether subjects buy anything, then, among those for whom you predicted a purchase, predict the actual amount spent with another model.
