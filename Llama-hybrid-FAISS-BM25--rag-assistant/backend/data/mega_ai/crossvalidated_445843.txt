Summarizing "percent error" for several data points

this is a pretty simple question, but ive never taken a stats class in my life. i have a series of measurements, e.g., 4.5, 6.7, and 8.2, and the "correct" values, e.g., 4.6, 6.5, 8.0. I want to summarize this data in a single line of a table. Using the average + standard deviation would give a high RSD, leading the reader to think there is more error than there is. What metric should I use instead? Median + average %error or something like that?
