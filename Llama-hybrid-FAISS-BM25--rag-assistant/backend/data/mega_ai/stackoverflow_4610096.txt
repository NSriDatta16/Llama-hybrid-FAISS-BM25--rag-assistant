If you're new to Rails, Apache + Passenger (as mentioned above) is the most 'straightforward' way to go. Having a good caching strategy is probably the best way to increase requests/second â€” before looking at Varnish though, I'd make sure you're handling your fragment caching properly and with enough granularity. See the Rails Guide on caching for more on this.
