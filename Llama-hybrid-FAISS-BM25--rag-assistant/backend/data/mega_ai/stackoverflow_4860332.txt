You don't need to know MySQL; postgresql is another fine choice for relational database backend storage. Mnesia is a nice database for soft-realtime non-relational backend storage. CouchDB is another non-relational database optimized for storing JSON documents that can be searched using JavaScript. You might not even need a database at all, if on-disk file storage is good enough (see Maildir for an excellent mail storage mechanism).
