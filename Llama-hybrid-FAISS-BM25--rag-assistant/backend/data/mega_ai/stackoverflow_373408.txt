An exploration of the possible solutions to closely related problem (that is, rounding down instead of up), many of which are significantly faster than the naive approach, is available on the Bit Twiddling Hacks page, an excellent resource for doing the kinds of optimization you are looking for. The fastest solution is to use a lookup table with 256 entries, that reduces the total operation count to around 7, from an average of 62 (by a similar operation counting methodology) for the naive approach. Adapting those solutions to your problem is a matter of a single comparison and increment.
