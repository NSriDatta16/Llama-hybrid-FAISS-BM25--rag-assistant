Neural networks can be notoriously difficult to work with (too many potential difficulties, such as local minima, over-fitting etc.). A kernel method is likely to be easier to work with, such as kernel ridge regression, the support vector machine, kernel logistic regression or Gaussian process classifiers, using a radial basis function kernel/covariance function. As long as the hyper-parameters are tuned using a sensible procedure (e.g. cross-validation), they are likely to provide good results with much less effort/risk than neural networks.
