Organising JBehave stories

We've just started looking at using JBehave for acceptance tests and I was wondering how people that are using it are organising the writing of stories and the storage of story files. It's just development that are working on them at the moment so we have the story files stored in the resources folder alongside the Java code to implement them. I guess my actual question is how and where are you storing your story files and how does this work with the product owner or QA writing stories?
