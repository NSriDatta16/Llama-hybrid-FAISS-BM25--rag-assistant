Detecting grammatical errors with BERT

We fine-tuned BERT ( bert-base-uncased ) model with CoLA dataset for sentence classification task. The dataset is a mix of sentences with and without grammatical errors. The retrained model is then used to identify sentences with or without errors. Are there any other approaches we could make use of using BERT, other than building a classifier?
