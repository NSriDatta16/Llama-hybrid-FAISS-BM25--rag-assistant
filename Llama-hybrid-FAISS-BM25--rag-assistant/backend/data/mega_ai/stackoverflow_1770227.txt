BalusC is correct. More to the point is that the person you are arguing with is assuming that XHTML must be XML, which is false. XHTML 1.0 is a syntax of HTML that is compatible with XML syntax, but is however an SGML serialization that may optionally be processed as XML per paragraph 5.1 of the specification. XHTML 1.1, however, must be processed as XML. The idea is that XHTML 1.0 is written as a transitional point between SGML and the XML syntax, even XHTML 1.0 strict. The various doctypes of XHTML 1.0 are all transitional and merely indicate the degree of conformance to the XML syntax without regard for the method of processing.
