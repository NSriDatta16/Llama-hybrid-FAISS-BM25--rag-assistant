Generate SOAP Web Service client forms (Java)

I have a Web Service accessible via SOAP. Let's assume it provides a method with the signature sayHello(String name) Of course, I have the WSDL describing the Web Service. What I want to do now is to generate a client web application (war archive) with a GUI that provides a form to enter the parameter for the Web Service method. In case of the example, the form must just allow to enter the value for the "name" parameter. Then, a SOAP message must be assembled and sent to the WS. Is there any way or any framework to generate such a webapp automatically !? The actual kind of the resulting webapp is not important, it may be a GWT webapp, JSF, plain Servlet with JSP or whatever. Even a plain HTML/JavaScript client app would be OK. I mean, there are tools to generate CRUD forms out of data models, so there must be tools to create forms for Web Services, too... I've been googling around for a long time, but the only thing I've found is a feature of Eclipse: http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/jst/components/ws/M3/tutorials/WebServiceClient.html . Basically, this does what I want, but I'm looking for a more ..hm.. elegant way to do this ;-) Thanks in advance, Frank
