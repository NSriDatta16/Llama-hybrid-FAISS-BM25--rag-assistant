You need to be using appropriate decomposition methods for daily data. Since it can have multiple seasonality. As an example, following seasonality can be observed in daily data: Day of the week. Day of the month. Month of the year. Holidays/special events. All of the above should be accounted. Using decompose in R does not capture above. tbats in forecast package can do multi seasonal time series. Below is the seasonal decomposition using tbats with two seasonal period. > Data.msts fit plot(fit) > plot(fit$errors) Error plot, shows no pattern at least visually and also using acf on errors acf(fit$errors) . This is just an example. you can use other techniques such as unobserved components model that can handle multi seasonality and also add external regressors such as holidays.
