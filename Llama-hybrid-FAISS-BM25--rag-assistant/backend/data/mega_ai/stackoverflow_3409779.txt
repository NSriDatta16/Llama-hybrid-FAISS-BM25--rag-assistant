If you are using linux, and just want to drag copies down to the local filesystem, then you could use s3sync: http://www.s3sync.net/wiki If you wanted to access the files directly on s3, you could mount s3 as a fuse filesystem locally, but beware that accessing files using this method is dependent on your connection, so there could be speed issues. I've used s3fs perfectly well for accessing backups etc: (can only post one link atm, but google s3fs - it's hosted on googlecode) If you just need a copy, then s3sync is the easiest option. Hope this helps.
