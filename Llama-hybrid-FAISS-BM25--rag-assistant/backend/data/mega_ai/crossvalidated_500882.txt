Plot a tree from RandomForest object

I trained a randomforest using the RandomForest package on R. I am interested in how the most useful variables are split into the classes, So i would like to visualize a tree that is somehow an ensemble of all (I know about the black box rationale) This topic ( How to actually plot a sample tree from randomForest::getTree()? ) explains that it is possible to plot it using the cforest function and the party package. So I created my random forest model, but got the error below. form st Any suggestion regarding how to proceed? or maybe another method? I tried reprtree as suggested in the topics' comments I linked above. However, when using the "realtree" object with ctree or rpar.plot, it doesn't work either: > rpart.plot(realtree, type=5,main = "default prp\n(type = 0, extra = 0)") Error in rpart.plot(realtree, type = 5, main = "default prp\n(type = 0, extra = 0)") : Not an rpart object > prp(tree, main = "type = 4, extra = 6\nbox.palette = \"auto\"", + type = 4, extra = 6, # label all nodes, show prob of second class + box.palette = "auto", # auto color the nodes based on the model type + faclen = 0) # faclen = 0 to print full factor names Error in prp(tree, main = "type = 4, extra = 6\nbox.palette = \"auto\"", : Not an rpart object
