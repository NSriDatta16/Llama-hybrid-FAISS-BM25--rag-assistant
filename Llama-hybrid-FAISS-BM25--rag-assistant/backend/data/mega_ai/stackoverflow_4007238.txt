execCommand justifycenter

If I try to execCommand("justifycenter"... a paragraph on my page in Firefox, it doesn't work; it's giving me this crazy error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMNSHTMLDocument.execCommand]" nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame :: editor.php?id=new :: onclick :: line 1" data: no] I already know the reason; it's because my body tag doesn't have contenteditable on, which is annoying because the other browsers don't require this. Now, my problem is I don't want the entire page to be editable. I'm writing something of a WYSIWYG page builder, and it's too much of a compromise to stick the entire editor into an iframe. Does anyone know any other alternatives? This whole execCommand stuff is new to me, and enabling it for the body, but disabling it for everything else seems like a really bad hack.
