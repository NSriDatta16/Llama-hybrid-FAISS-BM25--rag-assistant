Well the easiest/fastest workaround seems to be "don't use the phing task but start using the 'real' phpunit output. So running [...] and use --coverage-html and publish that in hudson and use --coverage-clover and the junit switch to get the coverage information into hudson. ( See jenkins-php.org or Setting up jenkins for php projects (there is a demo phpunit.xml.dist) for reference) But chances are you don't want to so that :/ Saidly from the Phing docs of the phpunit task i see no way of telling phing directly to use --process-isolation switch. So maybe someone else has a solution for that. I don't have one that will still produce code coverage. From the comments I'm going to assume that you have 2 separate pieces of test code that can't be run in a single process so what would ideal is if you could say: run 2 processes: "testsuite one do that, testsuite two do the other thing" after that aggregate the results Sadly i don't know how you could tell phpunit to do so. I'll investigate further but for now the only thing i know that works for sure is to use --process-isolation each test in the whole testsuite. If there is a way to run a whole suite in one separate process i don't know about it. Hopefully someone else has an easier solution to this :)
