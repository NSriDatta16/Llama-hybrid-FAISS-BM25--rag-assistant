Using GARCH does not sound like a great option, because you have not established presence of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (and you have used the ARCH-LM test that could have indicated that). Meanwhile, White's test assesses whether the variance of the residuals varies with the regressors (in your case only one). If you were to modify the model to account for that, you would want a model where, well, the variance of the residuals varies with $x$ . (This could still be done with a GARCH model in a dirty way. You would specify the conditional variance equation as GARCHX, including $x$ as an external regressor in the conditional variance equation. During estimation, you would restrict the parameters $\alpha=0.001$ and $\beta=0.999$ , so that the estimated ARCH patterns are negligible. But there should be a more elegant alternative.)
