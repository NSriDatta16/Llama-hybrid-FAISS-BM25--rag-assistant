Well, it mostly depends on the intended usage of the data. Often, data of this form is intended to show the influence or reach of an application. For this, most businesses will report some form of the average unique users during some time period, like "500 unique visitors each month", or facebook's "active daily users". For an application with a key activity, like uploading photos, you might also report something related to that activity, like "5 new photos uploaded every second." Would your data allow that? For displaying it graphically, a simple line our bar chart showing how the influence (y) grows over time (x) is usually sufficient. If you can tell us more about what you hope to use the data for, others may have better ideas than mine.
