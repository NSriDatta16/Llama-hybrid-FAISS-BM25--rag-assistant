Improper Bayesian Prior

I was reading TPE by Lehmann andCasella where I came through this example: If $X\sim\text{Bin}(n,p)$ and we consider a $\text{beta}(a,b)$ prior for $p$. The Bayes estimator in this case is $\frac{x+a}{n+a+b}$. If $a=b=0$, this estimator is $x/n$, but the prior density in this case is improper. The posterior density is proper if $1\leq x \leq n-1$ with $x/n$ as the posterior mean. When $x=0$ or $x=n$ the posterior is no longer proper. However any estimator $\delta(x)$ that satisfies $\delta(0)=0$ and $\delta(n)=1$, the posterior expected loss is finite and minimized at $\delta(x)=x/n$. I cannot verify this last part.
