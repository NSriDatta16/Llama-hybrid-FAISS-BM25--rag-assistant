You could use OLS to answer this. Suppose we have only 2 months $t=\{1,2\}$ and three kinds of cards $c=\{1,2,3\}$. In the following specification, you estimate the share of each kind of card for each month via interactions. Hence, $$Volume_{t,c}=\beta_0+\beta_1 Card2_{t,c}+\beta_2 Card3_{t,c}+\beta_4 Card1_{t,c}*Month2_{t,c}+\beta_5 Card2_{t,c}*Month2_{t,c}+\beta_6 Card3_{t,c}*Month2_{t,c}+e_{t,c}.$$ All variables are dummy variables. After estimating the coefficients, the volume for Card 1 in month 1 is just $\beta_0$, the volume for Card 2 in month 1 is $\beta_0+\beta_1$, the volume for Card 3 in month 2 is $\beta_0+\beta_2+\beta_6$ etc. If you want to test whether there are differences between the two months, say whether the volume due to Card 2 differs, then you test if $$\beta_0+\beta1=\beta_0+\beta1+\beta_5\Leftrightarrow \beta_5=0.$$ This is just a simple t-test for the coefficient. (Testing whether overall volume differs between both months is also possible by testing a linear combination of coefficients, but for example some t-test on the mean of both months would be simpler and faster.) Similarly, you can test whether some coefficient (or a combination of coefficients) differ from some value, e.g., the average volume of that card. Admittedly, this can become tedious if you have many months and cards. If you are only interested in 2 kinds of cards, you can subsume the rest in an "other" dummy and the number of coefficients to be estimated reduces greatly. Finally, if you want the share of volume instead of volume, just divide the dependent variable by the overall volume that month ($\sum_c Volume_c$) and you get percentage points rather than volume.
