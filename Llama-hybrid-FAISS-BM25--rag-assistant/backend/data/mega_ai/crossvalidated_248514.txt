Analysis of deviance Since the models you're interested in comparing are nested - your interaction model is a special case of your non-interacted model - you could also do an 'analysis of deviance' (like an analysis of variance, but suitable for generalized linear models such as logistic regression). That would test whether it was worth putting the interaction term in. Out of sample performance If one of the two models you are comparing is not a special case of the other then you'll certainly need to look at model comparison statistics like AIC or BIC, or possibly to something like cross-validation. These statistics (AIC and cross-validation at least) are trying to give you an idea of what you could expect from the model on new data. If this is what counts as a 'good' in a model, then these are your statistics. The cost of mistakes Another, very general way to compare the two logistic regression models (nested or not) would be to compare the ROC curves for them. That would be a measure of model fit under all possible assumptions about the relative cost of mistaking a passing student for a failing student versus the opposite. Typically some models perform well when the costs skew one way and other when it skews the other. A model whose ROC curve always dominates another is better under all loss structures. There are, inevitably, some caveats to all these, but it's a start.
