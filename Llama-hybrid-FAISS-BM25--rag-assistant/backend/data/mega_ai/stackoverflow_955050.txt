The visual studio designer has its own HTML schema validator. You may see HTML validation errors in design mode eventhough the website works fine. It could be that Infragistics assemblies are loading from the GAC and not the "bin" directory of the website. Make sure that your references to the Infragistics assemblies are set to "Copy Local". Please refer to this article for more information.
