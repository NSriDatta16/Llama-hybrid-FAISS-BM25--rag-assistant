What data structure should I use for object storage, for easily generating primary keys for new entries?

I'm doing a school project in Java and I the following question have arisen: I have an entity with attributes - id, name, phone.. with id as the unique primary key. I want to store them in a data structure(such as list..). Then in the application I obtain the data for creating a new instance (name, phone..) and I want to create a new instance of the entity and store it in my data structure with a new unique id. The id shouldn't be random, it would be best if the id rised continuously with the size of the list. Also I dont want to reuse ids. The first implementation that comes to my mind is to use ArrayList and simply set id as indexes. But ArrayList.remove(int index) after removal shifts all following elements to left. I assume that ArrayList.remove(Object o) works the same, but i would be gratefull i I'm proven wrong. Determining ids from last element would not work either. I could go through all of them but that seems inefiicient. Thanks in advance for any help :)
