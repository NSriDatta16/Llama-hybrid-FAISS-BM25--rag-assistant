To define the type of stat model you need to understand the behaviour of your dependent variable. In your case, it seems that your DV ("revenue") is at least continuous. Therefore you can forget about logistic regression, which is suitable for binary (0/1) dependent variable. Difficult to advise on the exact type of model you need without more info re your DV - Look at the distribution (Is it normally distributed?); Is the variable truncated? etc.
