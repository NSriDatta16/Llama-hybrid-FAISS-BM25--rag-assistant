How to report confusion matrix of Random Forest classifier on test set using R?

First of all, I have to say that I'm newbie in working with R. Anyway, I'm going to apply Random Forest classifier on my data set using R. To do this, I beforehand divided my data set into training set and test set, using SPSS. After creating two separate data sets, I incorporated my training set into the associated function of R; that is, randomForest . It have run very well but only reported confusion matrix on training set, not test set. I would like to ask how can one report confusion matrix calculated using Random Forest classifier on test set rather than training set?
