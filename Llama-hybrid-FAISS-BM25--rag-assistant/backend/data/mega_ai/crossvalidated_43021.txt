Based on your comment regarding your objectives, I would likely use a combination of these three resources: The Little SAS Book : An excellent primer for basic SAS syntax, data handling, etc. The SAS documentation for some missing data techniques like Multiple Imputation, as well as some of the various PDFs of papers presented at places like NESUG. This one , for example, in J. Statistical Software. Categorical Data Analysis Using the SAS System : A decent treatment of both the code and the statistical underpinnings for things like logistic regression. Alternately Logistic Regression Using the SAS System could also work - I haven't read it, but Paul Allison's survival analysis text is outstanding.
