Agent message code 20084. The process could not connect to Subscriber

All servers running SQL 2005 SQL server (NOLA) replicates to 35 remote locations (StoreXX). Earlier this week, one publication started having problems connecting to 30 of the 35 remote locations, with an error of: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Date 2/4/2010 10:00:01 AM Log Job History (NOLA-Closing_Balance-CB Defaults to Stores-R99S- Store1-2790) Step ID 2 Server NOLA Job Name NOLA-Closing_Balance-CB Defaults to Stores-R99S-Store1-2790 Step Name Run agent.

Try to run the agent at a later time. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The problem is only this one publication & not all subscriptions. I have deleted a problem subscription & readded, same problem. I have created another publication (same dB) & subscription (same & new subscribers) with the same results (error above). Now is where it gets weird….. I created a new publication using a different dB on both the publisher & subscriber & everything works fine. I have had the network folks check what they need to check & have googled until I am blue in the face. Can anyone give me any insight into this issue. AHIA, Larry….
