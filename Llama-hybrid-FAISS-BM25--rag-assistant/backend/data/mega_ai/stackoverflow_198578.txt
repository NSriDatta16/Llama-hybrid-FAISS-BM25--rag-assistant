Do you disagree with this? Is HTML and CSS impossible to learn well in a week? Yes, I'm almost sure. Although I share your experience related to the implementation: However I can take a photo shopped comp and create a pure HTML/CSS web page from it with ease. Given a good reference or some prior knowledge, this isn't really all that hard, certainly much (!) less hard than is often claimed, if the mock is any good. However, this: Crossbrowser coding is not as hard as people make it sound. is wrong, in my experience. It very much depends on the mock you're working from: If it's designed by a web developer and optimized for web development, implementation might be easy. However, graphical designs may be arbitrarily complex and implementing them all meaningfully while paying attention to divers browser quirks is extremely taxing.
