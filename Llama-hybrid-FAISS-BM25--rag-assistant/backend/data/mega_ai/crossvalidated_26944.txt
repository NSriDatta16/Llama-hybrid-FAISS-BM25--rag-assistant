The following article endeavours to promote the use of multilevel modelling in social science settings: Bliese, P. D. & Ployhart, R. E. (2002). Growth Modeling Using Random Coefficient Models: Model Building, Testing, and Illustrations, Organizational Research Methods, Vol. 5 No. 4, October 2002 362-387. PDF To quote the abstract: In this article, the authors illustrate how random coefficient modeling can be used to develop growth models for the analysis of longitudinal data. In contrast to previous discussions of random coefficient models, this article provides step-by-step guidance using a model comparison framework. By approaching the modeling this way, the authors are able to build off a regression foundation and progressively estimate and evaluate more complex models. In the model comparison framework, the article illustrates the value of using likelihood tests to contrast alternative models (rather than the typical reliance on tests of significance involving individual parameters), and it provides code in the open-source language R to allow readers to replicate the results. The article concludes with practical guidelines for estimating growth models. An examination of the articles listed on Google Scholar as citing this paper suggest several other useful leads .
