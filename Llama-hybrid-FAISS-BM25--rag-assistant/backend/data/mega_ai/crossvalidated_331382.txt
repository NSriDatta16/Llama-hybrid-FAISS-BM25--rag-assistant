I think you would be much better off by using matrix algebra throughout. As for your first question, remember that the fits in a linear model are obtained as: $$\hat{y} = H y$$ Intuitively, $h_{ii}=1$ means that observation $y_i$ fully determines $\hat{y}_{i}$, so in a sense it has maximum leverage. If $h_{ii} \approx 0$, that would imply that observation $y_i$ has very little role in determining $\hat{y}_{i}$ which would be mostly determined by the rest of the observations.
