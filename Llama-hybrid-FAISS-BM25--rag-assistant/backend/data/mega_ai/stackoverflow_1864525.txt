Puzzled by ror Mechanize

I'm trying to use mechanize to perform a simple search on my college's class schedule db. The following code returns nil, however it works logging into facebook and searching google (with diff url/params). What am I doing wrong? I'm following the latest (great) railscast here . Mechanize documentation has been useful but I'm still puzzled. Thanks in advance for your suggestions! ruby script/console require 'mechanize' agent = WWW::Mechanize.new agent.get("https://www.owens.edu/cgi-bin/class.pl/") agent.page.forms form = agent.page.forms.last form.occ_subject = "chm" form.submit.search => []
