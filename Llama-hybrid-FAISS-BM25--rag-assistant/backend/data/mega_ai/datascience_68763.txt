Random Forest Regressor doesn't have such an option, usually, if you have enough data and a correct training process, predictions should be in an acceptable range. Of course, they might go above and beyond your range, but the error might be still acceptable. If you are looking for a model that is able to utilize prediction boundaries, I suggest you look at Facebook Prophet as it may be useful for your problem at hand.

Here is a link for this part Forecasting Growth and Saturating Minimum And another note - Prophet proves to be quite useful in predicting any seasonal related time series, so you can achieve even better performance predicting sales compared to Random Forest.
