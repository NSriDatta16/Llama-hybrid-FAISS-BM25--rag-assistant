I liked your question! The complexity of EM depends on the structure it is being applied on, and could be quite different from one problem to another one. But, just like any computational problem, it might be worthy of rigorous analysis to find and compare the complexity in different cases. For some of the problems it is analyzed. For example in [1] see 3.1 . Some of these problems are proved to be NP-hard, whether with EM or not. See [3,4].
