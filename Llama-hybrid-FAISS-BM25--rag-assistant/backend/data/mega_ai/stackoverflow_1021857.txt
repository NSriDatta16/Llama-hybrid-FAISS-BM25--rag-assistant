Many of Google's whitepapers, especially but not exclusively ones linked from this page , describe successful practical applications of parallel distributed computing and/or their DS and algorithmic underpinnings. For example, this paper deals with modifying a DBMS's data structures to extract intra-transaction parallelism; this one (and some others) introduces the popular mapreduce architecture, since implemented e.g. in hadoop ; this one is about highly parallelizable approximate matrix factoring suitable for use in "kernel methods" in machine learning; etc, etc...
