Ok after working with it for sometime I figured out a way. Create a XAML like this / On windowLoad function set the canvas height/width equal to grid height/width. Update the canvas ht/wd: when grid size changes, due to mininmize/maximize. dragging an element beyond the boundaries of canvas or creating a new element too close the edge of canvas double dHeight = 220; if (drawingCanvas.Height Hope this is of some help. Please share if anyone has any better idea or suggestions to improve this.
