You don't mention what sort of content you are dealing with. If it's markup (markdown) and images it should be pretty simple Log every actual content request, and use that data to rank the order you pre-load the cache in. This way the system is self tuning. If there are complex paths to traverse, consider using a neural network process to determine what to pre-load Silverlight uses the standard browser HTTP request methods and hence cache, so all you have to do is request a resource and it will be cached You seem to be describing a wiki (editing pages in Silverlight etc). Consider using an existing wiki engine e.g. screwturn.eu and customising the display and editing interface to work via Silverlight. This will save an enormous amount in versioning, resource management, security etc
