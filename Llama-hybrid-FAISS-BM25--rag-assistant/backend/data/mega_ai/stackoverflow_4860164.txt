I bumped into the same problem while working at an app for Android. I tried with many encoding types but it didn't work. The thing that finally solved the problem was specifying the "User-Agent" property of the GET request to "Mozilla/5.0". Oh and the encoding type I found best suited is UTF-8. It allows recognition of most special characters, actually any of the ones supported by Google Translate. Hope this helps
