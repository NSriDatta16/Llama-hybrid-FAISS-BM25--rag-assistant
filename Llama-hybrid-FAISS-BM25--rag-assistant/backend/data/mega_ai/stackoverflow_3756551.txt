If the one phone uses the app from two different networks, it still counts as one user. It would seem the iOS Analytics SDK just sends a cookie (not actually stored in [NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] ) with the request to identify that it's the same person. edit: Turns out this is wrong. Our google analytics profile has twice as many "absolute unique visitors" as we have devices. We haven't released the tracked version yet. edit2: It appears that when you delete the app, then reinstall it, Analytics will count two absolute unique visitors. When you simply install a new version over an old one however, Analytics will only count one absolute unique visitor.
