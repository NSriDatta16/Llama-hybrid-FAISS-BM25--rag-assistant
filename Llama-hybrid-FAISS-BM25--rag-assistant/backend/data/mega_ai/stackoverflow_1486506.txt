Here's my random selection of suggestions: make it bigger, this allows a more structured grouping by reducing the space constraint on each group add some structure by grouping options that the user might want to combine at the same time add meaningful headers (might require the previous item). "special", "running options", "retrieval options" don't really convey any useful information. make sure that only options that can be combines randomly are checkboxes (for example are "no info", "all info", "some info" really completely independent options? Same for "append to logfile", "overwrite logfile"). use appropriate controls (spinner for number entry, file selection dialog for files, radio buttons for mutually exclusive items, ...) deactivate controls that make no sense with current configuration (for example custom directory text field). move all actions to a single place hide the scrollbars unless they are actually needed (i.e. reduce visual clutter) be more consistent (why is it "running options " and "retrieval options " but not "special options "?)
