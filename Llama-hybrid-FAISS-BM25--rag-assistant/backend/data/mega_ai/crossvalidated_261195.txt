You are clearly fine from a theoretical perspective. It is a mistaken understanding of non-stationary series that they have changing means. They have no mean. The sample average is a random number because it converges to no point and so appears to change. This is also no problem for logit or probit. Statistical models are mappings and there is no reason one cannot wrap an unbound series into a bounded series. For example, the real number line is normally thought of as having no length at all, but wrap it around a circle with the south pole being 0 and the north pole being $\infty$ and for a unit circle, the entire number line now has length $\pi$. By mapping a non-stationary series to a well bounded set, you have created a well bounded problem as the ultimate solution has to map to the interval [0,1]. All accounting ratios must lack a variance and all financial returns must lack a variance. See the paper at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2828744 You do not need to intrinsically worry about robust errors. It is a misunderstanding of non-stationary series that they are heteroskedastic. They are not; they are askedastic because they have no mean to form a variance about in the first place, so it is again a random number. The error terms structure has more to do with the model that maps than the lack of stationarity. Where you could face a problem is with the concept of covariance. The distribution of equity returns is from a distribution that lacks a covariance matrix. It isn't that stocks cannot comove, but they cannot covary. The same thing is true for economies. It is a more complex concept than covariance which is a simple relationship. You will want to read the paper above and think through your model relationships carefully.
