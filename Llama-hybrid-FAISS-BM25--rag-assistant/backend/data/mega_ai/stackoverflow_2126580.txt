convert.php does not run in a screen session

I am trying to convert a big forum. At the moment I have to do this via ssh and start convert.php with "php5 -f convert.php -- $OPTIONS". But my internet connection is a bit buggy and so it is often killed. If i start the above working command in a screen session it does not work. Instead php gives me the HTML code of the "convert.php" back. head of the page: X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.12 Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=6bc4370b2d8d40ff8c3ab23672ff4135; path=/ Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-type: text/html Does it has something to do with the Sessions? But why does it work on the same ssh-connection without screen?
