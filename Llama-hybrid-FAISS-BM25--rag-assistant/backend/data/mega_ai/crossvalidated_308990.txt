Test set, and assessment of algorithm

I have a very basic machine learning question (or maybe not so basic). Suppose we have a training set, and a test set (im leaving out validation set here). We have some parameter vector that we found from the training set - say $\mathbf{w}$. We can assess the accuracy (or misclassification rate) of this parameter vector on the test set. Is it different if we assess the COST FUNCTION on the TEST set (using parameter vector that we estimated from the training set)? How will it reflect the quality of the classifier (in comparison to accuracy, for example)?
