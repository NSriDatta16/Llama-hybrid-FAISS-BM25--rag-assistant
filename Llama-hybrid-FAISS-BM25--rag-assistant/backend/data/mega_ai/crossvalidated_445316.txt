How much linguistics knowledge does one need to study Natural language processing?

I've read some NYU articles on NLP and they seem to require knowledge of syntax, semantics, sentence diagramming that I instinctively know but don't actually know. Does one actually need to have some knowledge on linguistics to study NLP and apply machine learning techniques to NLP? If so, what are some readings/references one can read to learn enough linguistics to do NLP? Obviously if the text is in Latin, I need to know Latin to do NLP on it, but let's just talk about English.
