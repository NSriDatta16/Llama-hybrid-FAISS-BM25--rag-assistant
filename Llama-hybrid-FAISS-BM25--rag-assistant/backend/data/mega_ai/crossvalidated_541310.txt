The one-sample t-Test/z-test and inference validity

The CLT tells us that as we collect the means of different samples, the sampling distribution resembles a normal distribution and this way we can infer with a CI on the sampling distribution, the population mean. Now, this can be done via bootstrapping or manual sampling, in both cases the inference is totally valid. Now, the one-sample t-test also allows you to infer on the population mean with a confidence interval, but how is it valid if it doesn't sample with replacement (bootstrapping) or with manual sampling; meaning; how is the t-test able to infer without incurring in the required additional sampling process that the CLT needs, stated in the previous paragraph? The same question applies to a proportion z-test on categorical data.
