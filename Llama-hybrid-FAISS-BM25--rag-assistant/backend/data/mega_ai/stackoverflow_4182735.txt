HTML is a well-established way to describe structured text, in a plain-text format(!). Markdown (as you mentioned) would work as well. My view is that your best bet is probably going to be using some sort of plain-text markup such as those choices, and place your text in a single JSON string variable. Depending on your application, it may make sense to have an array of sections, containing an array of paragraphs, containing an array of normal/bold/list sections etc. However, in the general case I think good old-fashioned blocks are markup will ironically be cleaner and more scalable, due to the ease of passing them around, and the well-developed libraries for full-blown parsing if/when required.
