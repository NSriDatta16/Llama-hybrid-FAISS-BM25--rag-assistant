gnuplot: x11 terminal in "interactive mode" while calling gnuplot from shell

I want to call gnuplot with a shell command, all the commands are stored in, let's say, "load.gp". If I start the gnuplot shell and type "load 'load.gp'" I can change the viewpoint by dragging the splot with the mouse around. The Problem is, I can't figure out how to reach that without being in the gnuplot shell. echo "load 'load.gp'" | gnuplot -persist or gnuplot -persist 'load.gp' won't work. Can somebody help me? Thanks, Jan
