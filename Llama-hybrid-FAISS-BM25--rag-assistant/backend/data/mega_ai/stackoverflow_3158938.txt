Magento migration to local environment

I'm trying to duplicate my live Magento install by bringing everything over to my local environment to get SVN going (as answered in related questions, thank you very much to all that contributed). Here's the steps I followed: Backup the site through cPanel and downloaded to local Untarred the homedirectory and brought into htdocs Imported the database SQL from the backup to a DB with same name Changed base URLs for all sites in the database Changed local.xml to reflect the new user/pw because of MAMP Now, when I open the directory, nothing is loading - no errors or anything. I checked permissions and made sure my other directories were functioning, which they were. This is a 1.3 install, and I attempted to upgrade to 1.4 but ran into a ton of problems - that will have to be a future endeavor. Any ideas?
