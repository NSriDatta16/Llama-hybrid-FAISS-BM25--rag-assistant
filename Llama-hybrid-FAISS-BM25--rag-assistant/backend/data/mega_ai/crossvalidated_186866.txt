Meaning of 'compute' in the following statement

I am reading the following statement from a paper on the algorithms of inverse reinforcement learning: 'Using the RL Algorithm, compute the optimal policy $\pi$ for the MDP using the rewards $R = w^T\phi$.' I am not sure what this statement means. What is the expected output of this statement? If I want to compute the optimal policy, especially in a situation when I have infinite state space, how will this possibly turn out?
