I think I'll do it like this: A 8 character text id can store a number up to 64^8 = 2^48. I will then use two columns: ID, INT 2^32 auto-increment Rand, INT 2^16 Then, when I add a row, I will generate a random 2^16 integer and put it in a new row. The text id is then simply generated from from the two numbers combined. And retrieval is easy two - just splitting it up and a simple lookup in the database. Ridiculous simple solution which should eliminate row clashes and be random enough (2^16) to reduce guesses. Feedback on this approach will be appreciated.
