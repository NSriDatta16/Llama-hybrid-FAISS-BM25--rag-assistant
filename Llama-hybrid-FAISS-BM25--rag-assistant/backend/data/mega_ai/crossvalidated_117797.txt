It sounds like you want a linear regression with one outcome ( Fixation ) and three predictors: Word , IsKnown , and Participant . In other words, you will attempt to explain the fixation length as the sum of those three factors, and you'll see whether the IsKnown effect is statistically significant. As others have pointed out, because Fixation is continuous, you'll want a linear regression. Logistic regression is appropriate for dichotomous outcomes. To run through the regression explicitly, here's a fake data set I just made up: And here's how you'd build that model in Wizard: And what the results should look like: Here you can see that the p-value for [IsKnown = Yes] is quite small, and would conclude that there is a statistically significant negative effect. (According to the model, knowing the word on average results in a fixation duration of 0.791 seconds less than not knowing the word. Also participant D is a very fast reader compared to the others!)
