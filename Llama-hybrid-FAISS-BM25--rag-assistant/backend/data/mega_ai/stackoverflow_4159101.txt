When you add newUnit to list2 , you're adding the same instance of storageUnit 5 times. This means if you change one, you'll change the rest. You need to declare a new storage unit every time you add to list2 . ArrayList list1 = new ArrayList (); ArrayList list2 = new ArrayList (); for (int i = 0; i wordTable = new Hashtable (); };
