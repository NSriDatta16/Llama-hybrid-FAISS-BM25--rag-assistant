Can I use SVM classification probability for ranking?

I have used SVM for finding relevant results, denoting relevant results by class 1 and irrelevant results as class 0. SVM gives a probability of the label assigned. Can I rank the results of class 1, by that probability to state that more relevant results are above the lesser relevant results?
