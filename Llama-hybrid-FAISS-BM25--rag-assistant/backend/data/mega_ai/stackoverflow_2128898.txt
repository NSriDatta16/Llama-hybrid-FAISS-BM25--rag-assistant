Use: SELECT m.id AS x, t.id 'y' FROM MEMBERS m JOIN THREADS t ON t.id = m.author AND t.type = '0' AND t.category = '1' Column aliases are defined on a column by column basis - you can't use wildcards/etc. You can use the AS keyword, or simply enclose the column alias within single quotes if the column name doesn't contain special characters - use double quotes if it does. You can combine single/double quote usage with the AS keyword. Do I have to List all the Columns? Yes, you have to list all the columns unless you like duplicate columns because you choose to use m.* or t.* . There is no convention in SQL that supports what you ask. SELECT * is not an ideal practice - read this answer for details beyond this situation why . Addendum I took the liberty of rewriting your query to use ANSI-92 JOIN syntax - your example used ANSI-89. There's no performance difference.
