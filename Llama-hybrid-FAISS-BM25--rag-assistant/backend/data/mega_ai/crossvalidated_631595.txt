You can use the IOTT. That's the interocular trauma test. It hits you between the eyes. As Stephen and Tim point out, there's no minimum sample size for a t-test (or some others) to be valid. But will it be useful? Let's compare professional basketball players to the general population. According to lines.com, the average NBA player is 6'6". I couldn't find the SD, but I guessed it at 4 inches. The average American man is about 5'10" and I used the same SD. set.seed(1234) #Set a seed BB And the difference is not statistically significant (t = 2.19, df = 4, p = 0.10). Now, maybe the SD is actually smaller, but still, if you can't tell basketball players from the average adult man ... You can't tell much. And the nonparametric tests generally have less power.
