Flash Game 'falling' movieclips

I'm gonna make a small Flash game where movieclips go downwards. Very easy to make of course but I want to make a static level. I want to draw this level in Adobe Flash CS4 (drag movieclips in a big movieclip for example). So in the game I'm planning to lower this big movieclip couple of pixels per frame. But this movieclip needs to have a length of like 50.000 pixels of course. So I wonder, how would you guys make this feature of the game.
