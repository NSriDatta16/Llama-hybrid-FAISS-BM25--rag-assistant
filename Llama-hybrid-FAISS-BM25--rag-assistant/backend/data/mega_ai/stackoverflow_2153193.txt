save on cost when using Amazon EBS

Seeing that Amazon has priced the usage of EBS as: $0.10 per GB-month of provisioned storage; $0.10 per 1 million I/O requests Even though the value is in millions, I/O request add up pretty quickly ... I was wondering if there are any best practices for reducing I/O requests out there. E.g. Use an instance with more than enough RAM required for your app.. Tweak some OS level parameters.. dont do a 'sync' every couple of minutes :) .... etc.
