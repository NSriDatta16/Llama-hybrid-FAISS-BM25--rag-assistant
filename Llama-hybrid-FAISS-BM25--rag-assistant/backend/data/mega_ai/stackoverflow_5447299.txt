The problem is probably in your database.yml , I'd guess that it looks something like this: development: adapter: sqlite3 but you want it to look more like this: development: adapter: postgresql You'll probably want to apply the same change to the test: and production: sections as well; Heroku won't pay attention to the adapter but consistency is a good idea. As far as the second question goes, I think you're better off developing and deploying on identical platforms. You can usually get away with developing on OSX or Windows but deploying on Linux if you're careful but you should have the same gem versions, same Ruby version, same Rails version, same database (including the version!), etc. Anything else is going to cause you a lot of pain and suffering sooner or later. So, kudos for developing on PostgreSQL when you're deploying on Heroku, good call.
