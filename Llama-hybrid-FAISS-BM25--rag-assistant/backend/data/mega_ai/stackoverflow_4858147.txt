If the node name ( box ) doesn't change, you could use xpath : $xml = simplexml_load_file('test.xml'); $arr = (array) $xml -> xpath('box'); ...But because each box has an id , this led to a kind of madness: $final = array(); foreach ($arr as $box) { $box = (array) $box; unset($box['@attributes']); $final[] = $box; } I was going to look for a better way, but I began seeing a floating dagger so I gave up. As is, you just need to json_encode the $final array. Godspeed.
