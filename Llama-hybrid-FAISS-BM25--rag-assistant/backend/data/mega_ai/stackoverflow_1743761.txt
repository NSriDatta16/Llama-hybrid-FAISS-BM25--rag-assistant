This is a toughie. I've had reasonable results with the following low effort plan. (This is Winform oriented, btw) The biggest issue is with resolutions that are smaller than expected. Therefore create your screens as small as possible and pay particular attention to your anchor and docking settings. When displaying each form set it to full screen and the anchoring properties should do a reasonable job of displaying things in a sane way. This only starts to look silly if the resolution is MUCH larger than anticipated. Note you can find the screen size of the current platform via the Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds call.
