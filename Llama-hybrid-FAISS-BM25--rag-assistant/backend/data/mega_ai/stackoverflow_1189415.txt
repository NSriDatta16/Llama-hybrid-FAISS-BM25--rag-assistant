I've not really experimented with print stylesheets yet, having not had the necessity nor curiosity enough. However, looking at the W3C's page on paged media , reveals that page breaks may have to be explicitly stated or allowed: This section describes page breaks in CSS 2.1. Five properties indicate where the user agent may or should break pages... Taken from: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/page.html#page-break-props , 2009-07-27, 18:13 So it may be worth adding in the page breaks, or disallowing the page-break between the testimonials and the logo, by adding: #leftcol { page-break-inside: auto; /* although this may be the default value, anyway */ } I think I remember Eric Meyer having issues with this sort of thing because of the 'float' property; but since you've already stated float: none!important; I guess you've dealt with that.
