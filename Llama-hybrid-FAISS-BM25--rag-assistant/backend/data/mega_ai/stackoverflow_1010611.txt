maven cobertura generated-classes

I'm using the maven cobertura plugin to generate coverage reports, but for some reason, the instrument goal gets stuck in an infinite loop. In my classes directory (named bin), an infinite loop occurs and creates directories named generated-classes/cobertura/generated-classes/cobertura ...and on and on as long as I let the instrument goal run. Inside each of the cobertura directories are my instrumented classes. Any idea why this might occur?
