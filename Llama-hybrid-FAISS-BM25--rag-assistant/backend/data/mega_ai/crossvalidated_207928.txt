Standard data set for testing and comparing forecasting algorithms

What standard data sets are used for testing, evaluating and comparing forecasting algorithms? For example, if you're reviewing a paper that describes a new forecasting algorithm, what data set would you expect results for? For example, there's the Iris Flower database for clustering, and the MNIST data set for handwriting recognition. Would Rob Hyndman's Time Series Data Library ( https://datamarket.com/data/list/?q=provider:tsdl ) be a good choice? I know that questions of the form "Where can I find data that fits these criteria" are off-topic here and that a similar question ( Data set for forecasting ) has been closed. But it seems that questions about the "gold standard data set" for a particular purpose are allowed (e.g., Require gold standard data for face recognition ).
