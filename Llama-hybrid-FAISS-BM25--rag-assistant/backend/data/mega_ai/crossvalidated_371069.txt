Real world stat practice

I've been taking courses in Applied Statistics and through the homework problems I get to practice what I've learned. But, I find that the practice problems are always a bit contrived to fit within the context of the chapter and often not reflective or real life problems. In an effort to get more practice and especially in real world situations, I would like to find examples that I can consider how to approach. Of course, it would be nice if there was an actual approach that was taken, to help gauge my understanding. Cross Validated is extremely helpful, but the questions aren't really geared toward practice of the technique, or discovering the right technique for the problem. Kaggle is also great, but those are usually much more complicated. Any other ideas where I might find such practice sets with actual solutions? EDIT: Trying to add a bit more color... As I've taken classes, I find myself doing very well on homework and exams, which is great, but what is lacking is a real world perspective. Obviously the problems on homework and exams are specifically geared toward the particular techniques we have just studied, so I feel that I lack that organic problem solving ability that can likely only come through experience. Ideally, I would like to find examples of real world statistical problems along with the approaches that people have taken to those problems. Something akin to the problems in the chapters of a statistics textbook, but real problems with the real approaches that were taken. The intent would be to gain a better understanding of the types of problems statisticians/machine learning engineers are faced with and how they approach those problems.
