An important point to know is that there is a difference between a CRM deployment, and the organizations deployed. The deployment consist of one or more CRM Server, and a SQL Server that can be clustered. A different server can be used as ReportServer and an Exchange Server can be configured as the email router. Once the servers are deployed, one or many organizations can be configured using the CRM Deployment manager, on one of the front-end CRM Server. All the front-end (load balanced) server can be used to access any organizations configured in the deployment, based on the current user's credentials. When configuring the organization, the Report Server that should be used is assigned to the organization. Also, if you are using IFD (Internet Facing Deployment), every organizations should have their own DNS entry (orgId.theprefixchoosen.mydomain.intra) that is pointing to the load balancer's IP address, so that CRM can route the users to the appropriate organization. More can be found in Microsoft's documents on configuring IFD.
