Best neural network architecture for object detection without location

I want to build a model which is able to detect the presence of a specific object in the image without caring about the location (i.e. no bounding boxes, just 0/1 output). More specifically, the object is always the same and it is characterized by a specific pattern (e.g. a national flag or a bar code). The algorithm should be robust to scale, rotation and distortion. What is the best architecture in this case? Is there something better than a generic CNN binary classifier?
