problem passing listener class to a function

I'm using a library that manipulates a binary search tree. In this library is a function that traverses the tree and passes each node it finds to a callback class: bool TCODBsp::traverseInvertedLevelOrder(ITCODBspCallback *callback, void *userData) ITCODBspCallback is a base class in the library from which the user is supposed to derive his own callback class to pass to the function. Here is the base class: class ITCODBspCallback { public : virtual bool visitNode(TCODBsp *node, void *userData) = 0; }; Here's my derived class: class MyCallback: public ITCODBspCallback { public: virtual bool visitNode(TCODBsp*, void*); // defined in my implementation file }; I then pass MyCallback to the function like this: bsp->traverseInvertedLevelOrder(new MyCallback(), NULL); and g++ gives me the following errors: expected type-specifier before 'MyCallback' expected ')' before 'MyCallback' no matching function for call to 'TCODBsp::traverseInvertedLevelOrder(int*, NULL)' note: candidates are: bool TCODBsp::traverseInvertedLevelOrder(ITCODBspCallback*, void*) Anyone know what's wrong? I'm curious why it thinks MyCallback is an int* , in particular.
