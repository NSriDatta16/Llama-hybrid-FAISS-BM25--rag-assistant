Have you considered using Gravatar (like stackoverflow does) to store user images? It seems to be a cool idea! If you are interested visit www.gravatar.com. Gravatar stands for globally recognized avatars. I would suggest storing user information and images in separate tables. The choice is obvious as there is a one to many relationship between user and images. You can, however, use a variation to improve performance and avoid joins everytime you need to display user data. User(userID, loginName, loginPwd) UserImages(imageID, userID, image,type) The image attribute of UserImages will be a binary object storing the full image or the url to a location on the file system. In the second case, you need code to fetch the image (if required). The type attribute takes on values 'primary profile', 'primary avatar','other profiles' If the number of images is expected to be very large, you could modify the design as follows User(userID, loginName, loginPwd, profileImageID, profileImage) UserImages(imageID, userID, image,type) SQL to populate the profileImageID and ProfileImage Update User T1 set (profileImageID, profileImage) = (Select imageID, image from UserImages T2 where T1.userID = T2.userID and T2.type='primary profile' ) It may look like redundant data storage in the users table. This idea is sometimes used to improve performance by avoiding joins. Also, you need to make sure no direct inserts can happen on the Users table for profileImageID and profileImage column by making profileImageID a FK to userImages table. This would still lead to profileImage open to malicious updates. You need special code to handle that. You need to do all this if you expect to be the next Internet sensation! All the best and lets hope you do become one!
