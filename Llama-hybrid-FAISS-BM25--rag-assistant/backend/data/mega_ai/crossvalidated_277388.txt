Publication bias and proportional data in metafor

I have been recommended to use rma.glmm for an analysis of proportions and I am in need of publication bias tests. Are any possible in metafor given proportional data, please? The analysis is using the "PLO" effect size which is a mixed-effects logistic regression (according to the manual). How does the rma.glmm approach differ from the rma function in this instance? Both appear to be mixed-effects regression. Can a glmm analysis be translated into rma by first calculating the logit and SE and then the publication bias estimates run?
