Lots of good answers here. This is a design issue where pragmatism has taken precedence over following "rules". In this case, there are some conflicting "rules": avoid using special values as return data (not self-documenting, requires developer to handle special value in a distinct way from other code) vs. don't throw exceptions during routine execution of code, only when something unexpected happens I agree with this design decision. If you do not, however, you can always write your own code to check for the existence of a string before checking its index. Do not be a prisoner of your language, bend it to your will. Languages are meant to be tortured!
