In Flash, you can click the [Embed...] button below the TextField's character properties. In the window that you get then, you can specify which characters you want embedded in your textfield. There's a lot more to say about font embedding but this is the simple story. Flash CS5 added TLF TextFields but I don't think you were referring to those, right? The autoSize property really has nothing to do with font embedding but I guess your TextField is not Dynamic when you cannot auto resize it? Are you using CS5 or CS4 or earlier by the way?
