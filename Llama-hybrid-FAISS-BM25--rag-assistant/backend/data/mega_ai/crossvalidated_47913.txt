Pandas / Statsmodel / Scikit-learn

Are Pandas, Statsmodels and Scikit-learn different implementations of machine learning/statistical operations, or are these complementary to one another? Which of these has the most comprehensive functionality? Which one is actively developed and/or supported? I have to implement logistic regression. Any suggestions as to which of these I should use?
