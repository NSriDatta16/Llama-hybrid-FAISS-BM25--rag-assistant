After running this through IE8's debugger (Press F12, it's actually a nice tool), I found the problem: IE8 is not treating your strings as an array of characters. You're storing puzzle (and solution, among other things) as a string. In chrome/firefox, solution[2] will return the 3rd character in that string. However, in IE8, it returns undefined. The workaround is to use solution.charAt(2); I also took the liberty of removing setAttribute calls and instead I'm setting the properties directly. You can find the fixed code here (which works in IE8): http://pastebin.org/51648
