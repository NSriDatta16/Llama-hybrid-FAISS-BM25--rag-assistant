Seeing as you want this for shipping you might want to ask whoever handles your shipping whether they have some sort of API so you can build/buy/download an appropriate shipping module and spare yourself the hassle of mucking about with CSV files. If you really want a CSV file however I can show you how to create it. You didn't mention where this script will run so I'll assume it's an external script (which will make it easier to use with a cron job). You want to do the following: //External script - Load magento framework require_once("C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\htdocs\magento\app\Mage.php"); Mage::app('default'); $myOrder=Mage::getModel('sales/order'); $orders=Mage::getModel('sales/mysql4_order_collection'); //Optional filters you might want to use - more available operations in method _getConditionSql in Varien_Data_Collection_Db. $orders->addFieldToFilter('total_paid',Array('gt'=>0)); //Amount paid larger than 0 $orders->addFieldToFilter('status',Array('eq'=>"processing")); //Status is "processing" $allIds=$orders->getAllIds(); foreach($allIds as $thisId) { $myOrder->reset()->load($thisId); //echo " "; //print_r($myOrder); //echo " "; //Some random fields echo "'" . $myOrder->getBillingAddress()->getLastname() . "',"; echo "'" . $myOrder->getTotal_paid() . "',"; echo "'" . $myOrder->getShippingAddress()->getTelephone() . "',"; echo "'" . $myOrder->getPayment()->getCc_type() . "',"; echo "'" . $myOrder->getStatus() . "',"; echo "\r\n"; } For the sake of brevity (and sanity) I haven't listed all the available order information. You can find out what fields are available by dumping the relevant objects and taking a look at their fields. For example if you were to do print_r($myOrder->getBillingAddress()); you'd see fields like "address_type" and "lastname". You can use these with $myOrder->getBillingAddress()->getAddress_type() and $myOrder->getBillingAddress()->getLastname() respectively. Edit : Changed code according to craig.michael.morris's answer
