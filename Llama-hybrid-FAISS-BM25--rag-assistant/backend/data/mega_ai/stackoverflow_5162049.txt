Linq 0..1-one association

Hi I have a big problem with Linq. I have to do a 0. .1-to-one association within this two classes: [Table(Name = "TB_Points")] public class Point { private int _ID = 0; [Column(Storage = "_ID", DbType = "Int NOT NULL IDENTITY", IsPrimaryKey = true, IsDbGenerated = true)] public int ID { get { return this._ID; } } } [Table(Name = "TB_TimePoint")] public class TimePoint { private int _ID = 0; [Column(Storage = "_ID", DbType = "Int NOT NULL IDENTITY", IsPrimaryKey = true, IsDbGenerated = true)] public int ID { get { return this._ID; } } //here is the association public Point Pos { get; set; } } The Point is a my general class so some times a Point can exists without the TimePoint, so there is null in the association. And I don't need to know about the TimePoint from the Point class. All my attempts failed. I don't know whether the problem is in IsDbGenerated = true or in other stuff. Please help. Thx
