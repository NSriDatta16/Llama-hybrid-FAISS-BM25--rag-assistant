Use XHTML Fails fast . If there are any inconsistencies they will be found during validation. It encourages better design by separating semantic markup from presentation etc. It's structured which means that you can treat it as a data object and run all sorts of queries against it. For example you could find all addresses or citations within your website. You can do build-time optimizations . Since it's well-formed XML you can easily do find/replace operations during build time. Or any document management and manipulation. You can write XSLT or other transformation scripts to programatically transform your XHTML for other platforms. For example you could have an XSLT for the iPhone that would transform all XHTML to make it compatible or more user-friendly for the iPhone You are future proofing yourself. Transforming XHTML to newer semantics is again, very easy using transformation. Search engines will continue to evolve to gather more semantic information as part of the programmable web . DOM operations are more reliable since it's structured. From an algorithmic perspective, it yields easier and faster parsing .
