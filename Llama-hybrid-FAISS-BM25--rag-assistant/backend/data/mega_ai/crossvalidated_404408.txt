How to fix this error p<0! while optimizing SVM using PSO?

I am trying to optimize SVM paramters for a regression problem using PSO in R. I am getting this weird error. Any suggestion on how to fix this error would be greatly appreciated. Error in svm.default(x, y, scale = scale, ..., na.action = na.action) : p I am using e1071 and psoptim packages in R to optimize gamma, cost and epsilon parameters. I am not sure what p data $y1,scale=F, type= "eps-regression",kernel="radial",cost = V1,epsilon= V2,gamma= V3) error y1- svm.model$fitted return (rmse(error)) } B3 Also any suggestion on how to get the optimized values of gamma, cost and epsilon parameters after optimization would be greatly helpful
