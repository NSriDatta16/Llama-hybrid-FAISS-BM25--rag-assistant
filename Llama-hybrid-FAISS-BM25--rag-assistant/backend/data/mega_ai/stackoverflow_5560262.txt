to what degree is it worth sacrificing maintainability/flexibility for performance? I think it's very important to write clear maintanable code as a first priority. Until your code not only indicates that it is a bottleneck, but that your application performance also suffers from it, you should always consider clear code to be the best code. It's also important to not reinvent the wheel. The comment on taking a look at another parser is a very good one. There often found common solutions for writing routines such as this. Recusion is very elegant when applied to something applicible. In my own experiance slow code due to recursion is an exception, not the norm.
