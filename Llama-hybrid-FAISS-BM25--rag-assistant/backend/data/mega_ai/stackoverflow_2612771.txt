A table need not have a primary key. There is no effect on the database whatsoever for a table to have no explicit keys because every row in the database has an implicit unique data point that Oracle uses for storage and certain internal references. That is the ROWID pseudocolumn. ROWID is a piece of data that uniquely identifies every row in a database--with some notable exceptions. The following query on my database returns the data shown: select rowid from user$ where rownum It is not strictly necessary to have a key on a table. The Oracle10g database that I just queried has 569 system tables that have no primary or unique keys. It is a decision for the DBA and developer how keys should be created on database tables. The developers on my project always create primary keys regardless of their usefulness or sanity. As a DBA, I create keys only where they make sense. Kind regards, Opus
