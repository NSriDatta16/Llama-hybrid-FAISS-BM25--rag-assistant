My company is using DevExpress and we are very satisfied with their suite. We have never used the Infragistics suite, so I can't talk about the process to switch from Infragistics to DevExpress. Generally, I find the DevExpress controls very easy to use and implement in our applications. Some controls have a small learning curve like the DevExpress TreeList but it is not a huge issue. One thing I dont like with some of their controls is the property "Properties". This property is used to set additional options to the control. Per example to set the max length of a textedit (textbox of devexpress) : textEdit.Properties.MaxLength instead of textEdit.MaxLength So, their controls are great and have a great look but I think the main quality of DevExpress is their support. You can ask a question on the support page and you will receive a answer within one day, maybe two days if the question is complex. So, if you are not statisfied with Infragistics, try DevExpress. You can download a trial version so you have nothing to lose.
