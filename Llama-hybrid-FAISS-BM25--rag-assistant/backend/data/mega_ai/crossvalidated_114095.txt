data retrieval vs modeling

i don't have a specific mathematical setting for this question. it's rather high level. if you have a bunch of data X for a variable that we want to predict Y, and all we care about is predicting within the range of observed values, is there utility in finding a model? why can't we just put a probability (distribution) for Y given some data X?
