To elaborate more about the virtual memory: Your application fails when it tries to allocate a single 90MB array, and there is no contiguous space of virtual memory where this can fit left. You might be able to get a little farther if you switched to data structures that use less memory -- perhaps some class that approximates a huge array by using a tree where all data is kept in 1MB (or so) leaf nodes. Also, under c++ when doing a huge amount of allocations, it really helps if all those big allocations are of same size, this helps reusing memory and keeps fragmentation much lower. However, the correct thing to do in the long run is simply to switch to a 64-bit system.
