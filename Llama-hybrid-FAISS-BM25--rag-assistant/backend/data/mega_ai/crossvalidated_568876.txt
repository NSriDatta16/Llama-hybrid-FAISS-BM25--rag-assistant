Inverse Propensity Score Weighting vs. Double Machine Learning

I am familiar with Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW) for the estimation of causal effects, and recently, I came across the 2016 paper by Chernozhukov et al. on Double/Debiased Machine Learning. From what I can see, both DML and IPW make similar assumptions over the causal structural equations: is there any reason why I would choose one approach over the other when estimating the ATE or CATE?
