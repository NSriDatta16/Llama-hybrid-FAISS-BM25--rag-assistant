Interrupted Time Series Design with multiple groups

More of a conceptual question The standard ITS design is pretty simple, regress: Y ~ Time + Treatment_Dummy + Time_Since_Treatment However, what if the scenario was that there's multiple employees with sales data over time and we are looking to ascertain the effect of a certain training T on sales? Employees could take treatment T at different times and there could be 100 employees - each one could become an individual ITS analysis. Is there a way to modify ITS such that it could account for this?
