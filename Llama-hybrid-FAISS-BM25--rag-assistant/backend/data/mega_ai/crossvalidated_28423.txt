The United States government does not track "family" income, per se. Rather, the measurement is referred to as "household" income, and it includes the incomes of all individuals in the household over the age of 18. These data are primarily collected by the Census Bureau . Marco makes an important point, namely, that "family" size includes children. Therefore multiplying the average monthly income per person in the United States (or any other country) by four would not provide an accurate estimate of median household income. This would also ignore the fact that men are paid more than women. The Census Bureau also takes race, size of household, and geographic location into account when computing their estimates.
