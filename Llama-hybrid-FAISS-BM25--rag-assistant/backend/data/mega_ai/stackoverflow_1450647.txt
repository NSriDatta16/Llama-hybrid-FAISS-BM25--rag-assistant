Today's wisdom says "Release, release, release". I think it was Dharmesh Shah ( www.onstartups.com ) who said "If you're not embarrassed by your software, you waited too long to release it!". Get it out there, get people using it and get people talking about it. You'll get invaluable feedback (especially if you can charge for it). Also, write a blog from day one so that you can interact with your users. Years ago it used to be a case that we'd hold off because we weren't sure if we could overcome the technicalities and we wanted to do the hard bits to discourage anyone following us. Today it is much better to get an understanding of whether people will actually use your software as soon as possible. You could end up saving yourself a lot of time and money.
