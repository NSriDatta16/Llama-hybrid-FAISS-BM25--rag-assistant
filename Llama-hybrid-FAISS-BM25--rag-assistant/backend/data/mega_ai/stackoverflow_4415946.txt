You need to move the radio button outside of the parent DIV. I think you want something like this: Foo Other options are @AgentConundrum's display:none solution (which won't let you click the button, and will collapse the space) or use visibility:hidden (which still won't let you click the button, but will leave the empty space where the button used to be). If you're trying to replace the appearance of the radio button, there are a lot of quick solutions to this but they use Javascript. While I'm talking about Javascript, you can also not have a radio button and just click on your div, which can be coded to act as a radio button. In general, it's probably not good design to hide form elements that do something, since you'll have to work around the interaction with them anyway every time you want to use them. Just omit them completely and use Javascript, or evolve your design to incorporate them.
