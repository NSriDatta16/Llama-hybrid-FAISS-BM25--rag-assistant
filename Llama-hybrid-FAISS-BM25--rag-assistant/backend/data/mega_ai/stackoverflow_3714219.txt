Rails doesn't have many OS level deadlock concerns since Ruby 1.8 is single threaded, and even in 1.9 is locked The concerns are mainly in the database. Rails has a double whammy where ActiveRecord abstracts from the database AND stuff like FKs and constraints are pushed into application level validations (before_save, validates_*, etc) and the result discourages developers from thinking about DB deadlock situations. If you're using MYSQl, you can read about problem areas with innodb (default in Rails) here http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/innodb-transaction-model.html
