Reverse massive text file in Java

What would be the best approach to reverse a large text file that is uploaded asynchronously to a servlet that reverses this file in a scalable and efficient way? text file can be massive (gigabytes long) can assume mulitple server/clustered environment to do this in a distributed manner. open source libraries are encouraged to consider I was thinking of using Java NIO to treat file as an array on disk (so that I don't have to treat the file as a string buffer in memory). Also, I am thinking of using MapReduce to break up the file and process it in separate machines.
