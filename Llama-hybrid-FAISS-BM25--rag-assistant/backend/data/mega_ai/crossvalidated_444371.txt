Model selection with low N?

I've got a study which is kinda messed up by the design...Turns out I ended up with about 50 patients of which 80% have the outcome and 20% don't (binary outcome). I've been turning in my bed for the last month trying to figure out what to do with this. The only real answer is "don't" but I have to deliver something in the next days as it's part of a master's thesis. I have about 10 predictors of interest for the outcome (various variable types) and the research question is whether any of these predictors can predict the outcome. Some already have an established correlation in the literature while some are original hypothesis. Several are significant with a univariate logistic regression, but it doesn't look good in any other way than the actual p-value. Now obviously I'm not going to be able to answer this research question sufficiently but if you were in my shoes, what sort of statistical analysis would you perform to relay to your supervisors?
