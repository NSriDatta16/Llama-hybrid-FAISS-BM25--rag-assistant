Warning: Partial Solution If we follow the physics as stated, there is no maximum velocity. From a purely physical viewpoint, you've fixed the acceleration at a constant value, which means the velocity is always increasing. As an alternative, consider the two forces acting on your object: The constant external force, F , that tends to accelerate it, and The force of drag, d , which is proportional to the velocity and tends to slow it down. So the velocity at iteration n becomes: v n = v 0 + n F - d v n-1 You've asked to choose the maximum velocity, v nmax , that occurs at iteration nmax . Note that the problem is under-constrained ; that is, F and d are related, so you can arbitrarily choose a value for one of them, then calculate the other. Now that the ball's rolling, is anyone willing to pick up the math? Warning: it's ugly and involves power series ! Edit: Why doe the sequence n**F** in the first equation appear literally unless there's a space after the n ?
