Probability of future independent events given past and expected distribution with board games

This question is specifically in reference to how statistics apply to Catan. For background, two fair dice are rolled and rolling a 7 is a bad event. Given that the average number of turns for a game of catan is 80 and that means CLT can be applied, does it make sense to expect a 7 more and more as time goes on? There's a similar question here ( Does 10 heads in a row increase the chance of the next toss being a tail? ) so my curiosity is based on a few assumptions. Given that the distribution of 7 is the most likely, even though each roll is independent and not based on the history of the past rolls, one should expect a 7 to appear more often in the future rolls. ex - if there are an average of 40 rolls in the game and ~6 of those rolls should be 7, if and it is currently roll 25, there are 6 7's expected in the remaining 15 turns. Thus there is a larger number of 7's to be rolled to maintain the distribution and given the limited 15 spaces, we should expect a 7 to be rolled before we eventually roll a non 7. Is this an incorrect approach and if so why? It appears that this is a weird spin on the monty hall problem with a potential combination of gambler's fallacy? As a follow up, can we used expected distribution to predict future events accurately when those events are independent?
