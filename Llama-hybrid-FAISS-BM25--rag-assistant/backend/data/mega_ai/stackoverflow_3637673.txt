Firefox Extension : Store Addon Data

I am building up a firefox extension which allows users to drag and drop things. Now if a user closes the application or reloads the page, I want to restore the last activity he did. Example : User moves a box from point X to Y. There can be many more boxes as well. Now after page reload or application startup, if user puts the addon ON, I want the box's position to be Y. So for this purpose should I be using the firefox preference thing or is there any other better way of doing it.
