Is it possible to take values of an HTML5 SessionStorage and email it?

I'm creating an application with two pages (Page One, Page Two) that have radio buttons on them. The values are stored in sessionStorage and displayed to the user on Page 3. However, I want a Submit button that will take those values in sessionStorage and email it to me (I was planning to use PHP to process and send the email). Can someone help point me in the right direction on how to solve this please?
