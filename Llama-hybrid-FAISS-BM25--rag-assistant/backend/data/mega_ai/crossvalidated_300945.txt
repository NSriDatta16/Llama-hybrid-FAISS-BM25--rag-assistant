Can Convolution Neural Network be useful with encoded categorical features?

Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has been very successful in numerical features / inputs / independent variables, such as computer vision or or audio signal. And It can be viewed as extracting the useful information in frequency domain. (See What is the intuition behind convolutional neural network? ) But would it be useful in categorical feature. For example, suppose all of our features are categorical: a person's gender, race, education level, etc., what is the convolution mean on the data matrix (one-hot encoded) like that? More background, my data are not images or audio, but more similar to UCI income data , with the increasing popularity in deep learning and CNN, I am curious if it is also useful in non-images.
