Is there a standard way to handle many different options for mouse events in java?

I'm developing a grid based sim game in java, and I was wondering if there is a standard way of doing the following. I have a panel which is the game panel, and there are many different things which could happen when the panel is clicked. For example, when building a room, there are several stages, where dragging the mouse and left clicking will have different actions. Right now, the way I have done it, is to use booleans to check what's being built, and then what stage it is at. Is there any better or standard way of handling something like this? I had a quick google, but as I have said before, people on Stack Overflow always give a better, more relevant, up to date answer. I consider myself still rather new to java. Thanks in advance.
