Summarizing Likert-type Data

I used a questionnaire with several questions on a five point scale (never, rarely, sometimes, often, always) to determine how well a person liked their job. I then assessed the average scores for each person and categorized these into 3 (low, medium and high) to assess the frequencies in each group. I did max -min/3 and split the variable into low: 1 to =2.33 to =3.67 to 5. Is this valid? I didn't want to use tertiles because I thought tertiles via proc rank in SAS will simply split the sample into 3 equal groups which is not my goal. Thanks
