Why PCA performed on two similar data sets result in different number of components?

I have two data sets (2048 dimensions) collected under slightly different circumstances. I am using PCA to reduce the dimension of the data before passing it further for classification. Both data sets are spectra of the same alloy samples collected with slightly different lasers. My problem is that of the two sets of visually similar data one requires 60 components and the other 275 given the same amount of variance retention (99.9%). I would like to ask is there some technique that would allow me to identify the source (features or combinations of thereof) of this behavior? Is there some standard method other then simply comparing the total variance?
