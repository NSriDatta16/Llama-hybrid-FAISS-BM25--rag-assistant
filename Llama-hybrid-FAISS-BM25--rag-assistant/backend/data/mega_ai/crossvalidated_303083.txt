Thanks Alex/Jakub. I was trying to interpret individual components of the 300 dim vector. while mathematically, it doesn't seem to capture any meaning. some of the components turned out to be important as per the model. on checking the important variables - it did make sense. For example, v252 (component of embedding) was capturing grocery related terms, similarly v75 was capturing adjectives like top, best,etc. Using word embedding features provided a 5% lift in accuracy compared to hand engineered features.
