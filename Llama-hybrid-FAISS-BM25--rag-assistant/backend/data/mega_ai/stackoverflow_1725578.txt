Parsing a date in Java?

I have dates in text format of the form dd-mmm-yy or d-mmm-y, where months are abbreviations in letters (for example, 4-Nov-09 or 12-Dec-05, etc...) I would like to parse it to produce a java.util.Date object. Could this be achieved by leveraging the java.text.DateFormat class? Or is there another easy way of doing this?
