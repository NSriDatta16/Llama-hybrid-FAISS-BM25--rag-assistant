You're seeing a very typical learning curve where as you add more trees to the GBM, your model is learning too much of the noise in the training set, and that doesn't help predicting the test set. In other words, your model suffers from overfitting. Pick any book/tutorial/course/blog on machine learning and you will find lots of discussion of this issue.
