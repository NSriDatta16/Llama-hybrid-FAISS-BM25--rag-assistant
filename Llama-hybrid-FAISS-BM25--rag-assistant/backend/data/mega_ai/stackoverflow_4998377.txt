RRDtool (acronym for round-robin database tool) aims to handle time-series data like network bandwidth, temperatures, CPU load etc. This time series data is then automatically compressed based on the RRA (acronym for round-robin archive) defined at the time of creation. This allows the data to be retrieved at a high rate, but the storage footprint remains the same over time. The downside to this is granularity is lost over time. See the RRDtool documentation for more details. http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/index.en.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRDtool
