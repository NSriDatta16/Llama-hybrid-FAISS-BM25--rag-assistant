Interesting idea. There is nothing wrong with using data as a random effect. However, one thing to remember about mixed models is that the random variables are assumed to be centered at zero and the lmer model will simply return you the variance of the random variable. I'm unsure if that really answers your questions. You can (and in many fields do) include variables as both fixed and random effects yielding a model like this: Marker1 ~ Age + Gender + Caucasian + API + Hispanic + Other + Date + (1 | Date) My suggestion in a case like this would be to run both models and try to see what make sense and seems sound. You may also want to look into modeling this as a time series. I will not try to give any advice on that, as I'm not an expert.
