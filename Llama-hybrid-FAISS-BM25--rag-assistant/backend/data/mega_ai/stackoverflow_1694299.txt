Combining OpenGL ES template and Utility template

I would like to have an OpenGL view with an utility application. What I do: I create an OpenGL ES application template and a Utility Application template. I copy the files EAGLView.m and h, and the five ES renderer. files from the Opengl project to the utility project. I copy these lines from the OpenGl project to the Utility project: (in utilityAppDelegate.m) - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application { ... [glView startAnimation]; } - (void) applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application { [glView stopAnimation]; } - (void) applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application { [glView startAnimation]; } - (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application { [glView stopAnimation]; } - (void)dealloc { ... [glView release]; ... } And in the utilityAppDelegate.h I add: @class EAGLView; EAGLView *glView; @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet EAGLView *glView; I go to the view's identity inspector, and change the class identity to EAGLview. I open the mainview.xib and mainwindow.xib and drag the app_delegate from the mainwindow.xib, to be able to connect the glView outlet to the view. (Don't know if this is the way to do it, but that's the only way I could connect the glView variable to the view) When I build and run, the multi colored square show up on the screen, but it does not animate! When I debug, the glView variable is 0 in applicationDidFinishLaunching, and the startAnimation is not called. I suspect this has something to to with the way the outlet is connected to the view? Probably not connected. :-) The mistake is probably obvious, but I have only been 5 weeks on this platform. What is missing? What have I done wrong? Thank you!
