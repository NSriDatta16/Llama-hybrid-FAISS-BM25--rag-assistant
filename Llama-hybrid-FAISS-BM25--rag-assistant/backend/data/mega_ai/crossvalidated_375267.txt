From comments: This is a time series and comes with all the troubles in time series. If there is a general trend of falling values from january to august, than this test will become positive, even if there is nothing special about august. Maybe there is a general trend, that each year's August has special loan defaults because some people make more money in August independent of the interest rates? t-Tests are made for independent observations and these are probably not independent observations. If you use the t-test anyways, you should at least investigate and discuss these problems. – Bernhard as @Bernhard already outlined you have to take care about time series effects. In your case there is surely seasonality. Unemployment in Central and Northern Europe is higher in winter than in summer. Therefore presumably also the default rate for credits is higher. long-time economic cycles give you a "kind of seasonality over the years". I propose you make a Unit root test between July and August in order to test whether the structure of the time series changes significantly between July and August. An ADF-Test, KPSS-Test or Philipp-Perron test might perform better than a simple t-test. – Ferdi As this is a time-series problem, you should treat it as such. You could simply use control charts (from quality control methods) here some relevant posts . Or you could treat it as a question about detecting change points in a time series .
