Is OpenCL good for agent based simulation?

I'm learning Scala with the aim of writing agent based simulations using actor concurrency. I currently know very little about OpenCL, and before I dive in can anyone tell me if it is likely to be appropriate/compatible with agent based simulations? If so, then ScalaCL looks very attractive.
