Consider a body of text containing multiple paragraphs. You want each paragraph to be separated by 2em, and you want the first paragraph to be separated from the preceding content by 2em, and the last paragraph to be separated from the following content by 2em. This is easily accomplished with the following CSS, because the top and bottom margins separating the paragraphs will collapse: p { margin-top: 2em margin-bottom: 2em; } If margins didn't collapse, this would result in the margins being separated by a space of 4em, not 2em. Without margin collapsing, the only way to achieve the desired effect would be to set up some additional rules for the first and last paragraphs, which would involve giving them a class or id (which would have to be maintained if the text was ever altered), or wrapping them in an otherwise-unnecessary extra element and using :first-child and :last-child, or... well, you get the idea. I can guarantee that, if margin collapsing didn't occur, SO would have a lot of duplicate questions asking for workarounds to achieve the consistent spacing that the above rule provides :-)
