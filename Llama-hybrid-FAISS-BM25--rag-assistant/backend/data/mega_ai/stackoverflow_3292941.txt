Just like pete said, you need to change some settings in your project file: C/C++ Compiler Version (GCC_VERSION) set to "LLVM compiler 1.5" Other C Flags (OTHER_CFLAGS) should add "-Xclang -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2" flags. Cause the project is using synthesized property that introduced in LLVM, and the GCC compiler does not support it.
