analytics in C#

I am using Microsoft Enterprise library logging in c# to log the events in SQL DB and I use this records for analytics purpose. is there any better way for analytics in c#. for example "Microsoft StreamInsight from SQL Server 2008". another way is embedding Javascript in HTML code which google analytics is using. But in this way I should send all my logging data to the logging sever in HTTP post. Thanks
