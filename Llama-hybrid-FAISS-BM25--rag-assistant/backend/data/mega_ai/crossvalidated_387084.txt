How to find the value for average rate

I'm doing some textbook problems on my own and there are no steps given to the solutions to some of the problems. If anyone could help me solve the following problem, much would be appreciated. "A liquid culture medium contains on the average m bacteria per ml. A large number of samples is taken, each of 1 ml, and bacteria are found to be present in 90% of the samples. Estimate m . The answer given: m = 2.3026 The knowledge we're supposed to use (What we have so far learned in this chapter are: Binomial, Poisson, Exponential and Normal Distributions) is a bit limited, so if it is possible to provide an explanation within those constraints, that would be ideal. Thank you in advance.
