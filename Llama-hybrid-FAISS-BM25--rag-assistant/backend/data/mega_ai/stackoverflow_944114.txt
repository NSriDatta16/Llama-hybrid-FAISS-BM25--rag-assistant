As reading on an apple forum, it's an unsolved problem in the SDK. It happens when the accelerometer delegate is not nil. Touch event objects are allocated but never freed. The faster the accelerometer delegate is called, the faster those allocation failures happen. Many of the apple sample codes show the same problem. I had the accelerometer turned on. But I also encountered, that this kind of leaks happen when a touch is tracked from one view onto another. If I keep touching one and the same view and moving my finger on that view without leaving it, I'll not get that problem. Solutions: Turn accelerometer off (delegate set to nil), reduce the amount of views in your app. I don't know if they fixed that issue in iPhone OS 3.0. Unfortunately, this will not help: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [[UIAccelerometer sharedAccelerometer] setDelegate:nil]; // because of framework bug } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [[UIAccelerometer sharedAccelerometer] setDelegate:self]; // because of framework bug } - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [[UIAccelerometer sharedAccelerometer] setDelegate:self]; // because of framework bug } More info at: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=9396584t
