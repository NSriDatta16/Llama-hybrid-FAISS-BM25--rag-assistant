What is the best tutorial to quickly learning machine learning in R

I want to learn machine learning methods, preferably high-performance methods, by R in the quickest way possible. I am totally familiar with R but very less experience with ML packages. I know some resources like books but what I intend by opening this topic is to find the quickest way possible. I also need to see some examples in the tutorial and I DO NOT need any theory .
