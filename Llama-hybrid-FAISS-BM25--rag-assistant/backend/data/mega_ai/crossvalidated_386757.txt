To create those graphs, there wouldn't be a need (nor would it be feasible) to sample at an infinite number of points. Instead, you would sample a finite number of points with fine enough resolution, and interpolate between them to draw the graph. If you look closely at the plot, you will see that the curves are actually made up of straight line segments. The mean function and kernel of the Gaussian process itself defines what distribution to sample from. For example, if we had a Gaussian process defined by $f\left(\mathbf{x}\right) \sim GP\left(m\left(\mathbf{x}\right), \kappa\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}'\right)\right)$ (using the same notation as Murphy's Machine Learning book), and wanted to sample the process at points $\mathbf{x}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{2}$ , then we would do so from the bivariate Gaussian distribution: $$\begin{bmatrix} f\left(\mathbf{x}_{1} \right) \\ f\left(\mathbf{x}_{2} \right) \end{bmatrix} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\begin{bmatrix} m\left(\mathbf{x}_{1} \right) \\ m\left(\mathbf{x}_{2} \right) \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}\kappa\left(\mathbf{x}_{1}, \mathbf{x}_{1}\right) & \kappa\left(\mathbf{x}_{1}, \mathbf{x}_{2}\right) \\ \kappa\left(\mathbf{x}_{2}, \mathbf{x}_{1}\right) & \kappa\left(\mathbf{x}_{2}, \mathbf{x}_{2}\right)\end{bmatrix}\right)$$ This can be readily extended, so that sampling any Gaussian process at a finite number of points just involves sampling from a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
