Is there a code analyzing utility that can do things like calculating the average variable length in a script or a bunch of scripts? I'd be curious to see how different frameworks or CMSs compare in that aspect. Your question isn't clear but probably you are looking for a profiler, have a look at: PHP Quick Profiler I'm just obsessed with naming conventions and the linguistic aspect of programming. You need to have a look at PHP Coding Standards actually.
