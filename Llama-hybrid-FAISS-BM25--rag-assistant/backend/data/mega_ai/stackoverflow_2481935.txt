I would be fall down shocked if there was actually any "real" difference between while and for loops. Assuming that they were doing the "exact" same thing, they should be optimized by the interpreter to be more or less identical. I would wager that the difference was probably nothing more than other processes that were vying differently for resources during the two executions. Even if there was a difference, don't get caught up in The Sad Tragedy of Micro-Optimization Theater .
