Show the a Level Label on a Org Chart Layout TreeView

I have a WPF TreeView that i have applied a Organizational Chart template. What I now need to do is find a way to add a Label that shows what Level Items are at. Example: ROOT LEVEL Parent | |-----------| CHILD LEVEL CHILD 1 CHILD 2 | |----------------| GRANDCHILD LEVEL GRANDCHILD1 GRANDCHILD2 GRANDCHILD3 I would think there is a template to edit to do this. However I can not find one. Any help will be highly appreciated.
