What architecture is your neural network? Classifying on raw pixels is hard, even for greyscale images of that size. If you're not using a Convolutional neural network or other architecture designed for image classification, the task might be too difficult for your network. Learning from fewer features is a lot easier and faster. You may need to train longer, with different hyperparameters, architecture, etc. to yield benefits of pixel-based classification.
