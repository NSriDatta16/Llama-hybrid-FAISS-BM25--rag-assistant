At Dnr TV there are two episodes with JP Boodhoo, where he gives an introduction to test driven development: Test Driven Development with JP Boodhoo, Part 1 Test Driven Development with JP Boodhoo, Part 2 If you want to see unit testing and TDD used together with a whole bunch of other agile practices, I would recommend watching the sceencast series Autumn of Agile . This series shows the development of a fully unit tested application from start to finish. As for podcasts, check out the following: Polymorphic Podcast - Jason Bock on Unit Testing, Code Coverage & Analysis Hanselminutes - Scott Hanselman on Test Driven Development Hanselminutes - The Last Word on TDD, with Scott Bellware Software Engineering Radio - Gerard Meszaros on XUnit Test Patterns Since mock objects are a quite important part of unit testing, these podcast episodes might be of interest as well: Hanselminutes - Scott Hanselman on Mock Objects Dot Net Rocks - Eli Lopian on TypeMock.Net Dot Net Rocks - Oren Eini on RhinoMocks Dot Net Rocks - Oren Eini on RhinoMocks 3.5
