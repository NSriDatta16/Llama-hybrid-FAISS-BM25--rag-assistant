How and why to set the layout type for plone.app.blob (lawn v. bushy)

Possible Duplicate: What is the difference between the various ZODB blobstorage layouts? I have a Plone 3.3.5 site that I'm migrating to plone.app.blob. I just ran a test-migration and noticed that all the blob files get stored in the same directory in var/blobstorage. On the listservs I've heard it mentioned that it's possible to select between two layouts: "lawn" and "bushy". Lawn appears to be the default, with all files in a single, flat directory, while "bushy" organizes them into subfolders. Is there a buildout option by which one can turn on the bushy layout? (I've not been able to find any examples of this.) What are the strengths of each layout option?
