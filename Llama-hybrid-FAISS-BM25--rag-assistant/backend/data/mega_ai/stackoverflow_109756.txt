I think most of the answers are missing the point that the original questioner wanted the columns widths to depend on the width of the content. I believe the only way to do this with pure CSS is by using display: table, display: table-row and display: table-cell , but that isn't supported by IE. But I'm not sure that this property is desirable, I find that creating a wide columns because there is a single long field name makes the layout less aesthetically pleasing and harder to use. Wrapped lines are fine in my opinion, so I think the answers that I just suggested were incorrect are probably the way to go. Robertc's example is ideal but if you really must use tables, I think you can make it a little more semantic by using for the field names. I'm not sure about this so please someone correct me if I'm wrong. FieldName 1 FieldName 2 is longer Update: I haven't been following this closely, but IE8 apparently supports CSS tables, so some are suggesting that we should start using them. There's an article on 24 ways which contains a relevant example at the end.
