Android calendar app and back button

I am opening an Android calendar from my application in order to create event. For that I use next fragment of code: Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_EDIT); intent.setType("vnd.android.cursor.item/event"); ... startActivity(intent); When calendar is opened and I press back button, event is saved - which I don't want to happen. If I understand correctly (from this link ) it is default behavior of calendar application. Is there anyway I can override that or I have to implement my own "calendar create event" activity? I hope I can override it somehow. But I doubt I can.
