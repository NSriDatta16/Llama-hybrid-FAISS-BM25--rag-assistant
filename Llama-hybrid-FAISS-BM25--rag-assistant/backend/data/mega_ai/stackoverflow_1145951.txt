CommandBehavior.CloseConnection is usually discouraged because of this very fact - You can't be sure that the Connection will be closed. (I'll try to find some concrete evidence of this, I'm saying this from faint recall). Dispose() is the surest way because it implicitly calls Close() . The using construct demonstrated by @Alex is just another (programmer friendly) way of writing the try-finally construct with the added implicit Disposal of objects. Edit: (after edit to question) Your concern over the connections actually closing seems unwarranted to me. The connection would simply return to the pool so that it can be reused easily without having to go through all the initialization. This does not mean that the Connection is still actively connected to the DB.
