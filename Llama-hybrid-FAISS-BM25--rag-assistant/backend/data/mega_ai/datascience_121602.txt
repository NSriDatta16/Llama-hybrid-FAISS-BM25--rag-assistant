How complex can I make a classifier's loss function in Scikit-Learn?

I want to customize the loss vanilla loss function being used by scikit-learn classifiers like the Logistic Regression classifier, etc. For example, if the vanilla empirical risk minimization formulation is as follows, how can I change it to something like this? Thanks.
