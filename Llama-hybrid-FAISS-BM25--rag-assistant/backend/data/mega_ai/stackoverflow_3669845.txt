I think you should consider using showsUserLocation to depict your users location - it's the standard UI for the platform and helps people get a consistent experience across apps. Sure you can come up with some custom annotation for user location but why re-invent what people are used to seeing on the maps app and on many 3rd party apps? You should take the time to review Apple's code samples for MapKit everything you need to do is there. This one in particular is a good starting point for you: http://developer.apple.com/iphone/prerelease/library/samplecode/MapCallouts/Introduction/Intro.html
