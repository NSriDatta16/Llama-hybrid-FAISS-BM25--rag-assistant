Hash key for Facebook SDK if not using Single Signon?

I really see no reason to use the single signon feature because the Facebook app is just so fragile on Android anyway that it doesn't work a lot of times. With the above said, do I need to generate and register the hash key with Facebook if I'll have the user login via the WebView login interface anyway?
