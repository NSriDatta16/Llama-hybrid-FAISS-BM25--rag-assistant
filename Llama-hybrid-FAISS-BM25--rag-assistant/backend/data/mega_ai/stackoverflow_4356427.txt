PHP: will an operation in the body of foreach be called more than once?

foreach ( functionWithComplicatedComputationReturningAnArray() as $key => $value) Will the above code call the function more than once? And generally, are there rules in this regard, about PHP language constructs accepting function calls as parameters? Thanks Gidi
