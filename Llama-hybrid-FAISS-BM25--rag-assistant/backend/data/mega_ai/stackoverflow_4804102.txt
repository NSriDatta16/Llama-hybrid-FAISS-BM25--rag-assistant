I want to use a specific property of SharedConsumerSecret as the value that should be saved/loaded from the database You'll need to implement a UserType for SignatureSecret. It will need to know how to convert the object into a value (probably a String), and how to convert a String into the object. See this example from Hibernate test suite on how to build a UserType: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-core/blob/master/hibernate-core/src/test/java/org/hibernate/test/annotations/entity/PhoneNumberType.java
