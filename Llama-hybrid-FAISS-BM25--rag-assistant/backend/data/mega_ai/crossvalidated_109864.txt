The null deviance shows how well the response is predicted by the model with nothing but an intercept. The residual deviance shows how well the response is predicted by the model when the predictors are included. From your example, it can be seen that the deviance goes up by 3443.3 when 22 predictor variables are added (note: degrees of freedom = no. of observations â€“ no. of predictors) . This increase in deviance is evidence of a significant lack of fit. We can also use the residual deviance to test whether the null hypothesis is true (i.e. Logistic regression model provides an adequate fit for the data). This is possible because the deviance is given by the chi-squared value at a certain degrees of freedom. In order to test for significance, we can find out associated p-values using the below formula in R: p-value = 1 - pchisq(deviance, degrees of freedom) Using the above values of residual deviance and DF, you get a p-value of approximately zero showing that there is a significant lack of evidence to support the null hypothesis. > 1 - pchisq(4589.4, 1099) [1] 0
