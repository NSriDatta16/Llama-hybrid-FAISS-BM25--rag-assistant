Calling web service from SQL Agent Job not working

I have a a SQL 2000 DTS package that is scheduled to run from a SQL 2005 SQL Agent job. In this DTS there is a ActiveX step that has the following VBScript to call a webservice. Dim http: set http = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0") http.setProxy 2, "http://123.45.67.89:8080" http.open "GET", "http://mywebservices.com/MyWebMethod?Param1=value1", false http.setProxyCredentials "SQLServiceAccount", "" http.send When running this DTS manually i can see that it runs fine and is able to call the webservice. However when running from a SQL job it doesn't call the webservice. This doesn't even throw an error, but I can tell from our logs that the webserivce wasn't called. I have tried running the DTS manually while logged in as the SQLServiceAccount and this works fine. The SQL Job owner is 'sa' Anyone have an ideas why this doesn't work when running from a SQL Job but works OK when run manually in the DTS?
