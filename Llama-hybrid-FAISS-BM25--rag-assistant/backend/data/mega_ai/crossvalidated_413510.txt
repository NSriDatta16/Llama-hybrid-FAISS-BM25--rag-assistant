Reference for Inception-v2

Cross-posted from Data Science StackExchange . The " Rethinking " paper doesn't describe the actual implementation of the Inception-v3 model in Tensorflow: an accurate description is written in model.txt in the source files of the paper in the arXiv. Also the Inception-v2 implementation differs from the paper: referring to the figures in the paper, the implemented v2 is 2xfigure5 + 1xfigure10 + 4xfigure5 + figure10 + 2xfigure5. Does anybody know why it was implemented this way and not in a more faithful way?
