There are no rules on how to do this, you decide based on your experience/knowledge/goals. It might be the case that you know nothing about your data and hence cannot come up with any hypotheses to test, in which case you might just do EDA and report the results as tables/graphs with no concrete tests. It might be that you already have concrete hypotheses in mind which you want to test so you can skip all that EDA stuff and go straight to CDA and report your test results. Or it might be anything in between. The whole train/(validation/)test split stuff is much more prevalent in machine learning rather than statistics, where the goal is often prediction. Usually in statistics you do not have that much data to be able to afford splitting your data, so you are stuck with just the one data set. And you decide (beforehand) what kind of analysis you will do, depending on your domain knowledge/expertise. If, however, you have loads of data (or enough data to have any meaningful power) you may split it into multiple parts and perform different analyses on each part, say EDA on one and CDA on another. As long as you make it clear what you've done, how, and why.
