Machine learning interview of incorrect claissification

Here is a problem of machine learning interview: For a classification problem, suppose you have labels a, b, c . During test samples, suppose the lose that the samples with label a are classified as label c is very large even compared with being classified as b incorrectly. Namely you don't want label a sample to be classified as label c . How do you improve your algorithm to avoid the large loss in testing? My idea is give more weight to the samples with label c during training. But this would prefer every sample not to be classified as c rather than only for the sample with true label a .
