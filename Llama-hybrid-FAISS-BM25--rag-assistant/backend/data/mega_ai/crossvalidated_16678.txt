It seems as if deep learning might be very interesting for you. This is a very recent field of deep connectionist models which are pretrained in an unsupervised way and fine tuned afterwards with supervision. The fine tuning requires a much less samples than the pretraining. To wet your tongue, I recommend [Semantig Hashing Salakhutdinov, Hinton . Have a look at the codes this finds for distinct documents of the Reuters corpus: (unsupervised!) If you need some code implemented, check out deeplearning.net . I don't believe there are out of the box solutions, though.
