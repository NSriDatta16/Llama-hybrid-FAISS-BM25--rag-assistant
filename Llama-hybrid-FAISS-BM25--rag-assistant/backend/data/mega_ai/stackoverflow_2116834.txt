I've found the Entity Framework designer leaves a lot to be desired so I found the best way is to edit the .edmx by hand. The .edmx file contains 3 main sections, one which represents the storage model (database), one which represents the conceptual model and one section which represents the mapping between the two models If I understand correctly, you have removed Table2 from the conceptual model and so you should remove anything related to it in the conceptual side of the EDMX. Chances are table 1 will still have an association to table 2 that you need to delete. Unfortunately manual edits to the .EDMX file will be overwritten if you ever use the designer to regenerate the model.
