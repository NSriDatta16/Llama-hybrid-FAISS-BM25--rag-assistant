Since there isn't a textbook solution to what you're asking, I'll offer a few considerations: How do you know that data point is an outlier? Do you know for certain that your trend must be linear? There are numerous phenomena that are non-linear. Your logistic regression will pick that up if it's true. Have you tried using a different number of bins? Do you know for a fact that this feature should be cut into deciles? For example, if you had 3 or 4 bins, there's a good chance that the resulting bins would be linear. Similarly, if you had 20 bins, then perhaps only the first bin or two would be lower than expected, which helps identify the cause of a potential outlier. Related to 2., in my experience data on the edges (e.g., first and last bin) can behave differently than the middle because of their proximity to the borders. That is, the first bin may include 0's or negatives which may have unexpected results on your output variable. Have you done the necessary data cleaning required?
