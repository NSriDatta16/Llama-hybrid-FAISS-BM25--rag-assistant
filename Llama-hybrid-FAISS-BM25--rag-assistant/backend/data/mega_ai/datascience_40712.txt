While using one-hot (binary) encoding certainly takes more space, it also implies an independence assumption among the data. On the other hand, using integers such as 1, 2 and 3 implies some kind of a relationship between them. The problem that you mention of linear increase in size with one-hot encoding is common and can be treated by using something such as an embedding. An embedding also helps define a sense of distance among different datapoints. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding
