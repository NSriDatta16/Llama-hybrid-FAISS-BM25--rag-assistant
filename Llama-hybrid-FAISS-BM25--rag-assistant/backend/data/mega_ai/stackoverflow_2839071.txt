Well, let's simplify/concreteify a bit. Assume that our cars are unit squares, the parking lot is N x N, and we need to enter/exit from the lower left corner. A simple pattern gets the lot almost 2/3 full with cars (shown for N=12): +------------+ |C CC CC CC C| |C CC CC CC C| |C CC CC CC C| |C CC CC CC C| |C CC CC CC C| |C CC CC CC C| |C CC CC CC C| |C CC CC CC C| |C CC CC CC C| |C CC CC CC C| |C CC CC CC C| | -----------+ I can prove that the best you can possibly do is to get the lot 2/3 full. Imagine that you build up the empty spaces by starting with a completely full garage and driving out a (currently reachable) car one at a time. Each time you remove a car, you produce up to 3 newly reachable cars, and remove one once-reachable car (now an empty space). So for every space you make, you create at most 2 more reachable cars. To make 2/3 N^2 reachable cars, you need to make at least 1/3 N^2 spaces, and that's all the squares you have. So you can fill the garage at most 2/3 full. The simple pattern above is asymptotically optimal, as its density approaches 2/3 as N -> infinity. (Kinda boring, I was hoping some tree-looking pattern would do better.)
