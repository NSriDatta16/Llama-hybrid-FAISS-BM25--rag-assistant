WPF is the current "state of the art" in UI methodologies. Had it been available as people were learning to write UIs (instead of GDI, Win32, and later WinForms which is relatively similar), it wouldn't take so long to learn it. You can probably think of it like switching to a Dvorak keyboard - the most difficult part is changing your thinking about the parts of UI design you think you know well. That said, you should at least be encouraging members of your team to experiment with WPF in their spare time. Make resources available from the very beginning, maybe by the following: Have links to pages that tell about what you need to have installed to work with WPF - if it doesn't mention Blend then I wouldn't trust it. Look on here for "getting started" questions, since they'll probably have good answers from experienced individuals. Buy at least a few good books and let people borrow them if they want.
