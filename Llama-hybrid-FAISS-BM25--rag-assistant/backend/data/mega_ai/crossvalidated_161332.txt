For me it was much helpful to read in the book of S. Mulaik "The Foundations of Factoranalysis" (1972), that there is a method purely of rotations of a matrix of factor loadings to arrive at a canonical correlation, so I could locate it in that ensemble of concepts which I had already understood so far from principal components analysis and factor analysis. Perhaps you're interested in this example (which I've rebuilt from a first implementation/discussion of about 1998 just a couple of days ago to crosscheck and re-verify the method against the computation by SPSS). See here . I'm using my small matrix/pca-tools Inside-[R] and Matmate for this, but I think it can be reconstructed in R without too much effort.
