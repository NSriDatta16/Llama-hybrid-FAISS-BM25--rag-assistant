A few attempts have been made at making capistrano more universal - capistrano-boss and my own capistrano-provisioning , for example - it may be that somebody has already done it. Certainly, in terms of running commands remotely and organising tasks, namespaces, hooks etc, capistrano is second-to-none. But I've yet to see a comprehensive solution that allows you to really administer remote systems using it. Have you investigated chef ? It seems that this is frequently used in conjunction with cap. 37signals, for example, have extensive chef recipes available - and they were also the source of capistrano.
