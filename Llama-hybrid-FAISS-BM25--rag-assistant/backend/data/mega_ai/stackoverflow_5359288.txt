python eval and string indexing

Let's say I have a string string = '1234567890' and I want a slice of that string defined by another string slice = '5:8' This is easy to do with >>>string[5:8] '678' However the slice is passed in through a file and changes on user input. Is their a way of doing something such as >>>string[eval(slice)] '678' When I do this I get 5:8 ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax I have a function that accounts for all four cases, I was just wondering if their was a more elegant way of doing this. Thanks for your answers.
