I didn't really get logistic regression until I thought about it this way: Picture the S curve (the logistic) going from -3 to 3 Look at the coefficient estimate on your constant term. Mark it on the x axis of the S curve. Each coefficient moves you $\beta$ units along the X axis of the S curve. If you want to know what probability that corresponds to, go up from the X axis to the S curve and then over to the Y axis. So, say that your intercept is, like, -.5. This is something like 40% probability (or so). Say your first beta is -.2 or something. This means that you follow the X axis over to -.7, which has a lower probability. Say you have a coefficient that is -5. That'll take you way out left, where chances are basically zero. Its really pretty simple when you break it down simply.
