If you take the tests one at a time, then the Gender by outcome (pass/fail) table for each one is a 2x2 table of independent counts that can be analyzed with a simple chi-square test or a binary logistic regression. If you want to also formally test whether any Gender differences in outcomes differ across subject areas, then you'd have a 2x3 design, with Gender as a between-subjects factor and subject matter or test type as a within-subjects or repeated-measures factor. In SPSS this kind of design can be analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) in the GENLIN proceedure (Analyze>Generalized Linear Model>Generalized Estimating Equations), or as a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) in the GENLINMIXED procedure (Analyze>Mixed Models>Generalized Linear). Both procedures offer binary logistic models as options. GENLIN with GEE is a bit easier to use. In either case, the data need to be set up with three cases per subject, including a subject ID variable, a Gender variable, a test type variable, and a binary outcome variable. There is an example Case Study at https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLVMB_27.0.0/statistics_casestudies_project_ddita/spss/tutorials/gee_wheeze_intro.html that walks you through a repeated-measures binary logistic model in GENLIN. The structure (one between-subjects factor and one repeated-measures factor) is identical to yours, though of course the variables are different (and the repeated factor has four levels rather than three, but no different concepts are involved).
