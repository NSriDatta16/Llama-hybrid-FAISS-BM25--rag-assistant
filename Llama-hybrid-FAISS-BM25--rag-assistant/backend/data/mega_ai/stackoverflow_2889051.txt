VS2010 MSTest CruiseControl.NET .NET 3.5

We're in the process of upgrading from VS2008 to VS2010 since it's now released. We are using CC.NET along with MSTest and want to use MS coverage tool instead of NCover. Interestingly, as I've seen others talking about as well, when you upgrade your project from VS2008 to VS2010 your Test Projects get converted to .NET 4. Nice move!! So WTF does one do with their CI environment in order to build this stuff (some projects in .net 3.5, some in .net 4 - these are different FRAMEWORKS!) LOL!!! It seems that I might need to have my CC.NET build two separate projects? - not sure about how to run the units tests from cruise with .net 4. Has anyone done this and have a snippet of their config they might share? And I thought this was going to be a simple thing. :( thanks! Bill44077
