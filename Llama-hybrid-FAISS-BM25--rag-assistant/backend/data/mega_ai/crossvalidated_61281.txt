Classifier for biased dataset

I have a dataset with two classes and the ratio of the number of instances in two classes is 1:10. I used SVM for classification and obtained a pathetic performance as it classified all the instances in the larger class. Is there a classifier which is shown to perform well in case of biased datasets?
