Looking more closely at your simulation, I can see a bit more clearly what you're doing. You've set up a data generating process with a random intensity taking a gamma distribution for each gamma intensity, there's a Poisson realization, you then turn to estimate the Poisson rate among a subsample with non-zero counts. This is a bit different than how I envisioned the date problem because you have data from a sample, some of which are deliberately excluded, and this sample has important heterogeneity. There's a couple things to address here: If you did not have a random input to the Poisson process, the correct probability model for the observed data is a zero-truncated Poisson distribution . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-truncated_Poisson_distribution . Note that a method of moments estimator for the intensity could be solved numerically (no tractable analytic solution) \begin{equation} 0 = \bar{Y} - \lambda \exp(\lambda) / (\exp(\lambda) - 1) \end{equation} set.seed(123) ns zcpois(y[y!=0])$root [1] 0.6950045 You can also use maximum likelihood recalling the likelihood for a truncated RV: $P(Y=y | Y>0) = P(Y=y)/P(Y>0)$. y0 However, it's important to consider the Poisson/Gamma mixture and the impact on the resulting probability model. The mixture model does not follow a zero-truncated Poisson distribution. The underlying Poisson process (without omission of 0 counts) would follow an overdispersed Poisson process. lambdas zcpois(nzcounts)$root [1] 0.1311875 > mean(lambdas) [1] 0.05573894 A Bayesian model whose likelihood follows a zero-truncated Poisson model and whose intensity follows a gamma distribution with a non-informative shape and scale parameter would enable you to estimate the posterior distribution, whose posterior modes would give you good estimates of the input parameters to the gamma distribution. A frequentist approach would invoke the EM algorithm.
