Sounds like you've got an answer, but you might be interested in an implementation example anyways. Your div with 0.5 opacity cannot be one div with 0.5 opacity. It would have to be at least 4 divs with 0.5 opacity, but would probably be most flexible as 8. They would together form 8 tiles in a 3x3 grid with no center tile. They each have 0.5 opacity, and the center tile is non-existent, so it has full opacity. Then you can freely play with the dimensions of the negative space in the middle, adjusting the sizes of the various tiles to match. If you wanted to make the center area draggable, then it would be a 9th div with 0 opacity and a drag handler. Hope that helps. The imgAreaSelect plugin appears to use 4 tiles, where the left and right-most tiles occupy the full vertical area (i.e. each occupies 3 spaces in the 3x3 grid).
