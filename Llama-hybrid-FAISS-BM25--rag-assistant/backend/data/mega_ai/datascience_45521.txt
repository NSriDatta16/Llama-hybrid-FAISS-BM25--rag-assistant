I think your answer (or rather your perspective) is driven greatly depending on which part of "machine learning" you're looking at. It's a broad field and the approaches within each practice are different. An NLP specialist is going to have a different approach than an image processing specialist who will also be different than a signal processing expert. Also, are you reading whitepapers or looking at entire case studies of production implementations. If you do nothing but read whitepapers, then yes, it's easy to say that machine learning is myopic with "just math". But that's missing the forest for the trees. When you take a step back and look at large scale implementations, where you are combining multiple algorithms into a finished solution then it's clear that various forms of logic are used along the way. As an example, let's consider autonomous cars. There is no one algorithm that runs the car - autonomous driving is a combination of various algorithms and machine learning approaches. You can read the individual whitepapers and not see any logic there, it's strictly math. But when you look at how the components come together to make a car go forward, the use of logic becomes clear.
