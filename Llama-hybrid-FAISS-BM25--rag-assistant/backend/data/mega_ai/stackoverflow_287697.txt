You could have probably concluded your question after the second paragraph, rather than calling people "insane" simply because they have a different viewpoint than you do and otherwise trying to mock professionals who may have a very good reason for feeling the way that they do. As to your question, while there are certainly situations where a cursor may be called for, in my experience developers decide that a cursor "must" be used FAR more often than is actually the case. The chance of someone erring on the side of too much use of cursors vs. not using them when they should is MUCH higher in my opinion.
