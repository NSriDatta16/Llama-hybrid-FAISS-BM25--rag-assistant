When can we bucket groups together based on groups success rate?

I have a data set with a nominal data feature that has 20 levels. I want to label those levels in a way that I can say "Level A is Good", "Level B is Medium"... The data set is made of samples with a binary feature (0, 1) which indicates a success rate. So far, I've computed the average success rate for each of my levels and used percentiles and assigned a label based on the average success rate for each level. My issue is that some of my levels have a very low count. The level with the highest row count has 14704 while the lowest has 1 row. My question is, is there a better way to categorize my data that takes into consideration the low count of some of my category's levels. Would it be wise to merge low count levels into one group "Other" and if not, could you explain me why this would not be wise? Thank you in advance for your precious time and help!
