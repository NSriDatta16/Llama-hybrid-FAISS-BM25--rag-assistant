You can do anything you want, especially if it's a term paper or something of that nature. To obtain useful results you can't use nonstationary data with OLS and time series, except in case of cointegrated series. There are other more advanced methods where nonstationarity is a non issue. With OLS you have to difference real GDP and indices, and also apply log transform in many cases. UPDATE: when using non stationary variables in OLS you run into the potentially fatal issue of spurious regression , there's a ton of literature on this subject. Basically, your regression results will turn out garbage in most cases. You may see very significant coefficients, but the significance is artificial, and disappears when you run a proper regression. There's even more subtle phenomenon called "cointegration", but since you're working on undergrad paper, I would not worry about it. As a matter of fact, if your major is not statistics or econometrics, I would imagine your instructor will not penalize you for improper use of regressions. Clarification: you can use non-stationary data with OLS if the series are cointegrated . However, when doing so you better show that the series are cointegrated indeed, then adjust the parameter covariance matrix accordingly if you need inference. The parameters themselves would be fine. As I mentioned in original answer this is advanced concepts that are usually outside undegrad courses.
