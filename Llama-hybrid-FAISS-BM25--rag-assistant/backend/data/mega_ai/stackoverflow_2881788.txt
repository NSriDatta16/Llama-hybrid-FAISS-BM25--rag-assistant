I don't think so, the way you use your variable name does matter than its length. Good code should be consistent. Whether that means setting rules for the names of variables and functions, adopting standard approaches, or simply making sure all of your code is indented the same way, consistency makes your code easier for others to read. One should later construe on what is your variable name declared. var g:String; var gang:String; Both perform the same operation, one is more readability where someone going through your code will also construe it.
