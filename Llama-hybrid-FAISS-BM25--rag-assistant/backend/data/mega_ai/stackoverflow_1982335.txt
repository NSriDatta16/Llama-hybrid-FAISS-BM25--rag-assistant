If storage space is not an issue, it's worth a thought about putting in a bit field to mark a record as deleted so that none of your data is lost in case you want to add a part to your application that can look at all previous tasks. Like some administrative tools. Let's say employees are making tasks, and a task has expired and you don't want normal users to be able to modify or access expired tasks, so you "Delete" them when they expire. But one day the big boss comes along and says he wants a list of all tasks in the last year. This bit field could come in handy. It's just a thought and there may be better suggestions out there
