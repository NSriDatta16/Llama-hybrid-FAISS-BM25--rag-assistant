Associating .jnlp with javaws

I have an application that is being deployed via JNLP on Windows XP. I have created a shortcut on the user desktops pointing to http://myserver/myapp.jnlp . In the folder options on XP, I have set the jnlp extension to use javaws. Despite this, the desktop shortcut still appears as a web link (using the browser icon) and when clicked, results in a browser being launched (which in turn, successfully launches the app). This is a minor inconvenience as the application does get launched but I would prefer if the browser weren't involved. Any suggestions on how to get the app to launch directly (without the browser) would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Phil
