Another option is Lazarus, which is based on Free Pascal , which itself is based on Delphi. Lazarus allows you to develop using Object Oriented Pascal, across Linux, Windows and MacOSX and produces natively compiled executables on each target platform. Natively compiled executables are generally much faster than interpreter based apps (i.e. Java, C#, PHP). Lazarus use a component and event based approach to development which allows you to design GUI by dragging and dropping components on a Form Designer, which then are hooked through events. Good luck with your programming adventures!
