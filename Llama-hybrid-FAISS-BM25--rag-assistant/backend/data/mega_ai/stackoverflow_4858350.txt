MDX Count over time without specific hierarchy

This follows on from my question about count from start of time . I would like to be able to do the count without basing it on a DateTime Hierarchy, but have this as a calculated measure, which works when you drag a dimension against it. I currently have with member [Measures].[Commitment Total] as sum( [Date Dim].[FY Hierarchy].[Fiscal Year].members(0):[Date Dim].[FY Hierarchy].currentMember , [Measures].[Commitment Count]) Then using the calculation: select [Measures].[Commitment Total] on 0 , [Date Dim].[FY Hierarchy].[Fiscal Year] on 1 from [Cube] I would like to have the [Measures].[Commitment Total] not built upon the [Date Dim].[FY Hierarchy], but be independent in the calculation, then use the date axis in the select statement - i.e. we could calculate by the Calendar Year, Fiscal Year, Fisal Year / Month Dim's. So I'm thinking it'd look like this: with member [Measures].[Commitment Total] as sum( NULL:[Date Dim].currentMember , [Measures].[Commitment Count]) Then to use the calculation: select [Measures].[Commitment Total] on 0 , [Date Dim].[FY Hierarchy].[Fiscal Year] on 1 from [Cube] OR select [Measures].[Commitment Total] on 0 , [Date Dim].[CY Hierarchy].[Fiscal Year] on 1 from [Cube] Not sure if what I'm asking is possible or not?
