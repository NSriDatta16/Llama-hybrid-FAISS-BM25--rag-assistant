If code are in same file, you might make use of split window , or if you are using viemu or opening using vim, you can simply split by type :sp . Unless there are some other extensions might allow you open same document multiple times. Different files can have more options: bookmark code if you do not want to lose where you come from. use floating windows by simply drag out the source file out of VS2010 in tabbed view, if you have multiple monitors, you can view 4 documents at the same time quite easily, you can also quick align window by press + / in Windows if you don't know already.
