You are right that these are the parameters that conceptually belong to the encoder-decoder attention (sometimes called cross-attention). The implementation can be different. What your goal is fast inference, you can pre-compute the keys and the values for each head because they only depend on the encoder output and do not change during decoding. For each decoded token, there is only one query vector (disregarding beam search and batching) which is compared with constant precomputed keys and values.
