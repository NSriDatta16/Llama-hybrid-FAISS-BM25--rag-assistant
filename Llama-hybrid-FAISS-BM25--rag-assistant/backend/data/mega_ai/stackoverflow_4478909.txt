Silent Exception On Visual Studio 2010

private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { ///IDE will notify me of this exception throw new Exception(); } private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { //IDE will not notify me of this exception throw new Exception(); //code will not execute MessageBox.Show("test"); } why? ----------------------EDITED---------------------- the correct answer is what ChrisA mentioned. some quotes from microsoft : This is a known bug with x64 versions of Windows and the way exceptions are handled. One way to work around this issue while debugging is to go to the Debug -> Exceptions and select 'Thrown' for for the exception types you are interested in. This will stop the debugger when the exception is first hit (and before Windows eats it up). This bug was closed as "External" because this behavior results from how x64 version of Windows handle exceptions. When a user mode exception crosses a kernel transition, x64 versions of Windows do not allow the exception to propagate. Therefore attached debuggers are unaware of the fact that an exception occured resulting in the debugger failing to break on the unhandled exception. Unfortunately where is nothing that the Visual Studo team can do to address this, it is the result of operating system design. All feedback regarding this issue should be addressed to the Windows team; however the Windows team considers this to be the "correct" operating system design, and considers the x86 behavior to be "incorrect".
