Identifying which tests provide coverage in VS2010 code coverage results

Does anyone know of an easy way to work backwards from the VS2010 code coverage in-file highlighting to the test that provides the coverage? I have a file with one method covered and another not but looking through my tests I can't spot the one providing the current coverage. It would be great to be able to navigate back from the code highlighting. Thanks
