Yes, in fact, you should almost always prefer using your own (or jQuery's) ajax functionality before. There is a lot of overhead associated with the MS Ajax UpdatePanel (it performs a full postback, and then updates the element(s) that changed on the page), so the nice features in an AJAX enabled web site - responsivenes, continuity etc - are almost entirely lost (IMHO). You have very little control of what is actually submitted over the cable, of what is returned, and of how it is treated upon return to the client. With jQuery Ajax on the other hand, you get full and instant control, you can make as light-weight (or heavy) requests as you wish, and lets face it - the API isn't in any way harder to use than that of the UpdatePanel. With that in mind, there are still scenarios when the UpdatePanel is fine, or even better. Especially in ASP.NET WebForms, it can be tricky to return just part of a page in a way that gracefully degrades if the user can't use javascript, and for the rapid "drag-and-drop" development style, there is really no way jQuery can compete. (Whether you like drag-and-drop development or not is an entirely other discussion...)
