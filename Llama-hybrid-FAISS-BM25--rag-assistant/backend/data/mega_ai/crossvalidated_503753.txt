Standard practices for displaying thousands of regressions - what are they?

I thought this might be a fairly simple question, but I've failed gather adequate information on the subject. So what are the standard pratices to display the results of thousands of regressions? I have been doing some comparisons by looking at graphical averages (an average coefficient value associated with some other characteristic of the dataset, such as geography, e.g. the average value for the west coast is -0.05 if one is running regressions for each city of the united states), but still think I should have some sort summary statistics for the results or another type of result.
