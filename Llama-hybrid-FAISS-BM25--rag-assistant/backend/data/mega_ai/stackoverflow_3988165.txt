django template "file name too long"

I'm very new to Python and Django so maybe someone can point me in the right direction. I have the following url.py line url(r'^$', direct_to_template, {'template':'index.html', 'extra_context':{'featured_actors': lambda: User.objects .annotate(avatars_nb=Count('avatar')) .filter(actor_profile__is_featured=True, avatars_nb__gt=0) .order_by('?')[:4]}, }, name='index'), All this was working perfectly fine for a long time but for no reason that I can see all of a sudden I'm getting this template error. TemplateSyntaxError at / Caught an exception while rendering: (36, 'File name too long') On line 70 66 {% if featured_actors|length %} 67 68 Featured Actors: 69 70 {% for actor in featured_actors %} 71 72 73 74 75 76 {% endfor %} What is the best way to debug this? UPDATE 126 def avatar_url(self, size): 127 return self.avatar.storage.url(self.avatar_name(size)) I think I found a bit of the problem, one of the user profiles is also giving the same error. So I think it must be a avatar/image path for him that is too long. I'm trying to narrow it down...
