parameter passing to a standalone qooxdoo application

How can I pass parameters to a stand alone qooxdoo applicatoin? Thanks in advance :) update: I was thinking of passing URL parameters; something like GET/POST params when an html FORM is submitted. Initially, "arguments" in standalone application caught my attention. I think Tobi has correctly answered me (thanks a bunch); but feel free to share your ideas!
