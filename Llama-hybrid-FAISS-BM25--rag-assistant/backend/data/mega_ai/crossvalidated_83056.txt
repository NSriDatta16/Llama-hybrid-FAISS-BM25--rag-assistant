Using LibSVM for anomaly detection

Im trying to create a one class SVM using libSVM. However whenever I run the svmpredict function it always return an accuracy of 0%. model = svmtrain(label,userProfile',('-s 2 -t 2 -c 1 -g .8')) * optimization finished, #iter = 6 obj = 4.792359, rho = 2.225069 nSV = 6, nBSV = 3 model = Parameters: [5x1 double] nr_class: 2 totalSV: 6 rho: 2.2251 Label: [] sv_indices: [6x1 double] ProbA: [] ProbB: [] nSV: [] sv_coef: [6x1 double] SVs: [6x30 double] >> svmpredict(1,x2',model) Accuracy = 0% (0/1) (classification) ans = -1 Might it have something to do with my data preparation? Can anybody suggest what I might be doing wrong?
