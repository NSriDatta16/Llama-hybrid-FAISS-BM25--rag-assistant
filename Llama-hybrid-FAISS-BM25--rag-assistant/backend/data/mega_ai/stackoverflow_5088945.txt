Use @2x retina images for ipad in universal app? and does apple prefer native apps?

I know there were some discussions about this but i could not find good answer? My questions are - I know that - [UIImage imageNamed:@"blabla"] will automatically search for the correct image to display (retina or not) on iPhone. I have a Universal app, and i wish to use the @2x versions on the ipad so i wont have to load an other version of the images (I have hundreds of small images). is it possible ? I saw in some places that people wrote that apple discourage Universal apps as it prefers building separated apps for iPhone and iPad ? is that correct even when i create a different UI for each? thanks shani
