First of all I discourage using ajax here as you are not using it for the purpose for which it is intended to, and you are forcing it to do a reload. You can do something like this in the success of ajax success: function(){ window.location = "the new url you wanted to load"; } Edit: Why not do a normal post with form action attribute set to the page you want to post to and you can access all the variables of the form in that posted page, or alternatively you can concatenate or store in array all your values and store this array in a hidden variable and access this variable in the posted script.
