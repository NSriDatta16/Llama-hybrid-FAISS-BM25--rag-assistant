How to use neural network for regression

I am new in the field of machine learning, and I am sorry if my question may seem naive to most of you. I am following the "Machine Learning" course by Andrew Ng on Coursera. At this moment, I am studying the concept of neural networks (NN) and their training. During the course, we use NN for classification problems. I was wondering if we can apply a similar NN to a regression problem. Here is my doubt: the NN proposed, uses the sigmoid as the activation function. The sigmoid has an output between 0 and 1, so I understand why it is useful for classification. In the case of regression problems, the output has to be a real number, so that I do not understand if this NN can be used for this type of problem. Is it only a matter of normalisation? Do I have to use a different activation function? Thank you for your answers.
