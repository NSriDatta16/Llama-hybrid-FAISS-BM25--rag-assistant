Your idea of output format is very similar to what YOLO algorithm for object detection does, but you didn't mentioned using CNNs. YOLO uses something like your scheme on top of convolutional neural networks. The idea is to use CNNs to extract features and then apply layer that does what you described per patch, or in other words apply your idea in a sliding window fashion. You can see this video (CNN27. Object Detection: Bounding Box Predictions) and next ones (CNN28-31) for more details.
