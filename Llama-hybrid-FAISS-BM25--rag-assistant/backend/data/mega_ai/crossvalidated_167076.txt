For any AR(q) model the easy way to estimate the parameter(s) is to use OLS - and run the regression of: $$\newcommand{\price}{{\rm price}} \price_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \price_{t-1} \dotso \beta_q \cdot \price_{t-q} $$ Lets do so (in R): # time series setup: price (Okay, so I cheated a bit and used the arima function in R, but it yields the same estimates as the OLS regression - try it). Now lets have a look at the MA(1) model. Now the MA model is very different from the AR model. The MA is weighted average of past periods error, where as the AR model uses the previoues periods actual data values. The MA(1) is: $$ \price_t = \mu + w_t + \theta_1 \cdot w_{t-1} $$ Where $\mu$ is the mean, and $w_t$ are the error terms - not the previous value of price (as in the AR model). Now, alas, we can't estimate the parameters by something as simple as OLS. I will not cover the method here, but the R function arima uses maximum likelihood. Lets try: # Estimate MA(1) parameter: ma1
