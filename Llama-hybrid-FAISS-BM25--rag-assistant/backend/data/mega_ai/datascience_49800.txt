Deep learning not classify some classes

I want to classify 13 classes, but 2 classes is not classified. This is the test result. As you can see in the image, class 3 and class 11 is not detected. It's simple vector to class classification. The dimension of input is 16 and I've added 2 dense layers in the model. What do I need to add to model?
