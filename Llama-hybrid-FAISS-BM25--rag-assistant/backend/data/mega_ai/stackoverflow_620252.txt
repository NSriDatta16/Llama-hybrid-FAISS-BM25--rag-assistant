C#/mySQL Data Retrieval Problems over Network

I have a mySQL database running on a server on the local network. If I make a normal SELECT statement, I get 6000 results. The execution time in the mySQL query browser is 0.35s , but the data is received and shown in query browser after 9s . I have the same problem if I try to access the data through the .NET application. The query itself is fast, but the showing it in the application is slow. Does anyone have any idea as to what would cause this?
