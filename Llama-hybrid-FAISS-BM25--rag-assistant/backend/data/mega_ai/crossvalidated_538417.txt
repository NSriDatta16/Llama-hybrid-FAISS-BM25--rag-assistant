This is a classical time series estimation / prediction problem. For a broad overview, see, e.g., Shumway/Stoffer, Time Series Analysis and Its Applications . One way to solve the problem would be using a state-space approach and, more specifically, a Kalman filter (cf. chapter 6 in the book linked to above). You would identify a state-space model of the form $$ x(k) = A x(k-1) + v(k)\\ y(k) = C x(k) + w(k) $$ with internal states $x(k)\in\mathbb{R}^m$ , measurements (=daily stock market value) $y(k)\in\mathbb{R}$ , process noise $v(k) \in \mathbb{R}^m\sim\mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma_v)$ and measurement noise $w(k)\in\mathbb{R}\sim\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_w)$ . The matrices $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ and $C\in\mathbb{R}^{1 \times m}$ , as well as the noise covariances can either be selected manually or (partially) learned using, e.g., maximum likelihood optimization. To predict the future, you would first estimate the values of the state variables $x(k)$ at time $k=now$ from past data using a Kalman filter. Then, you can simply forward-simulate the first of the two equations above from time step to time step. This will automatically result in continually increasing uncertainty due to the addition of the process noise $v(k)$ in each time step. If you want to stick with your linear trend model, you can simply choose $$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad C = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} $$ and identify the noise covariances from past data. This will result in a linear prediction for the future, with the slope and bias of the straight being identified from the data up to this point.
