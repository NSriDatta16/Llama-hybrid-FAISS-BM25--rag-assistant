On the plus side, you might be able to squeeze out a little extra performance by doing ArrayLists just right. But deleting objects is going to be a royal pain - as Paolo and Anurag said, you'll either have to put an empty placeholder (null ?) or to renumber some other other object to fill the gap. This is likely to result in performance bugs and plain old bugs. HashMaps, on the other hand. Simple to use, decent performance guaranteed (unless you allocate your ids really badly). And retrieving objects by id might not turn out to be your application's bottleneck at all. As the saying goes, premature optimization is the root of all evil .
