Based on this: At the time of writing this article, Google Chrome 9+ has the only working implementation of the FileSystem API. Since a dedicated browser UI does not yet exist for file/quota management, the API cannot be used without running Chrome with the --unlimited-quota-for-files flag (Note: if you're building an app or extension for the Chrome Web Store, the unlimitedStorage manifest file permission will suffice). found at http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/file/filesystem/#toc-support I assume you are using Chrome and that you have not set the --unlimited-quota-for-files flag
