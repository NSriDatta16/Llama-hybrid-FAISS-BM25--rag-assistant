Encoding feature containing both text and string?

I have a feature which has following entries:- | Exterior | | -------- | | Vinyl | | Wd Sdng | | MetalSd | | Wd Sdng | | HdBoard | | BrkFace | | Wd Sdng | and so on. I am assuming that Wd Sdng is a text value and other values are string (but please correct me if I am wrong). How do I encode this feature since it has both text and string values? Should I perform a OneHotEncoding or should I perform some kind of NLP encoding (Tfidf etc)??
