How to delete particular string from paragraph

Hi Friends, I have a small question, I have a paragraph of string, now I want to delete some words from that para aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa*bbbbbbbbb*aaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Now, suppose I want to delete the "bbbbbbbb" fromthe above para and I am using the following method mySpeechText = [[mySpeechText stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:strTemp withString:@""] retain]; but this method is replacing the "bbbbbbbb" with blank spaces, ie, " " and I am getting aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa; and I want aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa; without any space. so how can I delete the "bbbbbbbb" rather replacing it. Thanks- If I am not clear plz let me know.
