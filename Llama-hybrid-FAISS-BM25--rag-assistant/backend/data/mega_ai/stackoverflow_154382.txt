ASP.NET Image Listbox

I want to display a list of images (instead of text) for the user to choose from. The control is databound (the URLs come from the database) Instead of the typical vertical scroll bar in a listbox, I want this box to be horizontal. I'm looking for an ASP.NET server control similar to this: http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/aspnet/webimageviewer.aspx#Overview I considered all the answers and finally decided to use the ComboBox from obout.com which can also display the images. thanks Shankar
