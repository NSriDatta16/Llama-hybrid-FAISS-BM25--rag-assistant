How to get the next 20 items in RSS feed?

I have created an RSS parser using NSXMLParser class. The feed has an item count of 20. I would like to know how to fetch the next 20 items from the feed? If I add the same url to google reader it fetches lot of items and keeps continuing as I scroll down. is there any particular way to fetch next 20 items from the RSS? consider this feed of dilbert blog for example. feed://feeds.feedburner.com/typepad/ihdT?format=xml
