classification imbalance data - bias and class weight

This page shows a classification problem. They have used bias as well as bias along with class weights. What is difference between bias and weights? In some other techniques such as Random Forest we could adjust cut off from 50% to say 90% so that if the edge node has 90% examples of high density class then only it will predict that class. Out of bias and weights, which one is similar to cut off probablity? When should I use just one of them or both? I can always run 3 models 1 with bias, 1 with class weight and 1 with both and compare the results. But is there any better refrence? keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', bias_initializer=output_bias) and weighted_history = weighted_model.fit( train_features, train_labels, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, epochs=EPOCHS, callbacks = [early_stopping], validation_data=(val_features, val_labels), # The class weights go here class_weight=class_weight)
