esent knowledge, including common sense knowledge plan learn communicate in natural language if necessary, integrate these skills in completion of any given goal Many interdisciplinary approaches (e.g. cognitive science, computational intelligence, and decision making) consider additional traits such as imagination (the ability to form novel mental images and concepts) and autonomy. Computer-based systems that exhibit many of these capabilities exist (e.g. see computational creativity, automated reasoning, decision support system, robot, evolutionary computation, intelligent agent). There is debate about whether modern AI systems possess them to an adequate degree. Physical traits Other capabilities are considered desirable in intelligent systems, as they may affect intelligence or aid in its expression. These include: the ability to sense (e.g. see, hear, etc.), and the ability to act (e.g. move and manipulate objects, change location to explore, etc.) This includes the ability to detect and respond to hazard. Although the ability to sense (e.g. see, hear, etc.) and the ability to act (e.g. move and manipulate objects, change location to explore, etc.) can be desirable for some intelligent systems, these physical capabilities are not strictly required for an entity to qualify as AGIâ€”particularly under the thesis that large language models (LLMs) may already be or become AGI. Even from a less optimistic perspective on LLMs, there is no firm requirement for an AGI to have a human-like form; being a silicon-based computational system is sufficient, provided it can process input (language) from the external world in place of human senses. This interpretation aligns with the understanding that AGI has never been proscribed a particular physical embodiment and thus does not demand a capacity for locomotion or traditional "eyes and ears". It can be regarded as sufficient for an intelligent computer to interact with other systems, to invoke or regulate them, to achieve specific goals, including altering a physical environment, as the fictional HAL 9000 in the motion picture 2001: A Space Odyssey was both programmed and tasked to. Tests for human-level AGI Several tests meant to confirm human-level AGI have been considered, including: The Turing Test (Turing) Proposed by Alan Turing in his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", this test involves a human judge engaging in natural language conversations with both a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The machine passes the test if it can convince the judge it is human a significant fraction of the time. Turing proposed this as a practical measure of machine intelligence, focusing on the ability to produce human-like responses rather than on the internal workings of the machine. Turing described the test as follows: The idea of the test is that the machine has to try and pretend to be a man, by answering questions put to it, and it will only pass if the pretence is reasonably convincing. A considerable portion of a jury, who should not be expert about machines, must be taken in by the pretence. In 2014, a chatbot named Eugene Goostman, designed to imitate a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, reportedly passed a Turing Test event by convincing 33% of judges that it was human. However, this claim was met with significant skepticism from the AI research community, who questioned the test's implementation and its relevance to AGI. In 2023, it was claimed that "AI is closer to ever" to passing the Turing test, though the article's authors reinforced that imitation (as "large language models" ever closer to passing the test are built upon) is not synonymous with "intelligence". Further, as AI intelligence and human intelligence may differ, "passing the Turing test is good evidence a system is intelligent, failing it is not good evidence a system is not intelligent." A 2024 study suggested that GPT-4 was identified as human 54% of the time in a randomized, contro
