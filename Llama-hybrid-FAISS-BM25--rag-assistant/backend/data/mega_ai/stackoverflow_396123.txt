What do you want to drag and drop? If I'm not mistaken most dragging and dropping in Visual Studio has to do with the GUI and that is completely different from the way PHP works (rendering a web page). You might try a WYSIWYG webpage design tool like Dreamweaver (commercial) or maybe something like Nvu (free, open source). But that wont help you developing the actual php 'behind' the page.
