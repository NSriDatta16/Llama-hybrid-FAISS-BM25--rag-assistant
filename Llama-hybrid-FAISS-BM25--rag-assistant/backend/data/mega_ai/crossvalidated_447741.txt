Expectation Maximization and Deep Learning

Most papers define the learning as maximizing the expectation given some function. Is the expectation maximization applicable to most deep learning models in literature? Can learning be generalized to EM algorithm ? Most of the models can be treated as probability functions, but when is this not the case? Can we express every deep learning model as part of EM training algorithm?
