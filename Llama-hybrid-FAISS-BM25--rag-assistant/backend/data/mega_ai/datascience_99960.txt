Most classification algorithms define a decision boundary between classes. Class imbalances will cause cause the learned decision boundary to have a preference for the majority class. This is preference exists because most loss functions try to minimize average error (this is best done by maximizing performance on the majority class). Then when the test data set is classified, the minority class will continue to perform worse because the decision boundary is designed to maximize majority class performance.
