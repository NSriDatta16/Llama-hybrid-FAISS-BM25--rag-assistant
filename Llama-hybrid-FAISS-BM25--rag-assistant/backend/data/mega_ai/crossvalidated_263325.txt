LOGISTICS REGRESSION FOR PREDICTING NON-BINARY OUTCOME WITH TIME SERIES I THINK?

What will I do if I have data of specific 50 employees about their gender and age and I want to know if these independent variables really affect the dependent variable which is Medical Class Type (Class A, B, C, D). Class A-very fit to Class D-not fit to work. I have the yearly data from 2012 to 2016 and I want to know what will be the possible Class Type they will have in the next 2 years perhaps. I dont know if I will use logistics regression or autoregressive time series or both. Somebody please help. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
