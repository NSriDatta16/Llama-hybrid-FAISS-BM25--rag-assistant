IE Automation with Windows PowerShell

I want to ask about manipulating IE via Powershell. My goal is to write script that will automatically perform some actions in the browser (on the client side – navigate to page, perform actions, measure time between responses, etc.) I have this little thing: $ie = new-object -com "InternetExplorer.Application" $ie.visible = $true $ie.navigate("http://google.com") Now I want to check whether the browser stopped page rendering (assuming, that google takes like 30 seconds to load). As I checked with $ie | get-member there is DocumentCompleted property (event), but I don’t know how to access/compare it. How should I do that? Or maybe I should use .NET instead COM object and initiate $ie with [system.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser] ? cheers edit: Well... $ie.busy works, but (what maybe I haven't made clear earlier) I want to know exact moment of the page rendering competition. Checking $ie.busy in infinite loop every second might work but I suppose it's not the best way to do that. Let's say page is loading some time (rendering is long due to the gigantic scripts on client side). I would like how long does it take to: load page how long it will take to reload/re-render after changing some data and clicking 'Save'.
