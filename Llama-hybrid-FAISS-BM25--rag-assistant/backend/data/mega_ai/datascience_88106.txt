Turns out I was using a wrong formula for scaling the scores. The formula Score_i= (βi × WoE_i + α/n) × Factor + Offset/n is applicable only if the logistic regression is done after doing WoE Transform, meaning for all features (not for all bins!) a WoE value is assigned and then the classifier is fit. The way I was doing it was binning first, and feeding columns with dummy values into the classifier. Reference to correct approach
