python remove text inside

I want to remove text inside tags for a block of html text. I am trying to standardize some text and remove all class, align, and other information. Every example I can find seems to deal with stripping html, and I don't want to strip the tags. I just want to make them all plain. So if I have something like this: some paragraph blah blah blah some other paragraph blah blah blah I want to return: some paragraph blah blah blah some other paragraph blah blah blah
