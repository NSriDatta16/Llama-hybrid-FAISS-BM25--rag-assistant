I found Tue Tjur's short paper "Coefficients of Determination in Logistic Regression Models - A New Proposal: The Coefficient of Discrimination" (2009, The American Statistician ) on various proposals for a coefficient of determination in logistic models quite enlightening. He does a good job highlighting pros and cons - and of course offers a new definition. Very much recommended (though I have no favorite myself).
