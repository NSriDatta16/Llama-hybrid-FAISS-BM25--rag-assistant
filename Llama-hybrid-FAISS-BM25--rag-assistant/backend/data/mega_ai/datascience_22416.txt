Passing a custom kernel with more than two arguments into `svm.SVC` in scikit-learn

I'm trying to use a custom kernel that accepts 3 arguments, with the SVM in sk-learn: def k_gaussian(_x1, _x2, _sigma): normsq = np.square(np.linalg.norm(_x1-_x2)) return np.exp(- normsq/(2 * np.square(sigma))) According to the documentation , a custom kernel must only have two arguments, which the svm.SVC class will handle automatically with the given input data. We are told to pass the custom kernel in a form like: clf = svm.SVC(kernel=my_kernel) However, I'm working on an assignment which requires us to run experiments on SVM performance with varying values of _sigma . How can I achieve that in this case? Can I pass in something like?: clf = svm.SVC(kernel=k_gaussian(_sigma=2)) Would things like decorators help me here?
