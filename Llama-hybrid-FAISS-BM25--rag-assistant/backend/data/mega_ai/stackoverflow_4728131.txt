Hope this helps, if anyone else is having this issue. Following configuration works perfectly fine for me. Windows 7 Professional 64 bit Eclipse Helios 3.6.1 64 bit (JavaEE) JDK 6u23 64 bit Android SDK 2.3 ADT 8.01 My sequence of steps: Install 64 bit JDK. Update PATH and JAVA_HOME env variables. Uncompress Android SDK and get all the required versions 7, 8 and 9. Add ANDROID_HOME env variable. Uncompress Eclipse 64 bit and install the ADT plugin and then configure the Android SDK in Preferences page of Eclipse.
