See this Eclipse bug . Your JNLP file is incorrect. Remove the line from the first tag. Specifying in the tag without any other attributes is throwing off the JNLP parser and causing the later line to be ignored. The two lines end up referring to two separate JVMs, and the first specification is 'winning'. That spec has no VM arguments on it, so the JVM starts normally, and the SWT is loaded on the wrong thread.
