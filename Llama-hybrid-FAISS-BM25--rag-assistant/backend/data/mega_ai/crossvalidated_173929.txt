Transforming a skewed data set to a Normal distribution

Say there is a skewed data set with a average of 35 and max and min points are 55 and 12 respectively. I want to know whether it is possible to transform this data set to a normal distribution so that the mean of the transformed data becomes 55? Hope the question is clear. Thanks
