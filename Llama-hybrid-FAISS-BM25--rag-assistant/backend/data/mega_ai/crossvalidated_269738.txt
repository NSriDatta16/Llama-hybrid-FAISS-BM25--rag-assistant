Data transformation before forecasting with ARIMA

I have couple of questions in times series forecasting. If the time series is nonstationary, should we make it to stationary for running auto.arima OR will this function automatically convert it? How to optimise the auto.arima ? If we take log of a time series to make it stationary, the forecasted values are in the log format. How do we convert them to the original scale?
