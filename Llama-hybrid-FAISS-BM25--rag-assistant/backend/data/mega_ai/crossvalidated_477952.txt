Simple understanding of Convolutional Neutral Network

I want to ask a basic understanding of CNN. Let say I have 1 dataset (100 pictures) with Class A (Picture of Cat: 40 pictures) Class B (Picture of Dog: 60 pictures) And then, I input 100 pictures into CNN and run it. My question is: What is the output should I look at? Is that mean if I input a picture (either Cat and Dog), I can know the picture (is cat or is a dog) by looking at the output? Thank you.
