Depending upon the operating system and NIC drivers that you're using, you can set the 802.11 NIC to Promiscuous Mode and Monitor Mode in order to capture all packets on a given channel. At least under Linux, this functionality is supposed by most drivers in conjunction with LibPCap; although Windows is another matter altogether (you'd have to use a version of Windows featuring NDIS6 - i.e. Windows Vista or Windows 7, and an external packet capturing API such as the one provided by the Microsoft Network Monitor SDK).
