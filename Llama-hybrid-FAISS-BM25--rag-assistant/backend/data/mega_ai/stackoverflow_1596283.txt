Co-Worker pushing for a scary and smelly software solution, need help!

A coder w/ a lot of clout in my office wants to go down a path I feel is instinctively wrong. We need a business rules framework for a set of web services we have for accepting certain types of xml infosets in a WCF based POX service. In the previous version we used a homebrewed rules framework that would trigger off certain data points and if those triggers were satisfied, actions associated w/ the particular rule would be taken against the xml infoset (modifications, appending, etc). Now this is a relatively large project w/ a lot of moving parts and we used the previous framework in various places all throughout the solution. I'd like to push for us to use a commercial and stable rules framework such as WWF or something similar but this guy has another idea and it seems really smelly to me even though I don't have a great argument against it. Basically, he wants to have an admin that uses CodeGen to generate scripts. This code will be stored in the DB and retrieved as necessary. The code will the be compiled into an assembly in memory and executed. When I pointed out that you can't unload an assembly in memory once it's there, he stated he doesn't care about that point. When a change is made to an existing script, he'll create a new hash to act as a new namespace and load that script as an assembly. Each script (there could be on average a hundred active) will be it's own assembly he'll load into memory dynamically. Each day he'll have IIS recycle the process to get rid of out of date assemblies. Is this really bad an idea as I think it will be and why?
