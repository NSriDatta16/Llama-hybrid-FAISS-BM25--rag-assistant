I don't see a "problem" using dots in solution file name. I did use them in the past as well. However these days, I just use short solution file names without any dots. I find it easier to read and locate, especially from recent projects list. I do indeed use dots for project files for organizing hierarchy. I guess it's just a personal preference thing for solution file names.
