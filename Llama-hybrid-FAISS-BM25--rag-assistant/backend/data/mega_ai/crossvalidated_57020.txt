How can I predict a value like this from a bayesian network model?

Let $\theta$ be the set of parameters for a Bayesian Network model. The model observes some data $D$. I want to then predict the values of some new data $D$. Why is the following true? $$ p(D'|D) = \int p(D'|\theta)p(\theta|D) d\theta $$ Does it stem from some manipulation of Bayes rule? Or the formula for expected value?
