Using a binary variable (present/absent) and its continuous counterpart (amount)

I am working on a banking-related logistic regression problem. Several of my variables are whether someone has an account of some sort, and there is a subsequent variable with the balance of the account (or zero if they don't have an account). By themselves, both variables are significantly related to the target variable; however, I worry including both will give me multicollinearity problems and probably other issues I am not aware of. How would you recommend approaching determining which variable to keep?
