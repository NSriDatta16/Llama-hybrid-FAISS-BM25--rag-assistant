Training N classifiers for N labels vs one classifier with N labels

I have a classification problem which is multi-label with N labels. I would like to know which method would be the better choice? Training N classifiers (1 for each label) or a single classifier which use K-hot encoding. I'm using a neural network for this with a softmax at the last layer. (Is there any chance that the softmax would cause a problem?) I'm using tensorflow for the model.
