Reference request: initializing big neural networks with small neural networks

I am currently trying some meta-algorithms on training neural networks. Start with a small but expressive enough network for training and after several epochs, initialize a larger neural network with the trained weight in the small neural network. It seems to me that we can gain marginal improvement in the optimization speed in terms of time. I believe there are already lots of paper in this direction but could not find any paper related possibly because I am using a wrong key word. I wonder where I can find relevant papers, thanks in advance.
