You want Date instead of Time : require 'date' now = Date.today before = Date.civil(2000, 1, 1) difference_in_days = (now - before).to_i (difference_in_days/365.25).to_i Will give you the difference in years between today and January 1st 2000. It can probably be improved, I just used the average number of days per year (365.25), which will give you the right answer except in extreme edge cases. You can also do something like this: require 'date' years = 0 d = Date.civil(2000, 1, 1) loop do d = d.next_year break if Date.today But Date#next_year was introduced in Ruby 1.9, so it wouldn't work in 1.8.7. Of course, the easiest way of determining the number of years between two dates is just subtracting the numbers: 2010 - 2000 # => 10
