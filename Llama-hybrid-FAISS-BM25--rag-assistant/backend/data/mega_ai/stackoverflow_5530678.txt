So you are looking for "spikes" in the graph. I'm guessing you are interested in the size and position of each group? You might use something like this: Sort the numbers Loop: Take the highest number you have Investigate more numbers until you find a number that is too small to belong to the group (maybe 5% smaller) Calculate the average of the selected numbers Let the discarded number be the last number End loop
