Initialize the List with the capacity you expect it to consume: List myList = new List (maxRows); Sidenote: If you generate 'very' large lists, the internally increasing storage arrays over time sum up to twice the storage you really need. But if for 1000 entries you already slow down, I suggest investigating the true reason for it with a profiler. May the strings grow to large ?
