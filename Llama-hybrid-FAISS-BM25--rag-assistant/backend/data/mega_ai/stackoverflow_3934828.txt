Are you using the ssh:// URLs for bitbucket or the https:// URLs? Bitbucket offers both. If it's ssh you need to use ssh-agent or similar ( [auth] sections aren't used by ssh) to keep a key in memory or switch to the https: URLs. You could also try adding bitbucket.schemes = http https just in case, though if you're using the https:// URLs the default value of https should be fine. Also be aware that bitbucket usernames are case sensitive -- that got me for awhile. If none of that's working for you try turning on debugging with --debug and see if there are any messages that help.
