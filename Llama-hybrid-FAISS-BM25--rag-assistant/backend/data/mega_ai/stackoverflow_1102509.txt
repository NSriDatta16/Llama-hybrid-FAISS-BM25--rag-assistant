How can I remotely deploy a rich client in .Net?

Currently we run our web applications on a thin client browser IE 6 and it is slow. We are a non-profit organization. All our offices are linked via VPN. Opera 10 browser allows one to convert one's PC into a server. I am thinking of deploying our application and Opera 10 on every client, meaning that the every client would run a server which in turn would run our application. Therefore, the clients would connect only to our database. This would speed things up. However, I would need to deploy updates to our application from time to time. How can I deploy a web application to the clients PC's remotely? Our app is .Net.
