I think you're misunderstanding what's going on here...it's almost always incorrect to use the distinct result transformer in conjunction with paging. Think about it, you're only getting the first 20 rows of a cross-product given that query above. I'm guessing that several of your clients at the end of the list aren't having their collections populated because of this, leading to your N+1 issue. If you need to do the paging operation, consider using the batch-size hint on your collection mapping to help minimize the N+1 issue. Note: if your typical use case is to show pages of 20 at a time, set the batch-size to this value.
