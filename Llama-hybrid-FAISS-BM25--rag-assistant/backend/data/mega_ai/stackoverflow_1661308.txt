Outlook can be quite useful in this space. Its task management isn't the most obvious of candidates for simple prioritisation, but if you create yourself some simple categories, such as "1 - Do now", "2 - Do this week", "3 - Do soon", "4 - Do sometime", or whatever approach you take, you're then all set to track tasks. When you create a task, you can assign it an initial category (I create a keyboard shortcut for this - ctrl-F2, ctrl-F3, etc). When you have your tasks in the system with an initial category, set your to-do bar to be sorted by category. You'll then find the things you're doing right now at the top of your list. The beauty is that you can drag and drop a task from one category to another, and outlook reassigns the new category. Outlook also maintains the order of the tasks within a category, so you can actually prioritise even within categories, just by dragging a task above or below its neighbours. A nice simple system. You can also easily convert e-mails to tasks by dragging them in from your inbox. And you can also take task lists from sharepoint sites, and categorise them in the same way.
