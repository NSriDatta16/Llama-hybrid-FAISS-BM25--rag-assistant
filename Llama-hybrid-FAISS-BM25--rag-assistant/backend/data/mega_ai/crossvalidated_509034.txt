Should we keep the detrended time series when predicting?

I am learning about exploring traditional TS. According to this notebook , detrending is necessary for time series predicting models When a time series is stationary, it can be easier to model. Statistical modeling methods assume or require the time series to be stationary. Yet when I want to predict the next move with SARIMAX, do I need to keep the detrended time series or the original time series? Here is the tail of the original time series: >>> df_settle.tail() Date 2020-10-01 211.905228 2020-11-01 201.941315 2020-12-01 216.210007 2021-01-01 222.419998 2021-02-01 239.649994 Freq: MS, Name: Close, dtype: float64 If I keep the detrended the prediction doesn't make much sense: df_log = np.log(df_settle) df_log_ma = df_log.rolling(2).mean() df_detrend = df_log - df_log_ma df_detrend.dropna(inplace = True) import itertools import warnings from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX warnings.filterwarnings("ignore") def arima_grid_search(dataframe, s): p = d = q = range(2) param_combinations = list(itertools.product(p, d, q)) lowest_aic, pdq, pdqs = None, None, None total_iterations = 0 for order in param_combinations: for (p, d, q) in param_combinations: seasonal_order = (p, d, q, s) total_iterations +=1 try: model = SARIMAX(df_settle, order=order, seasonal_order = seasonal_order, enforce_stationarity=False, enforce_invertibility=False, disp=False ) model_result = model.fit(maxiter=200, disp=False) if not lowest_aic or model_result.aic Indeed, I get: >>> prediction_ci.head(3) lower Close upper Close 2020-04-01 -0.090269 0.051201 2020-05-01 -0.071606 0.069863 2020-06-01 -0.042065 0.099405 Which doesn't make much sense compared to the last value of the original dataframe: 239.649994 for 2021-02-01
