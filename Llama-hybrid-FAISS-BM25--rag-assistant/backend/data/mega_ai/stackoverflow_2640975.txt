Use 'background-color' instead of 'backgroundcolor' . Remove the !important . You can't set this property from Javascript. You shouldn't put the semicolon at the end of the value. Update: In addition to the above, it seems that this is not an HTML element. You need to use a proper selector here, e.g. $('#someid') to select the element with id='someid' . If you want to change the body background, use $('body') . To summarize, you should be left with: $('body').css('background-color', localStorage.getItem('bgColorr'));
