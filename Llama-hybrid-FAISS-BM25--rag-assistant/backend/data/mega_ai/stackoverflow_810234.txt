Ok, wow. Hard question. So I have not found a way to get the style of a given character. You can, however, get the MutableAttributeSet for a given character and then test to see if the style is in that attribute set. Style s; //your style Element run = styledDocument.getCharacterElement( textPane.getSelectionStart() ); MutableAttributeSet curAttr = ( MutableAttributeSet )run.getAttributes(); boolean containsIt = curAttr.containsAttributes( s ); One problem with getting the Style for a range of characters is that there may be more than one style applied to that range (example: you may select text where some is bold and some is not). To update the selected text you can: Style s; //your style JTextPane textPane; //your textpane textPane.setCharacterAttributes( s, false ); Oh, and it appears that the function getLogicalStyle doesn't work because it's returning the default style (or maybe just the style) for the paragraph that contains p, rather than the the style of the character at p.
