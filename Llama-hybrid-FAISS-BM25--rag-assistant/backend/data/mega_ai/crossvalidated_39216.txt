Selecting the best indicator of disease progression

Quite a while ago, I asked a question for which Peter Ellis provided a very interesting answer. Now I'd like to follow on that and have your comments and ideas on how to actually put it to use. I try to restate the problem, hopefully this time in a more clear way using a synthetic example. Problem : Two groups of subjects participate in a longitudinal study. One is a control group and the another is a group of subjects with a degenerative disease. That is to say, from all other sources we know and expect to see a decline in the conditions of the subjects as time goes by. Over the course of the study, we measure all subject using a series of performance measures $M_{1}...M_{n}$. Our research question is: which of these measures can pickup the decline in patient's conditions the best. Suggested solution : Peter's insight was to build a theoretical response variable and use model selection methods to see which of $M_{1}...M_{n}$ could predict it the best. Here is a simple simulation with 2 measures to demonstrate the problem the best: library(ggplot2) library(nlme) set.seed(1234) # Followups in the longitudinal study t Here are the plots of measures over the time: Now to build a theoretical response: In the case, we'd like to see a constant response over the time for the control group and a change of performance for the patients. Also, at the baseline groups are typically already a bit different. # The desired, theoretical response data$theory Here is the plot of the theoretical response: Notice that the exact value of the slope and the differences between the two groups in this theoretical curve should not be important as long as model we fit could consider them. Finally, we fit a linear mixed model for each measure as well as a null model: fit.0 I fit the models with ML option as I'm interested in comparing the fixed effects. The final step is to compare the models to pickup the best measure of the disease progress. I use $AIC_{c}$ for this purpose. The AICcmodavg has a convenient function to build an $AIC$ table for us: library(AICcmodavg) f The results suggest that $M_{1}$ is the best predictor of the theoretical response here. Now what I'd like to know is: Do you think the whole idea of this approach to pickup the best measure related to disease progression make sense? Have you seen something similar? Is this the right way to do it? Do you think the theoretical model I built is sound? Are there cases that this model would mislead us? Can we expand the same kind of approach for picking up the best measures in other types of designs (like e.g. before/after interventions, comparing two different interventions)? Any other comments or suggestions? EDIT : I changed bio-marker to measure in the text as I suspected that saying what we deal with are bio-markers draws attention to issues that are not pertinent to this narrow definition of the problem. EDIT : With this approach looking at combination of measures is easy. For example: fit.3 In this example, the $AIC_{C}$ of fit.3 will be slightly worse than the model with only $M_{1}$ (i.e. fit.1).
