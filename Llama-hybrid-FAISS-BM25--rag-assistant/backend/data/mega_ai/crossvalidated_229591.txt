Counting the number of total connections (weights) in a Deep Neural Net

I am looking for a reasonable estimate of how many total connections (weights) there are in a given neural net. My prior would be that if it is a vanilla ANN with 3 layers of 1200 neurons apiece it would be: (1200^2)*2 . Since each neuron on each layer connects to every other neuron there are 1200^2 between each layer. On a 3 layer ANN there are 2 "in-between" layers. Is this correct? Also, how would this change for RNN's with self-directed loops (and LSTM RNN's)?
