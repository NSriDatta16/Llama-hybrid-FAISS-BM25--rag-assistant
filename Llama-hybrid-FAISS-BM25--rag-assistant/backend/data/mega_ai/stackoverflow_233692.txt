It would seem like one application would best fit your scenario... as others have said... A good rule of thumb would be that the average behaving mongrel will consume 60mb of memory (or less)... take your total RAM available, subtract out for any other services (database, memcache, etc) and then figure out how many pieces of the pie you can have left from the remaining memory. You can always scale them up or down from there...
