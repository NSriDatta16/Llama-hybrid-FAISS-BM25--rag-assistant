Is it allowed to include time as a predictor in mixed models?

I always believed that time should not be used as a predictor in regressions (incl. gam's) because, then, one would simply "describe" the trend itself. If the aim of a study is to find environmental parameters like temperature etc. that explain the variance in, letÂ´s say, activity of an animal, then I wonder, how can time be of any use? as a proxy for unmeasured parameters? Some trends in time on activity data of harbor porpoises can be seen here: -> How to handle gaps in a time series when doing GAMM? my problem is: when I include time in my model (measured in julian days), then 90% of all other parameters become insignificant (ts-shrinkage smoother from mgcv kick them out). If I leave time out, then some of them are significant... The question is: is time allowed as a predictor (maybe even needed?) or is it messing up my analysis? many thanks in advance
