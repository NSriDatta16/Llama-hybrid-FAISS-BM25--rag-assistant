I agree with the other posts about leveraging elements of a preexisting/licensed codebase, performance, etc. One thing I'd like to add is it's hard to pull nasty DRM tricks through a virtual machine. Also I think there's a hubris component where project managers think they can make stable/reliable code with C++ with all the perks like having absolute control over their tools and resources, BUT without all the negatives that complicate and bog down their competition because "we're smarter than they are".
