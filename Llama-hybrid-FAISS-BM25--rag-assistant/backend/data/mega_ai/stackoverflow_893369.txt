Disclaimer This will work as I am using it in my application extensively. That being said I would pursue the User Control route as depending on how far you carry the embedding things start to flake out . FYI Yes this is possible. This is how: public static void ShowFormInContainerControl(Control ctl, Form frm) { frm.TopLevel = false; frm.FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.None; frm.Dock = DockStyle.Fill; frm.Visible = true; ctl.Controls.Add(frm); } I have that in a Class Library and then I call it like so from the FORM I want to embed. public FrmCaseNotes FrmCaseNotes; FrmCaseNotes = new FrmCaseNotes(); WinFormCustomHandling.ShowFormInContainerControl(tpgCaseNotes, FrmCaseNotes); Where tpgCaseNotes is the control I want Form FrmCaseNotes embedded in. In this case a tab page on the Form I am calling from.
