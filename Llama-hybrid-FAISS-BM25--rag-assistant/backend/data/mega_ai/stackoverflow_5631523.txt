I suggest you redesign your database so that the field in the protocol buffer message that you want to modify, is in a separate database column. Therefore, instead of serializing the entire protocol buffers message in one column (which is what I presume you have now in your database) you would represent it in some other way. Then you can just use a simple SQL UPDATE command. I mean, it makes little sense to use a database designed for relational data storage, to store serialized data that needs to be updated. It gets in the way of using SQL efficiently. Alternatively, I don't know if there are databases specialised for working with protocol buffers, but there certainly are XML databases which are purportedly specialised for processing XML documents, so you could try converting your data to XML and using one of them. It's probably overkill for this one single problem though! But if you are going to have lots of little tasks like this to perform, it might be worthwhile. However, without more details about what your application and/or database are used for, it's difficult to say what would be best.
