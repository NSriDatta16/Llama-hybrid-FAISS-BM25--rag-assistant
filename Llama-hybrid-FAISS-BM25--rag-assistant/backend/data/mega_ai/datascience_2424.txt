I would recommend those materials: Python Python for Data Analysis - book which nicely covers Pandas workflow with IPython. Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow - slightly more advanced book about using Scikit-Learn and Tensor flow in data science projects R Coursera Data Science Specialisation - free nine one month time consuming courses which introduces R step by step from beginning to machine learning. Data Camp courses - at least 4 free courses covering topics from data analysis.
