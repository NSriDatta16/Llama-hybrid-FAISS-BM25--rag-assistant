Define "responsive." Do you mean that you want UI cues to continue to happen, or that you want to continue to be able to do other things in the UI while it's processing the files? The former is easy, you can just toss in the occasional Application.DoEvents() in your loops. This will prompt the UI to perform any cues that are waiting (such as draw the window, etc.). The latter is going to involve multi-threading. Diving into that is a bit more complex than can be taught in a paragraph or two, but some Google searches for "c# .net multi threading tutorial" should yield a ton of results. If you're not familiar with the basic concept of what multi-threading provides, I can further explain it.
