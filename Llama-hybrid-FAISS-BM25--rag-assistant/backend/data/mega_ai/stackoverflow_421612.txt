Very, very large C# floating-point numbers

I am doing some population modeling (for fun, mostly to play with the concepts of Carrying Capacity and the Logistics Function). The model works with multiple planets (about 100,000 of them, right now). When the population reaches carrying capacity on one planet, the inhabitants start branching out to nearby planets, and so on. Problem: 100,000+ planets can house a LOT of people. More than a C# Decimal can handle. Since I'm doing averages and other stuff with these numbers, I need the capability to work with floating points (or I'd just use a BigInt library). Does anyone know of a BigFloatingPoint class (or whatever) I can use? Google is being very unhelpful today. I could probably write a class that would work well enough, but I'd rather use something pre-existing, if such a thing exists.
