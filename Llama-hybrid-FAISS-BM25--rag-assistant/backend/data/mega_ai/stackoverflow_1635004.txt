It depends on what you want to test. It's possible to do full integration tests and there is some value in that (checking serialization, for instance). One simple way to get good test coverage with minimal work is as follows: Write one or more plain old classes that do the real work (use TDD if desired) Test these classes in isolation Have your WebMethods delegate to these classes.
