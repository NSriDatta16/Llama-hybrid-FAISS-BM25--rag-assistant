Looks like you might have Register Globals turned on. if (ini_get('register_globals')) { die("Register Globals is ON - This is BAD"); } else { die("Register Globals is OFF - This is GOOD"); } The idea was that - with register globals - you could use a variable $T as a shorthand for $_GLOBALS['T'] ... or $_GET['T'] or $_POST['T'] or (of course) $_SESSION['T'] . If it sounds like a bad idea, that's because it is (was) and has now been so aggressively discouraged that it is deprecated and usually off by default.
