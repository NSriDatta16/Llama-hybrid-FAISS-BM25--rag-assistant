CocoaTouch equivalent of Java custom protocol handler

I'd like to pretend to be new to CocoaTouch but since I've been using it for over a year I'll just jump right out and claim stoopidity. Is there an easy/elegant way to intercept HTTP calls in CocoaTouch and route them through a custom class. In Java I could implement a custom protocol handler and change the URL protocol from "http:" to something like "myproto:". Is there something similar in ObjC?
