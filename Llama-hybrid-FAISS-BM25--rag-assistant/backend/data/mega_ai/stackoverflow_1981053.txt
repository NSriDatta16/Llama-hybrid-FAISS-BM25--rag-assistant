PMBOK is just a naff industry standard used to give the management in organization A who don't know any better the (false) peace of mind that organization B is doing things in the 'correct' PMI certified way. Scrum as Pedro said is an agile project management technique that revolves around working in fixed iterations which is highly regarded by most software professionals. Although Scrum doesn't prescribe any engineering techniques it is commonly used in conjunction with the engineering techniques outlined in XP (Extreme Programming) such as pair programming and continuous integration. For business reasons some companies have to at least appear to follow PMI, CMMI or ISO in order to win work, but in reality most serious software shops are practicing agile techniques such as scrum/xp/kanban behind the scenes.
