snmp: correct behavior when only part of a table index is given?

Assume a MIB contains a table indexed by MAC address. What's the correct behavior by the agent when a manager requests myTable.0.1 ? This is an incomplete index. Some possibilities that I see: Return the first row in the table -- treat this partial index as coming before the first row. Treat this as a subtree -- return rows in the table that match this MAC prefix. Return no rows -- treat this as coming after the last row in the table. Return some kind of error?
