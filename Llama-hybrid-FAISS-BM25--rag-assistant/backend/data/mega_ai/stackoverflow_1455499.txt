Usability studies (I can't find the pdf) showed that at the exact same duration, loading bars with different patterns (exponential, linear, logaritmig), the ones that "felt faster" where the ones that completed exponentialy. By that I mean, the ones that start slow, but get faster as time passes. What I normally do is: If I know the average time the process can take, alocate for a little more, and go slow until last 20%-10%, then the progress bar speeds up and catches up with the real progress, with such a timing that the process ends at the moment that the bar has the fastest speed. If I don't know how long it could take, I measure many times to have the ballpark (seconds? minutes? hours?) If its a repetitive operation with little variation between runs, I take into account the last runs time. If its a long running operation or with high variability, I don't use a progress bar, but rather an animation to show that I'm working. Just don't lie to your users. Never tell them it will be over in a minute and half an hour later be still running.
