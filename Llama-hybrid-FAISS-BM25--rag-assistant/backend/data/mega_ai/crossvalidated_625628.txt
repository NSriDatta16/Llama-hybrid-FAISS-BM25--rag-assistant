How to report a difference in means - Demographics

First of all sorry for the question, I'm having a hard time with statistics :) I have conducted a survey for my thesis and am currently analyzing and reporting the results. At the end of my survey, I have asked participants about their attitudes toward different concepts (each measured by a singular likert-type item). Now, I would like to highlight differences between respondents of different gender. I have not formulated hypotheses or anything here, but I think it's still interesting to mention. One exemplary insight reads: "On average and compared to women, men reported a more positive attitude toward Artificial intelligence (Mmale = 5.6, SD = 1.423, Mfemale = 4.38, SD = 1.210)." Now my question is: Does this statement provide any additional value or do I need to conduct another test that examines significance, before reporting it (Mann-Whitney U in this case)? It seems a bit excessive to me to do it for every question and I am also wondering how to report if there is no significance. Can I just mention it or do I also need some values like here: "A Mann-Whitney U test revealed no statistically significant difference in attitudes between men and women (U = 8025.000, z = -0,431, p = 0.618)." Sorry and thanks!
