The short answer is that once you turn on trigger:'manual' , tipsy doesn't take care of delayIn any more. Your best bet might be to just have your manual trigger (wherever you do ...tipsy('show') ) do a delay instead: setTimeout("\$('#link').tipsy('show');",3000); You could also look at the tipsy source to see that they have a slightly more elegant version that you could work from: function enter() { var tipsy = get(this); tipsy.hoverState = 'in'; if (options.delayIn == 0) { tipsy.show(); } else { setTimeout(function() { if (tipsy.hoverState == 'in') tipsy.show(); }, options.delayIn); } }
