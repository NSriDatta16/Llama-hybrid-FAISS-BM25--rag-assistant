Hashchange jQuery plugin - obtaining the current hash when clicking an anchor

I'm using hashchange jQuery plugin from http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/ to hook up an event when the window's location.hash changes. I'd like to trigger a function when the hash changes that passes the new hash value (obtained with event.fragment ) and the current hash value (the value just before the event is fired). Here's a snipped of what I'd like to achieve: $(window).bind('hashchange', function(event){ myFunction(event.fragment, /* currentHash */); }); Is this possible?
