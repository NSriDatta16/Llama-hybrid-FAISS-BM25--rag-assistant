Mathematical algorithm for bots detecting

I'm faced with the task and I need the help of senior statisticians.There are a lot of virtual gambling, for example poker, it is need to detect bots. There are a lot of fixed indicators (mouse movement, clicks and so on).How to determine whether a bot is playing or a person on the basis of these data. Is the time series analysis relevant here? Thank you. do you want to detect on the session level or on the account level - i.e. can a legit account have a bot only playing sometimes? I want on the session level Do you have any labeled data? If you don't, the problem becomes MUCH harder. The problem is that there are no labeled data, so here it is necessary to determine somehow, if they were, I would use logistic regression, but how to define bots without labeled data? Can you suggest me? –êre there any such algorithms?
