How can I handle a column with list data?

I have a dataset which I processed and created six features: ['session_id', 'startTime', 'endTime', 'timeSpent', 'ProductList', 'totalProducts'] And the target variable is a binary class (gender). The feature 'productList' is a list: df['ProductList'].head() Out[169]: 0 [13, 25, 113, 13793, 2, 25, 113, 1946, 2, 25, ... 1 [12, 31, 138, 14221, 1, 31, 138, 1979, 1, 31, ... 2 [13, 23, 127, 8754, 0] 3 [13, 26, 125, 5726, 2, 26, 125, 5727, 2, 26, 1... 4 [12, 23, 119, 14805, 1, 23, 119, 14806, 0] Name: ProductList, dtype: object Now, it is obvious that I can't use this feature as it is. How do I handle this feature? I can explode the list and create a row for each list item, but will it serve my purpose? Update: I applied OHE after exploding the list, and it results in 10k+ columns, which my GCP instance and my computer can't handle; when applying PCA. PS: There are over 17,000 unique products.
