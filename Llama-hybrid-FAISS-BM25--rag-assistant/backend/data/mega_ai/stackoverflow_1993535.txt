I would keep them organized in groups, rather than all together, or all in their own files. For instance, if your have Create , Edit , Delete methods for Messages , put these inside a Messages.php file. /messages.php?a=create // Create new message /messages.php?a=edit&p=12 // Edit message #12 /messages.php?a=delete&p=12 // Delete message #12
