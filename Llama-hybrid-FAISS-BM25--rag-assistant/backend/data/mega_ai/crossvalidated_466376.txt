Benefits of random search over other optimization methods in Neural Network hyperparameter tuning

When reading about methods of hyperparameter tuning of neural networks, I have mainly come across grid search and random search in textbooks and articles online. I was wondering why other optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing or Genetic Algorithms not used? Are there any benefits to random search over the others?
