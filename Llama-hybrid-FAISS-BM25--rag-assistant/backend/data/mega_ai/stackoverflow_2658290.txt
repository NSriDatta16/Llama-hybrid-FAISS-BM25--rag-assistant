You can't. Not with 100% accuracy. The best method that is to check the user agent, however the user is free not to supply it, or fake it so try to avoid relying on it. $ua = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']; If the browser is IE, it should (roughtly) match (Where # is a number) Mozilla/#.0 (compatible; MSIE #.##; For which the regex would be something like '~^Mozilla/[0-9]\.0 (compatible;\s+MSIE~i' Alternatively you could just check for the string "MSIE" which would be simpler and slightly less strict. But as @Michal said, there are other (better) implmentations on the get_browser manual page
