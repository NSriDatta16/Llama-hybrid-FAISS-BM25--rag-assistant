Adding up time durations in Python

I would like to add up a series of splits in Python. The times begin as strings like "00:08:30.291". I can't seem to find the right way to use the Python objects or API to make this convenient/elegant. It seems that the time object doesn't use microseconds, so I'm using datetime's strptime to parse the strings, successfully. But then datetimes don't seem to add, and I really prefer not to overflow into days (i.e. 23 + 2 hours = 25 hours). I can use datetime.time but they don't add either. Timedeltas would seem appropriate but seem a little awkward to convert from/to other things. Perhaps I am missing something obvious here. I would like to be able to: for timestring in times: t = datetime.strptime("%H:%M:%S.%f", timestring).time total_duration = total_duration + t print total_duration.strftime("%H:%M:%S.%f")
