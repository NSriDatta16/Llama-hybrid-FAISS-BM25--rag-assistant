Looking for animals dataset for Deep Learning classification

Do you know any datasets that contain animals and their accurate classifications? I am looking for any dataset that categorizes animals. For example: a dataset with insects, with an image of an insect and its scientific name as label a dataset with dogs of different breeds, their scientific names and images. a dataset with Myriapodes (like centipedes or millipedes), images and their names as labels mammals birds reptiles ... Generally, I am looking for datasets of all animals worldwide, classified as good as possible. I would very much appreciate it! Here a list of possible classes (superclasses, groups, etc.).
