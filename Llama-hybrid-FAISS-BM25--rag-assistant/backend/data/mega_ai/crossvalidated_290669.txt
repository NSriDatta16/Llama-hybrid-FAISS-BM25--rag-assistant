Multinomial logistic regression with same DV but different baseline, how to correct p value

I have run a multinomial logistic regression with one dependent variable (category) and 28 independent variables. In order to compare each category with each category, I run the test 10 times, use the same dependent variable, but each time set one category as the baseline. So, will this be considered as multiple times of running? Do I need to use Bonferroni correction to adjust p-value? The reviewer asked me to do so but I doubt if it is necessary.
