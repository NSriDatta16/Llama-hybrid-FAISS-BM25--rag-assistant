Using random forest in MATLAB

I am having issues in using random forests in MATLAB. I have features of size 2000 and around 4000 data points. I am trying to learn how to compute random forests in MATLAB using the library Random Forest . However, I guess it's too slow to use this method. I have set the number of trees to 500 and mtry to 720 and it is taking ages. Is it natural to take this long? How long does it normally take?
