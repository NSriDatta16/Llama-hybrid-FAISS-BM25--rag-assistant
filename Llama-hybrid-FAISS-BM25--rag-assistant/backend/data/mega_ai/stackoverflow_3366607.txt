The compiler can insert padding between members or at the end of the struct. Padding between members is typically done to keep the members aligned to maximize access speed. Padding at the end is done for roughly the same reason, in case you decide to create an array of the structs. To prevent it from happening, you use something like #pragma pack(1) .
