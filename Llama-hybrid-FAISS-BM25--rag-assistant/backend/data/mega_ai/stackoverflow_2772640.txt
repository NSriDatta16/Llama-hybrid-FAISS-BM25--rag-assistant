Dragging not working on Custom class inherited from Moviclip

EDIT: If I have a class called Items and it has a movieclip instance which is loaded from a url. The startDrag on item fails. If Items contains a movieclip which we initiate from a SWC (not load it) on Drag works fine. Now how to solve the issue where I have a class which has a movieClip loaded from outside. I have the following code: package { import flash.display.Sprite; import flash.events.MouseEvent; import lib.CustomEvents.ItemLoadCompleteEvent; import lib.Room.Item; import lib.Room.ItemStruct; public class DragTest extends Sprite { private var itemInstance:Item; public function DragTest() { var tempItemStruct:ItemStruct = new ItemStruct("test",0,0,200,250,"wall","","inventory"); itemInstance = new Item(tempItemStruct); itemInstance.addEventListener(ItemLoadCompleteEvent.CONTROL_TYPE,loadComplete); stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP,mouseUp); } private function loadComplete(e:ItemLoadCompleteEvent):void { itemInstance.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN,mouseDown); this.addChild(itemInstance); } private function mouseUp(e:MouseEvent):void { itemInstance.stopDrag(); trace("MouseUp"); } private function mouseDown(e:MouseEvent):void { itemInstance.startDrag(); trace("MouseDown"); } } } I have used the same code with a normal clip and it works. When I use it with my own defined item it does not work. Here are the details. itemStruct: containing the properties of the item to be made. item : Loads the itemstruct defined item and puts it in a movieclip (item is inherited from movieclip) Traces from the above code, show that only the mouseUp function works mouseDown does not work. Though the same code works fine for a simple movieclip I have already tried stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN,mouseDown); EDIT: I have tried put the mouseDown on stage again if I click outside the item and drag from stage it both mouseDown and Up seem to work. But If I click on the item and drag. Still no luck. I have also added the item as movieclip on stage.
