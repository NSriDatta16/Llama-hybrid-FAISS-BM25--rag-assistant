I would guess that MySQL fulltext is sufficient for your needs, but it's worth noting that the built in support doesn't scale very well. For average size documents it starts to become unusable for table sizes as small as a few hundred thousand rows. If you think that this might become a problem further on you should probably look into Sphinx already. It's becoming the defacto standard for MYSQL-users, even though I personally prefer to implement my own solution using java lucene. :) Also, I'd like to mention that full text search is fundamentally different from the standard LIKE '%keyword%'-search. Unlike the LIKE-search full text indexing allows you to search for several keywords that doesn't have to appear right next to each other. Standard search engines such as google are full text search engines, for example.
