How do I learn a simple cut-off value between 2 classes given one-dimensional data?

Given a set of data which consists of a single real number and a class, I want to find a value (i.e., the inflection point if we were talking about logistic regression) which would lie right at the boundary of the two classes. What is the simplest way to do this using scikit-learn?
