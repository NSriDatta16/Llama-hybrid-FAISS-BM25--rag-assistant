error importing certificate to keychain Access, Error: 100013

I am trying to provision my iPhone for development; I followed all the steps the developer portal to adding and making the keychains and whatnot, but after trying double-click the certificate, as it says in the developer portal, keychain access gives me an error: An error occurred. Unable to import “iPhone Developer: Kevin Mendoza (RT5V4VKW2T)”. Error: 100013 also, in xcode in the organizer it gives me an error associated with the keychain: A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain (all yellow banded looking and search) How do I fix this?
