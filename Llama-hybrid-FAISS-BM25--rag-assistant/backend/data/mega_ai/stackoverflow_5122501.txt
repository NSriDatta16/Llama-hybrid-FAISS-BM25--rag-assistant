What Jeremiah said, plus the compiler issues the warning because the production: *src ="anotherstring"; says: take the address of "anotherstring" -- "anotherstring" IS a char pointer -- and store that pointer indirect through src (*src = ... ) into the first char of the string "abcdef..." The warning might be baffling because there is nowhere in your code any mention of any integer: the warning seems nonsensical. But, out of sight behind the curtain, is the rule that "int" and "char" are synonymous in terms of storage: both occupy the same number of bits. The compiler doesn't differentiate when it issues the warning that you are storing into an integer. Which, BTW, is perfectly OK and legal but probably not exactly what you want in this code. -- pete
