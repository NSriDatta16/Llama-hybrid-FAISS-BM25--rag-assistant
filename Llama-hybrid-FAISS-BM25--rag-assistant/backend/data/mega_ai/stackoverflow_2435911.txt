updating a shape in scene with a for loop using javafx

Following is a code fragment. I am updating a rectangle using a for loop when a button is pressed. This is a model for my ultimate intention of showing visualization of data model as it changes large number of times inside a for loop. It works but I see only one change. Now since I am changing the width randomly I should see large number of changes. It seems I am making a wrong assumption on something basic. The code goes below: 7 var rec: Rectangle = Rectangle { 8 x: 10, y: 10 9 width: 140, height: 90 10 fill: Color.BLACK 11 } 12 13 Stage { 14 title: "MyApp" 15 scene: Scene { 16 width: 200 17 height: 200 18 content: [ 19 rec, 20 Button { 21 text: "Button" 22 action: function () { 23 for (i in [1..999]) { 24 rec.width = 25 + java.lang.Math.random()*50; 25 } 26 } 27 } 28 ] 29 } 30 }
