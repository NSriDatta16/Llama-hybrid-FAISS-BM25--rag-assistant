I searched the entire PHPUnit manual and didn't find anything. You can ignore code for the purposes of test coverage, but that's about it. However, this ChangeLog (in an apparent fork) mentions that it will "Ignore test file names that are prefixed with . " I haven't tried that, but it's worth a shot. Or you could comment out the test. I'm assuming you'd like something like NUnit offers where it will report the ignored tests; I didn't find anything like that.
