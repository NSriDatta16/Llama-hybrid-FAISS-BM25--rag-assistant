How do you want to save a website's content as csv file? CSV means comma separated values, and it's really easy to save things as csv file but a website's content? You say "the content from a website" - normally you'll start reading one sites content, which includes html markup, scripts and styles. Or do you only want to get the text contents or some meta data? If your server supports opening urls via fopen I'd try this one (php.ini option: allow_url_fopen ) - otherwise you'll have to use cURL or something. Here 's some more information about reading websites in php. Regarding the storage of websites as csv I think you should be more precise what you want to achieve. Regards, Daniel
