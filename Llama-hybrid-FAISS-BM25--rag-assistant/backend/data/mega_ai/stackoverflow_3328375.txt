Inno Setup: How do I see the output (translation) of the Inno Setup Preprocessor?

I have an Inno Setup script with preprocessor directives ( #define s, #if s, etc.) I want to run the Inno Setup preprocessor on my script and see the preprocessor's output (translation in Inno-Setup-speak). That is, I want to look at the result of the preprocessor which it normally feeds into the Inno Setup Compiler, where all the references to {#something} are changed into whatever something was defined as. I look at the command line options (of iscc.exe ) and #pragma directives and did not find what I'm looking for. I see that I can specify not to run the compiler ( #pragma -c- | /$c- ) but I did not find a way to look at the output of the preprocessor. In short, how do I look at the output of the Inno Setup preprocessor?
