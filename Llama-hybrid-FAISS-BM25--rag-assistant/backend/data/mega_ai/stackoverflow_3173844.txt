How to organize downloaded demos, source code, open source projects utility etc. on Windows?

I have already asked this question on SuperUser but it was suggested there that I should ask it on SO. So here. As a programmer, I downloads many files that includes small utilities from codeplex or google code, sample source code from code project, other free tools/utilities. Usually these files have meaningless file names. The file remains in the download folder. After some time I forget what this file is. Is there any tool/utility to organize such files. I am looking for a tool with following features: Allow me to categorize the files such as sample code, .Net utility, Java utility etc. Store the information from where I downloaded this file. store small description of the file. List or information about the related file. Usually I save the original article with the downloaded code sample in pdf format.
