Silverlight 3 with WCF Service -

I've got a SL3 app trying to connect to a WFC service. Both the app and the service are on different secure servers on the same domain. The SL3 app lives here: https://www-r.aetc.af.mil/fm/tools/batsnet/authenticated/modules/blah blah When the SL app starts, it immediately connects to the service, but when it makes it's first call into the service, I get this exception: An exception occurred during the operation, making the result invalid. Check InnerException for exception details. at System.ComponentModel.AsyncCompletedEventArgs.RaiseExceptionIfNecessary() at FMDashboard2.FMDashSvc3Ref.GetMetricDataCompletedEventArgs.get_Result() at FMDashboard2.Objects.DataRetrieval.service_GetMetricDataCompleted(Object sender, GetMetricDataCompletedEventArgs e) ============ Inner exception: An error occurred while trying to make a request to URI 'https://bats.aetc.af.mil/fm/tools/FMDashSvc/FMDash3.svc'. This could be due to attempting to access a service in a cross-domain way without a proper cross-domain policy in place, or a policy that is unsuitable for SOAP services. You may need to contact the owner of the service to publish a cross-domain policy file and to ensure it allows SOAP-related HTTP headers to be sent. This error may also be caused by using internal types in the web service proxy without using the InternalsVisibleToAttribute attribute. Please see the inner exception for more details. at System.ServiceModel.AsyncResult.End[TAsyncResult](IAsyncResult result) at System.ServiceModel.Channels.ServiceChannel.SendAsyncResult.End(SendAsyncResult result) at System.ServiceModel.Channels.ServiceChannel.EndCall(String action, Object[] outs, IAsyncResult result) at System.ServiceModel.ClientBase`1.ChannelBase`1.EndInvoke(String methodName, Object[] args, IAsyncResult result) at FMDashboard2.FMDashSvc3Ref.FMDash3Client.FMDash3ClientChannel.EndGetMetricData(IAsyncResult result) at FMDashboard2.FMDashSvc3Ref.FMDash3Client.FMDashboard2.FMDashSvc3Ref.FMDash3.EndGetMetricData(IAsyncResult result) at FMDashboard2.FMDashSvc3Ref.FMDash3Client.OnEndGetMetricData(IAsyncResult result) at System.ServiceModel.ClientBase`1.OnAsyncCallCompleted(IAsyncResult result) ============ Inner exception: at System.Net.Browser.AsyncHelper.BeginOnUI(SendOrPostCallback beginMethod, Object state) at System.Net.Browser.BrowserHttpWebRequest.EndGetResponse(IAsyncResult asyncResult) at System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpChannelFactory.HttpRequestChannel.HttpChannelAsyncRequest.CompleteGetResponse(IAsyncResult result) ============ Inner exception: Security error. at System.Net.Browser.BrowserHttpWebRequest.InternalEndGetResponse(IAsyncResult asyncResult) at System.Net.Browser.BrowserHttpWebRequest.c__DisplayClass5.b__4(Object sendState) at System.Net.Browser.AsyncHelper.c__DisplayClass2.b__0(Object sendState) Here's my ClientConfig: Here's my web config for the service: And here's my ClientAccessPolicy.xml file: I've been working on this for WEEKS. I've hammer both Codeproject and the MSDN forums, and nobody's been able to come up with a solution for me. Help me, obi-wan-kenobi.
