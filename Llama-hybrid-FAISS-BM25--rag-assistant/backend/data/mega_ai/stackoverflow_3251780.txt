Longpress event on Google Maps API?

I'm creating a web app for mobile phones where if they longpress a certain part of the map, something happens. Unfortunately I can't use a window.setTimeout(..) with a mousedown/mouseup combination because the Maps API doesn't contain those events as it would disrupt the drag events. Is there another way to do this? There has to be a way because the Maps webapp on mobile pops up the same menu when you longpress as right-click on Google maps for computers - just don't know how! Please let me know!! Thanks in advance!
