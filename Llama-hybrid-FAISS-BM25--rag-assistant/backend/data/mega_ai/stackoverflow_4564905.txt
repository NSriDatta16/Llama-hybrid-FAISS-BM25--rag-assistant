How can I generate a list of #define values from C code?

I have code that has a lot of complicated #define error codes that are not easy to decode since they are nested through several levels. Is there any elegant way I can get a list of #defines with their final numerical values (or whatever else they may be)? As an example: #define CREATE_ERROR_CODE(class, sc, code) ((class #define MI_1 EMI_MAX #define MODULE_ERROR_CLASS MI_1 #define MODULE_ERROR_SUBCLASS 1 #define ERROR_FOO CREATE_ERROR_CODE(MODULE_ERROR_CLASS, MODULE_ERROR_SUBCLASS, 1) I would have a large number of similar #defines matching ERROR_[\w_]+ that I'd like to enumerate so that I always have a current list of error codes that the program can output. I need the numerical value because that's all the program will print out (and no, it's not an option to print out a string instead). Suggestions for gcc or any other compiler would be helpful.
