Random generation of ARMA(2,2) Gaussian time series

I get very poor replication of longitudinal parameters from my own program using the Box-Jenkins model. I had no such problem with my own program generating AR(1) Gaussian data. Is there some trick that I haven't discovered yet? I would like to use the validation framework of Martinez-Rivera & Ventosa-Santaularia (2012) to check a new time series regression method that is better than the usual on AR(1), but itself depends on ARMA random generation when applied to ARMA data.
