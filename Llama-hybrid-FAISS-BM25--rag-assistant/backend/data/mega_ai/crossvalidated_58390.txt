Averaging gridded data with missing values

I would like to use various parameters of remote sensing data (i.e. chorlophyl, sea-surface temperature, wind stress, etc.) as covariates in a species distribution model. I have sightings data, including sighting effort, collected from a number of scientific cruises over a two month period. My idea was to average environmental data for the entire sighting period, treat all sightings as having been collected simultaneously, with the 2 month average of values used as the covariates. Given the nature of remote-sensing data, there are numerous missing values due to clouds, etc., so if I were to average the data I would need to omit any cell that had no value for >= 1 day of data. This results in a small fraction of the data, and just doesn't seem like a good way of doing things. How can I obtain statistically consistent averaged estimates of parameters in the presence of missing data in remote sensor output? Update: Sighting effort is evaluated as the time taken before an observation is made. The more time taken for a sighting the higher the effort made to obtain the sighting. I could also use the distance covered before sighting rather than time.
