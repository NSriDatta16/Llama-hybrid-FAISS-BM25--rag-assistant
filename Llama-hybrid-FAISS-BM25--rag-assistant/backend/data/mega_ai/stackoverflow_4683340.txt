Best neural network for certain type of pattern analysis?

I'm working on a system that will send telemetry data on machine operation back to a central server for analysis. One of the machine parameters we're measuring is motor current drawn vs time. After an operation is finished we plan to send back an array of currents vs time to the server. A successful operation would have a pattern like a trapezoid, problematic operations would have a pattern completely different, more like a large spike in values. Can anyone recommend a type of neural network that would be good at classifying these 1D vectors of current values into a pass/fail type output? Thanks, Fred
