What's the best way to structure a project?

I was wondering about how I should structured my projects. We have some projects that are (re)use in other projects. I mean, our data project and model project are use in one-to-many other projects. What I really what to know is how to structure this type of project, what the best way to name it ? In a standard 3-tier application, is should like something like : DAL, DataAccessLayer, Data ... Model, BusinessObject, BOL ... UI, View, ... Any other ideas ? In each company I work, they got different way to organize it, is there one better than another ? Which one do you use and which one do you prefer and why ? Thx!
