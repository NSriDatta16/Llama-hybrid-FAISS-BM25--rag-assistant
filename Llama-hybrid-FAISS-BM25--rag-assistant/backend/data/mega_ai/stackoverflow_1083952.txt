I would start with Spring 3 for various reasons: full Java 5 support (this is main reason for adopting Spring 3 for me) Spring MVC support is deeply change between spring 2 and 3 (notably REST support). Learning spring 2 MVC is not a far-seeing imho. new module organization (if you start with Spring 3, you don't need to migrate packages in the future) OSGI compabitiliy Ivy support You don't need to worry about bugs or incomplete documentation since you are still learning the framework concepts. In conclusion, learning Spring 3 instead Spring 2 is a far-seeing choice. However a very good introduction to Spring 2.x is given by Spring in Action , an excellent book about the subject.
