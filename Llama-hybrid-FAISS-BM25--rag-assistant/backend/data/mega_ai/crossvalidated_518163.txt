This answer depends on the definition of artificial neural network (ANN) you take to be true. See my question here: What *is* an Artificial Neural Network? . Therefore, no objective answer can be given since: To accommodate all definitions of ANNs, they are simply defined as arbitrary computational graphs, with tunable parameters (even if they are not tuned, random neural networks are still ANNs) Differentiability is not required (for example, genetic algorithms and other metaheuristics have been used to learn ANNs) I will however, propose a counterfactual approach here that, in my experience, at least makes some people to conclude that deep learning is not solely based on ANNs: Do you consider hierarchical hidden markov models (HHMM)/hierarchical Bayesian networks deep learning? Do you consider them to be neural networks? If you answered 'yes' and 'no', then the overall answer is definitely 'no', for you there is a deep learning model that is not a neural network. Other combinations of answer will lead to undefined overall answers.
