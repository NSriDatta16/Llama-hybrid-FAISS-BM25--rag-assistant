Strings in Delphi Win32 are managed differently from strings in .Net, so you can not pass a .Net string to Delphi Win32 or vice versa. To exchange strings values you'd better use PChar type which is supported by both compilers. That is the same way you send string values to Windows API functions. Regards P.S. I am NOT Robert ;-)
