There are a lot of what-ifs involved with your question, and usually finding the best model involves testing most of these on the data. Just because a model in theory could produce more accurate results does not mean it will always produce a model with the lowest error. That being said... Neural Net ensembles can be very accurate, as long as you can accept the black box. Varying by both number of nodes and number of layers can cover a lot of variance in the data, with introducing this many modelling factors it could be easy to overfit the data. Random Forests have rarely produced the most accurate results, but boosted trees can model complex relationships like in the AI tasks you discussed without much risk of overfitting. One would think, well why not just ensemble all of these models together, but this model compromises on the possible strengths of the individual models. Again this would likely lead to some overfitting issues. Models that are computationally efficient is a different matter, and I would not start with a very complicated neural net. Using a neural net as a benchmark, in my experience it has been most efficient using boosted trees. This is based on my experience, and a reasonable understanding of the theory underlying each of the modelling types discussed.
