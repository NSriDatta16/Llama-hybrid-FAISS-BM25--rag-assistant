The negative binomial is a distribution for count data, so you really want your response variable to be counts (that is, non-negative whole numbers). That said, it is appropriate to account for "different sampling efforts" (I don't know exactly what you are referring to, but I get the gist of it). However, you should not try to do that by dividing your counts by another number. Instead, you need to use that other number as an offset . There is a nice discussion on CV of what an offset is here: When to use an offset in a Poisson regression? My guess is that your model should be something like: mst.nb = glm.nb(Larvae+Nymphs+Adults ~ B.type+Month+Season + offset(log(num.hosts)), data=MI.df)
