If your framework will let you represent your data as a directed graph, that might be handy. You could use connections between users to represent a friend relationship, and use a structured machine learning algorithm for your classification. If not, you could create a binary feature vector that's the same length of all the unique visitors with which someone could be friends with, and have a 1 represent friendship, while 0 represents not friendship. Does that help?
