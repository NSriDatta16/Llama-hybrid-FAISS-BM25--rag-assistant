Yes, by definition the PCA reconstruction will outperform any other linear combination of $k$ components in terms of RSS as it is designed to get the best $k$ -rank approximation to the matrix A in terms of least-squares. To quote Pearson's (1901) On lines and planes of closest fit to systems of points in space : " the best fitting plane is perpendicular to the greatest axis of the ellipsoid of residuals and the minimum mean square residuals varies inversely as the length of this axis. " In contrast to that, NNMF components are not constrained to be perpendicular so do not return the optimal reconstruction in terms of RSS. Please note that they are extensions to a specific member of the exponential family of distributions (e.g. Bernoulli, Poisson, etc.), Collins et al. (2001) A Generalization of Principal Components Analysis to the Exponential Family is an easy to follow and influential reference if you want to read on this further.
