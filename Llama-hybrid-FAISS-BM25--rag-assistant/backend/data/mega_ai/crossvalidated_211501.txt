You may find the concept of $p$-norms helpful. Your metric, which is analogous to root mean square error in statistics, is the $p$-norm with $p = 2$. As $p$ increases, the $p$-norm, considered as a metric, cares more about the few largest deviations and less about the average deviation overall. The $p$-norm for $p = âˆž$ is called the "sup norm", "max norm", or "uniform norm", and in this context, it would be calculated as $\max \limits_n |f(n) - \tilde f(n)| \quad .$ Perhaps that would work well for your purposes.
