Magento CMS pages â€” getting title from URL key/identifier?

Is there any way to get the title of a cms page, if you only know it's url key/identifier? For example, the about page (in the sample data) has a url key/identifier of 'about-magento-demo-store'. If that's the only information I had, how would I go about getting the page title from that? As in the faux code below: $pageTitle = Mage::getModel('cms/page')->loadByAttribute('identifier', 'about-magento-demo-store')->getTitle(); I'd like to get a list of all CMS page titles, using just the url keys/identifiers. I know you can get the current CMS page title using the following: $pageTitle = Mage::getSingleton('cms/page')->getTitle(); Anyone any ideas?
