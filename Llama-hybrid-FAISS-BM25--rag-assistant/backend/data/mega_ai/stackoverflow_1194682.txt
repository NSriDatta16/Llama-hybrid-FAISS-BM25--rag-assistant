The UI is not updated due to the fact that your current thread has a higher priority than your UI thread which will ultimately set the label ;). So until your thread has finished to your stuff it will update your label in the end. Lucky for us, there is a Dispatcher property on every WPF control that lets you fire up a new thread with another priority.. labelProgress.Dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Background, () => labelProgress.Content = string.Format("Step {0}{1}", i, countLabel)); This fire up a thread in the background and would get the job done! You can also try other DispatcherPriority options PS I also took the liberty to add an anonymous method and fix your string parsing somewhat.. hope you don't mind..
