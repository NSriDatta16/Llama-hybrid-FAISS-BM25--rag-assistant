Disclaimer: this is my experience with Visual Studio 2010 Premium, but I recall VS2008 Professional works the same way. Once you create a new Class Diagram via Add New Item, all you need to do is just drag the source code files from the Solution Explorer onto the Class Diagram's design surface. Unfortunately there are some manual steps to getting the relationships on the diagram. What I end up doing is selecting the members I'm interested in on the diagram, and then choosing menu options from the Class Diagram menu (or right-clicking). For example for properties you can choose Show Association or Show as Collection Association . With the entire type selected you can opt to show its base type and derived types from the same menu. This should render the relationships like you're wanting.
