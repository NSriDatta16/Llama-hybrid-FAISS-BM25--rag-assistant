I found this post Cross-validation techniques for time series data and in there he is referencing some paper Bergmeir et al. "A note on the validity of cross-validation for evaluating time series prediction" explaining that K-fold can be better if only autoregressive models are used. As far as I can see I only use autoregressive features (this is mathematically more precise for what I meant with "no direct time features"), so I might stick with the normal K-fold for now.
