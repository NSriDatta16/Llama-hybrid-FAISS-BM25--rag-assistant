ARIMAX and auto.arima for multivariate time series forecasting in R

I'm trying to do multivariate time series forecasting using the forecast package in R. The data set contains one dependent and independent variable. From the cross-correlation the 0 day lag of the independent variable seems to have better correlation with dependent variable. But I need some clarification on which function I should use - auto.arima with xreg or arimax . While using auto.arima to predict the dependent variable by using independent Variable as the xreg parameter in the auto.arima function,Do we need to have xreg values in place already for the forecast periods? Or Can we use arimax to predict the dependent variable along with a covariate even if there are no values available for the covariate on the forecast periods.
