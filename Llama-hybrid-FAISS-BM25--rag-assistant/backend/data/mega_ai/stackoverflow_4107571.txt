Unicode problem with linux g++

I have problem with unicode functions under my Ubuntu 10.10 linux. Lot of unicode functions doesn't work correctly. When I try following simple code: #include int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { wprintf(L"test %s %s %s\n",L"one",L"two",L"three"); return 0; } and compile using g++ (gcc version 4.4.5 Ubuntu/Linaro 4.4.4.-14ubuntu5) a have following results: test o t t instead of expected: test one two three Also other functions for working with unicode strings doesnt work correctly. Lot of my code I developing under MS Windows and this is my first linux programming atempts. (Same bug appears on two linux machines where I tested this fragment) Thank you for any advice.
