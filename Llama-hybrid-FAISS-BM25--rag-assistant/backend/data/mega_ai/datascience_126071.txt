t-SNE results vary wildly with different datasets and even with different hyperparameters, so your results are not strange. However, you should ensure that you are setting the same random seed , because t-SNE is not deterministic; this could be the source of the vast differences of your plots. Also, it's Ok to use the output of t-SNE as features for a classifier, as long as you ensure that the t-SNE you are applying behaves deterministically. That said, usually U-MAP behaves better than t-SNE, so may try with it before going all-in with t-SNE (check out this article in such case). Here you have an example integrating U-MAP in a classification pipeline with a SVM.
