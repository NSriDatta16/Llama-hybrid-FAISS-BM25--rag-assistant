adding a forum: sharing a database or creating a new one?

My site has a MySQL database with about 50 tables. I work hard to make it as safe and secure as possible. Per our development plan, we will be adding a forum in the not too distant future. I'm unsure about whether it is better to have the forum in its own database, or to insert all its tables into our existing database. I've listed the pros and cons of both approaches below as I understand them, and would appreciate some advice from those more knowledgeable and experienced than I, which is nearly all of you :-) Merged into Existing Database Pros integrating forum data into existing site is easier (example: using forum thread tags to match threads to site pages and automatically display links to relevant discussions) can merge existing users table into forum so users need not re-register to begin using the forum all-in-one backups Cons I've instantly added a huge amount of new code, some of which has database access, and all of which is a much higher profile target for shenanigans, meaning my original database is now placed at much more risk of attack updating the forum software will be more hands-on, as it will not be a straight database flop Separate Databases for Forum and Main Site Pros easy install, testing, upgrade, tear down of forum forum database security holes don't place my main site at risk (and vice-versa) Cons integration into existing site requires querying two databases at once. I suspect this would be fairly more difficult to program. users would have to re-register on the forum backing up 2 databases rather than one (this is a minor con, but it is a con) Your thoughts? :-)
