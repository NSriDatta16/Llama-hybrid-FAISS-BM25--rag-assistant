Problem making a GET request and spoof User-Agent in urllib2

With this code, urllib2 make a GET request: #!/usr/bin/python import urllib2 req = urllib2.Request('http://www.google.fr') req.add_header('User-Agent', '') response = urllib2.urlopen(req) With this one (which is almost the same), a POST request: #!/usr/bin/python import urllib2 headers = { 'User-Agent' : '' } req = urllib2.Request('http://www.google.fr', '', headers) response = urllib2.urlopen(req) My question is: how can i make a GET request with the second code style ? The documentation ( http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.5/library/urllib2.html ) says that headers should be a dictionary, and will be treated as if add_header() was called with each key and value as arguments Yeah, except that in order to use the headers parameter, you have to pass data , and when data is passed, the request become a POST. Any help will be very appreciated.
