Statistical Significance test for difference in FScore

For a classification task, I have developed two methods and FScore(harmonic mean of precision and recall) of both the classes serves as the performance criteria. How can I check whether the difference between the performance of the two systems is statistically significant or not. For eg. I was reading a paper by Navigli and in the evaluation he cites that "all the differences between 2 systems are statistically significant (p I would like to know how to perform this test of statistical significance. EDIT : No clue is there regarding which test is been talked about. Is there some standard test used in NLP community? (the work is related to Natural Language Processing)
