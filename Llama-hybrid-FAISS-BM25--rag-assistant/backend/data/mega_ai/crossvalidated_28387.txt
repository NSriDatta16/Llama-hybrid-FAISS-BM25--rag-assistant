Cosine similarity is not a clustering technique. It's a common distance measure for sparse vectors all over the place, in information retrieval and classification maybe even more than in clustering. I do not have the impression that you really have understood clustering. It is an unsupervised knowledge discovery technique. As it is unsupervised, you cannot "direct" it towards building a "sports" and a "non-sports" cluster. It might just as well find an "Obama" cluster and a "non-Obama" cluster. If you are interested in Sports as opposed to non-Sports, you are doing classification. And yes, you may use cosine distance in classification! Classification is when you want to assign instances the appropriate class of your known types. Clustering is when you have no clue of what types there are, and you want an algorithm to discover what (if any!) types there might be. This may involve a lot of trial and error, as the algorithms may find clusters that are not interesting to you. A clustering algorithm may find clusters such as "Sentences containing the word Banana" (most likely it will not give you this explanation though!), and it hasn't failed. It's a mathematically valid cluster , and how is the algorithm supposed to know that you don't like Bananas?
