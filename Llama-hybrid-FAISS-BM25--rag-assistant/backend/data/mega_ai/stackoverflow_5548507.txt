It's already implemented - the implementation is found in user32.dll . That's what the extern keyword means: The extern modifier is used to declare a method that is implemented externally. Interfaces can only declare instance methods for their implementors; as such the static keyword is not valid here either. Lastly, an interface can't declare implementations; only its implementors can. In this case, since the implementation already exists, it makes no sense to create an interface for it. If you're looking to create a wrapper class for unmanaged calls, see Kragen's answer .
