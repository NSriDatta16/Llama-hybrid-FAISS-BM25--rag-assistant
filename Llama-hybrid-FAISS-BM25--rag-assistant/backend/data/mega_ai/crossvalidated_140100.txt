Which variables to keep in my analysis based on loadings from PCA?

Could someone please explain me how I should decide which variables to keep in my analysis based on loadings from PCA. The output is: Comp.1 Comp.2 Comp.3 Comp.4 Comp.5 a 0.0281003 0.37882295 0.2935517 0.02025596 0.11199220 b 0.2019940 0.21168386 0.2398182 0.37883484 0.03540004 c 0.2545871 0.20163264 0.1459563 0.07187896 0.39797528 d 0.2774044 0.05867002 0.1859529 0.06134311 0.41428056 e 0.2379143 0.14919053 0.1347208 0.46768713 0.04035192 Importance of components: Comp.1 Comp.2 Comp.3 Comp.4 Comp.5 Standard deviation 1.5809667 1.0987927 0.8806842 0.63815856 0.33218647 Proportion of Variance 0.4998911 0.2414691 0.1551209 0.08144927 0.02206957 Cumulative Proportion 0.4998911 0.7413602 0.8964812 0.97793043 1.00000000 Does this mean that variable a is not important and I can drop it? Is there any method for making this decision?
