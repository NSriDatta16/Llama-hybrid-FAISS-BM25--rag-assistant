You are missing the /ims flag at the end of your regex. Otherwise . will not match line breaks (as in your first paragraph). Actually /s would suffice, but I'm always using all three for simplicity. Also, preg_match works for many simple cases. But if you are attempting any more complex extractions, then consider alternating to phpQuery or QueryPath which allow for: foreach (qp($html)->find("p") as $p) { print $p->text(); }
