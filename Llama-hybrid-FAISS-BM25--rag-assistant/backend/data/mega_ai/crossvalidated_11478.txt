Constant term in time series econometric models built on 1-st differences

Both dependent and independent variables I deal with are nonstationary series that become stationary after differentiating them once. The problem is that I assume that the dependent variable has a certain constant value which does not depend on the explanatory variables' changes and should be estimated as the model's constant term. But the constant term is lost in the process of differentiation. Does anyone know any method of dealing with that kind of problem?
