CCA can give you only as many components as the number of variables in X or Y (whatever is smaller), basically for the same reason why PCA will give you only as many components as you have variables and not more. By adding zeros or using one-hot encoding, you are only adding colinear columns, so you are not actually increasing the rank of your matrix and the CCA solution is not unique.
