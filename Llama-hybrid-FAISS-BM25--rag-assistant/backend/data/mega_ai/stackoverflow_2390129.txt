Ok, here's another one. You could use the anchor method. Let me explain: Imagine that http://myappz.com/fooshop_cs is the selling product's URL and this is what you distribute to your affiliates but each with a small variation. You simply add a unique ID to the URL by hijacking the fragment identifier (i.e. http://myappz.com/fooshop_cs#em001 ). Once a user follows a link to your site that has been charged with a unique ID, you check for the IDs existence using Javascript ( location.href.search(/#em\d*/) ). Once you found an ID you simply trigger an AJAX call to take that affiliate up a notch (I may recommend the jQuery framework to do so). The benefit of this approach is that search engines don't care about fragment identifiers and that you will be able to sell your product from a single page. Your users won't care either as the anchor has absolutely no impact on them (except you would setup an anchor tag within your page). bye
