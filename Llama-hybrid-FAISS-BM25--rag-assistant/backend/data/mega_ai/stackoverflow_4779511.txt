As for as I know in login url when you use canvas=1, fbconnect=0 then it means that you have an facebook application within facebook. you are specifying canvas=1 and fbconnect=0. If you are embedding facebook in your site then you must do the contrast. fbconnect=0 means you are not embedding facebook in your site.
