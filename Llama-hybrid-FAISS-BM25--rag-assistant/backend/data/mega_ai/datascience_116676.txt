How do SciKit-Learn Pipelines pass Data between Steps?

I would like to create some Custom Transformers and incorporate them in a SciKit-Learn Pipeline . I'd like to pass more than just a Dataframe between the transformer steps in the pipeline. For example, I'd like to create a Custom Transformer that uses pandas's get_dummies() function to encode categorical variables, then I would like to pass the columns that it considered categorical to a ColumnTransformer object, so that the pipeline automatically treatments them differently. I can't see an easy way to do this, so I realise this may take some effort. How does SciKit-Learn pass Data between steps in its pipeline?
