does {java.src.dir} need to point to one specific src directory. This is no one single src directory as I am compiling multiple projects. Each with their own build.xml file. I believe this is the portion that generates all the coverage reports: EDIT: I changed the sourcepath to point directly to one of the src directories. See if that works.
