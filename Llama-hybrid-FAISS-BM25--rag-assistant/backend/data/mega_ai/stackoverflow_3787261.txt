Visual Fox Pro, ODBC - I can't see .DBF tables in Visual Studio 2010

I'm making integration with application that is using ODBC Data Source - Visual Fox Pro Driver. In its dirrectory structure I've got two dirrectories (DANE and TRANS) which contains .DBF files. When I am using Visual Studio 2010 Server Explorer -> Data Connections to connect to DATA .DBF files, everything work fine. The problem occurs when I'm trying to use TRANS dirrectory - I don't see any tables (When I am using DBF Viewer - there are around 30-40 tables). When I try to connect to them using connection strings : Provider=vfpoledb;Dsn=Visual FoxPro Tables;Data source=c:\Softech\G_POS\DANE Provider=vfpoledb;Dsn=Visual FoxPro Database;Data source=c:\Softech\G_POS\TRANS I can get data from DANE without problem. On TRANS I can connect to database, but I've god exception when I try to get data (OleDbException) - Can't read file c:\Softech\G_POS\TRANS\"name of table".dbf Norbert "Visual FoxPro Database" is abstract name of destination. That's not a database, just my custom name of data source
