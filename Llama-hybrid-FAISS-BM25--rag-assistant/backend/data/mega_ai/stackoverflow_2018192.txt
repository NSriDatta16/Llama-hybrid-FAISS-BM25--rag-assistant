For efficiency and safety you may wish to store and work with IPs as ints in your database. The straightforward way to store IP addresses is to use a varchar field in your DB. However, another way to represent IPs is as an integer. Converting the supplied IP in this way will sanitize it, and also make your storage and queries more efficient. Storing an INT takes up less space in a DB, and works better for indexing and I believe query caching. Check out ip2long and long2ip for PHP functions to convert, and inet_aton and inet_ntoa to do it in MySQL. So, the process might go like $user_ip=ip2long($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']); if(!$user_ip){ //returned false due to odd input echo 'wtf, yo'; } else{ //do your query } You can also sanitize an IP and keep it in the original dotted quad form by combining the two $user_ip=long2ip(ip2long($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']));
