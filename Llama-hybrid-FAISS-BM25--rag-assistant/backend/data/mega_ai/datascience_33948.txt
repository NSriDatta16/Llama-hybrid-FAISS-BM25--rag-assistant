Is a CNN architecture more susceptible to adversarial attack if it is built on ResNet?

The title kind of sums up my question. But more generally, is a CNN architecture more susceptible to an adversarial attack if it is built on top of another open source architecture, like ResNet. Can something that spoofed ResNet also spoof another model built on top of ResNet? (Assuming you do not have access to the gradient of the secondary model, but of course do have access to ResNet)
