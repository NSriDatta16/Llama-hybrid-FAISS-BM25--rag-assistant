Javascript comparing 2 checks for localStorage

I saw this in the diveintohtml5 website. This is how they check to see if localstorage is supported on the browser. return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null; Would this be the same as just doing? return window.localStorage != undefined
