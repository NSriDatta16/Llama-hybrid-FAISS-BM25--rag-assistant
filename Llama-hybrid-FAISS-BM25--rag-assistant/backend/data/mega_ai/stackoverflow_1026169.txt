Let me share my own experience with django. My prerequisits: average knowledge of python very weak idea of how web works (no js skills, just a bit of css) my day job is filled with coding in C and I just wanted to try something different, so there certainly was a passion to learn (I think this is the most important one) Why I've chosen django: I've already knew bits and pieces of python django has excelent documentation, including tutorial, which explained everything in very clear and simple manner It is worth to read complete manual first (it took me two or three weekends. I remember I could not remember/understand everything at first pass, but it helped me to learn where the information can be found when needed. There is also another source of documentaion called djangobook . Djangobook contains same information as manual, but things are explained more in detail. It's worth to read it also, it helps to catch up with MVC concept, if you have not tried that before. And finally to answer your question best: there are already also OpenId modules ready for you. I'm considering to use django-authopenid for my new project. It supports OpenId, while providing fallback to locally managed users. There is certain learning curve if you are going learn django. The more you know about the web and python the steeper the curve is. I had to also learn bits and pieces of javascript and it took me also some time. If you are able to spend full time learning django, then you can expect you'll be able to deliver first results within 4-6 weeks. It took me 6 months, since I was doing my django studies in free time.
