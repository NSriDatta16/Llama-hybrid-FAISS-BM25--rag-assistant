If the clusters of features you've identified do all measure the same underlying property (e.g. twitter sentiment), then yes, combining them by averaging/summing or PCA (which is just a weighted sum) is a very common approach here. If you want to dig in a little deeper, you might consider trying Structural equation modelling to fully specify the relationships between these variables and your outcome Exploratory factor analysis (with orthogonal rotation) to properly identify the clusters of predictors that go together and can be combined, along with optimal weights for combining them. Using Partial least squares or Supervised principal components analysis as your predictive model. These algorithms do both dimension reduction on the predictors and predictive modelling at the same time. Most of these methods are more geared towards finding out which variables should be combined. If you already know which variables go together, the correlations are strong, and you've standardised the variables to be on the same scale (e.g. z-scores; and this is important) it doesn't really matter how much you weight each individual variable: the result you get from just summing everything will be very strongly correlated with the result from PCA or other weighting schemes.
