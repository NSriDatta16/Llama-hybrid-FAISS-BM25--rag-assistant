app update crashes just after default.png is showed

I'd like to test the new version of my app as an update of my former version. So I installed the older version from Appstore. Here's my problem : when I try to deploy the new version on my device (iphone 3G) : build is ok, install seems ok but when the app launches there's only the default.png that shows 1 second before everything crashes. In Organizer - console I can see the following errors : : entitlement 'keychain-access-groups' has value not permitted by a provisioning profile : entitlement 'application-identifier' has value not permitted by a provisioning profile : Killing XXXXXX activate: deactivate: for app installation ... UIKitApplication:AGLFRX2P2[0x1878][1034]) : (UIKitApplication:XXXXXX2[0x1878]) posix_spawn("/var/mobile/Applications/97DFB148-4C95-4DB4-AAA7-19DFE81C0BE1/XXXXXX.app/XXXXXX", ...): Permission denied ... if I do the same thing on my iphone without the older version installed (or the older version deployed by myself from xCode) , eveything works well ! Does it mean i can't install an update of my app with my developer profile when the app installed on the device was built with my distribution profile ? Thank you so much for your help ! info : I just updated xCode to the last version 3.2.3. I also updated my iPhone 3G to OS4.
