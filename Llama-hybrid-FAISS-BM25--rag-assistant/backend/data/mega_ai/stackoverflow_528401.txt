That margin-left:26px is the "computed style" of your styling margin-left:2em. Hence why it's under Computed Style section in Safari's Web Inspector. So if you change your margin-left to some other values the computed-style pixel value will also change too. Anyway there are indeed extra padding! And it's caused by the user agent stylesheet (-webkit-padding-start:40px). Reset this style by setting padding:0 on your ol and any others elements you want. A good way to prevent this problem from happening again and develop without worry is to reset your css. A basic reset would be: * { margin:0; padding:0; }
