How can I reduce the noise of prediction graph?

I am trying to use LSTM to predict a time series data as you can see in the following image, the predicted graphs is very noisy: The original data is looking like this: That I normalized it like this and fed it to the LSTM network: Is there a way to get better result with less noise? EDIT: I use keras implementation of LSTM and sklearn.preprocessing.normalize library for normalization.
