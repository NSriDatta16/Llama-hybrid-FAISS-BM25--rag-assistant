I think it (might) be because your view is inheriting from OrganizationGroupFormViewModel and in the post of the view you are using the model OrganizationGroup . I'd try accepting the OrganizationGroupFormViewModel in the post though this is untested. EDIT The other thing you might try is in your textboxes using the name that is fully qualified to your model. I've found this helps when I'm not passing in the form view model to my controller.
