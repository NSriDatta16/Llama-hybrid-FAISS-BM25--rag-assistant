How do I read a text file on the same server with ASP.NET?

Solution: It turns out I wasn't checking the path that it was looking up, quite silly of me. Once I tracked that problem down and corrected the offending path, the reading worked just fine. Still baffled at the MSSQL issue, since the articles average less than 10 000 bytes. Clarification: I am unsure if some of you are under the impression that the file I am trying to read is on my local machine. It resides on the web, on the same server as the script that is accessing it. Just in a different directory. I wrote an online help desk application that includes articles. One problem I have run into is some of the articles are too long, and get truncated when I put them into my MSSQL database. I tried using TEXT and VARCHAR(MAX) as the data type, but it would still get truncated. So I decided that I would put the articles that are too long into a text file, and have my application read the text file from there. I got this code working in my development environment, but it does not work live: Dim output As String = String.Empty Try Dim theArticle As gsClassroom = classArticles(iterate) If theArticle.Body.StartsWith("/docs/") Then Dim oReader As IO.StreamReader = Nothing Try oReader = New IO.StreamReader(Server.MapPath(String.Format("/dev{0}", theArticle.Body))) Catch ex As Exception output = String.Format("{0} {1}", ex.Message, "internal") Finally oReader.Close() oReader.Dispose() oReader = Nothing End Try Else output = theArticle.Body End If Catch ex As Exception output = String.Format("{0} {1}", ex.Message, "external") End Try Response.Output.WriteLine(output) At first, I thought it was because I did not change the /dev path prefix to /hlpdsk . But even after I changed it, it bombed out. What am I doing wrong?
