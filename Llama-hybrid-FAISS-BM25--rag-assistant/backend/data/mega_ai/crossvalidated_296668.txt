That is just a matter of what is substantially interesting to the authors. For example, we may be interested in the difference in mean income between men and women (typically women will earn on average less than men). But we could also get insights by comparing the variability of income between men and women (the standard deviation is typically smaller for women then for men). Both, and more, comparisons are legitimate, but they tell different stories. So you first need to choose the story, than look for the parameters that allow you to quantify that story. If you are interested in differences in shape, and the shape parameters capture that aspect, then by all means go for it. Otherwise, don't.
