Relation between logistic regression and logistic distribution

When we are using logistic regression, we can get the probability that $y$ belongs to class $1$ as follows: $P(y=1|x;\theta)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\theta^Tx)}$ . PDF of a logistic distribution is given as follows: $f(x)=\frac{\exp(-x)}{(1+\exp(-x))^2}$ and this is a continuous distribution. Here are my questions: Conditional distribution of $y|x$ is logistic distribution. Is this right? Or is it a categorical distribution? PDF at a single point is zero. So how can we get probabilities in logistic regression if it is a continuous distribution? As a side question, what is it we get when we evaluate a PDF at a single point? For example, in scipy.stats , norm().pdf(3) returns a value, what is it?
