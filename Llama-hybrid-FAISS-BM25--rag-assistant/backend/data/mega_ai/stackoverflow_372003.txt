Unit Testing Application_Start

I am looking for any kind of information (prefer Moq) on how to unit test the Application_Start method in Global.asax. I am using ASP.NET MVC and trying to get to that elusive 100% code coverage! The fact that I'm using MVC is not the point. And saying that not testing Start is not necessary isn't really the answer either. What if I had other code in there? I need to know how to test it.
