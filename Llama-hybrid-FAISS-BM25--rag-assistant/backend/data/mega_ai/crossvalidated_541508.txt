Including pre-treatment covariates in difference-in-differences: what if my covariates determine treatment but are outcomes of treatment?

I have the following question: What should I do with covariates that affect treatment in the pre-treatment period but are affected by treatment once the treatment is in place in a difference-in-differences model? Should I exclude them because they are outcomes of the treatment? Is there a way to use the variation of the pre-treatment period in the difference-in-differences formulation without including the post-treatment variation? A potential (please comment on it) solution: including the pre-treatment values of the covariates, but for the post-treatment period include the average of the pre-treatment period. In this way, the covariates can explain the treatment in the pre-treatment period, without being affected by the treatment in the post-treatment period.
