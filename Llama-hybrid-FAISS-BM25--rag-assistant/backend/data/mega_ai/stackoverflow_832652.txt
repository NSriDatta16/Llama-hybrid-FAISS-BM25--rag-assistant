SQL Server timing out during reorganize index and update stats

When running Reorganize Index and Update Statistics in MS SQL Server 2005's maintenance plan, our production web server is timing out. I know that Reorganize Index is an online operation and that is why we chose it over Rebuild Index so we're at a loss. It's run after a Database backup, in the same maintenance plan, but I've read that it shouldn't make a significant impact. Any suggestions?
