Replacing Variables by WoE (Weight of Evidence) in Logistic Regression

This is a question regarding a practice or method followed by some of my colleagues. While making a logistic regression model, I have seen people replace categorical variables (or continuous variables which are binned) with their respective Weight of Evidence (WoE). This is supposedly done to establish a monotonic relation between the regressor and dependent variable. Now as far as I understand, once the model is made, the variables in the equation are NOT the variables in the dataset. Rather, the variables in the equation are now kind of the importance or weight of the variables in segregating the dependent variable ! My question is : how do we now interpret the model or the model coefficients? For example for the following equation : $$ \log\bigg(\frac{p}{1-p}\bigg) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 $$ we can say that $\exp(\beta_1)$ is the relative increase in odd's ratio for 1 unit increase in the variable $x_1$. But if the variable is replaced by its WoE, then the interpretation will be changed to : relative increase in odd's ratio for 1 unit increase in the IMPORTANCE / WEIGHT of the variable I have seen this practice in internet, but nowhere I found answer of this question. This link from this community itself is related to somewhat similar query where someone wrote: WoE displays a linear relationship with the natural logarithm of the odds ratio which is the dependent variable in logistic regression. Therefore, the question of model misspecification does not arise in logistic regression when we use WoE instead of the actual values of the variable. But I still don't get the explanation. Please help me understand what I am missing.
