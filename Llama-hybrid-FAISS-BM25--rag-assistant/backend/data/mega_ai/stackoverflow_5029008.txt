I would like to add the following: If you are working with a UITableView it is likely that you are already implementing the UITableViewDelegate to fill the table with data. The protocol UITableViewDelegate conforms to UIScrollViewDelegate, so all you need to do is to implement the methods -scrollViewWillBeginDragging and -scrollViewDidScroll directly in your UITableViewDelegate implementation and they will be called automatically if the implementation class is set as delegate to your UITableView. If you also want to intercept clicks in your table and not only dragging and scrolling, you can extend and implement your own UITableViewCell and use the touchesBegan: methods in there. By combining these two methods you should be able to do most of the things you need when the user interacts with the UITableView.
