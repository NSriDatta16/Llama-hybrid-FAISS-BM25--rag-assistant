Arthur (1994) has a nice short paper/thought experiment that is well-known in the complexity literature. One of the conclusions there is that agents cannot select better predictive models (even if they have a "forest" of these) under non-equilibrium conditions. For example, if the question is applied to stock market performance, the setting of Arthur (1994) might be applicable.
