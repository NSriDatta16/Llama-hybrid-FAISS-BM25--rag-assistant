Short answer: yes. A simple way (not necessarily the best way) is to add mousedown event handlers to your button objects that trigger a function which constructs your level (by creating a new object instance of your class). You can then access this object through its reference (i.e. variable name). After you're done with the level, you can set the object reference to null, which will let the garbage collector clean up your memory. There are much more elegant ways to do this, but try this as a basic starting point. Good luck.
