The reason for not using binary floating-point for money is that money uses decimal fractions and people (and accounting regulations) expect specific decimal behaviour from arithmetic operations performed on it - which binary floating-point does not provide. However, stock quote feeds aren't generally used for accounting. They're displayed, compared, used as input for various chart analysis indicators or trading algorithms - all much closer to scientific applications than accounting, and not requiring decimal behaviour or precision. Instead, because of the large amount of data, storage efficiency and performance are relevant, and BigDecimal really sucks at those.
