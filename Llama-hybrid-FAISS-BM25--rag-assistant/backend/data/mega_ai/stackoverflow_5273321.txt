Reading complex xml files

I'm trying to read a complex XML file with spring batch, using the StaxEventItemReader . When dealing with a simple structure, it's not an issue. However, I must deal with this kind of XML file : String String String String text String String String String String 1967-08-13 1967-08-13 1967-08-13 String 1967-08-13 1967-08-13 String String String String 1967-08-13 0 3.14159265358979E0 0 String String The first nodes are some sort of header.(Emetteur, Recepteur, etc...) The policy node is a collection, which can be quite huge. My problem is that I can only define 1 fragmentRootElementName, which in ths case, cannot be the real root, PivotContrat, for volume issues. I need to read each 1st level node to marshal them in the appropriate objects (with a JAXB marshaller). Is there any way to use multiples fragmentRootElementName? Is there any other way to work with this XML structure? I've not seen how to achieve this kind of processing.
