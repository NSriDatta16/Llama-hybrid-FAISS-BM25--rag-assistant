Statistical significance in time series (R)

Stats newb here, I have to determine if two time series are really different instead of being part of the same population with noise in the samples. The data is a comparison between two algorithms ctr by day, a control one (a) and an experimental (b) a b 1 3.6162 3.6808 2 3.8967 4.0155 3 4.0669 4.2945 4 4.3680 4.4321 5 4.0558 4.2071 6 3.9234 3.9131 7 3.7467 3.9533 We can see the mean is bigger in b (4.070914 vs 3.953386) But are they statistically significant? To see that im doing ANOVA to get the p-value and compare to the alpha of 0.05 as far as i know, if it is smaller then the null hypothesis H0 of being equals is false. The problem is when i do the oneway.test i get a p-value really big, am i doing something wrong? data x name 1 3.6162 a 2 3.6808 b 3 3.7467 a 4 3.8967 a 5 3.9131 b 6 3.9234 a 7 3.9533 b 8 4.0155 b 9 4.0558 a 10 4.0669 a 11 4.2071 b 12 4.2945 b 13 4.3680 a 14 4.4321 b oneway.test(x~name, data = data) One-way analysis of means (not assuming equal variances) data: x and name F = 0.77477, num df = 1.00, denom df = 11.97, p-value = 0.3961 Thanks a lot!
