Magento custom module - where to store includes

I am creating a custom magento module and cant decide the best place to store some config files i require with the module? Anyone out there suggest the best place for this? Should it be in the root of the module or in with the helpers maybe? Edit: Along the same lines as this question: is it acceptable to have a folder in the root of the namespace for the modules for includes that will be shared amongst the modules?
