Using categorical features for regression problem in deep learning

I have a dataset which has 131 features. my goal is to estimate a value based on these features using deep learning(regression problem). However, 5 of my features only has 0 or 1 values, i want to know how can i implement these categorical variables in my model for regression problem? should i remove them ? or what? I really appreciate any help
