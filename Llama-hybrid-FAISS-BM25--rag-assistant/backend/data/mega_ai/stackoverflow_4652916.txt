Using IUserType would be a possibility if you store the key of the blob in the database and use this key to retrieve the blob when the user type is read from the database. However, transaction management across the database and the blob storage would be an issue. Entity persisters can be a lot of work to write and get right, as the documentation for this extensability mechanism of (N)Hibernate is not great. They are very geared towards relational databases, though could be used to access other storage mechanisms. Using event triggers may indeed provide the best option. They provide a pretty clean and compact interface to the life cycle events of an entity and to the transactions in which they take place.
