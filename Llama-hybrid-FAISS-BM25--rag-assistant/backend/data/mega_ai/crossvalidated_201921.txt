Transforming data on the Principal Components axis?

x y 2.5 2.4 0.5 0.7 2.2 2.9 1.9 2.2 3.1 3.0 2.3 2.7 2 1.6 1 1.1 1.5 1.6 1.1 0.9 Eigenvalues: .0490 1.2840 Eigenvectors: -.7352 -.6779 .6779 -.7352 Now how would I project my original x,y data onto the new axis or eigenvectors sometimes called transformed data? 1.using one single eigenvector. 2.using both eigenvectors refer to page 18 and 19 of the link.
