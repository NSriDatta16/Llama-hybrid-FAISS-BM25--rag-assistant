If the web server wants to returnin a 401 status instead of returning the web page, there is no way for a client to grab the content anyway. Instead, you must convince the server to serve the page. Perhaps it is expecting authentication credentials that you already have saved in Firefox. Perhaps it wants to see Firefox's User-Agent header in your http request. If you can't guess or ask the server admin, you might try using Wireshark to sniff the network conversation of a successful session and compare it to that of an unsuccessful one.
