The first question I have is: are you running a domain controller? This may sound like a crazy question, but I just want to make sure. Although is less and less common, I've seen organizations run Windows networks with workgroups and "pass-through" authentication. The symptoms you describe are the same as would be observed on a network that is set up in this fashion. Assuming you do have a proper domain set up, you must have a problem somewhere in the Named Pipes network stack. Named Pipes is the default protocol if you're using Windows authentication. It's not a bad idea to get to the bottom of this if you have the time, but if you just want to fix your performance problem, then I would force the TCP/IP protocol in your connection string: DRIVER=SQL Server;SERVER=tcp:[server name];Connect Timeout=300;Trusted Connection=True;APP=Microsoft Office 2003;WSID=[server name];DATABASE=[db name] Note the addition of the tcp: prefix. I got this syntax from Jon Galloway's blog. TCP/IP is the default protocol for SQL Server Authentication. You can also make the protocol switch by disabling Named Pipes support on the server, but this is more of a hassle and could cause other unanticipated problems.
