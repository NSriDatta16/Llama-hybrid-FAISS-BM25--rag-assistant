Check out jQuery Marquee , here's a demo: http://remysharp.com/demo/marquee.html . For updating the content at set intervals without reloading the page you're looking at AJAX requests using the jQuery.ajax method. I would recommend getJSON for simple data retrieval for updating your pages. jQuery has it's own getting started guide and visualjquery.com is a resource I constantly use as an API reference. Hope that helps.
