Where can I see a summary of tools and techniques for most updated transformer developments?

Since the invention of chatGPT, there are many tools and techniques and variants invented ever since. I want to keep track of these developments and tools but I find no avail. May I know which resources/sites that showcases all these? Thanks in advance.
