I think you need to look at this problem in a different aspect. Based on your case, instead of training your model to recognize 'if this item is recyclable', you can approach this problem as 'if this item is not recyclable'. The reason is you only have 5 recyclable items, which is much less that those of in reality. So, by the way, you can look at this problem as an unsupervised learning way or a semi-supervised learning way, with the assumption that you have access to the items that are NOT recyclable . In detail, the suggested approaches are of two: unsupervised learning: design your problem as an outlier detection problem. Build the training information with most of non-recyclable item with very few recyclable item. Follow the approaches such as k-means clustering, Gaussian mixture model, etc. semi-supervised learning: in this one, you are doing a regression on only the non-recyclable item. If you provide a item that is recyclable to your trained model, your model will predicted a value with large deviation comparing with you predefined value. Please refer to one-class SVM or one-class neural network. In your subject, for image based detection, probably constitutional neural network will be better...
