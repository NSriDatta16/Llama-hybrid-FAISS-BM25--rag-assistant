A set of duplicated normal random variables

I am working on the following problem. I have a set of $n$ random variables $$X=\{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}\} \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$$ I also have a set of $n$ random variables $$Y=\{p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n}\} \sim U(a,b)$$ Using these two sets of random variables, I create a set $Z$ . $$Z=\{x_{1},...,x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{2},...,x_{n},...,x_{n}\}$$ Note that I listed $x_{i}$ for $p_{i}$ times ( $i=1,2,...n$ ). I would like to know how to evalueate this set of variables. For example, how can I get an expression for the average of its components?
