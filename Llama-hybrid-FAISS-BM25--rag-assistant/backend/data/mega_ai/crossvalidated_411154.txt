I am not an expert in NN but was intrigued by your question.I took your 202 sequential values with known periodicity of 19 into AUTOBOX my tool of choice and proceeded to automatically analyze the data. It yielded the following model suggesting a level shift at time period 152 in addition to a few pulses. The Actual/Fit and Forecast graph as here with cleansed data here and reasonable forecasts here . The plot of the model's residuals are here with acf here Note also that two change points were detected in the error var iance suggesting increased error variance at 56 and a reduction in error variance at 92 suggesting the need for Weighted Estimation (GLS) to render the error process homogeneous This all suggests to me that your simulation incorporated a deterministic (and ignored) component which might explain why your forecast is flawed as you only included stochastic memory (arima) while the data included additional deterministic effects and some error variance changes. Do you concur with this ? Do you have any reason why your simulation may have introduced these additional effects NOT remediable with NN bit clearly in the historical . To continue my research in this NN vs Robust Time Series I used your suggestion of 15% and retained 32 values from the end and proceeded to develop the following model and forecasts for the out-of-sample 32 values. This is what was obtained using 172 actuals and 32 retained. and and .. no level shift at 152 due to only 20 values being available. and with a 1.2% MAPE for the 32 periods. I hope this helps you and others to clear up mysteries regarding NN and the possible analyses that are routinely available .
