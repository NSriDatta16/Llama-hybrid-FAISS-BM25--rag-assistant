random effect or time series model?

I'm modeling longitudinal patient level health records data which will have the following structure: \begin{equation*} \text{Prob}(Y_{it}=1 \text{ at time } t \text{ and member } i)=\beta_{i0} +\beta_{i1}x_{i,t-1} + \beta_{i2}x_{i,t-2} + ... + \beta_{ik}x_{i,t-k} + \text{additional covariates for patient age, diagnoses, etc.} \end{equation*} where Y is an inpatient hospitalization indicator variable for time period t and patient i, and the x's measure frequency of home nursing visits during prior time periods. The predictor variables are significantly correlated at the patient level. I'm considering a logistic regression, however the strong correlation between the x's makes things a bit more complicated. Is a time series model appropriate here, or would a multilevel repeated measures model be better (say using proc mixed in SAS with a random intercept for each member)?
