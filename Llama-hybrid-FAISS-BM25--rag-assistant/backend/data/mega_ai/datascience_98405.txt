It seems to be any kind of data that can be organized in a logical way. For example, bills that includes creation date or location (= that could be translated to a X,Y geographical position), or a employee ID in a company that is a number incremented with every new employee, or any name that could be classified in an alphabetical order. In your example, the data is primarily ordered by Item, and then Event.
