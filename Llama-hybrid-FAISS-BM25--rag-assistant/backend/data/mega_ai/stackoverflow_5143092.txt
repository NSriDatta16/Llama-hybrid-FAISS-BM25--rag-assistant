Recognizing set width/height of flash cs5 component?

i have a class, that extends Sprite and i want to build a Flash CS5 component out of it (using the component panel in Flash CS5, so some designers can benefit from it). The specialty is, i am overriding the setters/getters of width/height and also scaleX/scaleY of my component, because i want to do some special stuff there, but of course i still call super.width, ... and so on. So, i set up everything, drag an instance on the stage at author time, resize it to my needs. But at runtime now, i had to find, that neither my overridden width or height setters, nor my overridden scaleX / scaleY setters are ever called. Still, my component got resized. So i ask myself, what is Flash CS5 doing to change the size of my component, if it is not using width/height or scaleX/scaleY? Everything else works as expected, i have some parameters, which i set to inspectable and i can set them in the panel in the flash IDE, it just works fine. Only my overridden setters are not called.
