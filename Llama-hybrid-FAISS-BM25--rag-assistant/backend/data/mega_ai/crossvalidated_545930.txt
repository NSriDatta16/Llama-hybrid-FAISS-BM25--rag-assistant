Note that repeated measures ANOVA is considered to be obsolete by the marjority of statisticians, because it assumes a correlation structure that is two inflexible. Look at the chart in section 7.3 of RMS for more information and for better alternatives. In your special case where you compute the difference between a sampled value and a known constant, it is quite reasonable to analyze the original directional differences and to also analyze the undirectional absolute differences. This will allow you to describe "how far off" the participants are as a function of participant characteristics. But the distribution of absolute values will be more non-normal than the original signed differences, and parametric methods may not fit adequately. I suggest using a random effects (one random effect per subject, with random effects assumed to be normal with a finite single variance) in a proportional odds ordinal logistic model. The semiparametric proportional odds ordinal model does not assume a shape for the distribution of absolute values, so allows it to be the skewed distribution that it is. There are two R packages that will do this in the frequentist domain. The ordinal package is one of them. Bayesian modeling will provide more exact inference and there are many Bayesian modeling packages that will fit the longitudinal proportional odds model with random effects, e.g., brms and rmsb and rstanarm .
