SVMs are not usually thought of as a probabilistic model, but a maximally-discriminant model. Thus I have a hard time formulating your question in the context of what I know of SVMs. In addition, the Python bindings that come with libSVM are not terribly performant and don't expose all the options of libSVM. That said, if you are willing to look at other bindings, the scikit-learn 's svm bindings are richer and expose some parameters that may come in handy, such as weighted classes , or weighted samples . You might be able to put more emphasis on the class for which you do not want mis-classification. In addition, the scikit's binding expose a posterior classification probability , but in the case of SVMs, I believe that it relies on a hack (as SVMs are not probabilistic) of libSVM that resamples the classification to have a confidence interval on the prediction.
