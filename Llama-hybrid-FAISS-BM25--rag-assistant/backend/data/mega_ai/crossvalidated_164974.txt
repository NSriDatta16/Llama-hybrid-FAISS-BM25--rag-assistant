The equation follows from the definition of marginal distribution : $$ p(y) = \int_\theta{p(y, \theta)} $$ And, from factoring the joint probability of data and parameters into conditional probabilities, like so: $$p(y, \theta) = p(y|\theta)p(\theta)$$ (If this is confusing, divide both sides by $p(\theta)$ to get the familiar definition of conditional probability.) More plainly, and as referenced in comments, the prior predictive distribution is the Bayesian term defined as the marginal distribution of the data over the prior: It denotes an interpretation of a particular marginal distribution.
