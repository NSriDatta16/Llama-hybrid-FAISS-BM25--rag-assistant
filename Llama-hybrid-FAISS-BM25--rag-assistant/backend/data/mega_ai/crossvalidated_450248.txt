Partially answered in comments: Have you considered Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis by Helmut Lütkepohl and Time Series Analysis by James D. Hamilton? – Dimitriy V. Masterov Maybe also Applied Econometric Time Series by Walter Enders. – Dimitriy V. Masterov This could prove tricky. For example, James Gentle in his book Computational Statistics says that statisticians should be aware that "the form of mathematical expression and the way the expression should be evaluated in practice may be quite different". For that reason, time-series books may be only useful to a certain degree. You will also need some decent linear algebra / computational statistics references to complete this admirable objective. I'd say, it's a lot of work and you'll need to understand a lot - more than time-series. – Graeme Walsh The way the vars package estimates VAR models is equation-by-equation. For that, knowing simple regression is enough (which may be surprising). You do not need to learn ARIMA because (1) it is not a subset of VAR and (2) it involves different logic and different estimation techniques which are much more difficult to implement it in practice. – Richard Hardy
