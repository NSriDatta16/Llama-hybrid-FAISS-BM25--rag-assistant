I'm very interested in these types of questions myself. I do think there is a lot of information we can get out of a random forest. About interactions, it seems like Breiman and Cutler have already tried to look at it, especially for classification RFs. To my knowledge, this has not been implemented in the randomForest R package. Maybe because it might not be as simple and because the meaning of "variable interactions" is very dependent of your problem. About the nonlinearity, I'm not sure what you are looking for, regression forest are used for nonlinear multiple regression problems without any priors on what type of nonlinear function to use.
