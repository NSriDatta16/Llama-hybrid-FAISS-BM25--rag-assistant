A new comer in this field - How to start?

To be honest I find entire DS field so vague that I can't find actual roadmap of learning. I am actually a programmer for 10+ years and pretty much interested to get into Data related field. My stats and math suck at this moment. My question is, is it Ok that I use my programming skills and jump right onto Machine Learning/Analysis tools like WEKA, Python Scikit etc and use their algorithm for understanding and keep studying/learning theory in parallel. Right now in terms of Data, I am already involved in: Data Processing(RDBMS) Data Scrapping(Python) What I am thinking the logical steps are: Data Mining Data Analysis (sentiment analysis etc) Data Presentation/Visualization( D3 etc?) Machine Learning Kit/Libraries I have given myself a 6 month time to get into this field. Thanks
