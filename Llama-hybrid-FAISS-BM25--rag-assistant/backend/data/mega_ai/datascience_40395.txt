Since your winning_probability (Win_prob%) is a continuous numeric outcome variable, it is a supervised learning regression problem. For this there are many methods, both linear and non-linear (especially see scikit-learn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html ). Which of these algorithm is best for you depends on your data. It is likely that you need to try multiple algorithms and see which one gives best results. Cross-validation ( http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html ) is likely to be best way to determine this. You may also try neural networks using other libraries, e.g. https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_regression or https://www.kaggle.com/xgdbigdata/keras-regression-tutorial# . Once you have predicted winning_probability, it can be segmented into low, medium and high risk using any chosen criteria. Hope this helps.
