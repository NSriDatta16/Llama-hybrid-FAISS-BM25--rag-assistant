A salt is normally used for storing hashes of passwords safely. Hashing a password for storage or communication (such that it can't be read by others) is vulnerable for decoding by using rainbow tables . Now, when you add a random string to the password, but store the string with the hash, this becomes much harder. Calculating this new hash looks like: hash(password + salt) or even hash(hash(password) + salt) To safely log into a third party website, can send the UserID, salted hash (from above) and the salt that you used (if it is not given). Depending on how that website stored its passwords, you can generate the salt for yourself or you can ask for a salt from it. One option is to send the UserID first to the website, then let it respond with the salt, and then send the hash(password+salt)) back to the website.
