Of course you can call method directly on the object but consider following scenarios: You want to call series of method by using single delegate without writing lot of method calls. You want to implement event based system elegantly. You want to call two methods same in signature but reside in different classes. You want to pass method as a parameter. You don't want to write lot of polymorphic code like in LINQ , you can provide lot of implementation to the Select method.
