Linear regression is not appropriate for this problem. You should consider setting criteria for satisfied customers (say those who marked 4 or 5, e.g. a "Top 2 box") and then create a binary variable (say "satisfied", where 1 = respondent marked 4 or 5, 0 = else). Use this binary "satisfied" variable as the dependent variable in a logistic regression. Executives (who would usually be the ones utilizing the result) tend to favor this model, as you can tell them odds ratios for effects making a customer satisfied. That is a lot easier to interpret than a regression to individual score (which, being self-responses, aren't really comparable at that high of resolution anyways).
