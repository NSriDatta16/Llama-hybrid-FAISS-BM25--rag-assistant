What is posterior predictive check, and how I can do that in R?

I am using Bayesian hierarchical modeling to predict an ordered categorical variable from a metric variable. For example, I want to regress Happiness (in 1-5 ratings) on Money (a metric variable): Happinessâˆ¼log(Dollars) After estimating posterior distribution using MCMC with RJags, I want to do a posterior predictive check, so I need to model a discrepency between posterior distribution and the data. But what should I choose as the discrepency? This is the result of a sample from pp.check from jagsUI package which calculates Bayesian $p$-value for posterior predictive checking Bayesian analyses fit in JAGS.
