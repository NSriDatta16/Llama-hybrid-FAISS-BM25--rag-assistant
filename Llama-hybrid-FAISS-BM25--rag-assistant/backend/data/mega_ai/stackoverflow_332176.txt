With two exceptions, the answer must be a resounding "no". Rationale: Yes, as others have already pointed out there are many cases where I prefer to have a link opened in another tab. But thanks, I'll make the determination of when and which myself. The basic tenet of the web is that the user is sitting with a user agent , a.k.a. web browser. The browser is in other words an agent on behalf of the user. If I'll want a particular link opened in another tab, I'll command-click (or ctrl-clik on another OS), and if I don't, then I'll click regularly. When a link on a web page opens the link in a new tab without my asking, it annoys me no end and breaks the predictability and familiarity of the web. Exception 1: When clicking to see a large version of a picture or some other plain pop-up window. I see this as a separate topic. Exception 2: Fully Ajaxy web applications, which seem to set aside most of the rules of the web anyway.
