I don't know if you can just do it using a mouseDragged event. In the past I use mousePressed to save the original point and mouse dragged to get the current point. In both cases I translate the points to the location on the screen. Then the difference between the two points is easily calculated and the location can be set appropriately. My general purpose class for this is the Component Mover class.
