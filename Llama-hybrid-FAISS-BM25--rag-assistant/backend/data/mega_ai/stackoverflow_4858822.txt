what's the best way to play with cloud as independent project?

I am interested in play with new technology and the cloud things is one of recent interest i want to focus on. I want to know whether there is a way for me to try and do some experiment for free. I know google app engine maybe a way. But what if i want to have more supportive platform and try some other thing like building the Cassandra cluster. Is there any way I can have a good start? Such as free cloud data storage, or some academic projects opening to everyone? or even the raw server. I am thinking whether I should setup a test server at home. :) Maybe the amazon stuff? but it seems that cost is a little high, but free for academic project. Anyone have suggestions? Thanks for all reply.
