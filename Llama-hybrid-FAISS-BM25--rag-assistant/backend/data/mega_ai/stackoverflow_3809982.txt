As far as car_allocation is an intermediate table, it's rather better to put it into the FROM clause and JOIN others: SELECT car.rego FROM car_allocation A JOIN car ON A.car_id = car.car_id JOIN stuff ON A.stuff_id = stuff.stuff_id AND (staff.office = 'Glasgow' OR staff.office = 'Bearsden' -- OR some another condition, etc) Pay attention to brackets, they groups conditions. or SELECT car.rego FROM car_allocation A JOIN car ON A.car_id = car.car_id JOIN stuff ON A.stuff_id = stuff.stuff_ids AND staff.office IN ('Glasgow', 'Bearsden') If you have an enumeration you can use IN operator. Also JOIN means the same as INNER JOIN . Here's MySQL manual considering JOIN syntax
