Is this de best way to update an entity from DataContext?

I've found that this is the way to update an entity from a DataContext public bool UpdateLead(Lead lead) { OrganizationServiceContext context = GetOrgContext(); Lead leadToTrack = getLead(lead.Id, context); leadToTrack.AccountId.Id = lead.AccountId.Id; //... context.UpdateObject(leadToTrack); context.SaveChanges(); return true; } But I have about 200 fields in that entity (thanks to Microsoft Dynamics CRM). Do I have to write 200 lines like leadToTrack.Field1 = lead.Field1 or is there a more concise way? Thanks
