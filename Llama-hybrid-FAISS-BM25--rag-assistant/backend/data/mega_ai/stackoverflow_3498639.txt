How does Google create its form buttons?

I really like how Gmail has created the form input and accompanying "Search Mail" button. See linked for screenshot . However, I'm having a difficult time deciphering Gmails compressed HTML/CSS code to figure out how they created this look. Can someone assist me in figuring out what HTML and CSS I need to use to recreate the combination of the text input + accompanying "search mail" button exactly as seen in Gmail (see screenshot and pay particular attention to how the text input touchs the button as well). Thanks in advance. UPDATE : I found the following blog post but it did not have enough information for me to recreate what Gmail has done with the "search mail" button. stopdesign.com/archive/2009/02/04/recreating-the-button.html UPDATE 2 Even though I have got some initial awesome help from Michael below, I'm still at a lose for how to actually implement this. Any more help, would be really appreciated. Thanks!
