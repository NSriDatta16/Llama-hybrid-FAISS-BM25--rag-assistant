problem in getting the specific list

I have written a class which at first you pass a list to its constructor and then it will find all its permutations and then I make a BST with each of them and I will find their average access time.all these works are OK! BUT I want to keep the permutation which has the least average access time and I will get the least average access time but it won't give me the specific permutation of that least average access time. for example I have these permutations with their average access time: [digit :3 probability: 0.2 level:1, digit :1 probability: 0.3 level:2, digit :2 probability: 0.1 level:3, digit :6 probability: 0.1 level:2, digit :5 probability: 0.1 level:3] 1.6 [digit :3 probability: 0.2 level:1, digit :1 probability: 0.3 level:2, digit :2 probability: 0.1 level:3, digit :5 probability: 0.1 level:2, digit :6 probability: 0.1 level:3] 1.6 [digit :1 probability: 0.3 level:1, digit :2 probability: 0.1 level:2, digit :3 probability: 0.2 level:3, digit :5 probability: 0.1 level:4, digit :6 probability: 0.1 level:5] 2.0 I want to get one of the fist permutations but it will print the last permutation ! CODE: public void getAverageAccessTime(ArrayList result) { averageAccessTime = 0.0; averageAccessTime += result.get(0).getProbability(); result.get(0).setLevel(1); root = new DNode(result.get(0), null, null); for (int i = 1; i averageAccessTime) { minAverageAccessTime =averageAccessTime; listWithMinimumAverageAccessTime = result; } }
