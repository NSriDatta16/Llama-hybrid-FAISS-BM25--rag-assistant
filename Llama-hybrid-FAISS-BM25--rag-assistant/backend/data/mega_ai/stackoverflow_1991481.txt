How to embed audio message into an audio file with php?

I would like know if it is possible to create embedding of audio message to audio files? For example, on playing every 10 sec of an audio, it would be interrupted with an audio message "You are currently listening to an audio by XYZ band" and then the audio continues. And even if someone were to download the mp3 file, the audio message is still embedded with that downloaded file? May I know if there are any libraries or classes that can work with php to achieve the above result? And what would be the workflow? Thank you very much.
