Finding the best path through the matrix in DTW

I have two time series q and c and I want to calculate dynamic time wrapping (DTW) distance between these two time series: q As I understand we should make a matrix like this: 4 | 9 1 0 1 4 9 3 | 16 0 1 4 9 16 5 | 16 4 1 0 1 4 1 | 0 4 9 16 25 36 3 | 4 0 1 4 9 16 ------------------ 1 3 4 5 6 7 I have read many references, but I could not understand how the finding the best path in this matrix works. Could you please explain to me how can to find the best path through this matrix, and then how can to calculate DTW?
