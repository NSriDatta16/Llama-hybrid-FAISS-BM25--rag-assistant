I did some more research on this today, and finally noticed a good stack trace of the underlying error I was getting, and a hibernate forum entry that helped me get past this. The Exception I was getting is: Caused by: org.hibernate.PropertyNotFoundException: Could not find setter for CLAUSEDETAILID It appears as if Hibernate is taking my camel case aliases & turning them into all uppercase, so it can't find the matching setters in my AdvancedClauseSearchResultDTO class. Here's the forum entry that pointed me in the right direction: https://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1001608 I ended up using the approach detailed in that post for my own ResultTransformer, and that's working for me.
