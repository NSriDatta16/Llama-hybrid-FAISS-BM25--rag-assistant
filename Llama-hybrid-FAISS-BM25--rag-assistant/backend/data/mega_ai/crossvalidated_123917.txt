Using random forest for survival analysis with time varying covariates

I've been trying to train a model that predicts an individual's survival time. My training set is an unbalanced panel; it has multiple observations per individual and thus time varying covariates. Every individual is observed from start to finish so no censoring. As a test, I used a plain random forest regression (not a random survival forest), treating each observation as if it were iid (even if it came from the same individual) with the duration as the target. When testing the predictions on a test set, the results have been surprisingly accurate. Why is this working so well? I thought random forests needed iid observations.
