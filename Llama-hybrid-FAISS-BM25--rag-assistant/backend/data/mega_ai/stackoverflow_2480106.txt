This is obviously a hot topic, so I'm going to give a list of reasons why I prefer an IDE editor for coding. I prefer to be able to fold sections of my code (I don't know whether Vi(m) can) without having to remember the command to do so or type it. I prefer a one-click compile button/command as opposed to having to remember my compile command and its library of options I prefer the easier highlight copy paste operations without having to........ aah sod it!! Well, by now you get the picture. I'm not knocking Vi(m). I just think having your the elements and functionality of your coding environment visually represented makes for a clearer head and encourages exploration of options you may not know exists.
