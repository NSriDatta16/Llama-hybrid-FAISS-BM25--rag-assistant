As the two other posts said, it comes with a lot of pre-packaged apps that take care of common tasks in modern websites. Here's a list of the external apps that come packaged: https://github.com/pinax/pinax/blob/master/requirements/pinax.txt It also gives you project templates to start from, which you can see here: https://github.com/pinax/pinax/tree/master/pinax/projects/ The projects have working default settings in place so that you can run syncdb then runserver to get going immediately, unlike default Django. Its design also encourages you to write your own apps in such a way that they are more reusable. As they put it, "By integrating numerous reusable Django apps to take care of the things that many sites have in common, it lets you focus on what makes your site different." It does have a small learning curve of its own but I've personally been very happy with it and learned a lot more about Django (and git and virtualenv) by using Pinax.
