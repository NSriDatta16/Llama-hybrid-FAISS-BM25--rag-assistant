Polyspace is a a (hideously expensive, but very good) commercial product based on program verification. It's fairly pragmatic, in that it scales up from 'enhanced unit testing that will probably find some bugs' to 'the next three years of your life will be spent showing these 10 files have zero defects'. It is based more on negative verification ('this program won't corrupt your stack') instead positive verification ('this program will do precisely what these 50 pages of equations say it will').
