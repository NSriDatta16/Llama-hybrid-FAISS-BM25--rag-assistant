As crayola says, the distribution is unlikely to be independent. Even if it is, as assumed below, the analysis is not simple. It is possible to work out the probability of $N$ items happening in $M$ unique months out of $24$ with the following recursion: $$\Pr(M=m|N=n) = \tfrac{(24-m+1)\Pr(M=m-1|N=n-1) + m\Pr(M=m|N=n-1)}{24} $$ starting at $\Pr(M=0|N=0)=1$, and $\Pr(M=0|N=n)=0$ for non-zero $n$. So, for example, $\Pr(M=20|N=42) = 0.2676\ldots$, and for $M=20$ this is the value of $N$ which gives the greatest likelihood. It is also possible to work out the expected number of unique months $$E[M|N=n] = 24 \left(1-\left(\frac{24-1}{24}\right)^n\right).$$ If we set this equal to 20 and solved for $n$ we would get $$n=\frac{\log(24)-\log(24-20)}{\log(24)-\log(24-1)} \approx 42.09999\ldots$$ though $N$ needs to be an integer. So this too hints at $42$ . This is all looking hopeful, but hides the true horror. For example if $M=20$ then I think the 95% confidence interval for $N$ is $[28,68]$ which is rather wide. And if $M=24$ for a popular item then a similar confidence interval for $N$ could be $[50,\infty )$ while the maximum likelihood and expectation methods which took us from an observation of $20$ to an estimate of $42$ would take us from an observation of $24$ to an estimate of $\infty$. Even is you used Bayesian methods to deal with the $M=24$ observation case you would still face very wide credible intervals. The real answer is to get better inventory management reporting.
