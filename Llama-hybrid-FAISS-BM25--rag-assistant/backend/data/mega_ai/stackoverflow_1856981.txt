Best way to organize applications?.... (MVC design pattern)

When building applications, whats the best way to decide what goes where. How do you know what functions to put in what controllers and models. For example, I'm building an application that is based highly on location. Users can post different things, that will in turn be shown to other users within a certain distance. Also, each user will have their own profile page that will show everything posted by that user regardless of location. So I have models like this class UserModel extends BaseM{ get_user($uid); get_all_users(); edit_user($new_data); delete_user($uid); add_user($new_user); get_user_articles($uid); get_user_reviews($uid); get_user_foo($uid); } class ArticleModel extends BaseM{ get_article($aid); get_all_articles(); add_article($new_article); delete_article($aid); }// similar to ReviewModel, and other models class LocalModel extends BaseM{ get_local_articles($zip_code, $range); get_local_reviews($zip_code, $range); get_local_foo($zip_code, $range); }// holds all location related functions As you can see, I lumped everything dealing with a user (needs a userID) in the userModel, everything dealing with location (needs a zip-code) in the localModel, and then everything else has its own model. I was wondering whats the best way to figure out what goes where, is there like a rule of thumb for this kind of stuff?
