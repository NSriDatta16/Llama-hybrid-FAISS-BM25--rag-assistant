The procedure for cross-validated regularization parameter selection is the following : Discretize your lambdas : $\lambda_0, \lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n$ (for example you may choose $\lambda = 10^{-3}, 3 \times 10^{-3}, 10^-2, ..., 10^3$, but this is up to you. Divide your dataset into $n$ subsamples, where $n$ is the number of cross-validation folds. For each $\lambda$, compute the cross-validated error when training your model with regularization parameter $\lambda$ (this is the cross-validation part : for each fold, train on all the other folds and compute the error on the reserved fold ; then average out the error). Choose the $\lambda$ which gave the lowest cross-validated error (alternatively, choose the smallest value of $\lambda$ within one standard deviation of the lowest cross-validated error if you want to be extra conservative).
