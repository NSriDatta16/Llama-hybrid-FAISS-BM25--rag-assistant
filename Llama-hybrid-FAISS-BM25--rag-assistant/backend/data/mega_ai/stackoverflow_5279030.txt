EDIT (Incorporated all comments to a single answer) Try one of the following (or all) Instead of using Build For -> Archive, in the product menu just use archive. It will show up then. In the scheme editor, edit the scheme and go to the Archive tab, make sure the check box for show in Organizer is checked. In the archive tab in the scheme editor check the build configuration used for archiving. Make sure it has the right entitlements file & certificates. In the build settings switch Skip Install -> Release to NO, for the build settings used for archiving. Make sure the archives folder and XCode project files are inside the same shared folder if network drive is used. I took me a few days to finally figure this out as I placed my XCode source files from a Windows shared folder, but the Archives folder is on the local Mac, which caused archives not picked up by Organizer.
