When building an app that uses the internal storage, the Android OS creates a unique folder, which will only be accessible from the app, so no other app, or even the user, can see what's in the folder. The external storage is more like a public storage, so for now, it's the sdcard, but could become any other type of storage (remote hard drive, or anything else). The internal storage should only be used for application data, (preferences files and settings, sound or image media for the app to work). If you intent to download many mp3s, i'd reccomend saving them to external storage, as the external storage is often bigger. Besides, storing data on the internal storage may prevent the user to install other applications.
