What's the more elegant way to declare a const in C#

Possible Duplicate: C# naming convention for constants? I'm refactoring a library in C# and I found a lot of upper case constants: INTERVAL, TIME, SECONDS. I think this a kind of unnecessary, and personally I prefer declare everything with camel case. Exist some exactly definition about the better way?
