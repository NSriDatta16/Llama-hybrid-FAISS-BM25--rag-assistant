Linq To SQL OrderBy, issue when using enums

I am having some issues with using the OrderBy extension method on a LINQ query when it is operating on an enum type. I have created a regular DataContext using visual studio by simply dragging and dropping everything onto the designer. I have then created seperate entity models, which are simply POCO's, and I have used a repository pattern to fetch the data from my database and map them into my own entity models (or rather, I have a repository pattern, that builds up and IQueryable that'll do all this). Everything works just fine, except when I try to apply an OrderBy (outside of the repository) on a property that I have mapped from short/smallint to an enum. Here are the relevant code bits: public class Campaign { public long Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } .... public CampaignStatus Status { get; set; } ... } public enum CampaignStatus : short { Active, Inactive, Todo, Hidden } public class SqlCampaignRepository : ICampaignRepository { ... public IQueryable Campaigns() { DataContext db = new DataContext(); return from c in db.Campaigns select new Campaign { Id = c.Id, Name = c.Name, ... Status = (CampaignStatus)c.Status, ... }; } } And then elsewhere SqlCampaignRepository rep = new SqlCampaignRepository(); var query = rep.Campaigns().OrderBy(c => c.Status); This triggers the following exception: System.ArgumentException was unhandled by user code Message="The argument 'value' was the wrong type. Expected 'IQMedia.Models.CampaignType'. Actual 'System.Int16'." Source="System.Data.Linq" StackTrace: ved System.Data.Linq.SqlClient.SqlOrderExpression.set_Expression(SqlExpression value) ved System.Data.Linq.SqlClient.SqlBinder.Visitor.VisitSelect(SqlSelect select) ved System.Data.Linq.SqlClient.SqlVisitor.Visit(SqlNode node) ved System.Data.Linq.SqlClient.SqlBinder.Visitor.VisitIncludeScope(SqlIncludeScope scope) ... (sorry about the danish in there, ved = by/at). I have tried typecasting the Status to short in the orderBy expression, but that doesn't help it, same if i cast it to the actual enum type as well. Any help fixing this is greatly appreciated!
