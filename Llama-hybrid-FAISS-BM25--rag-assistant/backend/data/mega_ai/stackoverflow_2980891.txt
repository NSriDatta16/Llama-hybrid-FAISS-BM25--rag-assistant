Your first design is correct for a relational database. The redundancy in the key columns is preferable because it gives you a lot more flexibility in how you validate and query the rankings. You can do sorts, counts, averages, etc. in SQL without having to write any PHP code to split your string six ways from Sunday. It sounds like you would like to use a non-SQL database like CouchDB or MongoDB. These would allow you to store a semi-structured list of rankings right in the record for the photo, and subsequently query the rankings efficiently. With the caveat that you don't really know that the rankings are in the right format, as you do with SQL.
