Create a modifiable string literal in C++

Is it possible to create a modifiable string literal in C++? For example: char* foo[] = { "foo", "foo" }; char* afoo = foo[0]; afoo[2] = 'g'; // access violation This produces an access violation because the "foo"s are allocated in read only memory (.rdata section I believe). Is there any way to force the "foo"s into writable memory (.data section)? Even via a pragma would be acceptable! (Visual Studio compiler) I know I can do strdup and a number of other things to get around the problem, but I want to know specifically if I can do as I have asked. :)
