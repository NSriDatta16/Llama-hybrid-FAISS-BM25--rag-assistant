As I understand it correctly you have several estimates $\hat{\theta}_i$ of different population statistics $\theta_i$ , and wish to create an expression for the error that may occur. You currently compute the mean relative error (I assume using the absolute value of the deviation?) $$\text{mean relative error} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{|\hat{\theta}_i - \theta_i|}{\theta_i}$$ Your problem is that some of the relative errors $\frac{|\hat{\theta}_i - \theta_i|}{\theta_i}$ may be large while their importance is small because the error $|\hat{\theta}_i - \theta_i|$ is small. For example, if the true answer is 3, and my algorithm gives 9, it is a 200% error and will result in a very high average error, even if the other queries are answered properly I guess that you neither want the mean absolute error $$\text{mean absolute error} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n {|\hat{\theta}_i - \theta_i|}$$ and your use of the relative errors can be based on the idea/assumption that the relative error is constant among your values and the relevant value to describe the algorithm. For example your algorithm might be that you take a sample $k$ and multiply the average with the total size $m$ of the population to get an estimate of the sum in the population. Then your errors get multiplied with a factor $m$ but for the estimate of the error you would like to look at the error without that multiplication, hence use the relative error. If your situation is like the above example, then you should just accept that some relative errors can be very large. Sure it may happen with a small value $\theta_i$ but if your model is right, then the same relative error can just as well happen with a large value of $\theta_i$ . Possibly your model is not right and the relative errors are not constant. In order to get a better view of this you could plot the error versus the true values, to get an idea of the distribution of the error and it's relation with the true value. Also you might use information about the distribution and models behind of the sales (why do they vary? different amount of people, different sales per person, different percentage of people that make a sale, etc.) to come up with a better performance measure. For example, consider jars with 1000 marbles with red or white colour where the number of each colour is unknown. We estimate the sum of white/red marbles by sampling, without replacement, 50 marbles from the jars. Then the relationship between error and value looks like the following: These type of relationships can be very different and depending on the relationship and your goal with computing the error you may want to apply a different statistic. Potentially it can be better to not use a single statistic and estimate the relationship between the error and the true value instead. Some algorithms may be better for larger values and worse for smaller values, to compare the algorithms you either come up with a cost function that allows you to average the error for different cases, or you display the comparison in error as a curve/graph.
