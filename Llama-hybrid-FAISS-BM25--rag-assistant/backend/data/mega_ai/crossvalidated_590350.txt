What are some good feature selection techniques for binary classification problems?

I am performing binary classification on a data set with around 90k records and 28 features. I'd like to evaluate various models such logistics, SVM, Xgboost etc. via grid-search method to see which works best. I want to understand the best feature selection algorithms I can use to reduce the number of variables. I understand correlation heatmaps would be good to identify important variables in the case of regression problems. Is there any feature selection method that is more suitable for binary classification problems?
