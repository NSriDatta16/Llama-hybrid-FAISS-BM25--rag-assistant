To expand on Robert's answer you can do it with generics and stuff: public TReturn DynamicInvoker (T obj, string methodName, param[] args){ MethodInfo method = obj.GetType.GetMethod(methodName, BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public); (TResult)method.Invoke(obj, args); } If you wanted to make it completely horrible you can do that as a static method of object. You also can pass the BindingFlags as a method parameter.
