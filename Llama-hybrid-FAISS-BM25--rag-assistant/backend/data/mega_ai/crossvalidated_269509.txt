This is a good question, because model interpretation is more important than the model itself. First, you can try to using gblinear booster in xgboost, it's feature importance identical the coefficient of linear model, so you can get some impact direction of each variable. Second, you can try the monotone_constraints parameters in xgboost, and give some variable the monotic constrain, then compare the result difference. For more information about monotone_constrains, you can visit this site: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html
