According to the open pragma's documentation, you've already got the behavior you want: The open pragma serves as one of the interfaces to declare default "layers" (also known as "disciplines") for all I/O. Any two-argument open , readpipe (aka qx// ) and similar operators found within the lexical scope of this pragma will use the declared defaults. Even three-argument opens may be affected by this pragma when they don't specify IO layers in MODE. The perlop documentation tells us that while (<>) { ... } is equivalent to unshift(@ARGV, '-') unless @ARGV; while ($ARGV = shift) { open(ARGV, $ARGV); while ( ) { ... # code for each line } }
