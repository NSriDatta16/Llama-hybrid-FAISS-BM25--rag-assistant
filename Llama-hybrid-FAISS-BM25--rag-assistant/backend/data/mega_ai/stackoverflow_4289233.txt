How to determine if a specific type of mobile client is accessing my webapplication?

My current goal is to know when an iPhone, Android, and some other specific device is accessing my Java web application. I do not have to know anything more specific than that. I know one can get the User-Agent from the HTTP Request header and do a string search on it. Can it be as easy as just seeing if "iPhone" or "Android" is in the string? Looking at the user-agent information on wikipedia , it seems simple enough for my needs. I have also looked at WURFL. However, it seems much more than I need. Plus, the APIs are GPL and I want my license to not be GPL. Thanks!
