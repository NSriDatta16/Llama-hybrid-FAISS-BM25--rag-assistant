HoG feature vector confusion

I am new in the machine learning world and currently I am working on Computer Vision project. I am confused about HoG feature vector. In my understanding, the feature vector should contain magnitude and orientation of gradients. The gradient is a vector of partial derivations $v = \{ \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \}$. We are supposed to calculate this gradient for every pixel in the image. My question is: What gradient do we take? As I understand it, we are supposed to take gradient and its orientation/magnitude, where the biggest change occurs (in shade / color). But what about image like this? If we say the white dot is just one pixel, every direction of magnitude has same "scene change" from white to black, how do we chose gradient then? Secondly, how are we supposed to take the magnitude of gradient? Lets say we have this image: If we take 1st pixel (top left) and look for its gradient, the only scene change stats in the middle of image. Do we say the orientation is 0Â° and magnitude 50px (let's say it's a 100x100 image)? Or how do we deal with this? Thanks for answers.
