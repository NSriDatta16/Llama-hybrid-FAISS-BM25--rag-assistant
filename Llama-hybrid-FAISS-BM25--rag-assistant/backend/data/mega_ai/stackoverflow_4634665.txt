The Azure Table Storage Client natively understands DateTime (but not DateTimeOffset), so you may want to consider simply letting the SDK take care of the matter for you. Otherwise, the best way to represent DateTimes as strings is to explicitly store and retrieve them as UTC values written and parsed using the "u" format, e.g. var dateAsString = myDateTime.ToString("u");
