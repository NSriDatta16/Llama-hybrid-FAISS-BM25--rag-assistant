Improving SVM classification

I have a classification problem (bioinformatics domain) where I have around 333 features. Currently, I am first selecting features (using importance feature of random forest) and then pushing the same through RBF kernel for SVM. On the results front, I have section of data which gives bad results on the classifier. There is feature rscindex, which separates the data into well classified data and incorrectly classified data,i.e data points with rscindex
