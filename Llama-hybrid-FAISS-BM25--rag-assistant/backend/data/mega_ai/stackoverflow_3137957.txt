C++ pointer question

still working at C++, but this came up in my book and I don't understand what it's for: MyClass * FunctionTwo (MyClass *testClass) { return 0; } My question is what is the signifigance of the first indirection operator (MyClass *[ I tried making a function like it in codeblocks, with and without the first * and I didn't see any difference in the way it ran or it's output: int *testFunc(int *in) { cout I couldn't find anywhere that explained about it in my book. Thanks, Karl
