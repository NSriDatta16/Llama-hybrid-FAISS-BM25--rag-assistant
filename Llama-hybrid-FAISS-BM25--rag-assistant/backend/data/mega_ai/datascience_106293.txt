Beginning my data science journey

I am a Master's student in physics. Lately I have been intrigued by the field of data science. I have beginner level knowledge of python, undergraduate level knowledge of mathematics and master's level knowledge of physics. I now want to learn data science. I scoured the internet but could not get a good answer. I am willing to give around 1 to 1.5 hours daily. What steps should I take to become proficient in data science i.e what books should I read, what courses should I do, etc.?
