Very late answer from me, but I have found Introductory Time Series with R by Cowpertwaite and Metcalfe to be really useful for transitioning between BSc level analysis to MSc level stuff and professional work. Yes, it is a little basic, but there's good explanations and examples and some useful code. EDIT: I should add that I've also found Cryer and Chan hugely useful too in line with the first answer.
