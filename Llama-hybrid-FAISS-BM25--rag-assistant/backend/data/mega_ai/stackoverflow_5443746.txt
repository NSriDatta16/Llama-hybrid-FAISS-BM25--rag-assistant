First of all, there is an attribute in Active directory called thumbnailPhoto. According to this Microsoft article The thumbNailPhoto attribute contains octet string type data. The AD interprets octet string data as an array of bytes. If you want a sample code in C# you can get something here . On the theorical point of view you can also inject a photo with LDIF using tools like "B64" to code your image file in base 64. Secondly , On my point of view a Directory is not a database. So, even if the attribute exists (created by netscape according to the OID 2.16.840.1.113730.3.1.35 ), even if Microsoft explain us how to put a picture into Active Directory, I think that it's better to register an URL, or a path to a file from a file system into a Directory. I have no idea of the impact on performance of AD if I load each entry with 40 Ko (average size of a thumbnail photo). But I know that if there are bad written programs on the network, I mean kind of program that load all the attributes when they search an entry into the directory, this will considerably load the network. I hope it helps. JP
