C++: A way to declare a variable (or more than one) in an if statement that separates out the variable definition and the test?

One can do this: case WM_COMMAND: if (WORD wNotifyCode = HIWORD(wparam)) { ... } And one can do this: case WM_COMMAND: { WORD wNotifyCode = HIWORD(wparam); if (wNotifyCode > 1) { ... } } But one cannot do: case WM_COMMAND: if ((WORD wNotifyCode = HIWORD(wparam)) > 1) { ... } Using a for statement here I think is misleading: case WM_COMMAND: for (WORD wNotifyCode = HIWORD(wparam); wNotifyCode > 1; wNotifyCode = 0) { ... } Because it looks a lot like a loop is happening - and the poor schmuck who comes after me has to decipher this garbage. But is there no syntactic construct which combines the elegance of an if-statement that includes a local variable declaration with the ability to test its value for something other than zero?
