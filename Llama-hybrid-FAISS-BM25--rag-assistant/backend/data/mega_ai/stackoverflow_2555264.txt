It is certainly possible to split data like this for performance reasons, particularly if you are working with lots of data in lots of columns: you may for example just put "basic" user info in one table and detailed stuff (eg. with large text fields) in another because these are not accessed as often as the basic things. Maybe you need full text capabilities on parts of the data so you use tables with different storage engines. If ebaghaki needs to do it for performance reasons, i'd say its ok - be sure though, that you app ensures the validity of the keys (or use triggers to keep things up to date?). An alternative would be to build a lookup table which just holds references to the user and character tables. Then you wouldn't have any problems with null values for users that haven't chosen a character or characters that no users have chosen. This is probably your best bet because you aren't splitting the table for any of the reasons mentioned above.
