Although you talk about "calculation", in order to justify the presence of your question in this forum I will treat your problem as one of "statistical estimation". Moreover, I understand that this is not a supply-demand interaction framework, since it seems that you change prices and then "wait to see what happens", fulfilling whatever demand appears. Given these preliminaries: $1$) The fact that people may exhibit some degree of inertia is an integral part of their behavior, so trying to "eliminate" it is not useful since what you will then be estimating would perhaps be the "true" price elasticity of demand, but one which will never materialize, since inertia will always be present, and will affect the total demand response. More over, how would you determine the length of time to ignore? What you need is to obtain a separate estimate of both effects. This calls for a specification like the following: $$\frac {\Delta q_t}{q_{t-1}} = a\frac {\Delta q_{t-1}}{q_{t-2}} + b\frac {\Delta p_{t}}{p_{t-1}} + u_t $$ wher $a$ captures the degree of inertia, expected positive, and $b$ is expected negative, while $u_t$ is assumed white noise. The inclusion of the error term, and the whole statistical approach permits to allow for other "unpredictable", "uncontrollable" factors that may affect demand in each quarter. The estimate $\hat b$ will be the estimated average price elasticity of demand, "cleansed" from any inertia effects and other "random" factors. $2$) Yes you should use as your time period the whole quarter. Hopefully you have data for many quarters.
