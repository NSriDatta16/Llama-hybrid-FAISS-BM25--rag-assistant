The answer to this question is similar to the answers for Retrieving anchor link in URL for ASP.NET . Basically, according to the standard at RFC 1808 - Relative Uniform Resource Locators (see Section 2.4.1), it says: "Note that the fragment identifier is not considered part of the URL." As stephbu pointed out , "the anchor tag is never sent as part of the HTTP request by any browser. It is only interpreted locally within the browser".
