Sometimes it's the case that "good is good enough" and you don't need to have globally optimal results; an imperfect solution can be better than no solution at all. It sounds like the practitioners who are using this method are, explicitly or implicitly, making the judgement call that they'd prefer to have this model rather than no model at all. If it's possible to obtain a better solution with repeated optimization runs, the only conceptual impediment to leveraging that phenomenon is whether or not you risk overfitting, which is often hedged against by use of regularization or cross-validation .
