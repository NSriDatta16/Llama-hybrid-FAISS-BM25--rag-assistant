This question is really broad and could be refined (e.g. what level of system?) if you desire a better answer. The approaches below have worked in my experience and were adopted broadly within a company. This may not work for your organization, but our is very application/data integration oriented and these methods help us track integration at high/flow/data entity levels. The key to success is not the ideal model, but a practical one with good training and examples/cheat sheets. One UML model view that seems to work will for system integration at the component/interface level is a component diagram with components and then interface realizations and interface usages drawn out. Also using the concept of information flow either UML or just lines with a definition. Then just pick your level of abstraction. Example: PeopleSoft --- (Person Details via File) -----> Active Directory --- (Groups via LDAP) ----> Training Tool. BPMN is for business process really and though I really think it is great this is not where it should be used.
