Why is ergodicity not a requirement for ARIMA models besides stationarity?

I frequently read that ARIMA models must be fitted on stationary data. But stationarity does not ensure ergodicity, which I understand is necessary to deduce population parameters from a single time series sample. Why is ergodicity not a requirement for ARIMA modeling? Do we just assume it? Also, is there an example of a ergodic, but non-stationary process? Can you forecast these types of series?
