This is a basic property of convolutional networks. First layers identify simple features and as you go deeper in the CNN each layer uses the features of the previous layer to build more complex ones. I would say the state-of-the-art article about this is Visualizing and understanding Convolutional Networks by Matthew D. Zeiler and Rob Fergus . You can download it here
