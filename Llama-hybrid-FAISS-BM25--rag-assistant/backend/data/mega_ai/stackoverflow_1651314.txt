Google Maps API V3 "Overview" option

Google Maps API V3 doesn't support the V2 GOverviewMapControl option, yet. I've come across a piece of code at http://dl.google.com/io/2009/pres/Th_1045_Maps_API_Mobile.pdf , silde 19, that gives the code to display the smaller map, but not the draggable, semi-transparent blue box that you generally see here. It's possible, but unofrtunately the code is 'ellided'. Anyone have any ideas how to generate this? Thanks
