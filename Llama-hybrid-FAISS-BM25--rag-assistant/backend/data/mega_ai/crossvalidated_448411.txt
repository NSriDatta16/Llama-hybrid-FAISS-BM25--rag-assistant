No, it is not just transforming the outcome variable and performing linear regression. There is a difference between using a link function, and transforming the outcome. For example, using a log link, you are estimating $\log( E(Y|X) )$ , but if you log transform the outcome variable and use linear regression, you are estimating $E( \log(Y) | X )$ , which is totally different (see Jensen's inequality, for example). To fit a logistic regression model you perform maximum likelihood. The data is assumed to follow a Bernoulli distribution, conditional on the covariates. The success probability is equal to the inverse logit of $X \beta$ , i.e., $1/(1+\exp(-X \beta))$ , and you can form the likelihood out of that. Optimize that as a function of $\beta$ and you have the MLE, which is what you get when you get when you fit a logistic regression model.
