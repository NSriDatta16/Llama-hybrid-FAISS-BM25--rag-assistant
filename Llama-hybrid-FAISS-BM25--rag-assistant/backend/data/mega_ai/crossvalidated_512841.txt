There's a difference between not looking and therefore not seeing any X, and looking and not seeing any X. The latter is 'evidence', the former is not. So the hypothesis under test is "There is a unicorn in that field behind the hill." Alice stays where she is and doesn't look. If there is a unicorn in the field, Alice sees no unicorns. If there is no unicorn in the field, Alice sees no unicorns. P(sees no unicorn | is unicorn) = P(sees no unicorn | no unicorn) = 1. When the hypothesis makes no difference to the observation, the 'evidence' contributed by the observation to belief in the hypothesis is zero. Bob climbs to the top of the hill and looks down on the field, and sees no unicorn. If there is a unicorn in the field, Bob would see it. If there is no unicorn in the field, Bob would see no unicorn. P(sees no unicorn | is unicorn) $\neq$ P(sees no unicorn | no unicorn). When the hypothesis being true or false changes the probability of the observation, evidence is contributed. Looking and seeing no unicorns in the field is positive evidence that there are no unicorns in the field. We can quantify evidence using Bayesian probability. $$P(H_1|O)={P(O|H_1)P(H_1)\over P(O)}$$ $$P(H_2|O)={P(O|H_2)P(H_2)\over P(O)}$$ where $H_1$ is "there is no unicorn in that field". $H_2$ is "there is a unicorn in that field", and $O$ is "I see no unicorn". Divide one by the other: $${P(H_1|O)\over P(H_2|O)}={P(O|H_1)\over P(O|H_2)}{P(H_1)\over P(H_2)}$$ Take logarithms to make the multiplication additive: $$\mathrm{log}{P(H_1|O)\over P(H_2|O)}=\mathrm{log}{P(O|H_1)\over P(O|H_2)}+\mathrm{log}{P(H_1)\over P(H_2)}$$ We interpret this as saying that the Bayesian belief in favour of $H_1$ over $H_2$ after the observation is equal to the evidence in favour of $H_1$ over $H_2$ arising from the observation plus the Bayesian belief in favour of $H_1$ over $H_2$ before the observation. The additive evidence arising from the experiment is quantified as: $$\mathrm{log}{P(O|H_1)\over P(O|H_2)}$$ Alice, by not looking, has no evidence. $\mathrm{log}(1/1)=0$ . Bob, by looking and not seeing, does. $\mathrm{log}(1/0)=\infty$ , meaning absolute certainty. (Of course, if there is a 10% possibility that there is an invisible unicorn in the field, Bob's evidence is $\mathrm{log}(1/0.1)=1$ , if we use base 10 logs. This expresses information using a unit called the hartley .) Rees' dictum is based on people claiming things like that there are no unicorns in the universe based on having looked at only a tiny portion of it and having seen none. Strictly speaking, there is non-zero evidence arising from this, but it's near zero, being related to the log of the volume of space and time searched divided by the volume of the universe. Regarding the issue of null hypothesis experiments, the issue here is that often we are not able to quantify the probability of the observation given an open alternative hypothesis. What is the probability of seeing the reaction if our current understanding is wrong and some unknown physical theory is true? So we set $H_2$ to be a null hypothesis we intend to falsify, such that the probability of the observation given the null is very low. And we presume $H_1$ is restricted to unknown alternative theories in which the observation is reasonably probable. $$\mathrm{log}{P(H_{alt}|O)\over P(H_{null}|O)}=\mathrm{log}{P(H_{alt}|O)\over 0.05}=\mathrm{log}(20\times P(H_{alt}|O))\approx \mathrm{log}20$$ It requires some judicious assumptions about the existence of plausible alternatives, but from a Bayesian point of view doesn't look any different to any other sort of evidence.
