Have you tried subtracting the average score of each respondent in all of that respondent's answers? This would give you the "within variation" for every respondent, akin to the technique used in the fixed-effect estimator in multivariate regression. EDIT: What you really have to think long and hard about is the question you want to answer with your analysis. For instance, Nick Cox's transformation in the comment to this post will lead to clustering people according to how strongly they express their opinion on some matter (in a way, the absolute interest they have in the subject regardless of which "side" they are on) whereas mine will lead to clustering according to the side they take.
