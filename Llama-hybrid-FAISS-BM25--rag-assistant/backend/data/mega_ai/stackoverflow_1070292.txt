You can have multiple jar resources in a JNLP. A JNLP file can also use extension JNLP files. The Main-Class entry in the manifest is for use with java -jar and ignored by WebStart. Oracle ships a number of types of database driver. You probably want the pure Java one. You will also need to arrange for the application to be served from the same machine as the database (or at least appear to be). For larger projects an application tier is often used (probably a bit too eagerly, because it makes for a more complicated project).
