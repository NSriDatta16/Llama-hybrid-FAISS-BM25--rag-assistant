Expected loss function for regression: a Bayesian perspective

I am reading Bishop's PRML. Section 1.5.5 is about the expected loss function $L$ for regression, which is defined as: $E [L] = \int \int L( y(x),t ) \ p(x, t) \ dx dt $ where $x$ is the input and $t$ is the target. I don't understand this formulation. What is the intuition of the double integral over $x$ and $t$ and the expectation of a multivariate function over a continuous domain?
