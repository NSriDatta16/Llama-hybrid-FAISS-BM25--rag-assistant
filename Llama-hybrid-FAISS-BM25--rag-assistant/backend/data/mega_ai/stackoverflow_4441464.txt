How to get the homescreen behaviour of drag to bin, in my own application?

On the Android homescreen it's possible to delete the items by dragging them to the bin. I would like to have similar functionality in my own application, where I have a view with custom view items that I want to be user drag-and-droppable. Is there a easy way to implement this functionality? Or could somebody give me pointers that can guide me on the possibly difficult way to achieving this?
