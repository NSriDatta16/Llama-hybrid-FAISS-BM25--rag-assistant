interactions for paired and unpaired proportions

I would like to compare the effect of a treatment between two groups. My dataset is summarized in this table: Each score corresponds to a proportion (namely, the proportion of successes on a given cognitive test). How would you compare the difference of treatment effects between Group 1 and Group 2, taking into account the within-subject variability? Would you use a logistic regression? Thanks a lot
