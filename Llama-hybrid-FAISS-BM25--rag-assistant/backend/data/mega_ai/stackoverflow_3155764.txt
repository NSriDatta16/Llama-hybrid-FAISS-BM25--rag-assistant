I don't agree with others that it's not possible to debug XAML, but it's true that there are no powerful tools available for this. As Mark says in this post - http://markegilbert.wordpress.com/2008/03/15/debugging-xaml/ So, the simple answer is yes, you can debug problems with XAML. The longer, more qualified answer is that while it’s possible, the support isn’t terribly robust yet but should improve with newer dev environments (Visual Studio, Expression Blend, etc.).
