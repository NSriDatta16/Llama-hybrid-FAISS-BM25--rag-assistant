Chi's answer seems most promising for real use. I just want to add that, according to Joel Spolsky, Internet Explorer used a frequency-based guessing algorithm in its day: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html Roughly speaking, all the assumed-to-be-text is copied, and parsed in every encoding imaginable. Whichever parse fits a language's average word (and letter?) frequency profile best, wins. I can not quickly see if jchardet uses the same kind of approach, so I thought I'd mention this just in case.
