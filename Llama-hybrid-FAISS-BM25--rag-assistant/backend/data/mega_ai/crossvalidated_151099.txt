The statement in the exam question seems contentious. Take a simple example, like plotting life expectancy of a baby versus various factors including average daily salt consumption. The baby will (on average) die early if the salt consumption is near zero, will thrive it the salt consumption is intermediate, and will die immediately if it's very large. PCA is likely to obscure this crucial information. Usually, if a phenomenon cannot be explained using only a few factors, then it will be inaccessible to the human mind, and too complex to publish. Then we wait until someone in the future thinks of a way to explain the phenomenon simply, perhaps using completely different variables. With real data, it's certainly true that one usually finds that PCA gives rise to a coordinate change, indicating certain directions as being more significant. If these indications cannot be backed up with specifically designed experiments or with existing theory or with previous results, then the research may be discontinued. The overall result may be a bias in the assumptions made by examiners as to the nature of the scientific enterprise.
