Naive Bayes, LDA and QDA, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Nearest Neighbors etc can be used. Hashing can be used to handle endless inputs. I am not good at C, but you can use hashing to include new user in one of the existing user. This will induce Exploit-Explore dilemma.( Thompson sampling and multi-arm bandit for your further study). This way you can have online/real time learning/prediction. Another classification in batch data is to be performed so that new variables can have exact separate class. So solution can be a combination of online+Batch learning for your problem.
