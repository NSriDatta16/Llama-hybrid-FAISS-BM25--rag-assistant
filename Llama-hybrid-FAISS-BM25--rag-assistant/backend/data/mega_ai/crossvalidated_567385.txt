The exact answer can be given by the Lambert $W$ function as follows: $$k=-\frac{\hat{R}\ln(\hat{p}_0)}{\ln(\hat{p}_0)-\hat{R}\,W\!\left(\frac{\hat{p}_0^{1/{\hat{R}}}\,\ln(\hat{p}_0)}{\hat{R}}\right)},$$ where $W$ is the Lambert $W$ function, which is the inverse of the function $f(x)=x\,e^{x}.$ In R, you can install the lamW package, which gives access to the lambertWm1 function (a better branch of the $W$ function to use; see Henry's comment), and then code up the equation above as follows: install.packages('lamW') require(lamW) k = - R * log(p) / (log(p) - R * lambertWm1(p^(1/R) * log(p) / R)) As mentioned in the comments, this does require $p>0$ to satisfy the domain requirements of the logarithm function.
