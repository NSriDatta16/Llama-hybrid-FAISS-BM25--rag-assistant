Test results and code coverage status on LCD Screen

HI, We are a small TDD team. We have a LCD screen mounted on the wall which we would like to have display the status of our builds together with current code coverage. Are there any tools that will provide this out ot the box? If not is this pretty straight forward to develop on our own? We are using TFS 2008. Cheers!
