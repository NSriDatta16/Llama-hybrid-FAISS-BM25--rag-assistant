See Does an unbalanced sample matter when doing logistic regression? where most is answered. Unbalance in itself is not a problem, but only 42 'true' with 4 predictors is on borderline. The wikipedia quote seems somewhat imprecise, but not wrong. This posts give more information. The 'rule-of-10' you refers can be criticized, see Minimum number of observations for logistic regression? and also Sample size for logistic regression? , especially F Harrell's answers, where references are given. But, if you want to try anyhow (who wouldn't), note that the usual asymptotic distributions used for logistic regression (leading to Wald tests ...) are usually bad for logistic regression, so the standard errors cannot be trusted. Search this site for Hauck-Donner phenomenon: Logistic regression in R resulted in perfect separation (Hauck-Donner phenomenon). Now what? . A possible remedy is to calculate confidence intervals for parameters via likelihood profiling, see Binomial GLM - non-significant difference between 100% opposite groups of observations for an example.
