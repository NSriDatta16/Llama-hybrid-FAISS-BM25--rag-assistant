It depends on what you mean by "drop to zero relatively quickly". For a stationary AR(1), $y_t = \rho y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$, $|\rho| 1$, so it drop to zero very quickly. Ljung-Box is not used for testing stationarity. Rather, it is used to test for the presence of serial correlation. For example, an AR(1) is stationary, but the Ljung-Box test will reject the null hypothesis due to the presence of serial correlation in the AR(1). If you apply the test to a non stationary time series you will also reject the null, but you can't conclude that the series is non-stationary just because the Ljung-Box test was significant. Just a side note, an iid time series is still stationary (trivially), so just saying "if the series is stationary I'll reject the null hypothesis" is not correct.
