I encountered the same bug on a 4.0.1 iPhone 3GS - an app that worked fine the day before started failing on startup, and then presenting a black screen. Running the app from Xcode was causing gdb to crash with "putpkt: write failed" message. I also could not use the organizer to remove the relevant provisioning profiles, and Apple has apparently removed Settings->General->Profiles in iOS4. Rebooting the phone, removing the app, and removing the provisioning profiles in Xcode organizer fixed this bug for me. Springboard errors from the console log: activate: deactivate: eventOnly underLock : (ipc/send) invalid destination port activate: deactivate: animate : (ipc/send) invalid destination port
