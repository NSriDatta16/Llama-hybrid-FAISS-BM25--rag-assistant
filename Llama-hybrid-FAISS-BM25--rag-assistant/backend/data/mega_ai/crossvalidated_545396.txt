Can statistics be used to answer the following question?

Suppose I am an inactive person - I go for a walk on average a few times a .month (e.g. every day there is a 5% chance I go for a walk, independent of yesterday) . However, each time I go for a walk, I meet this man with a red hat. Can statistics be used to infer that this man walks more often than I do? Or perhaps his walks are also decided by a random process? Knowing that I go on such few walks but still see this man each time, it seens more likely that he walks more often than me? Suppose I go for walks every Sunday and still see this man. Is it more logical for me to believe that this man might have a busy schedule (a schedule similar to mine, e.g. we both work 6 days a week) and simply prefers to only walk on Sundays? (I.e. the other days of the week he doesn't walk) Thanks
