SurfaceListBox doesn't support this because it needs to treat moving fingers as scrolling. If you don't need the ability to scroll, you can ditch SurfaceListBox and instead use a StackPanel filled with SurfaceToggleButton elements. On those toggle buttons, set ClickMode=Hover so that they will toggle just by moving your finger over them. -Robert (former PM for the Surface controls)
