Any example usage of @Target({}) for java.lang.annotation.Target?

http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Target.html This meta-annotation indicates that the declared type is intended solely for use as a member type in complex annotation type declarations. It cannot be used to annotate anything directly: @Target({}) public @interface MemberType { ... } What does this mean? Any example code using this? NB: I'm referring the the empty args use of @Target, as documented in the JavaDoc, and not to the well-documented use of Target with enum constants.
