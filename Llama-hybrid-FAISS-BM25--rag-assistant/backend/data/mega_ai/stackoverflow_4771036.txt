magento escape string for javascript

Is there a helper function that will properly escape a string to be rendered as a single quote quoted JavaScript string literal? I know of jsQuoteEscape but it only handles quotes and does not treat \n & \r etc. so if my string is 'line1\nlineb' (i.e. two lines with a newline between them) and I use var jsvar=' helper('myextension')->jsQuoteEscape($mystring); ?>'; I will get in the rendered content var jsvar='line1 line2'; which is a syntax error. Thanks, Eyal
