How large should the hidden layer of a neural network be?

I have done some searching on the topic and I know the answer is mainly "it depends". BUT, I haven't found anything stating general relationships regarding size of data and number of hidden layers. For example, I'm working with 45-dimensional data, is there any "rule of thumb" regarding a ballpark estimate of hidden layers that may work best?
