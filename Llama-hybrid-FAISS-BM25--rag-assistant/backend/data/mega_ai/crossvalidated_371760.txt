Comparing impact of one variable on another SAS

I have two variables as below. I want to compare if AverageDrive has any impact on the totalStrokes. I have tried running PROC CORR, but wanted to understand if there is any other test that I can run in SAS which would help me understand the dependency between these two variables?
