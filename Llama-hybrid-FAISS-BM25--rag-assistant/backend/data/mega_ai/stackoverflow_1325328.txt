As long as you are within a process simply passing a void* pointer and some care on object lifetime are enough. If is SendMessage you can pass it in LPARAM as a void* cast, and the client uncast it back to your string type. Because SendMessage is synchronous , you are safe: If the specified window was created by the calling thread, the window procedure is called immediately as a subroutine. If the specified window was created by a different thread, the system switches to that thread and calls the appropriate window procedure. Messages sent between threads are processed only when the receiving thread executes message retrieval code. The sending thread is blocked until the receiving thread processes the message If you want to use PostMessage then you'll have to do an explicit hand off because the call is asynchronous: make a copy of the string on the heap and by calling the PostMessage you have passed the delete responsability to the calee (the dialog). If you go out of process (MyhWnd belongs to a different process) then is a whole different story and you'll have to marshal your message into something like a global atom.
