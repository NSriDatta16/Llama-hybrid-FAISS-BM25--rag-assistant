RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^([^/]+)/?$ index.php?clip=$1 i wouldn't suggest this technique because it will cause an extra disk read to check if the file is there... if you have the possibility i would advise to organize your directory structure in a way that apache can tell from the directory what to do. example from my framework: # skip whitelisted directories RewriteRule ^(test|skin|stylesheets|images|javascripts|favicon|robots\.txt|index\.php) - [L] RewriteRule ([-_\w\/]*) index.php?p=$1 [NE,NC,QSA]
