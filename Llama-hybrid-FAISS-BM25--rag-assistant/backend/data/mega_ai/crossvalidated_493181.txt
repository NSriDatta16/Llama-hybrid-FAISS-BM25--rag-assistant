How to interpret this loadings statement in PCA given the example in R?

I am reading in the fabulous book of "Exploratory Multivariate Analysis by Example Using R" 2nd edition by Husson, however when I came across this sentence about PCA loadings and their calculation I couldn't get its math or how to prove it in R code: Loadings are interpreted as the coefficients of the linear combination of the initial variables from which the principal components are constructed. From a numerical point of view, the loadings are equal to the coordinates of the variables divided by the square root of the eigenvalue associated with the component. How can loadings be calculated given the above statement in this R example from the variables divided by the square root of the eigenvalue of the principal component? I know that each principal component is a linear combination of the variables and loadings are the coefficients of these linear combinations. Example A So the A matrix has 32 rows and 9 columns (variables), so what is meant by variable coordinates and what does this statement really mean? Update: using FactoMineR package When I use the FactoMineR package which the above book deals with, I even get more confused as the meaning of the statement in question, see the code below: library(FactoMineR) res.pca $var$ coord) # here store are the coordinates of the variables R> head(res.pca $var$ coord) Dim.1 Dim.2 Dim.3 Dim.4 Dim.5 Dim.6 Dim.7 Dim.8 Dim.9 mpg -0.935 0.0397 -0.1571 -0.00315 0.1373 0.25338 0.1236 -0.0302 0.01712 cyl 0.957 0.0227 -0.1792 0.02095 -0.0501 0.07893 0.0515 0.1960 0.02423 disp 0.945 -0.1283 -0.0556 0.17477 0.2083 -0.00692 0.0591 -0.0155 -0.09860 hp 0.873 0.3888 -0.0122 0.03516 0.1261 0.12453 -0.2257 -0.0401 0.03751 drat -0.742 0.4930 0.1065 0.43535 -0.0693 -0.00541 -0.0155 0.0327 0.00567 wt 0.888 -0.2481 0.3222 0.09846 0.0802 -0.02947 0.1387 -0.0480 0.08479 # actually these are the loadings (V . Sigma) as proof to that: res.pca $svd$ V %*% diag(res.pca $svd$ vs) == res.pca $var$ coord # TRUE So how can we compute loadings according to the statement in question of FactoMineR book and package from the variable coordinates when the coordinates themselves are actually the loadings matrix as we know it ( $V \cdot \Sigma$ )? Accordingly, my guess is that this statement could read like the following: Loadings are interpreted as the coefficients of the linear combination of the initial variables from which the principal components are constructed. From a numerical point of view, the loadings are equal to the coordinates of the variables divided which are the eigenvectors scaled up by the square root of the eigenvalue associated with the component.
