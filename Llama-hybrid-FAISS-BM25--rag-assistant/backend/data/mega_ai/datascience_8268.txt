Establishing data science programs as an independent discipline

What are the benefits of establishing data science programs as an independent discipline rather than creating data scientists in different fields? (for students, universities and the society as a whole) I am authoring a book on data science and I have mentioned some university programs as models for establishing data science programs in bachelor's, master's and doctorate level. I am thinking of some reasons to compare this model with enriching well-established programs and adding data science skills.
