Emacs cloud storage options?

What options are there for saving and retrieving documents to and from the cloud, from within Emacs? I use Emacs at work, on a Windows machine, and at home, on a Linux box, so ideally I would want a solution that works more or less out of the box for both operating systems. I touched on g-client, but could not quite get it to work. Obviously, if there are no other, simpler options, I'm just going to have to spend a couple of more hours on it. Many thanks, Andreas
