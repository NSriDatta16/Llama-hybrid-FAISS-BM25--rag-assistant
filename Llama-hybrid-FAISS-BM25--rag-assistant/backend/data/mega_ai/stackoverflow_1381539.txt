DragNDrop from Java to Windows Explorer

I want to create an application in Java that lists a directory and add drag and drop support to it for copying files from that directory to the explorer window opened and vice-versa(Windows system). While adding support to drag and drop from windows explorer to the java application is quite easy, it kind of eludes me how to do it when the action starts from the java application and ends in explorer. I tried searching google and SO, but to no avail. Any pointers, directions, snippets of codes or pseudocodes will be appreciated. So, is it possible to drag from a java application and transfer data to a drop target in a native application? If yes (it should be), can you point me in the right direction?
