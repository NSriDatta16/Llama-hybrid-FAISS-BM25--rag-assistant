Feature selection for time series data

I am looking for methods for feature selection (or feature extraction) for time series data. Of course I did some research before, but it was not satisfying. I am aware of methods like PCA, importance matrix from random forest, linear regression, etc. for feature selection or extraction, but are those methods also applicable to time series data? The task would be to find a set of variables which is a good predictor of a certain time series variable. Thanks for any suggestions!
