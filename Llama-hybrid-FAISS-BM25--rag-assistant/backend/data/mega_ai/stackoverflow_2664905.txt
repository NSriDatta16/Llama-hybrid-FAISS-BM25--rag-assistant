DoDragDrop disables MouseMove Events

After having started a Drag & Drop operation by DragDrop.DoDragDrop(...) no more MouseMove Events are fired. I even tried AddHandler(Window.MouseMoveEvent, new MouseEventHandler(myControl_MouseMove), true); where the last parameter means I even opt in for handled events. No chance, seems like the MouseMove Event is never fired at all! Any way to still get MouseMove Events while using Drag & Drop? I'd like to Drag & Drop a control, while dragging this control it shall follow the mouse pointer. Any idea how to do this in this case?
