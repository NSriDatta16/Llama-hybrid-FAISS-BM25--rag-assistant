If you want to use machine learning instead of outlier detection methods, then you are on the right track. How can I represent a peak? What kind of features can I use? I am thinking of using my current thresholds as features (frequency,growth ratio,decay ratio) but I am not sure if this is appropriate. Yes. Frequency, growth ratio, decay ratio are good features. Of course, it remains to be seen how well they perform in your dataset. You could also consider the following features that are routinely used in this kind of problems: Mean Median Standard deviation Power spectrum Magnitude Kurtosis Percentil Principal frequency Magnitude of first five components of FFT Skewness Entropy Mean absolute difference Autoregressive coefficients Wavelet coefficients Crest factor Now, you have to think carefully about which features are likely to provide good separation between event A and B. For example, I don't think entropy or autoregressive coefficients are going to give much of a separation, but kurtosis, standard deviation and crest factor look more promising. I am thinking of using these features to train a logistic regression classifier or a neural network. Is this straitforward? Sure. You may want to try decision trees or even kNN. I have found good results with decision trees. If all else fails, I suggest looking at SAX, Symbolic Polynomials or Shapelets .
