As far as I know, libpcap allows you to read copies of incoming and outgoing packets, and some implementations allow you to inject a raw packet, but not rewrite a packet. You would basically have to drop the original packet (something libpcap cannot do) and then inject a new one in it's place. Firewall apps that allow you to filter incoming and outgoing packets might be able to do something like this. However, since you're talking about Perl and Win32 your options are probably limited.
