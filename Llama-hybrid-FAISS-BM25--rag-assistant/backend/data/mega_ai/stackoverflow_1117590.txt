Preventing multiple daily votes in a contest

Voting contests seem to gain a lot of attention from people who want to game a system for fun. I know I spend a good amount of time fooling around with their forms and URLs, deleting cookies and writing the occasional crappy script. Is there a way to create a foolproof voting system that only allows one vote a day? Is Captcha the only effective way of deterring automated voting? How have you gone about solving this problem? Some of my thoughts on solutions are to track IPs or require an email, but even these seem like they're easily circumvented.
