Load External Class from content in another sandbox

The problem is: I have (for example) font embeder class, and I want to load external SWF not from application storage folder, but another local path ( "D:\blah-blah\123.swf") in AIR, but as you understand I can't find any decision on the Internet (Google, Adode.com) Security.allowDomain() not working in AIR ( documented on adobe.com) Trick with ApplicationDomain is not working ( same documented on adobe.com) The all I want, is to get CLASS REFERENCE from loaded content and use in load initiator. Does anybody knows how to solve this problem? listing code for getting acquaint: _ _ [main AIR-app code sheet] // function and one param (path to content) function tralala( _swfPath : String) { var l : Loader = new Loader(); l.contentLoaderInfo. addEventListener( Event.COMPLETE, function( _e : Event) { var tmp = _e.target.content; // call function from SWF and retrieving // classes, but can't work with them Font.registerFont( tmp._getRef()[0]); // no error checking for clarity } ); l.load( new URLRequest( _swfPath)); } _ _ [external SWF code] function _getRef() : Array { // class1,2,3 are font classes imported in library return [ class1, class2, class3]; }
