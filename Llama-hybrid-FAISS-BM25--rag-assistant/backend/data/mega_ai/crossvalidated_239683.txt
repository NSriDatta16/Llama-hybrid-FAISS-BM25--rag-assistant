If I understand correctly, the "theoretical" name for your empirical distributions is actually multinomial . Now it is unlikely that your counts for condition 1 are an exact weighted average (convex combination) of your sample counts for conditions 2 and 3. However your problem is to estimate the likelihood that there is a consistent set of underlying multinomial probabilities, consistent with your sample proportions , where condition 1 is an exact mixture of conditions 2 and 3. The maximum likelihood estimates of your probabilities are the sample proportions, but these have some uncertainty, due to the finite sample size*. You could perhaps proceed using uncertainty estimates such as discussed here (which recommends this paper ). (*There may also be uncertainty in whether or not the "multinomial trials", i.e. participant responses, can be treated as i.i.d. variables as well.)
