In union, members will be share the same memory. so that we can get the float value as integer value. Floating number format will be different from integer storage. so that we can understand the difference using the union. For Ex: If I store the 12 integer value in ( 32 bits ). we can get this 12 value as floating point format. It will stored as signed(1 bit), exponent(8 bits) and significant precision(23 bits).
