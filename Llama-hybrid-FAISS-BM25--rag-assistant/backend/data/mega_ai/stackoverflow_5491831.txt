Tell Fragment which XML to Inflate

I start with a home fragment that opens either a listFragment(Al) or I can choose a normal Fragment(Jim). If my new Fragment(Bob) is called from the listFragment(Al), I want Fragment(Bob) to call XML A. If Fragment(Bob) is called from Fragment(Jim) I want Fragment(Bob) to inflate XML B. How do I pass a value from listFragment(Al) and Fragment(Jim) that can be checked in the onCreateView of Fragment(Bob) so that Fragment(Bob) knows which XML to inflate? Hope that all makes sense. Thanks.
