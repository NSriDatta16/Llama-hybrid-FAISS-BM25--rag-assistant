Do I need to encode the target variable for sklearn logistic regression

I'm trying to get familiar with the sklearn library, and now I'm trying to implement logistic regression for a dataframe containing numerical and categorical values to predict a binary target variable. While reading some documentation I found the logistic regression should be used to predict binary variables presented by 0 and 1. My target variable is "YES" and "NO", should I code it to 0 and 1 for the algorithm to work properly, or there is no difference? Maybe I just didn't get the idea but can someone confirm this to me.
