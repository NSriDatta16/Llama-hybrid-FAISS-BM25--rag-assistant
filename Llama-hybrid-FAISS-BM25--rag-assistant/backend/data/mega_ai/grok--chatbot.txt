Grok is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by xAI. It was launched in November 2023 by Elon Musk as an initiative based on the large language model (LLM) of the same name. Grok has apps for iOS and Android and is integrated with the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Tesla vehicles, and Tesla's Optimus robot. The chatbot is named after the verb grok, coined by American author Robert A. Heinlein in his 1961 science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land to describe a deeper than human form of understanding. The bot has generated various controversial responses, including conspiracy theories, antisemitism, and praise of Adolf Hitler, as well as referring to Musk's views when asked about controversial topics or difficult decisions. Updates since 2023 have shifted the bot politically rightward to provide conservative responses to user queries. Background OpenAI Musk was one of the 11 co-founders of OpenAI, and initially co-chaired it with Sam Altman. He left the company's board in 2018, saying of his decision that he "didn't agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do". OpenAI went on to launch ChatGPT in 2022, and GPT-4 in March 2023. The same month, Musk was one of the individuals to sign the "Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter" from the Future of Life Institute, which called for a six-month pause in the development of any AI software more powerful than GPT-4. TruthGPT In April 2023, Musk said in an interview on Tucker Carlson Tonight that he intended to develop an AI chatbot called "TruthGPT", which he described as "a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe". He expressed concern to Carlson that ChatGPT was being "trained to be politically correct". Grok TruthGPT would later be renamed after grok, a verb coined by American author Robert A. Heinlein in his 1961 science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land to describe a form of understanding. History Grok-1 In November 2023, xAI began previewing Grok as a chatbot to select users, with participation in the early access program being limited to paid X Premium users. It was announced that once the bot was out of early beta, it would only be available to higher tier X Premium+ subscribers. At the time of the preview, xAI described the chatbot as "a very early beta product â€“ the best we could do with 2 months of training" that could "improve rapidly with each passing week". On March 11, 2024, Musk posted on X that the language model would go open source within a week. Six days later, on March 17, Grok-1 was open sourced under the Apache-2.0 license. Disclosed were the network's architecture and its weight parameters. On March 26, 2024, Musk announced that Grok would be enabled for X Premium subscribers, in addition to those on Premium+. Grok-1.5 On March 29, 2024, Grok-1.5 was announced, with "improved reasoning capabilities" and a context length of 128,000 tokens. Grok-1.5 was released to all X Premium users on May 15, 2024. On April 4, 2024, an update to X's "Explore" page included summaries of breaking news stories written by Grok, a task previously assigned to a human curation team. On April 12, 2024, Grok-1.5 Vision (Grok-1.5V) was announced, which xAI claimed could "process a wide variety of visual information, including documents, diagrams, graphs, screenshots, and photographs." However, Grok-1.5V was never released to the public. On May 4, 2024, Grok became available in the United Kingdom, which was the only European country to support it at the time due to the impending Artificial Intelligence Act rules in the European Union. Grok was later reviewed by the EU and was released on May 16, 2024. Grok-2 On August 14, 2024, Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini were announced, with upgraded performance and reasoning, and image generation capability using Flux by Black Forest Labs. Grok-2 mini was described as a "small but capable sibling" of Grok-2 that "offers a balance between speed and answer quality
