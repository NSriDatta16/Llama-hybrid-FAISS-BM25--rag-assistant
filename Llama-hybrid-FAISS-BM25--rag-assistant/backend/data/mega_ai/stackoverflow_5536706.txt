Any object you pass to must support serialization (and deserialization) I would guess that the way you are defining Game you are not enabling this. I would however recommend serializing (and deserializing) the object yourself though as IsolatdStorage uses the DataContractSerializer internally and this is very slow. If you can serializer the object faster yourself and then pass a simple type to the IsolatedStorageSettings then you should be able to get better performance.
