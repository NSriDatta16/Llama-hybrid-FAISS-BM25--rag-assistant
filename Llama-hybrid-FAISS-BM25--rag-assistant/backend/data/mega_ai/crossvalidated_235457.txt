What type of data analysis should I make in case of (quasi-) experimental data?

In my school, there is a trend of using computer software for teaching a first course in Chemistry for undergraduate students. I hypothesized that the use of this tool could make the students achieve better scores than without this help. So far what I have done is the following: I chose two groups, both of them were going to follow the same topics. Only in one of them the use of the computer software was commendatory. I make an entrance test about basic chemistry knowledge to both groups and approximately 100 percent of both classes failed that examination. I had compiled the results of the mid-term exam and the final exam of both groups and I have seen an increase in the final marks of the group that was using the computerized tool. I have read that this seems like a quasi experiment. I have gathered some information about this techniques, but apart from the basic stuff I am a little bit lost of what statistical techniques should I perform to gather a conclusion that this software tool should be encouraged to be used. I have performed a hypothesis test, but I believe this is not enough. Any advice? My statistics knowledge is very basic.
