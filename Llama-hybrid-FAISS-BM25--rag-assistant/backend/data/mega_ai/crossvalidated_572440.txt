One way to "control for" a second variable (like height) when you are interested in a primary variable (like sex) is to build a model that contains both and test the remaining "significance" of the primary variable. The simplest way to do this with a Cox model is to perform a Wald test on its coefficient. If you insist on a likelihood-based test, you can perform a profile-likelihood test on the coefficient instead. (That's implemented efficiently in SAS; see here for how to do that in R with a Cox model.) That leads to the question about whether "controlling for" height should be done with a simple term or via an interaction with sex . A likelihood-ratio test is easily done to evaluate this, by comparing a model with the interaction against a model with both predictors but without the interaction. If the interaction is significant then there really is no single answer to the question of the association between sex and survival, however. In that case the association of sex with survival depends on the value of height (and vice-versa). You could examine the differences between specific scenarios, for example males versus females at each of their population-average heights.
