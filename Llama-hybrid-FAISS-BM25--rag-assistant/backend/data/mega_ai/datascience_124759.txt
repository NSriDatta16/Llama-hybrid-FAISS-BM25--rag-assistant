Proper way to build time series dataset

I have daily time series but need to predict weekly total. Here is example: date col0 col1 col2 col3 col4 target 0 2023-01-01 00:00:00 -1.021 0.708 -0.564 -0.502 0.244 -106.538 1 2023-01-02 00:00:00 -1.226 -1.464 1.047 1.574 0.224 -42.152 2 2023-01-03 00:00:00 -0.156 1.168 0.338 0.087 0.254 72.307 3 2023-01-04 00:00:00 -0.083 -1.505 0.082 -1.406 0.76 -65.941 4 2023-01-05 00:00:00 1.712 -1.372 1.471 -0.173 -1.614 37.075 5 2023-01-06 00:00:00 -0.897 0.076 0.975 -0.012 -0.677 -65.985 6 2023-01-07 00:00:00 -0.559 0.377 -0.066 -1.523 1.566 44.787 7 2023-01-08 00:00:00 1.629 -1.38 -0.056 0.074 -1.703 -133.008 8 2023-01-09 00:00:00 0.856 0.214 0.173 -0.447 -1.246 0.211 9 2023-01-10 00:00:00 1.073 -0.365 -1.045 0.538 -0.839 -98.987 10 2023-01-11 00:00:00 -0.86 -0.385 -0.577 0.047 1.006 -99.636 11 2023-01-12 00:00:00 -1.713 1.354 1.238 -0.469 -0.115 54.005 12 2023-01-13 00:00:00 1.551 -0.998 -0.214 0.234 0.984 68.9 13 2023-01-14 00:00:00 -0.319 -0.796 0.021 -0.752 1.076 -22.462 14 2023-01-15 00:00:00 -0.592 -0.864 -0.831 -0.487 0.049 -102.358 The basic approaches are sum days predict in week or group and predict weekly. The idea is to extend training data to predict weeks using slide window of 7 days to group data so first row is sum of 2023-01-01 - 2023-01-07 days, second row is sum of 2023-01-02 - 2023-01-08 days etc. This method gives much more samples for training model. I am not sure whether it is theoretically correct due to strong autocorrelation or something else. Moreover, I need to predict strictly Mon-Sun target sum on inference.
