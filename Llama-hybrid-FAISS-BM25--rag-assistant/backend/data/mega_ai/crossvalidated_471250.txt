I would argue that CNNs are not inherently able to handle non-scale-invariant features. Imagine if we have image A of size n x n that only contains a ``corner" feature which looks like a curve. If we scale up the image by 100 times, the new image B will be 100n x 100n and each n x n sub-regions of it will appear to be straight edges instead of corner-like curves. Let's say we have a CNN-based image classifier C for corner features that trains with only kernels smaller than n x n. Now if we feed B into the classifier, it will look at n x n(or smaller) sub-regions in B and will have no chance of outputting positive results.
