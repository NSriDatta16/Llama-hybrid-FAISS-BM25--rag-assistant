You identify search engines by user agent and IP address . More info can be found in How to identify search engine spiders and webbots . It's also worth noting this list . You shouldn't treat user agents (or even remote hosts) as necessarily definitive however. User agents are really nothing more than what the other end tells you it is and it is of course free to tell you anything. It's trivial to write code to pretend to be Googlebot. In PHP, this means looking at $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] and $_SERVER['REMOTE_HOST'] . There are a lot of search engines but honestly it's only the big few you really care about generally speaking. Google and Yahoo together have almost all of the market. But of course it depends on what you're trying to achieve. Note: be very careful of treating search engines differently to normal users (like the "evil hyphen site" as Joel put it) when it comes to content . In particularly egregious cases, this could get your site removed from that search engine. Even if that doesn't happen you will probably put some users off who go to a site expecting something. If they're then presented with a "Please register to see this article" box instead, well, gratz on your high bounce rate.
