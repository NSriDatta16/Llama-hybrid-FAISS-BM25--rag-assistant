MySQL database search

I have a database table with chinese dictionaries (about 300 000 rows) for online dictionary. The data structure looks like this: ID ch_smpl pinyin definition ---------------------------------------- 1 我 wǒ I, me 2 我们 wǒmen we, us etc. I'm not good with php and mysql, so the question is how to setup a search engine? I've found a bunch of tutorials on php mysql search, I also found some full-text search examples, but I'm not sure how it works with chinese characters. The speed of search is really important for me. Any suggestions on how to organize the search engine for this purpose are greatly appreciated.
