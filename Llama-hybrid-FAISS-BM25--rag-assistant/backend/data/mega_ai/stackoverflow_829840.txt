I could be way off, but it sounds like you want an object with a built in method to output as a string. If you start with a string, like the one you mentioned, you could pass the string to the class as a new object, use regular expressions like everyone has already suggested to parse out the chunks that you would then assign as variables to that object. Finally, you could have it output a string based on the variables of that object, for instance: $string = "COHOCOHOCOHOCOHOCOHOC"; $sugar = new Organic($string); Class Organic { $chem; function __construct($chem) { $hydro_find = "OHO"; $carb_find = "C"; $this-> hydro = preg_find ($hydro_find, $chem); $this -> carb = preg_find ($carb_find, $chem); function __TO_STRING() { return $this->carb."="$this->hydro; } } echo $sugar; Okay, that kind of fell apart in the end, and it was pseudo-php, not perl. But if I understand your question correctly, you are looking for a way to get all of the info from the string but keep it tied to that string. That would be objects and classes.
