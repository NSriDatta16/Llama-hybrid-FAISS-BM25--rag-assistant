The "official" approach is to simply delete any out of date tables from the designer then drag the updated table from your Server Navigator back on again. I've been using this method for well over a year now and so long as you make your data context changes at the same time you're updating the database you should be OK. It also gives you extra incentive to make sure you have your database structure in order before continuing.
