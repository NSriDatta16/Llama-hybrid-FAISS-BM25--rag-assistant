What is the importance of probabilistic machine learning?

I am attending a course on "Introduction to Machine Learning" where a large portion of this course to my surprise has a probabilistic approach to machine learning (ML), like a probabilistic approach to linear and logistic regression and trying to find the optimal weights using MLE , MAP or Bayesian methods. But what is its importance? We can do all this using a non-probabilistic approach as well. My instructor only told me that "With a probabilistic view, we got more information about the data", which I understand, that for each point rather than claiming something true or false directly, we are taking into count the probability, which gives us a continuous value and describe to what extent that value is really useful . But apart from this, what are the advantages of probabilistic machine learning, and what can serve as a motivation for such viewpoints?
