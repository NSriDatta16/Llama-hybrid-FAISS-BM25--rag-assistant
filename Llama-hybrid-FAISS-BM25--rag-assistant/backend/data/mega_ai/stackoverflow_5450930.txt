Heroku Postgres Error: PGError: ERROR: relation "organizations" does not exist (ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid)

I'm having a problem deploying my Rails app to Heroku, where this error is thrown when trying to access the app: PGError: ERROR: relation "organizations" does not exist (ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid) SELECT a.attname, format_type(a.atttypid, a.atttypmod), d.adsrc, a.attnotnull FROM pg_attribute a LEFT JOIN pg_attrdef d ON a.attrelid = d.adrelid AND a.attnum = d.adnum WHERE a.attrelid = '"organizations"'::regclass AND a.attnum > 0 AND NOT a.attisdropped ORDER BY a.attnum Anybody have any ideas? This is a first for me, especially because I've been working with Heroku for a year on other apps, and haven't see anything like this. Of course, everything works on local SQLite.
