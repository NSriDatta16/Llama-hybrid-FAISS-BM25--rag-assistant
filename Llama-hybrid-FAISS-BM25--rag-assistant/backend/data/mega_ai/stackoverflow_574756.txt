Best IDE for developing Java Desktop Applications

I've been developing Java Web apps using Eclipse as the IDE. Planning to start developing a desktop app based on Java. Can someone suggest the best IDE for developing Java based desktop apps? (One that would have drag drop for building the interface like Visual Studio)
