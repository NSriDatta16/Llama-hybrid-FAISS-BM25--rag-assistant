Your "other task" seems to be just a Markov chain problem. If you are interested in combinations of two words, you just need to read through your text a word at a time, creating a dictionary (hash, table, whatever) where the key is the current and previous word, and the value is the count. So for input text "home is where the home is", you get nil, home: 1 (ignore this) home, is: 2 is, where: 1 where, the: 1 the, home: 1
