Hmm, does this link help you at all? My only other suggestion is that often dependency walker is useful in these sorts of situations, in particular if you are running this vb6 application on a 64 bit OS then pay attention to whether or not comdlg32.ocx has all of its dependencies present as 32 bit libraries.
