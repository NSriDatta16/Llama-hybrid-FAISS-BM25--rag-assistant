I would avoid talking about bubble sort because, while it works, it's not very theoretically elegant. Moreover, it's never used anywhere in practice. There are a whole bunch of algorithms that rely on selection sort (in-place merges, for example) or insertion sort (like the crazy fast introsort), so those might be good ones to start off with. I personally like insertion sort the most because from an instructional standpoint it's a gold mine. It's O(n^2) in the worst-case, O(n) in the best case, and so gives a good testbed for talking about worst-case/best-case analysis. It's an in-place sort, so you can use it to talk about in-situ versus non-in-situ sorting, and you can generalize it to heapsort by talking about the fundamental ideas it embodies.
