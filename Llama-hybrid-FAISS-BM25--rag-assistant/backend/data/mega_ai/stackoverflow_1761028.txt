problem with json and eval

I can't seem to find any solution to this within SO so here goes. I have a call to a WebMethod within the C# of my page like this; $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "MyWebPage.aspx/jQueryMyWebMethod", data: "{FamilyType:'" + $('.HdnFamilyType').val() + "'}", contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", dataType: "json", success: function(msg) { var obj = eval('(' + msg + ')'); } }); In the code behind I create an object, serialise it and return it like this; LHCRequiredFormViewModel fvm = new LHCRequiredFormViewModel(); DataContractJsonSerializer ser = new DataContractJsonSerializer(typeof(LHCRequiredFormViewModel)); MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream( ); ser.WriteObject(ms, fvm); return Encoding.Default.GetString(ms.ToArray()); However, in the Javascript when I do the eval I get the error; Expected ']'; At the point of returning the serialised object from C# the data looks like; "{\" k__BackingField\":true,\" k__BackingField\":false}" string I should mention that the project was .Net 2.0 and I was simply returning a serialised object w/out all the JSON guff and it worked fine. So I then converted to 3.5 and the problem began. It's then that I used the JsonSerializer but am still getting exactly the same error. Anyone know what's going on and how to fix it?
