In long run,Proportion of time in each state?

Consider a homogeneous Markov Chain with transition probability matrix P= Row 1=[0.5 0.4 0.1] Row 2=[0.3 0.4 0.3] Row 3=[0.2 0.3 0.5] In the long run what is the proportion of time is process in each of the three states. Also find closed sets in homogeneous markov chain having state space S={1,2,...,M} and determine nature of each state.
