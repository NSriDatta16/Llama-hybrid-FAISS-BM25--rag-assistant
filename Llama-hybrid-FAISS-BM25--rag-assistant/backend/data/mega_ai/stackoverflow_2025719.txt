How fast can you read the source file if you don't write the destination? Is the source file fragmented? Fragmented reads can be an order of magnitude slower than contiguous reads. You can use the "contig" utility to make it contiguous: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897428.aspx How fast is the network connecting the two machines? Have you tried just writing dummy data, without reading it first, like ATTO does? Do you have more than one read or write request in flight at a time? What's the stripe size of your RAID-5 array? Writing a full stripe at a time is the fastest way to write to RAID-5.
