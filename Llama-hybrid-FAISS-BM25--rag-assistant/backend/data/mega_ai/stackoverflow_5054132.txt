How to change the decimal separator of DecimalFormat from comma to dot/point?

I have this little crazy method that converts BigDecimal values into nice and readable Strings. private String formatBigDecimal(BigDecimal bd){ DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(); df.setMinimumFractionDigits(3); df.setMaximumFractionDigits(3); df.setMinimumIntegerDigits(1); df.setMaximumIntegerDigits(3); df.setGroupingSize(20); return df.format(bd); } It however, also produces a so called grouping separator "," that makes all my values come out like this: xxx,xxx I do need the separator to be a dot or a point and not a comma. Does anybody have a clue of how to accomplish this little feat? I have read this and in particular this to death now but I cannot find a way to get this done. Am I approaching this the wrong way? Is there a much more elegant way of doing this? Maybe even a solution that accounts for different local number representations, since the comma would be perfect by European standards.
