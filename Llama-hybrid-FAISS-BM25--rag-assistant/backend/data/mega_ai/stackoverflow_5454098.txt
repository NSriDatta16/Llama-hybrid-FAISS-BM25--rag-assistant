Calculating and storing precomputed average with Hibernate

Say I have a set of products and each product has a set of reviews. Each review has a score. I will need the average of the scores much more often then I will need the actual reviews. Are there any best practices/clean ways of precomputing the average and storing it with hibernate. I am currently thinking of adding review count and review sum columns to the product table and rigging the add review method to update the count and sum. I would be very glad to hear of a cleaner way of doing this.
