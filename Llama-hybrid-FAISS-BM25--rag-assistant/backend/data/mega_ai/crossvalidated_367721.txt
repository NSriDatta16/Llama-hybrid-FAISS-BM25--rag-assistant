There are plenty of other statistical methods, such as regression and machine learning, that have obvious use cases: regression can provide information on the relationship between two variables, while machine learning is great for prediction. You answer your own question, below: autocorrelation. Time series usually have it, violating an assumption of basic OLS regression. Time series techniques have the appropriate assumptions for time series. Machine learning methods which deal with sequential data are specialized, like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs), so you still have specialized techniques for time series. But meanwhile, I don't see what time series analysis is good for. Sure, I can fit an ARIMA model and use it for prediction, but what good is that when the confidence intervals for that prediction are going to be huge? There's a reason nobody can predict the stock market despite it being the most data-driven industry in world history. Confidence intervals (CIs) resulting from a time series technique will probably be larger than those from a non-time-series regression. This feature is known as being accurate. In general, when you use a non-time-series regression your CI will be smaller but it is incorrect because you've violated its assumptions. If all you want to do is present a graph with small CI's make them up or skip the CI's entirely, but if you want appropriate CIs use appropriate techniques. The stock market is hard to predict because of it's nature. Other time series are much more predictable. Try using your machine learning technique of choice in the stock market and I doubt you'll have more success. Likewise, how do I use it to understand my process further? Sure, I can plot the ACF and go "aha! there's some dependence!", but then what? What's the point? Of course there's dependence, that's why you are doing time series analysis to begin with. You already knew there was dependence. But what are you going to use it for? To predict. To see seasonality. To have an idea about the variability of the data over different seasons. Not to mention that there are more powerful time series techniques than old-school ARIMA, like State Space methods. ARIMA is not the best technique for modeling time series. (In fact, the ARIMA procedure in your statistical software of choice is probably using a State Space representation under the hood.)
