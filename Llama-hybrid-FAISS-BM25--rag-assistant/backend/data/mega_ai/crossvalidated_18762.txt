When is there a representer theorem?

The case of regularization in a hilbert space is considered---an optimization problem with an error term and a Tikhonov-regularizer. In the article "When is there a representer theorem" it is stated on page 2 (2508), and proofs are referred to, that the representer theorem holds when the regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the norm, i.e. square of the hilbert space norm. Are there any other requirements on the problem, for example on the error term?
