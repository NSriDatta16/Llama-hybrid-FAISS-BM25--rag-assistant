Ratios, differences, and link functions?

I recently learned that with Poisson regression, you can model rate difference by using an identity link function, or rate ratio by using a log link function. Does that work the same way with other generalized linear models? For example: If I fit the linear regression equation "height_in_cm = B0 + B1*gender" where gender is 1 for male and 0 for male, B1 would be "How many cm taller are man than women?" If I changed the equation to "log(height_in_cm) = B0 + B1*gender" would the interpretation of B1 then be "Men are exp(B1) times taller than women?" If so, is that a commonly-used way to model something like "Men are __ times taller than women" or is there some other model that would more commonly be used for something like this? If I fit the logistic regression equation "log(P(depression)/(1 - P(depression))) = B0 + B1*poverty" B1 would be an odds ratio - could I model it without the log and make an odds difference? Also: I have seen a few mentions of using square root as a link function - what do your betas mean if you do that? I can follow the math through and say that if sqrt(Y) = B0 + B1*X then B1 is "the amount by which sqrt(Y) increases for each unit change in X" but I can't come up with a broader explanation the way I can with "With an identity link B1 is difference, with a log link exp(B1) is ratio". (Maybe there just isn't one for sqrt?)
