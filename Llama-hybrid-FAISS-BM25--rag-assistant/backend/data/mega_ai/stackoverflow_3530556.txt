The very original C compiler was written (by K&R) in a predecessor language called B, or maybe BCPL. But once the C compiler was working well enough, they converted over to C and began using each successive version to compile the next. Many of the bizarre features of C such as pre- and post-increment operators exist because (a) they represented special addressing modes on the PDP-11 on which the first C was developed, or (b) they helped the compiler fit in memory while compiling its own next version. So that's the rest of the story.
