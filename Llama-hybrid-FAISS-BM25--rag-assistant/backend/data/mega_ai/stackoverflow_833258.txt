std::map unable to handle polymorphism?

When using std::map in c++, is it possible to store inherited classes as their "base class" in the map and still being able to call their overloaded methods? See this example: #include #include class Base { public: virtual void Foo() { std::cout Storage; Storage["rawr"]=Child(); Storage["rawr"].Foo(); return 0; } This following code writes "1". Which somehow tells me that polymorphism doesn't work when you use std::map.
