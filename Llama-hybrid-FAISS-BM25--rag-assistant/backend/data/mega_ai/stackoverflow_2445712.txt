Producing a giant DOM tree in the memory is not the way to go; find a way to feed your XSL Transformer with XML events, like SAX or StAX API. Never use DOM API on XML files that massive (1.1GB sounds scary). If you are using Java 6, take a look at the packages javax.xml.transform.sax and javax.xml.transform.stax for reference what should your solution implement in order for this to work.
