To solve your specific question, you might consider replacing the characters to be the same, and then split on that one. Use datetime.replace(/[ :-]/g, "|") and then split on "|". (I didn't check the correctness of the regexp). What Tyler says is more elegant: datetime.split(/[ -:]/) . I stand for the rest though: What MySQL outputs (via php?) is a standard date notation. You could try and use the Date.parse(dateString) to get a timestamp from it, and convert that into a date object by passing it as the sole constructor parameter: recordedTime = new Date(Date.parse(datetime)); You could then compare the two date objects directly. if (recordedTime.getFullYear() > currentTime.getFullYear()) { ... } Hope it helps.
