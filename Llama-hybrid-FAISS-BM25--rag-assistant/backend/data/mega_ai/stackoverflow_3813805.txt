A non-programmers guide to programming

Okay so I am a very low level programmer and happy to admit it. I can write simple programs things like VB and python etc given the basic syntax. I want to write simple programs for android, for instance a calculator that handles feet and inches and a program that simply searches a database of products and tells me the details of them. Is there a simple solution where I can drag and drop some buttons and text boxes and execute code or do I have to learn the whole gui drawing code and start from scratch? If I do have to start from scratch is there a book out there that doesn't assume that I know any of the advanced coding techniques or do I have to learn the whole language and then learn the SDK? I want to be able to write a program quick and dirty, here are the variables here's the formula, do your thing...
