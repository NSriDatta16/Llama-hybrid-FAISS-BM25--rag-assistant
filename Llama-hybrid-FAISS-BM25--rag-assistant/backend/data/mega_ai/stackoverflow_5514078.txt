Is there a way to use a sound channel on a movieclip?

The only way i can describe this is showing the code I have already then trying to explain what i want to do.. Basically, I am creating a soundboard game, where at the bottom of the screen I will have a bar which is a movieclip, and I will be dragging other movieclips onto it and then clicking pay, and using an array and .push they will play in order. I am trying to put the sounds onto the movieclips using code. So far, I have this: var snd1:Sound = newSound(); snd.load(newURLRequest("naturefrog.wav")); var channel:SoundChannel; snd.addEventListener I am now stuck with what I would put for the listener to listen for.
