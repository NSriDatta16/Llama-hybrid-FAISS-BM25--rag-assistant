Add this functionality to your unit test. If your unit test covers serializaiton/deserialization (for example, by making sure deser(ser(x)) == x ), failure to add members to the serialization function would fail during unit testing. The same could work for copy ctors. It's not as ideal as compile time errors, but if you have a good unit test framework in place and you make sure that you have proper coverage, then these errors of neglect would be harder to make.
