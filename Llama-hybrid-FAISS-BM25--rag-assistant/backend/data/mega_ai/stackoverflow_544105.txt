To change the number referenced when referring to paragraphs, you want to change \theparagraph . Here's an example: \documentclass[12pt]{article} \setcounter{secnumdepth}{5} \renewcommand\theparagraph{\roman{paragraph}} \usepackage{lipsum} \begin{document} \paragraph{foo} \lipsum[1] \paragraph{bar} \lipsum[2] \end{document} Instead of \roman you can also use \Roman , \arabic , \alph , \Alph . Although if you have lots of paragraphs you'll want to use the alphalph package and use \alphalph to get more than 26 paragraphs. Note that \paragraph takes an argument for the "paragraph title". If you never want that, you'll probably want to define your own command to simplify things: \newcommand\PARA{\paragraph{}} You'll also probably want to remove the way that paragraphs are numbered "within" sections; i.e., they reset from "1" for every new section. You can get around this with something like \usepackage{remreset} \makeatletter \@removefromreset{paragraph}{section} \makeatother
