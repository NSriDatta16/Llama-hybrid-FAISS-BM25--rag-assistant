How can a UIControl pass all touch events on to the next object in the responder chain?

That's tricky. I have a small button over a very big one. When the small button on that big button is pressed, the small button does something. But the big one does nothing. Of course. But now I want that the big button also does something, no matter if the small button was tapped or not. So the small button has to forward all touch events to that big button. What would be the easiest way to do it? I know for UIView, but UIControl's have their very own touch handling methods different from those of UIView. In UIView that could look somewhat like this: [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event];
