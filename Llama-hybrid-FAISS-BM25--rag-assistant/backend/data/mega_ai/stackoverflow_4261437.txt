Does this work? Not taking credit for it at all. I am looking for a solution as well and found it (possibly) at www.n2ndevelopers.com http://www.n2ndevelopers.com/magento/how-to-remove-parent-category-path-from-sub-category-url-in-magento/ Go to app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Model/ Open Url.php and go to line no 632 and comment(//) the below line //if (null === $parentPath) { //$parentPath = $this->getResource()->getCategoryParentPath($category); //} //elseif ($parentPath == '/') { $parentPath = ''; //('Don't comment it') //} Now save and upload it. Now login to admin panel of your site then go to System->Config->Index Management and click on select all then select Reindex Data from the Action Dropdown then click on submit. Now refresh your cache to see the effect.
