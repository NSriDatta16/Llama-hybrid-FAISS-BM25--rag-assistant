Apache with c# classes

Is there any way to have apache "pass" the request it takes to a c# "application" to handle, allowing it to return specific content. I want to handle an intense amount of asynchronous calls to apache via javascript and have these calls routed through c# (much the way asp.net does). Has anyone successfully done this before? Any idea where to start looking? Update : Some more information. I want to be able to handle thousands of concurrent asynchronous requests as fast as can possibly occur writing the interpreting agent in some kind of threaded c# application. I could be wrong, but I dont think that iis with asp.net is tailored for this sort of thing (a proof of concept would be great). I feel that going with something like apache would be better suited. If that means going from something else to c# first is fine I guess, but I would like to be more direct.
