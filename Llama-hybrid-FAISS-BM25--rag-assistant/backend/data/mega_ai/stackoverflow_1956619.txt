The reason for the seemingly redundant type name is that you are performing two separate operations, each of which requires you to specify a type. On the left side, you are declaring a variable (a storage location) with a particular type. On the right side, you are creating a new object with a particular type. The '=' in the middle causes a reference to the new object you created to be placed in the storage location you created. The types on each side do not have to be the same. This, for example, is legal code: Object number = new OddEven(); The reason that the keyword String only shows up once in your second example is that the type String is implied on the right hand side since "xxx" is a String constant. It is simply shorthand for: String string = new String("xxx");
