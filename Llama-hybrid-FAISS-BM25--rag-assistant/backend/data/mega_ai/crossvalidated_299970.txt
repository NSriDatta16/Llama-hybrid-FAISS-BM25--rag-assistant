What is the purpose of Markov chain Monte Carlo in context of simulation of distributions with hard-to-compute constants

It is suggested that MCMC can be used to simulated draws from a distribution which has a complex normalising constant $C$, so that we don't need to derive them (as an example, let us suggest Beta distribution $f(x) = C x^{a-1} (1-x)^{b-1}$). We cannot calculate constant $C$ so we perform draws form a Markov chain with transition matrix provided by i.e. a Metropolis-Hastings scheme. Now, after say 1000 draws, we will have something like a histogram of visited states, which will approximate the Beta(a, b) distribution. BUT what is the point? We cannot simulate separate values (because states of the Markov chain are dependent, so we cannot assume that a state taken at some random time instant will be ~ Beta(a, b), but only as time -> infinity will the collective number of draws approximate the distribution in question).
