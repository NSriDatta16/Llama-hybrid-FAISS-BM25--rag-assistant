C# Image Processing Whitespace

I have a ton of pdfs scans that I have converted to images. Most of these scans contain a lot of whitespace around the edges. What is the best way to go about finding a boundingbox for the actual content and then subsequently removing the whitespace? I've thought about writing a program that just displays the image, then you drag a box and its saves the image, and moves on to the next one. This would be VERY time consuming, but it would get the job done. I'd like to be able to automate this process somehow using C#. Either buy just cropping the image or by perhaps by suggesting a bounding box.
