hook_menu isn't really the place to set weighting, I'm sure it can be done there but you'll find that just creating a normal menu item and dragging it into place in the admin's Menus dialogue will save you a ton of hassle and pain. The reason, as I understand it, is that menu hierarchy is determined in part through a weighting system rather than by the path you set. Convention certainly dictates how people set their path, but just making a normal menu item at admin/monkey does not put a monkey item into the admin menus automagically.
