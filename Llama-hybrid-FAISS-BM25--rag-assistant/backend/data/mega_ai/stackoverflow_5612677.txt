I had the same problem, I solved it like this: mentions=["foo","bar","baz"] ranked = User.where(:nickname.in => mentions).sort do |a, b| mentions.index(a.nickname) mentions.index(b.nickname) end Not really the most elegant solution since I'm sorting in the application and not on the database engine but hey.. it works ( on small lists ).
