You need to use the Blobstore . Edit : To post to the blobstore in Java, the code fragment in this SO question should work (this was for Android; elsewhere, use e.g. Apache HTTPClient ). The URL to post to must have been created with createUploadUrl . The simplest way to communicate it to the source server might be a GET URL, e.g. "/makeupload" which is text/plain and contains only the URL to POST to. To prevent unauthorized uploads, you can require a password either in the POST, or already in the GET (e.g. as a query parameter)
