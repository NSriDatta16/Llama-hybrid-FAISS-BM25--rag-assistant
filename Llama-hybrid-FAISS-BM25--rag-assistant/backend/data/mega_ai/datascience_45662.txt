Part of the confusion could be because POS tagging is not a regression problem. POS tagging is a classification problem. Classification is predicting the most likely category from a set of discrete categories. Regression is predicting a numeric output. POS tagging is multi-class classification (e.g., DET, NN, V, ...). The last layer in a neural network for a multi-class classification should be a softmax function . A softmax function will convert the activation of the nodes for each category into a probability. The largest probability will be the predicted category, in this case a POS tag.
