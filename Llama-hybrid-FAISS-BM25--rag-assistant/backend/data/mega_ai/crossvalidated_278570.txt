How exactly does AIC penalize overfitting?

I've been reading up alot on the AIC value for GLM models and it has come to my attention that pretty much all of my litterature claims that AIC penalizes the model with too many variables without mensioning what the penalty actually is. Is there anyone here who cares to explain to me how AIC penalizes models with too many variables? How does AIC show that an arbitrary model with for example 3 explanatory variables is better than a model with say 7 variables?
