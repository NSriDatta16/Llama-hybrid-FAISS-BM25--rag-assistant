A better indicator is the load average , if I simplify, it is the amount of waiting tasks because of insufficient resources. You can access it in the uptime command, for example: 13:05:31 up 6 days, 22:54, 5 users, load average: 0.01, 0.04, 0.06 . The 3 numbers at the end are the load averages for the last minute, the last 5 minutes and the last 15 minutes. If it reaches 1.00 , (no matter of the number of cores) it is that something it waiting .
