A naive estimator of $E[X \mid H]$ might be the weighted average $\dfrac{\sum p_i(H) x_i}{\sum p_i(H)}$ and similarly of $E[X \mid T]$ might be $\dfrac{\sum (1-p_i(H)) x_i}{\sum (1-p_i(H))}$ This has the following properties: If the $p_i(H)$ are $0$ or $1$ (some of each), it will give you the obvious estimates for the conditional expectations If all the $p_i(H)$ are all equal (not $0$ nor $1$ ) it will give the same estimates for the two conditional expectations The estimate of the unconditional expectation will be the mean of the actual amounts won If the two conditional expectations are actually equal then the expected difference between the estimates of the conditional expectations will be $0$ The difference between the estimates of two conditional expectations may be biased towards $0$ compared with the actual difference between the two conditional expectations
