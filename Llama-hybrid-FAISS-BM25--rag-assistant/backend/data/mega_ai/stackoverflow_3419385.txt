Did you add -vmargs ... -javaagent:lombok.jar -Xbootclasspath/a:lombok.jar # or use the full path of the jar -javaagent:C:\{sts_path}\spring-tool-suite-3.9.11\sts-bundle\sts-3.9.11.RELEASE\lombok.jar to your eclipse.ini ? Because if you have (and if you have added the lombok.jar to the libraries used by your project), it works just fine with Eclipse Helios: Ian Tegebo mentions in the comments that: a simple "restart" was not sufficient to pick up the changed vmargs: I needed to explicitly exit and then start again . chrisjleu mentions in the comments : If you happen to be running a customized Eclipse Helios (3.6+) distribution then you may have to use the full path to lombok.jar in both the vm arguments. See commit b47e87f for more details. boolean fullPathRequired = IdeFinder.getOS() == EclipseFinder.OS.UNIX || System.getProperty("lombok.installer.fullpath") != null;
