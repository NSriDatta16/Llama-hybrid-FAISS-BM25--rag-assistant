When calculating the fast Fourier transform..?

If we get the sound from microphone with two channels, to calculate the frequency spectrum we: calculate the fast fourier transform of all the data input? calculate the fast fourier transform of each left and right channel and then make a average of both? calculate the fast fourier transform of each left and right channel and get the biggest values of both? calculate in a different way?
