Bayesian model comparison for randomly sampled sets of models

I have two models $M_1$ and $M_2$ that I am using to try and compare to observed data $D$. $M_1$ is an $n_1$-dimensional model, and $M_2$ is an $n_2$-dimensional problem. The Bayes factor $K$ to compare the models can be calculated using: $K = P(D|M_1)/P(D|M_2) $ assuming no prior preference for either model. The numerator and denominator can be written as $P(D|M_i) = \int P(D|\mathbf{w},M_i) P(\textbf{w}|M_i) d\mathbf{w}$ where $\mathbf{w}$ is the parameter vector, so the integral is over parameter space. Now say that due to e.g. computational constraints, one can only compute $M_1$ and $M_2$ for a finite number of random samples of the parameter vector $\mathbf{w}$, where the number of samples is given by $s_1$ and $s_2$. Would it be acceptable to then say that the integral above becomes a summation over the random samples, and assuming the random samples are uniformly distributed through parameter space, $P(\textbf{w}|M_i)$ becomes $1/s_i$, so that: $P(D|M_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{s_i} P(D|\mathbf{w_j},M_i) / s_i$ and so what is being compared in the Bayes factor $K$ is the ratio of the average probability over all the samples for each model?
