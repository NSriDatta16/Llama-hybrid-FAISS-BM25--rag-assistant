It's not possible to tell whether a team is agile just because somebody says that they're doing scrum. There are good and bad scrum implementations but they key things about agile are: the ability of the project and team to think flexibly how self-organising the team is (do they have a control freak "architect" or manager? or is there a considerable amount of consensus decision making?) It's all too easy to conform to the minimum requirements of what a team needs to do to be doing scrum without being truly agile. Those minimum requirements are only there to bring about a certain attitude and way of working. It's possible for decision-making in a project to be ridgidly inflexible and controlled top-down and yet conform to the minimum requirements of scrum. Sadly, when I look for contracting engagements, I find the scrum-in-name only implementations outnumber the real thing by a considerable margin. Personally, I'd choose to implement extreme programming within scrum. (In fact, Jeff Sutherland says he's never seen a top productivity scrum team that didn't do the XP practices.) However, I'm pretty confident that people could implement XP really badly too... ;-) It really comes down to the attitude in the team.
