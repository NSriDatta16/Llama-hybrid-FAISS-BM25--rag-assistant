Determining sample size from a Bayesian problem

I was following up on this problem when it seemed to me that the correct answer was ambiguous. I will not re-state the problem since it can be found in the original link. I will use the same notation conventions as the accepted answer, namely that $M_1$ will designate the model for having mastery and $M_2$ for not having mastery. $N$ and $c$ indicate the number of questions and correct answers, respectively. To be more explicit, where I am having difficulty, I'll pickup from where the accepted answer finished. We have the ratio of model posteriors: $\frac{p(M_1|c)}{p(M_2|c)} \geq 19 $ By plugging in using Bayes theorem, we have: $\frac{p(c | M_1)p(M_1)}{p(c | M_2)p(M_2)} \geq 19 $ The likelihoods $p(M_i|c)$ are binomials and $p(M_i)$ are the given priors. By substituting with numerical values given in the problem, we get: $ \frac{{N \choose c} (1/2)^c(1 - 1/2)^{N-c}\times (1/2)} {{N \choose c} (1/4)^c (1-1/4)^{N-c} \times (1/2)} \geq 19 $ This can be simplified to: $ \frac{(1/2)^N}{(1/4)^c \times (3/4)^{N-c}} \geq 19 $ . However, at this point, we cannot directly solve for $N$ , since $c$ is also a variable. What is the correct approach for determining the smallest possible value of $N$ ?
