There are two types of classification model, generative model and discriminative model . Naive Bayes is a generative model, and to train Naive Bayes, your training data should be generated by the true process, and future data will be generated by that process as well. Balancing the data isn't part of the true process, so you can't do that. On the other hand, if you are training a discriminative model (eg logistic regression), then in some cases, you might want to balance your data. One common reason is that the minority class is of more importance and by balancing, you get a better performance for that class. Manipulating data is a dangerous practice and you should know very sure why you do that.
