If you break your contracts out into a separate assembly and then reference it from both the client and the server then any breaking changes will show up immediately upon compilation. Sharing references like this has been covered many times here on SO, so i won't go over it again. Where you will run in to trouble is if you are relying solely on a generated proxy on the client side, as the other posters have already answered you will not be able to test this unless you deploy and run integration tests post build. If this is your situation then you need to refer back to my first paragraph and reference the same interfaces from the different assemblies.
