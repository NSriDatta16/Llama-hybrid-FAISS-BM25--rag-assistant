I've built a rating system similar to yours, so I'll contribute some additional points to consider: As to the rating plugin, I chose jQuery Star Rating , which worked just fine, but I suspect that any of the other mentioned plugins will be fine as well. As for an algorithm, I used a simple average of all the ratings for the composite rating of an item. I also made sure to display the count of ratings so people know how reliable the average is. As to the database structure, it depends on whether you allow anonymous ratings or not. The application I built only allowed logged-in users to rate items, so I had a table that stored the user ID, the item ID and the rating. This helped prevent the same user from rating an item multiple times and kept all of the data around for me to generate my average. (If you allow anonymous ratings, then I suggest that you store the IP address or session identifier to dissuade people from rating more than once. You won't be able to stop it but you can discourage it.) You'll probably also want to compute aggregate ratings via a batch job, or at least cache the computation so it isn't redone every time an item is viewed. There's plenty of coding to be done and plenty of issues to consider to implement a "simple" ratings system, so I hope these thoughts help.
