All, I have worked-around/resolved the problem myself. The actual problem was with the Hibernate code generator tool [HibernateTools-3.2.4.GA-R200905070146-H18.zip] that does not generate hbm.xml and pojo's by reverse engg method for PostgreSQL DB. I believe the tool does not have reverse engg support for postgresql DB. Workaround/resolution I changed my DB to MySql and i was able to generate the hbm.xml and pojo. I have tried the same with Eclipse 3.5 Galileo and Eclipse Europa versions. Tips I have found a way kind of to understand whether the tool has got support for the DB that you use. Once a console configuration is created for your application, go to hibernate perspective and expand the DB. if you are able to view the columns of the DB then the tool has got the support to generate the code. The reason being is that, for postgreSQL it was not listing the column of the tables when browsed from hibernate perspective. Thanks for all those who viewed my post. ~ Jegan
