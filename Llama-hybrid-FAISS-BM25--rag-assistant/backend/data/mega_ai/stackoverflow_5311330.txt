@Gabe Contrary to what many people believe, a period (full stop) is not the only way to end a statement in COBOL. Move A To B Move C To D is logically equivalent to Move A To B. Move C To D. Where it gets squirrelly is If A = B Move C To D Add 1 To E. If I put a period after the D, 1 will be added to E unconditionally. The COBOL 85 standard added explicit scope terminators to many statements, so we got the more easily visually parsed construct If A = B Move C To D Add 1 To E End-If Now if I put a period after the D I will get a compile error. Most COBOL programmers I know now use explicit scope terminators and only end paragraph names and paragraphs with a period, otherwise banishing them from the Procedure Division.
