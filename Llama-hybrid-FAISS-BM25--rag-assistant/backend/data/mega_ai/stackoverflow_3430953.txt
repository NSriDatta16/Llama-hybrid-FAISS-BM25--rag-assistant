By typewriter effects you mean the string being displayed letter by letter? You can achieve similar effect with StringAnimationUsingKeyframes object, however, you would have to enter every string value manually. To create this effect automatically, you would have to write your own animation object, most likely one based on StringAnimationBase class.
