SHAP values of Ensemble Model

I predict a continuous variable by taking the average of $N$ model predictions. The models are different in terms of their functional form, i.e. a tree model, a neural net, etc. Is the average SHAP value for some input variable across those $N$ models equal to the SHAP value I would get by treating the aggregate model as a single model? Put differently, if I wanted to derive the SHAP value of an input variable for my aggregate (average) model prediction, is taking the average of the individual SHAP values for that respective input variable across models the correct approach?
