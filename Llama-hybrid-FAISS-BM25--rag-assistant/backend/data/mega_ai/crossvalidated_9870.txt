While it is focussed on statistical pattern recognition, rather than time series forecasting, I would strongly recommend Chris Bishop's book Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition becuase it is the best introduction to neural networks in general, and I think it would be a good idea to get to grips with the potential pitfalls in the use of neural networks in a more simple context, where the problems are more easily visualised an understood. Then move on to the book on recurrent neural networks by Mandic and Chambers . The bishop book is a classic, nobody should use neural nets for anything until they feel confident that they understand the material contained in that book; ANN make it all too easy to shoot yourself in the foot! I also disagree with mbq, nn are not obsolete, while many problems are better solved with linear models or more modern machine learning techniques (e.g. kernel methods), there are some problems where they work well and other methods don't. It is still a tool that should be in our toolboxes.
