Missing weights file in kaggle notebook

I was trying to train the DistilBert model on AG news dataset in kaggle by running this code . I created a version of the notebook and let it run in the background. After the training was done i was able to see a weights.h5 file in the output section of the notebook but when i tried to copy and edit the notebook and make further changes there was no weights.h5 file present anymore in the output section in the notebook.
