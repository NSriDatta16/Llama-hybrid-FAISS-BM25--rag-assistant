How can I find the sum of two numbers which are in String variables?

In this code fragment, I can't sum a and b : String a = "10"; String b = "20"; JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,a+b); Since a and b are defined as String , this code will concatenate the strings and output 10+20=1020 . How can I get it to instead sum a and b and output 10+20=30 ?
