Since learning is one of he objectives, Spark should work for this project. There are some drawbacks (Such as code running on CPU instead of GPU) but it should work. For text classification; High level flow could be : Build a Language Model + Vector representation of words and sentences ( https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.1/api/java/org/apache/spark/mllib/feature/Word2Vec.html ) Build a classifier with vector representation of text. Since Spark lacks good LSTM implementation; it might not perform as well as others. One way to validate is to compare performance of such classifier on public dataset such as Yelp review dataset.
