Fade / pulse effect as used on this site

I've tried searching but can't find a definitive answer, does anyone know what Stackoverflow uses to highlight changes to a page through that fade-in orange highlight? Is it just a jquery fade or some sort of pulsate effect? So for example I've a page that I change a few elements on when a user clicks in various places, I'd like to draw attention to these page updates by pulsating them like StackOverflow does. Presume it's jquery, just not sure which effect. Thanks.
