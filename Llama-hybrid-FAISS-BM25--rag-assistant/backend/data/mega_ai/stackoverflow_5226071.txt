MVC.NET Drag and Drop Toolbox to build layout page at runtime

I'm trying to create a drag and drop style toolbox using MVC.NET, similar to Visual Studio for an application I'm developing. Basically the first part of the app allows the user to create a custom layout which will be used throughout the site. I've tried a few different approaches to this but can't seem to hit one that works. My last attempt used the jQueryUI modal to allow the user to input the attributes of the item, say a div. This works and I can use AJAX to post the attribute values to my controller. This is where I get stuck. I don't know what would be the best way to append the item to the layout page. I was toying around with Streamwriter but it was proving difficult to keep track of where on the page the item was placed. I'm in the process of trying to do it via jQuery, but I'm just wondering if there is any options in the jQuery library or MVC.NET framework which I don't know about that might be useful.
