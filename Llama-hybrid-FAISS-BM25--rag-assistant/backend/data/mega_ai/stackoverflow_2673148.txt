The most elegant would be to write an own Maven plugin or to extend maven-dependency-plugin . Actually what you need is quite close to dependency:copy-dependencies , but you need a possibility to specify which artifact you want to start with. As I see from the code, this is not possible at the moment. Further idea: You can create one zip assembly per module (including module dependencies you need) and use dependency:unpack to unpack these zips in your installer module.
