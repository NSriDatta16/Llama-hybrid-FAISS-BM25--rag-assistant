Longitudinal predictive models

I have a predictive model to construct and am looking for some ideas on the approach. I have a large training dataset of customers' balances (think a savings account) at time t=1 to 36 representing monthly averages over three years. I will want to construct a model to predict the value of a customer's account at t=4..36 using only information available at the end of t=3. Hence, this is a forecasting type problem, but not in the time series sense where you observe a sequence of data significantly longer than the time horizon you are trying to predict. I am thinking of approaching this like a discrete hazard model, where a row in the dataset is created for every customer/month combination (so here each customer has 33 rows in the data and a variable called t takes on the values 4 to 36). Repeated for every month is the "initial state" variables for the customer known at the end of month 3. This is the setup of the so-called person period data . I would then learn a regression model on this data using the initial state data and 't'. There would be no accounting for the fact that the customers are repeated in the data. This works for a discrete time hazard model, but my question is if this is OK for a linear regression or a machine learning algorithm (e.g. neural net)? Is there a better way? ADD : Specifically I am wondering if such a model will fail if it does not explicitly account for the repeated measures and the correlation between rows (same customers at various values of 't'). When dealing with a predictive model, how could this be accounted for?
