Is there any criterion about choosing reference factor in multinomial logistic regression?

I have a dependent variable that includes four categories. I also have four continuous independent variables. The 3rd category covers the largest group in the sample. Is it important to choose the category covering largest group as a reference factor or can I choose another one that would make sense for comparisons?
