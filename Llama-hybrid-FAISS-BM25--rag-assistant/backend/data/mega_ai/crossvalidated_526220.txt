What would be a good objective function for a computer vision model that predicts rotation?

Let's say I have to correct images of scenes which can be rotated in the range $[0, 2\pi)$ . For my particular application I already know a CNN makes sense. I'd use this to detect the orientation, then apply the appropriate correction. I'm just trying to think of how to frame the problem and objective function. This blog post mentions the use of categorical cross-entropy loss with a multi-label classification problem where the labels are $\{0, 1, 2, 3, ... 359\}$ . To me this doesn't make much sense because if the target is 45, then 44 is penalised just as hard as 87. Regression feels a lot more sensible, apart from the fact that here the number line wraps back around onto itself. But, since max-pooling works with back-propagation I don't see why I can't use a modified MSE like $min((y-\hat{y})^2, (y-\hat{y}-2\pi)^2, (\hat{y}-y+2\pi)^2)$ . Another potential solution could be to go for the categorical approach, but apply a gaussian smoothing to the target probabilities, centered around the target label. Would anyone care to comment or advise?
