What your advisor is suggesting is called data leakage and it’s somewhat similar to training and testing your model on the same data. You might find it useful to read about p-hacking and backtest overfitting to get a feel for why this is a problem in quantitative finance. There’s also this excellent comic strip about the related concept of p-hacking ... The right thing to do is to train your ten (or more) models and then take the average performance as an indication of how well that type of model performs. You might also consider cross validation strategies to give you an even better idea of how your model might generalise.
