An interesting factor could be typing frequency and mouse movements. They are fairly easy to catch via JavaScript. Analyzing them is a different matter, although I imagine it would be fairly easy to calculate deviations and averages that give a good idea how "organic" the movements are. On the other hand, this is extremely expensive on the client side and can be understood as snooping / spying if detected. Maybe as advanced security for clients that are suspected to be bots?
