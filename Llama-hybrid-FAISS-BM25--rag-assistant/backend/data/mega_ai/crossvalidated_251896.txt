Computing variable importance based on decrease in performance when excluding each variable

I use Random Forest for a predictive problem in which the goal is to maximize the F-measure. There are various techniques to compute variable importance in Random Forest but I'm wondering what might be wrong with this simple implementation: Let's say we have k attributes selected after feature selection. Now we train and test k models using k-1 attributes each time and then compare the amount of decrease in performance (F-measure in my case) measure, and then rank the attributes based on that. Any thoughts?
