Time series analysis: alternative to Brockwell & Davis

I bought the book "Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting" by Brockwell and Davis. The first chapter was ok, but in chapter 2 I am totally lost. I cannot figure out the main idea of the explanation, and I cannot figure out the intermediate steps in the author's results; so the math becomes useless. I have no background in stochastic processes. Can someone recommend a book similar to Brockwell & Davis in contents, but where proofs are given without "It can be shown that..." (with intermediate steps), and which has more coherent explanations? I do not understand why the authors (Brockwell and Davis) are giving the details of all these propositions. I need the book for self-study.
