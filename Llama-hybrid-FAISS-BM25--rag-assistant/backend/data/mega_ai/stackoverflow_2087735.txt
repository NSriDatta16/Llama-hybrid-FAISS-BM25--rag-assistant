Most representative instance of a cluster

After performing a cluster analysis to my dataset (a dataframe named data.matrix ), I added a new column, named cluster , at the end (col 27) containing the cluster name that each instance belongs to. What I want now, is a representative instance from each cluster. I tried to find the instance having the smallest euclidean distance from the cluster's centroid (and repeat the procedure for each one of my clusters) This is what I did. Can you think of other -perhaps more elegant- ways? (assume numeric columns with no nulls). clusters
