RNN-Model for Extracting real-valued sequences

I am trying to extract a real valued sequence from a larger sequence. For example, a function generates a sequence by doubling the previous value: 1.1, 2.2, 4.4, 8.8 Currently I have trained a LSTM classifier that classifies a sequence based on the trained model of a function: 1.1, 2.2, 4.4, 8.8 = 1 1, 3.5, 2.6, 6 = 0 .5, 1, 2, 4 = 1 1, -3., -5.5, 6 = 0 .. and so on is there a way to extend this to extract sequences out of a combined sequence? 1.1, 1.5, 2.2, -3.7, 4.4, -6.8, 6.9, 7.7, 8.8 = 1.1, 2.2, 4.4, 8.8 or 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 Extracting the most likely sequence that fits into the trained classifier or predictor model. What's a suitable RNN-model approach to extracting a sequence that fits a model among a longer "noisy" sequence?
