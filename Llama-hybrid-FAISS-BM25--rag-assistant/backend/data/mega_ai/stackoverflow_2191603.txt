I'll answer your question with a counter-question... What do you think of Org-mode? It's not as pure as Markdown, but it is Markdown-like, and I find it as easy to work with, and it allows embedding of Latex. Cf. http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Embedded-LaTeX.html Postscript In case you haven't looked at org-mode, it has one great strength as a general purpose "natural markup language" over Markdown, namely its treatment of tables. The source: | 1 | 0 | 0 | | -1 | 1 | 0 | | -1 | -1 | 1 | represents just what you think it will... And the Latex is rendered in pieces using tex-mode's preview-latex.
