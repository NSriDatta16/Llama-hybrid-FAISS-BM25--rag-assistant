Warning: strong opinions following. Yes, they're drinking the Kool-Aid. Facebook Connect is a proprietary, provider-dependent Single Sign-On plus more. Facebook goes down, or is deemed unworthy of trust, and you're hosed. OpenID bypasses that. It has major user experience issues at present, but long-term it is a better solution because it frees the system from dependence on (and filtering all traffic through) a single provider. Further, its specification and implementation seem a lot cleaner -- none of this JavaScript/IFrame stuff. Just plain HTTP requests and redirects. This also gives you a lot better browser compatibility. Facebook Connect fixed the user experience issue, but at the expense of browser support and provider choice. It's a short-term pragmatic win, but I think that long-term it's not a good idea.
