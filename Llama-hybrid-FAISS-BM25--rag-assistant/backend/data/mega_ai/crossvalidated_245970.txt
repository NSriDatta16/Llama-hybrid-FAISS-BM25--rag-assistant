I too speculate at the prevalence of logistic models in the literature when a relative risk model would be more appropriate. We as statisticians are all too familiar with adherence to convention or sticking to "drop-down-menu" analyses. These create far more problems than they solve. Logistic regression is taught as a "standard off the shelf tool" for analyzing binary outcomes, where an individual has a yes/no type of outcome like death or disability. Poisson regression is frequently taught as a method for analyzing counts . It is somewhat under emphasized that such a probability model works exceptionally well for modeling 0/1 outcomes, especially when they are rare. However, a logistic model is also well applied with rare outcomes: the odds ratio is approximately a risk ratio, even with outcome dependent sampling as with case control studies. The same cannot be said of relative risk or Poisson models. A poisson model is useful too when individuals may have an "outcome" more than once, and you might be interested in cumulative incidence, such as outbreaks of herpes, hospitalizations, or breast cancers. For this reason, exponentiated coefficients can be interpreted as relative rates . To belabor the difference between rates and risks: If there are 100 cases per 1,000 person-years, but all 100 cases happened in one individual, the incidence (rate) is still 1 case per 10 person-years. In a health care delivery setting, you still need to treat 100 cases, and vaccinating 80% of the people has an 80% incidence rate reduction (a priori). However the risk of at least one outcome is 1/1000. The nature of the outcome and the question, together, determine which model is appropriate. I would be concerned with saying "we fit a Poisson regression model for incidence to estimate relative rates " because this may introduce some confusion as to the nature of the outcome and whether one person may experience it more than once. If you are interested in relative risks, you must say so, and be prepared to discuss the sensitivities of the inappropriate variance assumption where the mean is proportional to the outcome when binary events have the following mean variance relationship: $\mbox{var}(y) = E(y)(1-E(y))$ My understanding is that if the scientific interest lies in estimating relative rates, there is a hybrid model: relative risk regression which is a GLM using the logistic variance structure and the poisson mean structure. That is to say: $\log (E[Y|X])= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$ and $\mbox{var}(Y) = E[Y](1-E[Y])$, By the way, the Zhang article provides a biased estimate of inference based on the relative risk estimate which doesn't account for variability in the intercept term. You can correct the estimator by bootstrapping. To answer the specific questions: If the outcome is rare they are approximately the same. If the outcome is common, the variance of the relative rate estimator from the Poisson might be over inflated, and we might prefer the odds ratio as a biased but efficient estimate of association between a binary outcome and several exposures. I also think that case-control studies justify use of the odds ratio as a measure which does not vary with outcome dependent sampling. Scott and Wild 97 discuss methods around this. Of course, other journals might not have dedicated statistical reviewers. 2.3. I think you are blaming and assuming overmuch about what happens in medical review and academics. You should always be encouraging your students to use appropriate models whenever possible. http://biostats.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1128&context=uwbiostat
