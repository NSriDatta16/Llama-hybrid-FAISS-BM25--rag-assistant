Why the trees generated via bagging are identically distributed?

I have problem in intuitive understanding of following arguement: "The trees generated via bagging are identically distributed, thus the expectation of the average of a set of trees is the same as the Expectation of a single tree" 1) What does really distribution of tree mean? 2) Why, when there are generated via bagging are ID?
