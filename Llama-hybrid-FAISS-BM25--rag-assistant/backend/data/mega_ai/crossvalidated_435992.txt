Best Method to Find Embedding Similarity Between Array of Items to One Single Item

Say I have an array of items purchased together and I have different attributes of these products purchased together. X_1a = [product_id_1,product_id_2,product_id_3] X_2a = [product_id_2, product_id_3] X_3a = [product_id_3, product_id_4, product_id_5, product_id_6] X_1b = ["product desc 1", "product desc 2", "product desc 3"] X_2b = ["product desc 2", "product desc 3"] X_3b = ["product desc 3", "product desc 4","product desc 5", "product desc 6"] X_1c = ["country_origin_for_product1", "country_origin_for_product2", "country_origin_for_product3"] X_2c = ["country_origin_for_product2", "country_origin_for_product3"] X_3c = ["country_origin_for_product3", "country_origin_for_product4","country_origin_for_product5", "country_origin_for_product6"] I then create 3 embedding layers and train a tensor flow model: embedding#1 : [w11, w12, w13, w14] embedding#2 : [w21, w22, w23, w24] embedding#3 : [w31, w32, w33, w34] model = Model([input1,input2,input3]) Given some new customer and combination of products/attributes that are bought What is the best way to recommend the single most similar product? [product_id_1,product_id_5,product_id_6] = product_id_x Note: I would convert the ids in the first layer to strings.
