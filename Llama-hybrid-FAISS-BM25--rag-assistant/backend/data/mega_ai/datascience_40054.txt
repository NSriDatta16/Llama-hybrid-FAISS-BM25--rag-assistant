Twitter tweet classification

I am trying to do a small project on my own to find out job openings using twitter data. I saved data using flume and converted it to .csv for analysis. My problem is i don't know how to classify tweets, whether it is a job vacancy or just some news on say machine-learning.I read online about neural networks and word2vec but i am not sure if it will solve my problem. Can anyone suggest some ways to do this based on tweet text and hashtags.I don't have training and test data, i just have tweets stored using flume.Also what kind of analysis will i be able to do with it.I am new to data science :/
