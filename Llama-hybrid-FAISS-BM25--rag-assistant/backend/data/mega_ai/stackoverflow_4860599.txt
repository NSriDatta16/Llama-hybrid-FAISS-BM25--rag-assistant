Web ui Drag & drop designer

i know Ext Designer, but i cannot reach in time to take the demonstration period of it. I think that on the internet will be a lot of Ext Designer like apps. If someone knows a similar product (don't want dreamweaver or similar) can say me the name? If there are open source would be better, but paid apps although will be OK Thanks a lot for all, and I know that my English it's too poor
