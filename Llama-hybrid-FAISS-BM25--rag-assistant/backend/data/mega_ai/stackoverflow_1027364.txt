Task planning data/object structure

I need to create a database structure for managing a gantt style system of tasks and resources, there are some custom needs and the technology involved doesn't play well with others, so I'm thinking of doing it from scratch. My needs are simple: Tasks, prioritized Resources (just people) Calendars (mostly being able to handle non-working days) I've checked the Microsoft project data structure but it's way to complex for my needs, and haven't been able to find anything simpler that's more or less documented. The most important use case is taking an unassigned task and drop it into the worklist of a resource, making all the dates adjustments in the surrounding tasks. There's no need to plot a graph for the moment. Is there some standard way of doing this that I'm missing?
