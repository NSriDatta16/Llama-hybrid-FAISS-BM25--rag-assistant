Organizing JavaScript code to be visible in Eclipse Outline

How should I organize my JavaScript code to be visible well in deep in the Eclipse JSDT's Outline View? For example, if I have a JS file containing the following content, Outline shows the one top level function only: function topLevel() { var local1 = 1; var local2 = 2; function local() {}; }
