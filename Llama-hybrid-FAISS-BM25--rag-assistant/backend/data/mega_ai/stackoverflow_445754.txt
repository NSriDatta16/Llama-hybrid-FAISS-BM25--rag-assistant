how to set auto increment value=true in LINQ

I have a table with names 'Employee' with four field EmployeeId,Name,Address,Age I have set the EmployeeId is Primary key.I want that EmployeeId field will be incremented automatically whenever adding any new records. Codebehind for insert is: { DataClassesDataContext db = new DataClassesDataContext(); Employee emp = new Employee {Name = "James", Address = "India", Age = 24}; db.Employees.InsertOnSubmit(emp); db.SubmitChanges(); ShowEmployee(); } designer.cs: [Column(Storage = "_EmployeeId", DbType = "Int NOT NULL", IsPrimaryKey = true,IsDbGenerated=true,CanBeNull=false)] When I am running this application getting the following error: Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'EmployeeId', table 'Habib.dbo.Employee'; column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails. The statement has been terminated. Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks, Masum
