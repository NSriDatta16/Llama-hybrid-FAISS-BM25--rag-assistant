When to use Bayesian Networks over other machine learning approaches?

I expect there may be no definitive answer to this question. But I have used a number of machine learning algorithms in the past and am trying to learn about Bayesian Networks. I would like to understand under what circumstance, or for what types of problems would you choose to use Bayesian Network over other approaches?
