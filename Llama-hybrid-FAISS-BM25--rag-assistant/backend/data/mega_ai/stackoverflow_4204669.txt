Asp.Net MVC3 RC Razor views : syntax for embedding code inside block

Having trouble embedding c# code inside a javascript block with MVC3 RC1 razor view. What syntax should I use to make this working? I get warnings eg. Expected constant on the isOk variable among other. (Without text tag, the following code is not recognized as javascript) @{bool isOk = true;} var tmp1 = ""; @if (isOk) { var tmp=""; // this should be interpreted as javascript }
