Yes, you do need to account for the irregularity of the time series because volatility scales with time. Depending upon the distribution and independence assumptions, sometimes a "square root of time" rule can be appropriate . Is this data sampled irregularly intraday or across a longer time period?

For dealing with high-frequency financial data, you can apply a realized volatility measure, which is available in R in the realized package $^\dagger$ . $\dagger$ Package ‘realized’ was removed from the CRAN repository.
