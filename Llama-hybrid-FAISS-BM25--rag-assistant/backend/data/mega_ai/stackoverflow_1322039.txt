The following query will get you the employee records that aren't deleted, or only the employ only has deleted records. select a.* from table_a a left join table_b b on a.empno = b.empno where b.status <> 'D' or (b.status = 'D' and (select count(distinct status) from table_b where empno = a.empno) = 1) This is in ANSI SQL, but if I knew your RDBMS, I could give a more specific solution that may be a bit more elegant.
