How to unambiguously communicate that a trend line through data is not presumed to be predictive?

I placed a regression line through data purely as a visual aid: The problem is there is a non-trivial risk that someone (especially non-statisticians) may interpret this regression line through the time series as predictive and hence assume it can be used to make estimations about the future (generally a bad idea ). What I know so far I considered: Avoiding the use of the word "trend", since it doesn't imply historical-only or future. A disclaimer: " past trends do not predict future results " (similar to financial documents). Question Are there any better ways of placing a line through data such that it serves as a visual aid and is unambiguously not to be used for extrapolation?
