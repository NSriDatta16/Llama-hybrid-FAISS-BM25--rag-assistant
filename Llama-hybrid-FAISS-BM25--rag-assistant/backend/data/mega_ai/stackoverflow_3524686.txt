I've tried the Pomodoro Technique for a week or so. I didn't focus too much on the details of maintaining check lists of completed and interrupted sprints, but rather I started the day with the tasks that I wanted to do on that day, and went through them as best as I could using the 25-minute sprints and five-minute breaks. The Pomodoro Technique suggests to use the breaks to relax, stretch your legs, grab a coffee, etc. I've noticed that activities like those that don't require a total focus shift and can be done on automatic don't break the flow, but rather helped me cleanse my mind and refocus my attention. It's as if you're allowing yourself to step away from the trees to survey the forest for a bit before diving back in. I dropped Pomodoro after that short trial period because I found that in my case I got the most benefit from simply sitting down in the morning and writing down what I wanted to do on that day. Once the decision is made and the work is started I found that I fall into a natural rhythm of sorts. I work until I'm bored, frustrated, or interrupted, then I take a break and continue. I didn't find that time boxing my sprints added much value. YMMV, but it's worth at least giving it a try.
