plot log likelihood function evolution in mcmc simulations

Is it possible to plot log likelihood function evolution in mcmc simulations? I have a mixture model and its parameters are estimated using the gibbs sampling method in r environment and using the r2jags package. I want to trace the log likelihood function evolutions in iterations to present the model convergence. Is it possible? How can I best present the convergence of the model?
