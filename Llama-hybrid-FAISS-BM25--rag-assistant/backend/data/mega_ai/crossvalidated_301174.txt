Lasso and ridge regression can be interpreted in Bayesian framework as Maximum A Posteriori estimation (the regularization term comes from the prior). For the details see these notes or first chapters of Statistical Learning with Sparsity . There is also a derivation for linear regression that is based on assuming that predictor variables are noisy . Notes for Hinton's coursera course contain the details (Lecture 9c, Using noise as a regularizer).
