You need to include the interests table. @events = Event.all(:include => :interests, :conditions => ["interests.id = ?", 4]) You had it right in your post, but you didn't pluralize interests. Update Because this answer is still getting attention, I thought it might be a good idea to update it using ActiveRecord::Relation syntax since the above way is going to be deprecated. @events = Event.includes(:interests).where(interests: { id: 4 }) or @events = Event.includes(:interests).where('interests.id' => 4) And in case you want a custom condition @events = Event.includes(:interests).where('interests.id >= 4')
