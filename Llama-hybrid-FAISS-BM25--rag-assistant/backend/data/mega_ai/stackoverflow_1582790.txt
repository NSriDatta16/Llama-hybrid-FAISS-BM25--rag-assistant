Network programming: SOAP vs DIY marshalling with XML library?

I know that there are a lot of discussions already on SO about SOAP, bloat, XML, and alternative mechanisms like REST. Here's the situation. A new team member is really talking up SOAP based upon the difficulty of implementing protocols by hand. He recommends gSOAP (project is all in C++.) He is stating things like WSDL cleaning up lots of messy hand coded C++. Right now I am handling most networking with XML based text messages, and the expat XML library. So I have some programming effort (not much) associated with modifications to message formats or additions to parameter lists. At the sender end I package up an XML request and send it over a plain old TCP socket. At the receiver I parse the XML using DOM or SAX. Etc. It has worked fine so far. The XML messages are quite compact and average a couple of hundred characters, at most. And I understand every item in those messages. We want one portion of the product (a server) to be accessible to web sites that are coded using PHP. That is partly driving this idea here, that a SOAP interface will be "easier" for script writers. Everyone on this project believes that SOAP is their salvation. I see the introduction of a new large library like gSOAP as highly disruptive to the momentum of a mature project. What I am wondering is if there is a different and more compact way of doing what SOAP gives us. And how to balance claims of gSOAP or other SOAP tools making development life easier against hard reality. IE, I am being told that WSDL is better, easier, more workmanlike, etc than hand coding C++ using an XML library. That it puts the semantics of the C++ objects right into the declaration of the network messages. The thing is, many of the XML messages that I have defined don't map one for one to a single distinct object at the receiving end. Or, it is possible that I am worrying about nothing. But the reality as I scan messages here seems to contradict what I have been told locally.
