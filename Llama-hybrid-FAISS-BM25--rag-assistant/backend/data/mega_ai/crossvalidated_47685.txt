Calculating log-likelihood for given MLE (Markov Chains)

I am currently working with Markov chains and calculated the Maximum Likelihood Estimate using transition probabilities as suggested by several sources (i.e., number of transitions from a to b divided by number of overall transitions from a to other nodes). I now want to calculate the log-likelihood of the MLE.
