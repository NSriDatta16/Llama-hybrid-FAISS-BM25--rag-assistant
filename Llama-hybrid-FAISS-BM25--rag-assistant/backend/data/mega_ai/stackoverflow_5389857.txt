how to get web-fragment.xml working

I have following web-fragment.xml in a jar file, under META-INF/ It seems I cannot get it to work (although I think it did in previous tests). The same content works in web.xml. The web application is itself part of an ear, but I wouldn't expect that to matter. I tried with tag and . Where is the reference documentation, btw? The idea is to include my jar in all of my ear's wars (10+) to have common things implemented in one place (authentication, ...). The question is about web-fragment, I'll get the things working (which was the case in web.xml) once I can migrate to that. tag was itself at 2.5 before, changed it to 3.0 (and cleaned the project to be sure). javax.faces.FACELETS_RESOURCE_RESOLVER be.epc.common.web.util.EpcResourceResolver 403 /epcResources/noaccess.jsf javax.ejb.AccessLocalException /epcResources/noaccess.jsf 404 /epcResources/notfound.jsf 500 /epcResources/error.jsf Faces Servlet javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet 1 Faces Servlet /faces/* /icefaces/* *.jsf Toutes pages *.xhtml *.jsf APP_EPC HTTPS CONFIDENTIAL FORM epcRealm /unauthenticated-redirect.jsp /unauthenticated-redirect.jsp APP_EPC
