"What would be the best way to expose this rate through a performance counter? Perhaps I could just track the total number of events that have occurred, together with the total time elapsed, and then calculate the average and code and expose it through a NumberOfItems32? What seems a bit weird about that is that it wouldn't use the same "averaging window" as the properly managed counters." You have your solution right there. Keeping track of the number of items and the time is the only way to get the average you're looking for. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.performancecounter.aspx
