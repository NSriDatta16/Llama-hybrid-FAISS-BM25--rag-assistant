"Introspective Writer"? It seems that the interesting you can do with it (that you can't do with Writer) is to write an introspect function that examines the state/output and changes it: introspect :: (s -> s) -> M s () introspect f = M $ \s -> (f s, ()) I can't see that you can do this for writer, I think you'd have to make do with a post-transformer instead: postW :: Writer w a -> (w -> w) -> Writer w a postW ma f = Writer $ let (w,a) = getWriter ma in (f w,a)
