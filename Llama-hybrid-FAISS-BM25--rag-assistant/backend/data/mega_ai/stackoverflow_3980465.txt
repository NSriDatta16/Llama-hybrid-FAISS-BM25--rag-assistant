Your setAnimationTransition: shouldn't be forView:modelView; it should be for the parentView. [UIView setAnimationTransition:UIViewAnimationTransitionCurlUp forView:containerView cache:NO]; http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIView_Class/UIView/UIView.html If you want to change the appearance of a view during a transition—for example, flip from one view to another—then use a container view, an instance of UIView, as follows: Begin an animation block. Set the transition on the container view. Remove the subview from the container view. Add the new subview to the container view. Commit the animation block. Use of this method is discouraged in iOS 4.0 and later. You should use the block-based animation methods instead.
