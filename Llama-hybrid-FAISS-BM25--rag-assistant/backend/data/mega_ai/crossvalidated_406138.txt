How to interpret the basics of a logistic regression calibration plot please?

First-time post to Stack Overflow. I am asking for help interpreting the calibration plot of a logistic regression model please. I understand what the ideal line means, but not the bias-corrected or the apparent lines please. Also what do the ticks on the top x-axis mean? I have read through the documentation on rms::calibrate() but need something of a lower level. calibration.Model.A
