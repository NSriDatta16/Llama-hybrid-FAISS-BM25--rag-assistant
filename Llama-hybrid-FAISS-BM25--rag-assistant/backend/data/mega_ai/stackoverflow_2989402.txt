for the Drag & Drop part, there is no built-in functionality in Silverlight so far (at least not for UIElements). But there are many implementations out there that provide this functionality, e.g. the DragDropManager on Codeplex: http://silverlightdragdrop.codeplex.com/ These "workarounds" usually use mouse events and CaptureMouse/ReleaseMouseCapture to implement Drag & Drop behavior on UIElements. Once you have Drag & Drop in your app, the rest should not be too hard. I'd place the image inside a Canvas and then move the markers around on that Canvas using the functionality provided by e.g. the Codeplex Drag & Drop implementation. Basically, all you have to do is set Canvas.Top/Canvas.Left for a marker based on where the mouse is. Cheers, Alex
