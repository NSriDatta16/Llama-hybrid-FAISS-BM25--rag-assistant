Is my full model with all significant estimates really the most parsimonious model?

I am performing a model selection based on BIC (Bayesian information criterion). I start with the following model fitted with rma.mv() in the 'metafor' package: res I get the following output: Multivariate Meta-Analysis Model (k = 773; method: ML) Variance Components: estim sqrt nlvls fixed factor sigma^2.1 0.6877 0.8293 37 no Experiment sigma^2.2 4.3396 2.0832 364 no Species Test for Residual Heterogeneity: QE(df = 763) = 12090.4603, p-val I can't go further in the selection as you always get higher BIC by dropping any others of the terms. It is very wierd that all interaction terms are significant to me. Could this be interpeted as overfitting due to the large number of levels at the random part of the model (1|Species)?
