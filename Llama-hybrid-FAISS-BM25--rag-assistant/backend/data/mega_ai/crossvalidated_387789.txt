If you don't mind having a rectangular confidence region, and you know things are unimodal and symmetric, you could use the approach taken by credible.region() in the bayesSurv R package: https://rdrr.io/cran/bayesSurv/src/R/credible.region.R I believe this is the idea behind how it works: We have $n$ MCMC samples for each of $p$ parameters. Imagine them plotted in $p$ -dimensional space. Start with the smallest hypercube around all the samples. Shrink it down so it just barely excludes any point which is a marginal min or max along any axis. (E.g. with $d=2$ , we would remove up to 4 points: the top-most, left-most, right-most, and bottom-most points. Or maybe as few as just 2 points, if e.g. the top-most and right-most values are at the same point and likewise for left/bottom.) Repeat the whole process on the remaining points. Continue until only 95% (or whatever desired fraction) of samples remain. (But the way it's implemented in practice, you only need to sort each column once---no need for a loop the way I described it here.) This rectangular region will be larger than an ellipsoid, but not as computationally-intensive as relying on KDE or Euclidean distances.
