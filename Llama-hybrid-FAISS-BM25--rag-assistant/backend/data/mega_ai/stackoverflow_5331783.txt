Why TObject.Free is called before the first line of code of my application is executed?

We are trying to figure out if we have memory leaks in our software. So, I have been using various tools and programs to help me find possible memory leaks. One of the software I used was AQTime. As it came with Delphi XE, it was only a demo. So, I was not really able to get any useful information from it. Then, I decided to use free software, MemProof. So far, it has shown me many issues with our software that requires attention. One of which is an error. As soon as I start my program through MemProof, it lists 2 errors, which is attempting to destroy non-existent object from the unit file, system.pas. So, when I actually put a break point within TObject.Free procedure, it breaks even before my program started all the way. Stepping through the procedure Free in system.pas, I found out that TIconimage is trying to destroy or free itself. In other word, free procedure is not invoked from within my program prior to actually starting up. Here is the actual Free procedure: procedure TObject.Free; begin if Self <> nil then Destroy; end; After that observation, I removed the breakpoint and let the program run all the way. My programs main window popped up ready for user input. However, I also found out that TObject.Free procedure is invoked non-stop if any part of my program's WINDOW is displayed on the screen. I don't understand that at all. Why is that? Can anyone explain? How is TForm is related to TObject.Free in any shape or form as the procedure is constantly invoked when the TForm is displayed on the screen? Thanks in advance.
