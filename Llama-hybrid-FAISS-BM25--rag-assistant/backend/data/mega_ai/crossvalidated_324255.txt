I have not tried this before, but I might try to do the following. Use a random forest implementation that handles categorical splits properly (I think the r implementation might). This is an open ticket for scikit-learn here's the ticket . Once the random forest has been trained you can examine all splits in the categorical variable of interest. You would be looking for which groups of categories had the largest decrease in impurity.
