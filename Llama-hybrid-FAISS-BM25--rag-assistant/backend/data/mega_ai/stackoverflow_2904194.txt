I'll state the obvious - something changed. It could be an upgrade that isn't having the desired effect - it could be a network component going south - it could be a flakey disk - it could be many things - but something in the access path has changed. What other problem indications are you seeing, including problems not directly related to this application? Where is the database stored (local disk, network storage box, written by angels on the head of a pin, other)? Has your system administrator "helped" or "improved" things somehow? The code has not worn out - something else has happened.
