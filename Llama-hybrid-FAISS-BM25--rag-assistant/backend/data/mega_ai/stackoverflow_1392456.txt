jquery - Resize element ondrag when reaches container

I have a standard div that is set to both drag & resize within it's parent. I need to be able to resize the div as it is dragged into it's parent. I only need this to happen when it's dragged vertically to the bottom, so I have it setup like this: $("#draggable").draggable({ drag: function(event, ui) { AtBottom(); }, axis:'y', containment:'parent' }); Then I am calculating the bottom position of both the draggable element and it's container(minus offset), and re-sizing it when it's greater.. function AtBottom(){ var Cpos = $('#Container').position(); var cheight = $('#Container').height(); var Boundry = Cpos.top+cheight; var pos = $("#draggable").position(); var height = $("#draggable").height(); var bottom = pos.top+height+10; /*10 as offset */ if(bottom>Boundry){ $("#draggable").height((height-10)); } } It appears that jquery stores the element properties throughout the entire drag and doesn't re-calculate them, which makes sense for performance, but isn't allowing this to work the way I would like -> Otherwise it does as it should. On each drag, it decreases the height by 10. Is there a way I can force Jquery to re-calculate the positions? -> I already tried enable/disable..
