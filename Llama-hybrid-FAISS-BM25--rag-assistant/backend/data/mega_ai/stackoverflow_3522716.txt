Speed of retrieval is the top priority here, and every nanosecond counts. Anything to do with dynamic probably isn't what you're looking for then... Don't get me wrong, it's pretty heavily optimised - but if you basically just want a string-to-string dictionary lookup, stick with a dictionary. Alternatively, if you have a limited number of keys, have you considered just having an array with either an enum or a bunch of int constants as the keys?
