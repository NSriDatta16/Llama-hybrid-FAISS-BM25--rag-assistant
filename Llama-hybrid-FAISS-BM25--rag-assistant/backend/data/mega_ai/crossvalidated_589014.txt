I have a different opinion than above and I think you got misunderstood. I believe it is possible. Training of GAN is done when the generator fool the discriminator. The Generator is useless at this point and can be used as a generator of synthetic data - there are already papers on this topic https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1577/1/012027/pdf Though this is not what you are interested in. Simple example: You had dataset of cats and generator learned to create pics of cats so well that discriminator cannot distinguish it anymore. Logically when you take the Discriminator from the trained GAN and you feed it with pictures of a dog and cats it should be capable to say NO the pic of the dog is not a cat! As your post was 4 years ago, how did go? :)
