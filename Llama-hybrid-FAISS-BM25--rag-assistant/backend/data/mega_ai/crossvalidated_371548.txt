What is the connection between Bayesian Networks and the models done in Probabilistic Programming?

For what I’ve read about them, they are very similar. Both model probabilistic models in which the nodes are random variables and the edges are dependencies among them. However, the literature I’ve read makes no explicit connection among these two fields. Is probabilistic programming just a technique for modeling and doing inference on Bayesian Networks? Is it because probabilistic programming languages have enabled the specification of very complex Bayesian Networks that their literature seems so different?
