Mean adjusted $R^2$ for linear regression with gaussian noise covariates

Consider the simple regression model $y = a x + b + \varepsilon$, where $x$ is a covariate, $y$ is the observed response and $\varepsilon$ is the unobserved noise (with no distribution assumption). We can add to the model a covariate $\omega$ which is a realisation of a gaussian noise, and this obviously increases the $R^2$ coefficient of the fit. However, is the expected adjusted $R^2$ cofficient of the augmented model the same as the adjusted $R^2$ coefficient of the original model? This would mean that the adjusted $R^2$ is apt at eliminating the inflation of $R^2$ which is due to random noise in the covariates. The answer may be completely trivial. In any case, I'm interested to learn more about this and in references (for a mathematically mature audience) on the subject. Remark. An example seems to indicate it may be the case. With R's Ozone data, the adjusted $R^2$ coefficient of the model $\texttt{O3}$ ~ $\texttt{T12}$ is found as follows: out = with(ozone, lm(O3 ~ T12)) summary(out)$adj.r.squared ## 0.2640621 For the model $\texttt{O3}$ ~ $\texttt{T12}$ + $\texttt{noise}$, where $\texttt{noise}$ is an instance of white noise, the average adjusted $R^2$ is almost the same: r2.aug
