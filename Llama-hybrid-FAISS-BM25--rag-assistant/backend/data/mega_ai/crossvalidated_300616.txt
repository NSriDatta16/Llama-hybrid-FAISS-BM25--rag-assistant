Blind Source Separation of Ongoing Time Series Data

I have a blind source separation problem that matches the form of "isolating conversations in a crowded room" and have been looking into ICA as an option. Basically, a sensor array will have overlap in its readings that need to be factored out. However, I need to be able to do this in an online learning context where the solution is based on the aggregated Time Series data to date. I was wondering if ICA is generally an appropriate solution or if I am approaching this correctly. Any suggestions on direction would be appreciated. I am not entirely sure of the terminology I should be using so please bear with me.
