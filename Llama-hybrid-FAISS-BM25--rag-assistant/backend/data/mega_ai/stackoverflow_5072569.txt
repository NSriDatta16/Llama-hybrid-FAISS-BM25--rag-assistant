How to make a Windows Service listen for additional request while it is already processing the current request?

I need to build a Windows Service in VB.net under Visual Studio 2003. This Windows service should read the flat file (Huge file of about a million records) from the local folder and upload it to the corresponding database table. This should be done in Rollback mode (Database transaction). While transferring data to table, the service should also be listening to additional client requests. So, if in between client requests for a cancel operation, then the service should rollback the transactions and give feedback to the client. This windows service also keeps writing continuously to two log files about the status and error records. My client is ASPX page (A website). Can somebody help me explain how to organize and achieve this functionality in a windows service(Processing and listening for additional client requests simultaneously. Ex. Cancellation request). Also could you suggest me the ideal way of achieving this (like if it is best to implement it as web service or windows service or just a remote object or some other way). Thank you all for your help in advance!
