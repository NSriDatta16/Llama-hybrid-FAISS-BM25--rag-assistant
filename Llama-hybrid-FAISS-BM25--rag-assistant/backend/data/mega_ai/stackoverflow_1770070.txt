Also beware that the form may be closed by pressing Alt+F4 and pressing the X button and both ways will not trigger the cancel button click event. Unless you are also handling these situations wouldn't it be best to follow the advice of slurdge and prevent the form from closing in the FormClosing event. Edit: Also note that if you change the DialogResult of the button back to None in the Properties windows, you are changing it to the default value. If the value is the default value of the property then it will not be persisted in the *.Designer.cs. Even if it were persisted the form initialization code is placed last in the *.Designer.cs and would override the None with Cancel because of the line: this.CancelButton = this.button1; As you can check in Reflector the previous line does this: public void set_CancelButton(IButtonControl value) { base.Properties.SetObject(PropCancelButton, value); if ((value != null) && (value.DialogResult == DialogResult.None)) { value.DialogResult = DialogResult.Cancel; } } You can change it back to None in the constructor after the InitializeComponent() call.
