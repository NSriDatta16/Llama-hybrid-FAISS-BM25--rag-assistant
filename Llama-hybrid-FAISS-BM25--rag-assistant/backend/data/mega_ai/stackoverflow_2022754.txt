Order objects for Northwind Access database

I need to build two objects: an OrderList and an Order. Using those two objects, I have to populate a DataGridView with a history of the orders. However, I am instructed not to use binding sources for the connection or other drag and drop controls. Unfortunately, from Google it seems like those are the most popular options for this type of problem. Can anyone point me in the right direction? I don't have much experience with C#. Thanks.
