Advantage of character based language models over word based

Is there an intuition why character based models language bases models are preferred over word based. For example Karpathy builds his language model by predicting the next character in Karpathy Blog . The aspect I am struggling with is that not each combination of characters is a word, so intuitively I would try to predict the next word (or word embedding and calculate squared error). I think this is also used in the sentence embedding proposed by Kiros Skip Thought . So my question is what are advantages and disadvantages for character based language models in comparison to word based models.
