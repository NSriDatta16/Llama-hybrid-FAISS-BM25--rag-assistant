Why bother with the "L" in the "LVHA" link styles?

Isn't the "a:link" pseudoclass redundant with "a" when put in that order (:link, :visited, :hover, :active)? Why put this: a:link {color: blue;} a:visited {color: purple;} a:hover {color: red;} a:active {color: yellow;} When you could just put this: a {color: blue;} a:visited {color: purple;} a:hover {color: red;} a:active {color: yellow;} I ask because the first one is the most common example I see of the LVHA order. The second version has the same specificity, so it functions the same way. Is it just an organizational thing to make clear what's changing when the link state changes? What am I missing?
