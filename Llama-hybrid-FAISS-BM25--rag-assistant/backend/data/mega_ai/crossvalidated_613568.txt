Strange high values in the probability vector in Image Classification

I have successfully trained a ResNet50V2 model. I used transfer learning on ImageNet database, and launch the inference on the unseen data. I obtain a high accuracy (>80%), but when I print the probability vector for each label, I obtain strangely high values. The sum of the elements is one, sure, but it is like the CNN is almost sure when it performs a prediction. For the predicted label I recover a probability of 1 and this trend is quite common in all the 200 predictions. In the last dense layer I use the softmax activation function. Is there an error?
