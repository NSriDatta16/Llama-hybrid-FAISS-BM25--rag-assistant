As has been noted, your code only runs the action once. A usual tactic is to run the code a number of times (say, do 3 searches) to get larger numbers (so if 3 searches take 0.9 seconds, you can say a search takes 0.3). Then loop this a few times to allow you to calculate an average (including standard deviation if you like, to filter out wild results), and then on top of that, run once without paying attention to the record time in order for any JITing to be performed. Also, run the code in release mode with no debugger attached.
