You can store the data as a JSON file in your application's internal storage space . I find that this is a much easier approach, as you can easily map the JSON to Model classes using a library like Gson . You would typically follow this approach if the data you have will not be "updated" like you might do in a traditional database(although you are still able to update your JSON data, just differently).
