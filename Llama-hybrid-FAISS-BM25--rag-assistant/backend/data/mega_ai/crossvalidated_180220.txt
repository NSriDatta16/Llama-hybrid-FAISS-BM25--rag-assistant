How to define prior for beta-binomial A/B test

I would like to run an A/B test using a Bayesian beta-binomial model whereby I would state probabilities such as $P(p_B>p_A)$ in place of using a traditional T-test. I've read that the prior should be constructed as $f(a,b) \sim (a+b)^{-\frac{5}{2}}$. How exactly is this done? I'm looking for an actual example of this step of the modeling process. Here is my A/B test data by day formatted as: date, A enrollments, A conversions, B enrollments, B conversions. 10/1/2015,150,16,148,17 10/2/2015,163,17,165,19 10/3/2015,155,14,157,18 10/4/2015,161,15,153,19 10/5/2015,148,14,150,16
