Posterior distribution for a real sample

I'm supposed to write a function in R that evaluates the posterior density, up to a multiplicative constant, at $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ for a logistic regression given a dataset $y$ and $X$ . Where $y$ contains the results (pass/fail as TRUE/FALSE) and $X$ information about the participant (age, gender, private/public education). So I have $\boldsymbol{\pi}=\left(\pi_\text{intercept}, \pi_\text{age}, \pi_3,\pi_4 \right)$ where $\pi_3$ and $\pi_4$ are binary parameters (they can be either 1 or 0). I want to write a function that calculates the posterior density (up to a multiplicative constant) assuming we have a vague prior $\boldsymbol{\pi} \sim N(\boldsymbol{0, I})$ where $\boldsymbol{I}$ is the identity matrix. So far I have tried writing code for $$f(\boldsymbol{\pi}|x) \propto L(\boldsymbol{\pi})f(\boldsymbol{\pi})$$ where $L(\boldsymbol{\pi})$ is the likelihood function. I have come up with this so far # R's build in logistic function logistic I know this is wrong since for the following data I should get X What am I doing wrong here?
