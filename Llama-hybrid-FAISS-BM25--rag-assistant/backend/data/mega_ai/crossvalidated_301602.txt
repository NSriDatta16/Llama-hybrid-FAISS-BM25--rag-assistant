Choosing neural network architeture and how to know if it is overfitting

I am trying to build a neural network on MATLAB using NNTool. I have a huge data set, with more than 20k samples. It has 3 input parameters and 1 output. Here is a data sample: U varies at 0.5 step until 10 (0.2 ; 0.5 ; 1.0 ... 10). n varies from 0 to 1 and m varies from 0 until it equals n. I am using the Levenberg-Marquartd algorithm and have been playing with number of neurons and hidden layers. Despise that, I have done nothing in other parameters. How can I know if I am achieving a good performance without ovetfitting with such a huge data set? Here's what MATLAB tell me about the performance:
