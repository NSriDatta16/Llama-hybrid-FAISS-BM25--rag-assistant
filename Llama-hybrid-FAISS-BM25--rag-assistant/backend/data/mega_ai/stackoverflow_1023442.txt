jQuery .load() function + IE + dynamic URL = hair loss

IE is having diffculty with dynamic urls in the jQuery load function. Here's my code snippet: var formValues = $('#testing').serialize(); var URL = "test.cfm?" + formValues; var dialogOpts = { modal: true, bgiframe: true, autoOpen: true, height: 500, width: 500, draggable: true, resizable: false, closeOnEscape: false, open: function() { //display correct dialog content $("#dialogContainer").load(URL} }; $("#dialogContainer").dialog(dialogOpts); Now mind you, if I changed URL to something static like "thisHTMLfile.html", this will work flawlessly in FF and IE. But since the URL is dynamic IE barfs. I get a blank dialog. It's as if IE won't do the ajax call. i've tried the idea of putting a random value in the string to make it a unique url so that IE won't cache the url, no dice. I've also checked the test2.cfm file for any HTML errors. No problems here. Has anyone come across this? Thanks!
