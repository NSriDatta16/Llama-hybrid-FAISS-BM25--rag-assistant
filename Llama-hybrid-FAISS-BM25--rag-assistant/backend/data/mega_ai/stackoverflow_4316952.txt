Retrieving Points of Polygons created by cvApproxPoly()

I have a CvSeq* containing the polygons created by running cvApproxPoly() on a CvSeq* created from running cvFindContors on a b&w input image. I want to access the CvPoints of each polygon returned from the CvSeq*. Code so far as follows (outlines is an IplImage containing the b&w input image): //create pointers to store data we're going to be calculating CvMemStorage* storage = cvCreateMemStorage(); CvSeq* first_contour = NULL; CvSeq* first_polygon = NULL; //find the contours (edges) of the silhouette, in terms of pixels. cvFindContours( &outlines, storage, &first_contour, sizeof(CvContour), CV_RETR_LIST ); //convert the pixel contours to line segments in a polygon. first_polygon = cvApproxPoly(first_contour, sizeof(CvContour), storage, CV_POLY_APPROX_DP, 2, 1); I can use cvDrawContour to draw the polygon onto an image, but I want to iterate over each 2D point that defines each contour. It looks like each element of the CvSeq* first_polygon contains the set of points for a single polygon (concluded based on the value of first_polygon->total;, but I don't know how to access the individual points. Help please?
