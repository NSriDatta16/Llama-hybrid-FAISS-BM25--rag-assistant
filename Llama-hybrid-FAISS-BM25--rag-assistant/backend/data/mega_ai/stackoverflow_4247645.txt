While each potential user must decide what makes the most sense for them and their organization, we just wanted to clarify what is included in a subscription. Our current subscription includes support, all big fixes, and point releases. Most importantly, it also includes access to the next major version. We have a major new release planned. Purchasing the subscription now would entitle you to that new release when it becomes available. Currently the majority of our customers buy a subscription.
