Android firing onTouch event for multiple ImageViews

I have several ImageViews, and I want the onTouch event to fire for each of them when I drag my finger across multiple images. At present the onTouch event is only firing on the first ImageView (or actually on multiple ImageViews but only when multitouching the screen). Pseudo code: for(int i=0;i Am I barking up completely the wrong tree? Thanks for any help.
