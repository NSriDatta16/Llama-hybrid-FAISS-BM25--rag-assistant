Serving video to iOS devices using the Apache/PHP server included with PostgreSQL

I am developing a system in which a server will serve a video to a device (iDevice or otherwise) and then ask the user to rate the video. I had decided to use PostgreSQL for my database, and let it install an Apache and PHP server to work against (as found here http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload ). It seems, however, that this server isn't configured quite like a typical Apache/PHP install. When an iDevice attempts to download a video from the server, the iDevice gives this error: Cannot play movieâ€”The server is not correctly configured I've done some research, and learned that iDevices require byte-range request functionality, so I checked my server's access logs and found this: xx.xx.xx.xx - - [08/Mar/2011:11:45:56 -0700] "GET temp.mp4 HTTP/1.1" 206 2 xx.xx.xx.xx - - [08/Mar/2011:11:45:56 -0700] "GET temp.mp4 HTTP/1.1" 200 17760579 (where "17760579" was the exact size in bytes of the particular file) They should look something like this: xx.xx.xx.xx - - [07/Mar/2011:18:04:11 -0700] "GET temp.mp4 HTTP/1.1" 206 2 xx.xx.xx.xx - - [07/Mar/2011:18:04:11 -0700] "GET temp.mp4 HTTP/1.1" 206 25947357 xx.xx.xx.xx - - [07/Mar/2011:18:04:11 -0700] "GET temp.mp4 HTTP/1.1" 206 60637 xx.xx.xx.xx - - [07/Mar/2011:18:04:11 -0700] "GET temp.mp4 HTTP/1.1" 206 25880928 So, I know that my server isn't dealing with some byte-range requests properly. However, using curl to check for this functionality returns a proper result: curl --range 0-99 http://url/temp.mp4 -o /dev/null % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 0 100 0 100 0 0 8574 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 10000 I've ensured that the video MIME types are properly configured. I'm not sure where to go from here. Something, somewhere, is misconfigured in this server. Update: Here are appropriate version numbers: Server version: Apache/2.2.16 (Unix) Server built: Oct 7 2010 00:26:09 PHP version 5.3.3 PostgreSQL 9.0.2 on x86_64-apple-darwin
