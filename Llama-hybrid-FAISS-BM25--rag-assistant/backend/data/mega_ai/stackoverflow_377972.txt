I doubt there will be anything more efficient. The alternative would be splitting it into parts and then concatenating, but I don't think that would be much efficient. Perhaps even less, considering that every concatenation results in a new string which has the same size as its operands. Added: This is probably the most elegant way to write this. Besides - what are you worried about? Memory usage? It's abundant and Javascript has a decent memory manager. Execution speed? Then you must have some gigantic string. IMHO this is good.
