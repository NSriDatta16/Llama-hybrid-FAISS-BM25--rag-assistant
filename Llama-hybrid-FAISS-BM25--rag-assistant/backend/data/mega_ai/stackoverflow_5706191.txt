How do I make my DIV display ontop of a Silverlight application?

I have a Silverlight application that needs Drag-And-Drop functionality because I allow the user to drag and drop files to upload into the system. However I am running into an issue where the navigation always falls behind the Silverlight application. I tried turning on "Windowless" but had to turn it off because I lost the drag-and-drop functionality ( Microsoft doesn't support it ) What do I need to do to make it so that my navigation appears on top of the silverlight application ( param name="Windowless" value="true" is not an option unless there is a way to use it with drag-and-drop)?
