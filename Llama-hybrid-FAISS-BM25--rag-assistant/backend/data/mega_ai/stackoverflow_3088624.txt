Support legacy iPhone users

Now that iPhone SDK 4.0 is available for download, and iOS 4.0 will be available for consumers shortly, does it make sense to start using the new features available in the 4.0 OS? My primary concern is that using the 4.0 features mandates that end users also update their phones/ipods to 4.0. While this process is pretty painless, is it a reasonable expect most users to update? The application itself doesn't really need anything introduced in the new OS but some of the traditional animation techniques are now "discouraged" in favor of their block-based counterparts. This is fine for me, I'd prefer to use block methods, but I'm concerned that this is a hassle for end users. So what's the general experience on this? Do you plunge ahead with the latest and greatest or stick with the current version? p.s. This assumes GM installs of the OS on end users when it is available - not beta.
