Thank you. Actually I just figured it out. We have to use what is called "artifacts settings". In artifacts settings, we can see our "projectname:war exploded" artifact. When we select that it asks us how we want the WEB-INF folder to look like..... So, right-click on project -> select module settings -> opens a new window on the "project settings" pane of new window select "artifacts" on the middle pane select "yourproject: war exploded" on the right most pane select "output layout" tab [selected by default] Under this "output layout" tab there are 2 panes Left Pane IS the existing WAR layout [Here in the left pane I selected WEB-INF\lib folder] Right pane has any AVAILABLE elements that you WANT to add to the WAR layout! [In the right pane I selected the new library and then drag-n-drop in left pane] Click "Apply" and its all set....
