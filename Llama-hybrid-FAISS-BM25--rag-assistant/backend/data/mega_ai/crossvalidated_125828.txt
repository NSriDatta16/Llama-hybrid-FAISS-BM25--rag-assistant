Intuition behind RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space}?

Why has Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) become such an important concept in machine learning in recent times? Is it because it allows us to represent a function of combination of linear functions? What areas of mathematics does one need to cover before understanding RKHS?
