I've got the same problem and I can understand your thoughts very well! After dealing with this subject and reading several books I'm also a little bit confused. But as I understand: if the whole VAR system is stationary it follows that EVERY single component is stationary. So if you test the stationary of the VAR system (by means of the determinant of inverse of |I-A|matrix as described) it will be enough and you can proceed. Currently I'm working with VAR-models, too. In my cases the VAR system is always stationary because the modulus of the eigenvalues are all less than 1. But when I look at the single time series I would think that some series are not stationary. I think, this is your problem, too... So I think one has to decide which criterion to use. Either looking at the eigenvalue-condition and proceed if all are less than one in modulus or first have a look at single time series and than put the stationary time series (after differencing / polynomial subtraction if needed) in the VAR analysis. By the way, if it helps, I found one reference which says that the single components do not necassary have to be stationary but only the vector of time series (the VAR system). This is a german reference [B. Schmitz: Einf√ºhrung in die Zeitreihenanalyse, p. 191]. But in my opinion this conflicts with the proposition that VAR system stationarity results in single component stationarity... Hoping for more arguments from others.
