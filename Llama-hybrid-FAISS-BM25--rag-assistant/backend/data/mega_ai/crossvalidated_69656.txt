Ridgeway and MacDonald (2009) suggest to use non-linear basis functions (e.g. splines) to estimate non-linear effects in the logistic regression equation in estimating the propensity score. This is amenable to including geographic terms in the equation (e.g. projected latitude and longitude coordinates). You can also include other terms in the equation that characterize the extent of the spatial matching you want to accomplish, such as neighborhoods of matching (e.g. Ridgeway and MacDonald (2009) match stops within the same police precinct using dummy variables - this would work the same for county) or distance from a particular point if that distance is predictive of selection into treatment (Chagas et al. 2011).
