Question on the Grid View tutorial “res/drawable/ “ directory

The tutoriel in question is “http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-gridview.html” The Tutorial asks that you 1- Create a new project named HelloGridView. In eclipse (OK) 2- Find some images or download the ones at “http://developer.android.com/shareables/sample_images.zip” I downloaded the .ZIP file and extracted the images (OK) 3- Save the image files into the project's res/drawable/ directory. (QUESTION!) When I expand the tree view that eclipse has created for this project, I do not see any directory labeled drawable, but instead see 3 choices (drawable-hdpi, drawable-ldpi & drawable-mdpi) HelloGridView - res - - drawable-hdpi - - drawable-ldpi - - drawable-mdpi - - layout - - values Choices/Ideas that went threw my mind a- Maker another directory under “res” called drawable? b- Just pop them into any of the three already existing directories labeled drawable-?dpi c- Since I just upgraded to the new eclipse (on 2/4/11) maybe the tutorial and eclipse are out of sync, and I should just wait a while for an updated tutorial? Comments, Ideas or Pointers to documentation or other already answered questions welcome. I did search Stack Overflow and found lots of questions on the Grid View tutorial, but none seemed to address this particular problem. -=-=-= Also – When (and since this is my 3rd attempt at the Grid View tutorial,and I'm afraid it is more likely WHEN then IF) I have more questions on this tutorial, should I post separate questions, OR just extend this question for each problem I encounter? Thanks for any help Joe
