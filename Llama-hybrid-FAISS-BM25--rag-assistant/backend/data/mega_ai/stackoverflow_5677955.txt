jQuery Draggable x,y containment relative to absolutely positioned container

I have a map that I am trying to make draggable, and am containing with x,y coordinates. The problem I'm having is that these coordinates seem to be based on window size. It works perfectly in a 1280x1024 window, but any other window size throws the containment off. I'm hesitant to use a parent container, because the image is so large (1350x1700). My code looks like this CSS: #mapcontainer { width:700px; height:500px; overflow:hidden; padding:0px; margin:-250px -350px; border:4px solid #ddd; position:absolute; top:50%; left:50%; z-index:2; } #map { position:relative; top:-400px; left:-200px; z-index:1; } #mapimg { position:relative; top:0px; left:0px; } HTML JS $(function() { $( "#map" ).draggable({containment: [-340,-1035,275,120]}); });
