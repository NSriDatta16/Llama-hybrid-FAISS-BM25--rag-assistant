C++ vs PHP performance on PCA

May I know whether C++ or PHP is more efficient on running PCA (Principal Component Analysis)? I'm developing a web based system which get uploaded image with php, and then process the image so that I can analyse the image with PCA to find out whether the image match with another image which already stored in database. But I'm wondering which language to use ( C++ or PHP or any other better alternative ) for a better performance to complete the PCA task. tq~
