Classification on rare events (~%3) and only categorical variables

I need to build a model based on about 10 independent variables, all categorical (only two of which are potentially ordinal), to predict a dichotomous output ( '1' : 3%; '0' : 97%). To overcome the problem of class imbalance I had thought about applying undersampling / oversampling technique ( undersampling seems to me the right way given the nature of the predictors, even more so to avoid overfitting). In terms of model , I thought of using a logistic regression model as a classifier, because as an output I would also get the expected probabilities (which are still something I need) and the marginal importance of each regressor (in case of a significant relationship). Being a beginner, in reality, I would not be able to identify which techniques / models / regularizations would fit my scenario well; I'm obviously willing to get my hands dirty as much as possible, but to do this I feel that I should have more arrows to shoot. In order to do so, I have some doubts: Having only categorical variables and a dichotomous target variable, I have the impression that the prediction will not detach itself much from the sample frequency of the variables; the idea to improve would therefore be to add as much randomness as possible (maybe with a Random Forest classifier ). Do you think it's the correct approach? What could be the side effects? Given the high number of records (> 100K) I do not think a procedure for reducing the dimensionality is necessary (I have always seen this as a technique for datasets that are too massive in terms of variables); however I have seen that in some cases they contribute in increasing the precision (or in any case the chosen metric), precisely for their ability to eliminate noise. Do you think that in such a scenario an MCA ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_correspondence_analysis ) could do for me? More generally, is there any model particularly suitable for such a scenario? Any other advice is greatly appreciated.
