This does seem to be possible in the version of Qt Designer 4.5.2, but it can't be done from the Signal/Slot Editor dock-widget in the main window. This is what worked for me Switch to Edit Signals/Slots mode (F4) Drag and drop from the widget which is to emit the signal, to the widget which is to receive the signal. A Configure Connection dialog appears, showing the signals for the emitting widget, and the slots for the receiving widget. Click Edit... below the slots column on the right. A Signals/Slots of ReceivingWidget dialog appears. In here its is possible to click the plus icon beneath slots to add a new slot of any name. You can then go back and connect to your new slot in the Configure Connection dialog, or indeed in the Signal/Slot Editor dockwidget back in the main window. Caveat: I'm using PyQt, and I've only tried to use slots added in this way from Python, not from C++, so your mileage may vary...
