Short answer: Yes this is possible (but it relies on a few assumptions being valid). Assumptions There is a hidden state (which we can't observe) that is influencing the Food Sales. By definition we can't know what this is but we can use our intuition and give it a name like "Ticket Sales Level" for example. Or like you said it could be "Home Team Performance". Or "Home Support Excitement". The hidden state is Markovian, i.e. its next value only depends on its current value. So we assume that just knowing how full the stadium is today will be useful for predicting how full the stadium will be next time round. At any rate, it's completely possible that there could be a HMM with (for example) 3 hidden states (Good, Neutral, Bad sales) that can predict future sales. Your HMM would tell you: "We're currently in a state of Good sales. When we're in this state we have average sales of 60,000Â±2,000. There's a 20% chance we'll switch to Neutral sales in the next game, 10% chance to switch to Bad Sales and 70% to stay in the Good Sales state." Just to reiterate we need these assumptions to hold: There is a useful hidden state. The hidden state is Markovian.
