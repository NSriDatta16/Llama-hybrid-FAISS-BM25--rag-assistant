You need the future values of the covariate to make ARIMAX (or perhaps regression with ARIMA errors â€“ see The ARIMAX model muddle by Rob J Hyndman) feasible. If you do not have these values, you may need to forecast them. This could be done separately or jointly with the dependent variable. In the latter case, a multivariate time series model such as VAR (vector autoregression) could be used.
