iPhone -- Applying MVC when the view hierarchy has a parallel structure to the model hierarchy

I have a Triangle class. Each Triangle has three edges a, b, and c, and also three angles angleA, angleB, and angleC. In addition to the size (length or angle), each datum also stores whether it was entered by the user or was calculated based on geometric relationships to other data. Corresponding to my Triangle class, I have a TriangleSidesAndAnglesView. This view has six subviews -- one for each of the angles, and one for each of the sides. The contents of the subviews depends on the information in the model class. The subviews are all of class TriangleDatumView. Information can pass both ways. For example, if the user enters something in a text field corresponding to an edge or angle, the entered value needs to be passed up to the model. I am trying to figure out how to keep everything organized. For example, should the TriangleDatumView objects contain references to the respective corresponding members in the model class? Does the TriangleSidesAndAnglesView need to keep a table of which TriangleDatumView corresponds to what model object? Should the TriangleDatumView for (say) edge b know that the name of the edge it is displaying is "b" so that it can write "b=" each time . . . or does it grab that info from the model? Nothing here is fundamentally difficult. The challenge is organizing it all in a sensible way. Thanks for any help.
