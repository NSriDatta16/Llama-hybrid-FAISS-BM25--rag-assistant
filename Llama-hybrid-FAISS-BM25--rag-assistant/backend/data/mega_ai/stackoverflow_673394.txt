where to store media files in an iPhone app

I am new to writing iPhone apps, but I have an idea for one. The only problem is that the app I want to write will require a ton of very tiny sound files. I want to organize everything in a hierarchy of folders in the app, but allow the user to add more sounds later, possibly from the music collection or something. Basically, the user needs to be able to add sound files, but the only way I see to have sound files in the app are if they are in the binary app. Is anyone familiar with setting up an iPhone app that can access sound or media files from outside the iPhone app?
