If what you're calling "current value of the fragment" is the pixel color value that was in the render target before your fragment shader runs, then no, it is not available. The main reason for that is that potentially, at the time your fragment shader runs, it is not known yet. Fragment shaders run in parallel, potentially (depending on which hardware) affecting the same pixel, and a separate block, reading from some sort of FIFO, is usually responsible to merge those together later on. That merging is called "Blending", and is not part of the programmable pipeline yet. It's fixed function, but it does have a number of different ways to combine what your fragment shader generated with the previous color value of the pixel.
