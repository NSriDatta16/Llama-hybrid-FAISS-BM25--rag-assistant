First, I'd make the application run properly and as safely as possible in that environment, with regexes if necessary. Then, I'd talk to the IT people. They need to upgrade their web package at some point and that point is already long past. PHP 4.3.2 is out and not supported any more at all (see here ). That means that if a vulnerability is detected, it's not guaranteed to get a fix (altough it's still pretty likely due to the number of hosts not having switched yet). Better do the switch now than later. It's not really clear from your description how the people in the organization use E-Mail (do they have their own mail clients? Do they use web mail) but if they use their own mail clients, the "only" issue will be moving the mailboxes to a new host. While that may take a few painful days to move all the mailboxes and redirects, and get everything running - including setting up everybody's workplace with the new data - it is not impossible to do, and will hardly add any long-term strain.
