Integrating ASP.NET MVC 2 with classic ASP

I'm in the process of moving a large classic ASP application to ASP.NET MVC 2. Questions: My question is about project organization. I would prefer to not mix the MVC code with the ASP code in the same VS project. I'd like to have an MVC WAP with areas that match the parts of the website that I'm migrating. For instance, the old site has a folder /products/default.asp..... /products/productName/default.asp etc. In the MVC WAP, I'd like to have an area called "products", which I could then, either through a rewrite, routing, or preferably through some IIS configuration, point the "products" folder on the ASP site to. In this way, I could gradually move root folders from the ASP site to the MVC application. However, if I create the MVC WAP in a virtual folder, then my routes wind up looking like http://localhost/virtualFolder/products instead of http://localhost/products Any suggestions on how to conquer this? I know that, during deployment, I could deploy the MVC WAP into the root of the ASP site, but this doesn't help with debugging.
