Android: open file in byte array representation with Intents

I'm a litte bit desperate to open a file with intent so that android can decide which application should handle this file. My Problem is that i have only the file as an Base64 representation which i decode to an byte Array Now i want to send an intent and open that file. I try to do save it in the internal storage and open the file with the uri given by getFilesDir(). Here is my Code FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput(filename, Context.MODE_WORLD_READABLE ); fos.write((byte[])result); fos.close(); uri = Uri.fromFile(new File(getFilesDir(), filename)); Intent myIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW); myIntent.setData(uri); startActivity(myIntent); Unfortunatly this doesn't work. All i got is an ActivityNotFoundException (even if i try to open a *.jpg) Thanks for any input!
