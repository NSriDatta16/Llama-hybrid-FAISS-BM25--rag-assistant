Are you upgrading to Visual Studio 2010 or are you forced to stay with 2008 (or worse)

We are on VS 2008 at the moment and it's very hard to convince management that we should move to 2010 (we have just recently upgraded to 2008...). I wonder if there are many of you with the same problem at the moment, or maybe you had a similar situation and managed to push the change in your organization somehow? I'd be happy to read some ideas of how you did it.
