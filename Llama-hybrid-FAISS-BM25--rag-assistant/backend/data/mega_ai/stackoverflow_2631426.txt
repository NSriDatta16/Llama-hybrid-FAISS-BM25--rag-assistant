This is probably more of a ServerFault question. On a basic level, you could do this by regularly querying v$session to count the number of current sessions, store that number somewhere, and average it over time. But there are already good utilities available to help with this. Look into STATSPACK . Then look at the scripts shown here to get you started. Alternatively you could install a commercial monitoring application like Spotlight on Oracle .
