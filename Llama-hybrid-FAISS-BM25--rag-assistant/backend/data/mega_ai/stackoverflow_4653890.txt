What is inelegant about the NSFileManager method is having to build up a dictionary structure, which is horribly verbose. The POSIX approach would be: #include #include const char path[] = "hardcoded/path"; /* Get the current mode. */ struct stat buf; int error = stat(path, &buf); /* check and handle error */ /* Make the file user-executable. */ mode_t mode = buf.st_mode; mode |= S_IXUSR; error = chmod(path, mode); /* check and handle error */
