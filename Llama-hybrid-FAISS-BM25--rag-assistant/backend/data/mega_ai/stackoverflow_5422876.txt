If this is a one-off thing that you just want to get done, I'd try Jason's advice of increasing the memory available to Java. You are building a very large list of objects and then looping through that list to output a String, then writing that String to a file. The list and the String are probably the reasons for your high memory usage. You could reorganise your code in a more stream-oriented way. Open your file output at the start, then write the XML for each Centroid as they are parsed. Then you wouldn't need to keep a big list of them, and you wouldn't need to hold a big String representing all the XML.
