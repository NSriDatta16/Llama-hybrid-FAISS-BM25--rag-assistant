According to the context you have provided, this is a supervised learning problem. Therefore, you are doing classification, not clustering. If I misunderstood, please update your question to say so. I would start with the simplest features, namely tokenize the unicode text of the pages, and use a dictionary to translate every new token to a number, and simply consider the existence of a token as a feature. Next, I would use the simplest algorithm I can - I tend to go with Naive Bayes, but if you have an easy way to run SVM this is also nice. Compare your results with some baseline - say assigning the most frequent class to all the pages. Is the simplest approach good enough? If not, start iterating over algorithms and features.
