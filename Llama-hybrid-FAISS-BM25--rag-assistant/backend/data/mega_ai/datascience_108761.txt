Should mini-batches contain an even mix of classes or can this be random?

I'm creating mini-batches to put into a CNN. Is it best to try and get an even mix of classes into each mini-batch (Scenario 1), or can this/should this be a random assortment of my classes (Scenario 2)? Scenario 1: I have 2 classes and a mini-batch size of 32. I should try and have 16 samples from each class in each mini-batch. Scenario 2: Same as 1, but I have a random distribution of samples in each mini-batch. So this could be 20 of one class and 12 of the other. Or even 32 of one class and none of the other on occasion.
