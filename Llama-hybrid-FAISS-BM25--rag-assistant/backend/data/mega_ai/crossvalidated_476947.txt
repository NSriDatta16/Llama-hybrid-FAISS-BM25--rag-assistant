It all depends on what you are going to do with this data afterwards. If you can explain the problem/application, it will be easier to give some recommendations. The simplest option would be to get both values to "change or unit time". In other words, you divide your overall change by the time (in required units): Region A: 300/75 = 4 mm/year Region B: 250/60 $\approx$ 4.17 mm/year. So, you can see, that Region B had a faster change in average. Please, note, that the word average here is the key. That assumes that the rate of change is constant (or the change is linear). To fit a more complex function with more than 1 parameter (e.g. polynomial), you will obviously need more points for each region (or make extra assumptions).
