I'm a .NET Programmer. What are specific uses of Python and/or Ruby for that will make me more productive?

I recall when I first read Pragmatic Programmer that they suggested using scripting languages to make you a more productive programmer. I am in a quandary putting this into practice. I want to know specific ways that using Python or Ruby can make me a more productive .NET developer. One specific way per answer, and even better if you can say whether I could use Python or Ruby or Both for it. See standard format below.
