Function to generate alpha numeric sequence number based on input number

I am trying to develope a routine in C# that will take a given input integer and return a 6 character alpha numeric string based on a predefined possible set of characters. The possible characters to use are: "0123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ" (note that the letter "I" and "O" are not in the set.) Therefore given the input of 1, the output should be "000001", input of 9 would output "000009", input of 10 would output "00000A", input of 12345 would output "000AP3", and so on. I am having a hard time coming up with an elegant solution to this problem. I know I must be approaching this the hard way so I'm looking for some help. Thanks!
