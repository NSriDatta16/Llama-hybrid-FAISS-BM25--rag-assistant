Detecting trends is similar to detecting step/level shifts insofar as a step is a difference of atrend just as a pulse is the difference of a step/level. Intervention Detection ala Tsay and others has been extended by SAS and AUTOBOX ( a piece of software that I am involved with commercially ) to emoiricallyt identify local time trends. I suggest that you contact both SAS and AUTOBOX and send them your data and have them analyse it (automatically ) and send you back the results. Maybe you can like Yogi said "learn a lot by simply watching !" Hope this helps. EDIT: Pulse outliers are often be mis-dagnosed as variance changes. They are 1 period variance changes. THe procedures I refer to are appropriate for single series not parallel series. Pure variance change can be detected by conducting a variance difference F test "before and after" some time point BUT this premises no anomilies .This optimal breakpoint can be found by a simple search procedure. The idea of detecting 4 kinds of Interventions is as follows: Pulse interventions (PI) temporarily affect the series at 1 point in time 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,…..t Step/Level interventions permanently (SLI) shift the baseline (implied intercept) of the series. e.g. 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,…..t Seasonal Pulse interventions (SPI) permanently affect the series at all subsequent seasonal points in time much like seasonal fixed effects. e.g. 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,…..t Local Time Trend (LTT) interventions permanently change the slope of the series reflecting steady state change from that point forward. e.g. 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,…..t note that LTT = STEP/(1-B) or STEP = (1-B)LTT As an example of a time series with LTT's consider an example (nob=51). Modelling 10 numbers would be more difficult. the data the plot the equation ( thus two time trends ) If i took the first 10 values this is waht was resolved . Three values were ear-marked as not being represntative.
