The answer by @PBulls is excellent, and I would just like to add a thought here: What do you need the P value for actually? The use of P values is widespread in empirical research but even experts like Statisticians, Epidemiologists or Psychometrists are bound to interpret them incorrectly (see for example the study quoted in Gigerenzer et al's "The Null Ritual" ). An extensive list of misinterpretations is collected in Greenland et al's paper , and with your sample size of 28,000 most tests will yield a "significant result" anyway, even for tiny differences. My recommendation is therefore not to bother too much with P values (short of abandoning them altogether as suggested by McShane et al ) and focus on something else instead. If you have the possibility, in communicating your results, focus on effect sizes and variability, displayed in graphs or summarized in confidence intervals, as encouraged for example by Dunkler et al. for transplantation medicine. This will hopefully lead to discussions and further insights, like "for which circumstances was response more time reduced, and for which less so?" such that the merit of current measures to reduce response times can be discussed and improvements can be suggested.
