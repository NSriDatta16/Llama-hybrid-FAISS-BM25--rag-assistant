How do I interpret the credibility interval in a Bayesian Regularized Regression?

A penalized regression provides biased estimates of the regression coefficients (bias-variance trade-off principle). Therefore, standard errors and confidence intervals are regarded as not very meaningful for those biased estimates arising from (frequentist) penalized regression method, see e.g. the discussion Estimating R-squared and statistical significance from penalized regression model . I would assume that the same problems exists in an Bayesian approach but Kyung, Gill, Ghaosh and Casella (2010) say that the Bayesian formulation produces valid standard errors. Does it mean that a 95% credibility intervals includes with 95% probability the true biased estimate and if yes, is this a useful information?
