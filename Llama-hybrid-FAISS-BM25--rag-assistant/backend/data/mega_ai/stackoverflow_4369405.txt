Most platforms will "align" and "pad" structures so that they begin and end exactly on a word boundary. This is done to improve memory performance. Assuming you are on Windows, you can set your own alignment. In your case, you want to align on single bytes, so do this: #pragma pack( push, 1 ) typedef struct zsSysVersionMsg_tag { WORD cmd; BYTE len; } zsSysVersionMsg_t; #pragma pack( pop )
