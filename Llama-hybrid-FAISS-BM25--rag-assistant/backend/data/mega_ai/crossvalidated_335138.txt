I think the key point about the coefficients, which I couldn't see in the other answers but may have missed, is that they are the values of smoothed level and smoothed trend for the last period in the time series on which the forecast was based/made; and smoothed seasonal components for the last 12 months of that time series. Understanding the table of fitted values for the forecast also helps. For each row corresponding to time t, the values of level and trend are the smoothed values for time t-1, and the value of season is the smoothed value for t-p. These are added to give the estimated true level for time t, Xhat. I have only begun to use R fairly recently, so apologies if my terminology isn't fully accurate.
