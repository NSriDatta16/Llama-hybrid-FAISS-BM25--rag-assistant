So long as the languages in question are used for scripting, I agree with other commenters that it should be left to the devteam, and different languages should be tolerated in most cases. If the language is used for your main codebase, you had better standardize on one. If some developers complain about a script not written in their language, encourage them to learn it, particularly if it's one of the widespread ones like Ruby, Perl, et al.
