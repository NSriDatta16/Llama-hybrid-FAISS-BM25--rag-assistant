How to statically assess impact of trade volume on a rate?

I have about 50,000 information about historical foreign exchange trades. For each trade I have the equivalent USD amount, the rate at which it was traded and the market rate. I am trying to understand what is the "optimal USD amount" at which we get the best rate. So I calculated the percentage difference between the traded rate and market rate. Plotting everything on a graph, USD amount on x axis, and percentage difference on y doesn't really help because there are too many points. So I thought about splitting the trades into groups and calculate the average: from 0 to 100,000 100,000 to 200,000 200,000 to 300,000 etc Then the problem I have then is that I have loads of trades in the first groups like 10,000, and just a few in the higher groups. So I am kind of feeling that this is statically wrong. So what I also tried is to split the trades in group with the same number of trades in each one, so I have group : 0 to 20,000 20,000 to 50,000 ... 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 The problem by bucketing trades like this, is that the result is greatly influenced by the choice of the buckets, that's why I don't think any of these method is 'mathematically' correct. What would be a better method to understand the impact of the amount of currency you trade on the rate you get ?
