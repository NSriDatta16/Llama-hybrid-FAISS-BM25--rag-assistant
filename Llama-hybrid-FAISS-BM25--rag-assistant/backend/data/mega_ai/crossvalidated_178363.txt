Time series correlation issue

I have time bins (every 0.5 million years) with measures of two variables (Diversity and CO2). >head(matrix) Age Diversity CO2 1 0.0 0.4971946 1.0000000 2 0.5 0.4039132 0.9982684 3 1.0 0.4062398 0.9957440 4 1.5 0.4093916 0.9950622 5 2.0 0.4128504 1.0039857 6 2.5 0.4138772 1.0311683 . .. . . >plot(matrix$Diversity ~ matrix$CO2, xlab = "CO2", ylab="Diversity") Although correlation exists >cor(matrix$Extinction_Rate,matrix$CO2) [1] -0.8303699 the resulted plot is pretty odd (temporal autocorrelation?). I was thinking that maybe resampling (bootstrap) several times each of the x,y rows of the matrix might help, but I am not sure about that. Any ideas?
