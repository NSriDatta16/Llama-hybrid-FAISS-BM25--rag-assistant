C# code for saving an entire web page? (with images/formatting)

I've been struggling to find an exmample of some C# code (I'm using C# Visual Studio 2008 Express ) that can programmatically save an entire web page (given a URL) including the images and formatting (e.g. CSS). The intention is that in a subsequent phase I'd ship this off (not sure how yet) so it could be viewed later via a browser. Is there an example of the most simple approach (leveraging the .NET Framework methods) to save an entire web page? Saving as one page with a subdirectory for images, or otherwise. Basically the same as what you get with browsers when you say "save entire web page".
