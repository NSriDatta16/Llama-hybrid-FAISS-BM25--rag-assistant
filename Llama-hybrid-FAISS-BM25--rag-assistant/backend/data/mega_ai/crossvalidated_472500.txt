Including measurement precision in a bayesian linear model

I'm using Jags to fit a Bayesian linear regression to a dataset. The model is: N[i]∼N(μ[i],τ) with precision τ and mean: μ[i]=β1*variable1[i]+β2*variable2[i] All β coefficients come from N(0,0.001). N[i] is the measurement for each sample. If I know that the instrument I used to measure samples has a SD of 0.2. Is it accurate to model this explicitly by specifying τ as 1/variance? τ=1/(0.2*0.2)
