CART vs Random Forest

Considering that individual trees in random forests use the cart algorithm(or can be configured to) , if cart fails to predict anything(empty tree) ,why should random forest perform better on the same dataset. Edit: I am using R (rpart vs randomForest) ; the data is daily financial data of a stock. CART gave empty trees but random forest achieved decent accuracy even on unseen data.
