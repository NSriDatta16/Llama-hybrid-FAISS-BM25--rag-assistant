Actually, I think the rationale here: Is there a (scientific) rationale to compute a confidence interval in a study that won't or can't be repeated exactly? Makes it more necessary that the CI is computed. If the likelihood of a replication of the study is extremely low, having a CI estimate will help others know what a plausible range of the statistical estimate is when replication is either close to impossible or completely impossible. Consider for example a study of those with a rare brain injury which only occurs to about 5 people per year. A sample of only three patients would be super informative if they are already hard to find. Say someone runs a study on the patients and finds a considerably narrow range in the CI lower/upper bounds. Because of the difficulty in running another study like it, others do not try to replicate this study. Because they have a well-informed estimate of what a plausible point value could be, they can already infer what it should be in the population. Edit I should add that one would have to be very mindful of the limitations of a single study's CIs, particularly if they are strongly built around the idiosyncrasies of that dataset, which may not extrapolate well to other datasets. A reported CI is of course better than none, particularly when the research, as highlighted above, is difficult to do. But it is important to note that a single CI has it's limitations. What may be a good alternative in this case is something like a Bayesian credible interval, which may be better if one assigns informative priors around what a population value should be. This is because you would at least be able to constrain the estimate to certain values that match what one should expect in reality.
