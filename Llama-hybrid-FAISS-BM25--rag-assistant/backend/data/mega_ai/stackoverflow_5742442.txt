Thanks in Advance: m new in iPhone development. I have used code given at the following URL. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5240111/changing-an-image-via-dragging-swiping-with-finger-in-order-to-make-a-3d-model But m getting error in the below given piece of code. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; gestureStartPoint = [touch locationInView:self.SFImage]; } Error message is: "Property 'SFImage' not found" and "Request for member 'SFImage' is something not a structure or union" Kindly help me out how to fix these errors. I m wondering may be i have missed something, but don't know what. Thanx
