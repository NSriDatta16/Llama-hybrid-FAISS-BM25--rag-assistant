Calling gawk from Python

I am trying to call gawk (the GNU implementation of AWK) from Python in this manner. import os import string import codecs ligand_file=open( "2WTKA_ab.txt", "r" ) #Open the receptor.txt file ligand_lines=ligand_file.readlines() # Read all the lines into the array ligand_lines=map( string.strip, ligand_lines ) ligand_file.close() for i in ligand_lines: os.system ( " gawk %s %s"%( "'{if ($2==""i"") print $0}'", 'unique_count_a_from_ac.txt' ) ) My problem is that "i" is not being replaced by the value it represent. The value "i" represents is an integer and not a string. How can I fix this problem?
