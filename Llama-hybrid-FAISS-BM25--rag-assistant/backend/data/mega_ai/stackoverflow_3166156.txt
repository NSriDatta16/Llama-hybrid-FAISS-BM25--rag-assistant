Just in response to some of the comments about the SCJP (sorry don't have permissions to leave comments - apologies if leaving an answer is not the right way to do this). In defence of the SCJP exam, passing object references as method parameters AND the differences between immutable String objects and StringBuffer / StringBuilder objects are part of the exam - see sections 3.1 and 7.3 here: http://www.javadeveloper.co.in/scjp/scjp-exam-objectives.html Both topics are covered quite extensively in the Kathy Sierra / Bert Bates study guide to the exam (which is the de facto official study guide to the exam).
