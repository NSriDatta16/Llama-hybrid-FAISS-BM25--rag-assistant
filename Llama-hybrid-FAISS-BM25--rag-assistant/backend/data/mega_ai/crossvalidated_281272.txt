One idea, is that you could concatenate the documents of each category in one big document containing the whole category and infer the topic distribution $\theta_{category=c} $ of this concatenated document. Bear in mind though, that your topic model maybe sensitive to the average length of the initial simple documents. That is, if it's trained on more or less same length documents, then this concatenated document will be $N$ times longer, where $N$ is the number of documents to be concatenated. Maybe, if you use tf-idf features for each document you can alleviate this./
