I'm not sure whether this is exactly what you're after, but a couple of articles I've found useful on theoretical properties of various Metropolis-Hastings algorithms are: Optimal scaling for various Metropolis-Hastings algorithms - Roberts & Rosenthal, 2001. (This summarises some earlier results for the Ransom walk Metropolis and the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm.) The Random Walk Metropolis: linking theory and practice through a case study - Sherlock, Fearnhead & Roberts, 2009 (This may be a good bridge between theoretical properties and practical use, as suggested by the title.) The book by Robert & Casella (mentioned above) is a very good and thorough resource, but you may also find these two of use: Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice - Gilks, Richardson & Spiegelhalter (1995) Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Stochastic simulation for Bayesian inference - Gamerman (2006) These both also have information on Gibbs sampling. I suppose you may also find some other information on Markov Chains useful. I generally use: Markov Chains - Norris, (1998). But there is also some good information in most MCMC books on this.
