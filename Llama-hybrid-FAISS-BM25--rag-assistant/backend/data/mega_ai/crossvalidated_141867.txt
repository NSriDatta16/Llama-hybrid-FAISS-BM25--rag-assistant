Anova Post Hoc Test

I am running an anova in SAS on the average hours worked for a country. With those countries grouped into 3 regions. When I run the anova I get a F value of 3.64 and P-value 0.0379. With these results I thought you would reject the null stating that the means for each region is the same. But when I run a post hoc test like Tukey, SNK or scheffe they tell me the means are not significantly different. Does anyone have an idea where I am going wrong?
