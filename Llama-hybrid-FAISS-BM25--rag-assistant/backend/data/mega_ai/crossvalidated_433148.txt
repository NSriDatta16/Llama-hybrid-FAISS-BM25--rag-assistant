Multi-level logistic regression - probability received from the intercept is different from the original sample

I am running multi-level logistic regression in order to perform case-mix adjustment (corrected estimates) for 100 clinics. I got some results but they are somehow suspicious to me. I noticed that received/modeled probability of the outcome variable (I calculated probability with the transformation from the logit: exp(x)/(1+exp(x)) is different from the orginal (sample) probability of a target variable. For example, sample probability of a target variable is 88.8%, meanwhile the received intercept of a multi-level logistic regression model is 2.20225 which is 90.0% after the transformation back to probability. This happens also on a unconditional model where covariates are not included. I am wondering if this is something to expect? Because if I run ordinary logistic regression, both probabilities are almost identical. Also, when I run multi-level linear regression (in case of dependent variables of interval type) the sample mean is identical to the intercept of a multi-level model. I centered all predictors (grand mean centering, weighted effect coding) but as I mentioned the situation is the same also in case of an unconditional model. I am using R and a package glmer with a code below: # Unconditional Model (Intercept-only Model) M0 I also tried to increase the nAGQ to use Gauss-Hermite approximation (for potential better accuracy) but the results are the same. Many thanks for your feedback, help, ideas.
