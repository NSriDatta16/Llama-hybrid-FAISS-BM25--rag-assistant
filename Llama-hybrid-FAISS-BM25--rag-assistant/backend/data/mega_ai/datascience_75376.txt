Help for formula for regularized logistic regression?

Can someone help me write the cost function for logistic regression in octave.These are the variables I used... X_t = [ 1.00000 0.10000 0.60000 1.10000; 1.00000 0.20000 0.70000 1.20000; 1.00000 0.30000 0.80000 1.30000; 1.00000 0.40000 0.90000 1.40000; 1.00000 0.50000 1.00000 1.50000]; y_t = [1;0;1;0;1]; lambda_t = 3; theta_t = [-2;-1;1;2]; cost = (-1/5)*sum((transpose(-y_t)*log(1./(1+e.^(X_t*theta_t))))+(transpose(1-y_t)*log(1-(1./(1+e.^(X_t*theta_t))))))+((lambda_t/(2*5))*sum(theta_t.*theta_t));` I get a cost of approx~2.2, but the aim was to get at least 2.5 for the minimum accuracy of my model. Can someone point out the mistake that I have done and help me, please?
