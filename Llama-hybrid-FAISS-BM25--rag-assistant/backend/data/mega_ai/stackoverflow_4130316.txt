How to use native sqlite in ios' webview?

I just want to develop an ios app based on webview. The offline storage must be used. I know that html5 offline storage is supported by webview. But I just want to use a native sqlite file(not the one embedded in webkit) just like other native ios app. So could anyone please give me some clues?
