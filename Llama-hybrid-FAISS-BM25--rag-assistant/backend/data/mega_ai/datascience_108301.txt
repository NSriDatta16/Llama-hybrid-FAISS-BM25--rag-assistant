I have done this before. Not with ranger. Packages that are open source, and with the appropriate license, I have changed the code for my model. The code might be in R, C, Python, Java. I have also used xgboost for this. xgboost allow you to customize the objective function. You create the gradient and the hessian based on your function. You can call xgboost from R. The example is in Python. I am not sure if they support an R customized loss function but writing one function in Python might not be hard for your team. I have not done this but you can use Tensorflow in R and write a customized loss function .
