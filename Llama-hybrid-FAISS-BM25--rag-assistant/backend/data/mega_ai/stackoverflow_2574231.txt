If you want to learn more about writing PHP extensions, those links will probably interest you : (Note that it's not quite an easy task -- but if you are required to... well ^^ ; and some would say it's not that hard ) Extension Writing Part I: Introduction to PHP and Zend Extension Writing Part II: Parameters, Arrays, and ZVALs Extension Writing Part II: Parameters, Arrays, and ZVALs [continued] Extension Writing Part III: Resources And, just for reference, as i'ts about C++ and not C : Wrapping C++ Classes in a PHP Extension And, if you are really interested by the subject, and ready to spend some money on it, you could buy the book Extending and Embedding PHP ( some pages are available as preview on Google Books too) ; It's considered as the book to read when interested on this subject (In fact, I've bought it some time ago, and, in my opinion, it is indeed an interesting read) BTW, the author of that book is also the author of the first four articles I linked to ;-)
