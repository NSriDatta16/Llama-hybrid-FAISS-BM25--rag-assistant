The reason for the error is a security restriction. You're accessing a nested iframe so you'll need to reconfigure your function to work recursively to bypass the restriction. See how you access the first level of iframes using hr = pContainer->EnumObjects(OLECONTF_EMBEDDINGS, &pEnumerator); but then use doc->getElementsByTagName(SysAllocString(L"iframe"), &iframes);' to access the nested iframes ? That's the error, you need to access the nested iframes the same as the first ones, using EnumObjects and then getting the IWebBrowser2 interface.
