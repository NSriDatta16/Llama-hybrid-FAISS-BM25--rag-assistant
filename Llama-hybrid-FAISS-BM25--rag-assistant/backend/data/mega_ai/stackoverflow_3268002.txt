Avoid getting emotionally or intellectually mired in what the "right" way to do something is. Focus instead on doing . Don't put too much value on the code you've already written, because any or all of it may need to change to support things that you want to do. IMO there's way too much energy being spent on patterns and cool techniques and all of that jazz. Just write simple code to do the thing you want to do. The level "contains" everything within it. You can start there. The level shouldn't necessarily drive everything, but everything is in the level. The player can move, but only within the confines of the level. Therefore, the player needs to query the level to see if a move direction is valid. The level isn't taking items from the player, nor is the level dealing damage. Other objects in the level are doing these things. Those other objects should be searching for the player, or maybe told of the player's proximity, and then they can do what they want directly to the player. It's ok for the level to "own" the player and for the player to have a reference to its level. This "makes sense" from an OO perspective; you stand on Planet Earth and can affect it, but it is dragging you around the universe while you're digging holes. Do Simple Things. Any time something gets complicated, figure out how to make it simple. Simple code is easier to work with and is more resistant to bugs.
