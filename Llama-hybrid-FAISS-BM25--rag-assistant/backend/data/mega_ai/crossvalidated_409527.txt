Are feature importances from tree based models directly actionable for business?

If my response variable say is "has_repurchased" [0 or 1] and I have all customer level features. Can I rank the features in order of importance from the random forest model and report them as whats most important to focus on for the business impact? Forex: store rating, time taken for delivery, total_amount_spent, gender, age, lifestyle (working, college, kids etc.) are my features. And RF tells me store rating is most important in whether a customer has_repurchased. Can I frame strategies around prioritizing campaigns that improve store rating related initiatives? OR is it that feature importance is only mathematical importance within a model but not actionable? Please eli5 as to why or why not?
