Parse HTTP:Response object

I am having some difficulties getting results from a form via Perl. I believe I have successfully found the form and submitted the value I want to the appropriate field, but am unsure of how to turn the response object into something useful (If I print it out it shows up as the following). HTTP::Request=HASH(0x895b8ac) Here is the relevant code (assume $url is correct) my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $responce = $ua->get($url); my @form = HTML::Form->parse($responce); my $chosen = $form[0]; $chosen->value('netid', $user); my $ro = $chosen->click('Search'); What can I do to make $ro useful? Thanks!
