I actually just got done with the same type of situation. My client wanted me to migrate 7 years worth of orders (just over 500,000 total orders). Truth be told I only had the budget to try a single product (it was an extension of DataFlow) and I have to say that while it did sort of import orders, it was far from complete. I tried to fix his code to make it work for me but the problem was that to import that much information took an incredibly long time (I started the process before going on vacation for a week and when I came back it was only 70% done). I looked at some other solutions but in the end I really just had to dive into the code and make my own script that lived outside of Magento to push the orders in. I spent about 5 months on and off getting this one done. There really probably is a good market for an affordable way to push orders into the system. Frankly I am surprised this kind of functionality does not already exist inside of Magento's API system.
