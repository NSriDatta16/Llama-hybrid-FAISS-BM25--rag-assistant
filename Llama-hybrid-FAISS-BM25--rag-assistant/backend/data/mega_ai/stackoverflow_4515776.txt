It is a combination of all your answers. This works for me from just about any block: //A Success Message Mage::getSingleton('checkout/session')->addSuccess("Your cart has been updated successfully!"); //A Error Message Mage::getSingleton('checkout/session')->addError("Your cart has been updated successfully!"); //A Info Message (See link below) Mage::getSingleton('checkout/session')->addNotice("This is just a FYI message..."); //These two lines are required to get it to work session_write_close(); //THIS LINE IS VERY IMPORTANT! $this->_redirect('checkout/cart'); Credit due to: http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/40324/ (Where I posted the answer) and http://www.deepcodeonline.com/blog/magento/how-to-display-error-success-and-notice-messages-in-magento/
