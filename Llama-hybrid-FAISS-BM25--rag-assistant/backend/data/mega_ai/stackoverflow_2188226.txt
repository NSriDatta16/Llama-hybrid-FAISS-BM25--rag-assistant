How do you let end users customize report columns in SSRS?

I'd like to create a report where users have the ability to choose what columns they want to see from a predetermined list. They should also have other options like applying an aggregate function for footers (average, sum...). How do I accomplish this with SSRS? (this will be a first report attempt with SSRS).
