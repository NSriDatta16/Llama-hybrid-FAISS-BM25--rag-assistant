Whenever I have less than descriptive error messages that tell me something is going on at the system level but not what , I use Sysinternals' Procmon to tell me what's going with the registry and filesystem. It's verbose, and getting the filter to show just the process of interest takes some learning, but you can export the results to Excel and skim them for suspicious-looking results. Pay particular attention to failures, of course. Give it a try and see what DLL is being searched for.
