How can I select the first day of a month in SQL?

How can one select the first day of the month of a given DateTime variable? I know it's quite easy to do using this kind of code: select CAST(CAST(YEAR(@mydate) AS VARCHAR(4)) + '/' + CAST(MONTH(@mydate) AS VARCHAR(2)) + '/01' AS DATETIME) This is not very elegant, and not very fast either. Is there a better way to do this?
