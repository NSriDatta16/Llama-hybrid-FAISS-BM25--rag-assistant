Accurate time series predications might not be possible for the data. The data appears to be non-stationary (i.e., changes distributional properties) at the vertical line. Training before that time point might not yield accurate predictions for time points after. Additionally, the yellow, blue, and red lines are extremely noisy after the vertical bar (possibly even being a random walk).
