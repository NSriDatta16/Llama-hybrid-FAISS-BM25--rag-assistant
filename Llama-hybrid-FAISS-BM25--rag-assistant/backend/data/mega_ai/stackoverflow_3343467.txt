Currently I use servletContext to remember the processed query string Do you realize that the ServletContext is shared among all users/sessions who are visiting your webapplication? Once visitor X modifies it, the changes are reflected for all other visitors . Don't you rather want to store it in the HttpSession to keep the data visitor-specific? See also: Servlet lifecycle and multithreading I want to use back button for some reason I really have a hard time in understanding your functional requirement (the some reason part). But at least, since you'd like to have the back button to work properly, you'd like to use idempotent requests here. So, where applicable, replace POST by GET. Whenever you'd like to refire a real HTTP request on the server instead of loading the page from browser's cache, you'd like to instruct the browser to not cache the pages by adding the following headers to the response: response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"); // HTTP 1.1. response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); // HTTP 1.0. response.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); // Proxies. You can do that in your controller or some Filter covering the url-pattern of interest. See also: Make sure that a webpage is not cached across all browsers Webbrowser caching tutorial
