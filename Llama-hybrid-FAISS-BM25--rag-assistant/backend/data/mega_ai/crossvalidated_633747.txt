You have a long time series (one with great many observations), so you are able to estimate the ACF and PACF very precisely. This is why your "confidence interval" (actually, critical points for testing the hypotheses that a coefficient is zero, as @whuber notes in his comment) is so narrow. You should be quite happy to have such great estimation precision! It grants you quite some confidence in choosing a model for replicating these patterns.
