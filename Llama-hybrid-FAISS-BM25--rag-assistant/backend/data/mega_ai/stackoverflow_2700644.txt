Sharing on Facebook from public kiosk -- user can't logout from FB!

I have a website that is designed to be run at a kiosk at public events. I want users to be able to share a page from this site on Facebook without leaving their Facebook session logged in. This is not a Facebook Connect site (there's no login to synchronize w/FB), all I have is a link for sharing that goes to Facebook's sharer.php: share this It allows the user to log in and posts the link fine, but then closes the window and leaves the user logged in. There is no option for logging out, so the next user that comes along and wants to share has the previous user's FB account logged in! Seems like this just changed when Facebook's UI changed recently; previously it would redirect to the user's profile page after posting, from which they could log out. How can I fix this? Any recommendations on the "right way" to allow sharing with FB from a public kiosk? EDIT: I have entered an enhancement request on bugs.developers.facebook.com ( http://bugs.developers.facebook.com/show_bug.cgi?id=9903 ) to have sharer.php auto-logout the user if a login was required. Please vote for it to get some attention from FB! My current solution is to force a logout from facebook in the window.onbeforeunload event using a hidden iframe (code below). My site is currenly only intended for the public kiosk, so this is acceptable. For sites intended for public and private use at home, this is probably too brute force and will annoy users. window.onbeforeunload = function() { if (do_fb_logout) { iframe = document.createElement("iframe"); iframe.setAttribute('width', '0px'); iframe.setAttribute('height', '0px'); iframe.setAttribute('frameborder', '0'); document.body.appendChild(iframe); doc = iframe.contentDocument; if (doc == undefined || doc == null) doc = iframe.contentWindow.document; doc.open(); doc.write(" "); doc.write(" "); doc.write(" "); doc.write(" document.getElementById('fbForm').submit(); "); doc.write(" "); doc.close(); } } I have tested this so far on Windows browsers FF 3.6, IE 7, and Chrome.
