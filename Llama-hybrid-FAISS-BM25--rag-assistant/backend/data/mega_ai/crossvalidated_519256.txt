How to mathematically prove that PCA can reduce noise?

We know $X^TX=U\Sigma U$ and reconstructed data $Y=X\tilde{U}$ for k eigenvector corresponding with k largest eigenvalue. Then how to mathematically show that PCA can reduce noise? I am thinking about using covariance of Y to prove that. That is, the covariance of reconstructed data is less than the original data. Then, the reconstructed data contains less information so the noise is reduced. But I cannot relate less covariance in data and less noise in data using mathematical language. Can anyone help?
