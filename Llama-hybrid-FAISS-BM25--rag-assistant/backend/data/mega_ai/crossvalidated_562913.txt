This is just to make the 5-level-factor approach more explicit. What you have is an empty cell: > with(my.df, table(fert_trt, fire_trt)) fire_trt fert_trt con ex re none 104 52 52 fert 0 26 78 Let's define a 5-level factor trt having levels "con", "ex.n", "re.n", "ex.f", and "re.f", and fit your model(s) with the fixed-effects part being ~ yr * trt . (Note: explicitly list the levels in factor() so they come out in the order shown rather than alphabetically.) Later in doing post hoc analyses, use emmeans::emmeans(mod, ~ trt) to study marginal means, averaged over yr , and emmeans::emtrends(mod, ~ trt, var = "yr") to estimate marginal slopes. Each yields a set of 5 estimates. Then you can use emmeans::contrast() to study key contrasts; most importantly, key.contrasts The first three of these compare the column, row, and diagonal averages of the 2x2 table where we ignore the con column, and the last compares the (1,1) cell with the others. I wouldn't worry about interpreting the regression coefficients (even though this is much simpler for this model than the 3-factor model). As long as you can estimate the effects you need, the coefficients don't need interpretation.
