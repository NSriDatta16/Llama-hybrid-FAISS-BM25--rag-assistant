Well for something to average to a specific number, they need to add up to a specific number. For instance, if you want 100 items to average to 10, the 100 items need to add up to 1000 since 1000/100 = 10. One way to do this, which isn't completely random is to generate a random number, then both subtract and add that to your average, generating two RunnerStat items. So you do something like this (note this is from my head and untested): import random avg = 10 n = random.randint(0,5) r1 = RunnerStat(miles=avg-n) r2 = RunnerStat(miles=avg+n) r1.save() r2.save() Of course fill in the other fields too. I just put the miles in the RunnerStats. The downside is that your RunnerStats must be an even number. You could write it to pass in a number and if it is odd the last one must be exactly the number you want the average to be.
