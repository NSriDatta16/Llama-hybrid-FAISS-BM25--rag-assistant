Does ROC AUC different between crossval and test set indicate overfitting or other problem?

I am training a composite model (XGBoost, Linear Regression, and RandomForest) to predict injured people probability. Well, the results of cross-validation with 5 folds. Well, I can see any problem related to overfitting since the metrics are almost equal for each fold and the test set. However, this is not true for ROC AUC, as you can see above. This same behavior happens on neat models. The question is: does this situation indicate some problem or I can use the model without major concerns? Libraries: scikit-learn and XBGoost.
