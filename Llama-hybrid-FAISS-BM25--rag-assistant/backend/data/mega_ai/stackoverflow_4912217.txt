If your markup is valid, you could parse it with the XML parser, rather than the HTML parser. Edit: Just realised this: .. There's a couple of problems here. First, the start and end tags don't match. If the opening tag is 'Â´ then it should be terminated by `. Second, using a colon in the node name has a certain meaning in XML - Namely that the first part is a namespace and the second part the node name. In this case, you should either use a tag named "organisation", or have it in an attribute. The first would probably make the most sense. So: .. If you can't change this, then you can't use an XML/HTML parser, as it isn't valid XML nor HTML.
