I highly discourage you from using PHP to do this directly. There are plenty of video manipulation tools that you can run from the command-line ( ffmpeg , for instance) that would do it far more efficiently. If you want to get somewhat fancy (and want to dramatically increase your site's responsiveness), you could pop the job into a database and have a constantly-running service do the clip extraction, updating the database with the relevant information when it's done. Just an idea, of course. There may be a module out there with PHP bindings that processes video, but you'd still have the problem of making the user wait (and occupying webserver resources) while the video is chopped up.
