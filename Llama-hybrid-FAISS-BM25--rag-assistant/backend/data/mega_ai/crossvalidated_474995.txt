Asymptotic dist of an average involving OLS coefs?

Suppose that we have iid sample of size $n$ . i.e., the random vector $(Y_{i}, X_{1i}, X_{2i}, X_{3i})$ is iid from $1,\ldots,n$ . And suppose the following relationship is true: $$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1*X_{1i} + \beta_2*X_{2i} + \beta_3*X_{1i}*X_{2i} + \epsilon_i $$ Suppose for simplicity that $X_{1i}$ and $X_{2i}$ are uniformly distributed from 0 to 1, and are correlated. Let's assume further that $\epsilon_i$ is normally distributed and independent of $X_{1i}$ and $X_{2i}$ . Let the OLS estimators be $\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_2$ . Let $Z_i$ be $$ Z_i = 1*\hat{\beta}_0 + 2*X_{1i}*\hat{\beta}_1 + 3*X_{2i}*\hat{\beta}_2 + 4*\hat{\beta}_3*X_{1i}*X_{2i} $$ How do I find the asymptotic distribution of $\bar{Z}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i$ ? I cannot apply a CLT since the $Z_i$ are correlated with each other because of the $\hat{\beta}$ . In addition to solving this particular case, any reference to theory I can study related to this would be helpful. I do not have an advanced statistical theory knowledge. I would like to derive a non-degenerate asymptotic distribution, i.e., something like $\sqrt{n}(\bar{Z} - E(Z_i))$ .
