Libpcap will let you craft complete packets (layer2 through layer 7) and send them out over the wire. As fun as that sounds, there's some caveats with it. You need to create all the appropriate headers and do all the checksumming yourself. Libnet can help with that, though. If you want to get out of the C++ programming pool, there is scapy for python. It makes it trivial to craft and transmit TCP/IP packets.
