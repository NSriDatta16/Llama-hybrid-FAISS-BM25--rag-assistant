searching data from database..?

i have a project about patient billingsystem which is a website to a organization.. and i use technologie jsp and java to develop this.... in this system i have different organizations and each organization has it's own database and i didn't maintain any central database for this system.. and in this my requirement is seraching must be done by the organization wise.. for example if we want to know the no of beds is available in each organization then it has gives the result no of beds available by organization wise.... and my thought is that save the organization static ip in my central database and then query on the database when we require.. In this also i have a doubt that.. is it possible to query on different databases on at a time...?? please give me any solution for my problem.... thanks in advance...
