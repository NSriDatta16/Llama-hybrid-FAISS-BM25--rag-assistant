How to declare a global variable in ASP.NET MVC page

I've began working with asp.net mvc very recently and I've ran into a problem. I've got an aspx page which renders a few ascx pages. What I'd like to do is declare a global var at the aspx page so it is visible to all its childs. I tried but it wasn't visible at the child pages. What could I do?
