Just replace [self btnScore_Clicked:(id)sender]; with [self btnScore_Clicked:self]; inside your -init implementation since you shouldnâ€™t list argument types when sending a message to an object. Also, in that case, the sender of the btnScore_Clicked: action is the object itself, hence the sender parameter is self . Furthermore, numberTotal = 0; is not necessary since all instance variables are zeroed out when a new instance is created.
