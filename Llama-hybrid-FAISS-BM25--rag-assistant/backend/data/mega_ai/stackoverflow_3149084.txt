There are three options: store them in the database as blobs store them in a folder external to the web application (and configurable in the application properties) and keep reference (in the db) to the subfolder+filename in the database push the items to some other storage, like a content repository, and keep reference (in the db) to the unique key of the resource This is the case not only with spring, but with any application.
