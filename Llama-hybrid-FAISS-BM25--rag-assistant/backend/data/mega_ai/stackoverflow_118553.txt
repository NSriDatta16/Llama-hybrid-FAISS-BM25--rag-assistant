So here are a few tips: We use RallyDev. We created a view of packages that our requirements live in. Large stories are labeled as epics and placed into the release backlog of the release they are intended for. Child stories are added to the epics. We have found it best to keep the stories very granular. Coarse grained stories make it difficult to realistically estimate and execute the story. So in general: Organize by the release Keep iterations between 2-4 weeks Product owners and project managers add stories to the release backlog The dev team estimates the stories based on TShirt sizes, points, etc... In Spring planning meeetings the dev team selects the work for the iteration from the release backlog. This is what we've been doing for the past 4 months and have found it to work well. Very important to keep the size of the stories small and granular. Remember the Invest and Smart acronyms for evaluating user stories, a good story should be: I - Independent N - Negotiable V - Valuable E - Estimable S - Small T - Testable Smart: S - Specific M - Measurable A - Achievable R - Relevant T - Time-boxed
