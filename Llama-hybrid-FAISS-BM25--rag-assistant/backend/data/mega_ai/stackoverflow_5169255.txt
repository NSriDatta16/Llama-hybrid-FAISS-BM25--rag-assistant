Code coverage generally makes sure you cover all your code-paths. If you have a lot of logic in your view, that is a smell. I think logic should be moved to your helpers, controllers (render a different view) or presenters, and those you can test with perfect coverage. Aside of that: theoretically it should be possible, but i would not want to encourage placing too much "intelligence" in views.
