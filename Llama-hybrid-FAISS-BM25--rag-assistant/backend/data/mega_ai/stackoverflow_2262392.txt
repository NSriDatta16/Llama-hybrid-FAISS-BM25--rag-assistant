Determine if user is on server OS

I need a way to determine if user is on server OS or is using terminal connection (remote desktop) to view the site. I need this to turn off all animations and other stuff. The best i can do is to determine os from UserAgent, but there is no difference between Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008. I can check color depth on user machine also. Is there a better way to do this?
