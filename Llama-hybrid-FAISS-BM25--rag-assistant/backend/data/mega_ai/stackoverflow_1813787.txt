If there's really quotes around the password, try to remove them: sqlConnectionString="Data Source=dbServer;User ID=stateUser;Password=thepassword" And remove the following line, it has no function for SQL session storage: stateConnectionString="tcpip=127.0.0.1:42424" And you might as well stop the state service; it's needed for out-of-process session state, not for SQL Server session state. Also, SQL Server session state requires you to run InstallSqlState.sql on the database, not aspnet_regsql.exe . It should create a new ASPState database.
