Add specific phrases from Qt framework to my application's translation files

Is there a way to add specific phrases from Qt frameworks's internal .ts files to my application's translation files? I only need to translate several phrases for QMessageBox and friends. EDIT: I also want to: Bundle the phrases inside my application's .ts file Prevent them from going obsolete after a routine lupdate There's always an alternative to subclass QMessageBox, but I'd like to try a perfectionist solution first. EDIT #2: I've solved the problem the ugly way by shipping a .qm file with my application from the Qt distribution. I'll keep this question open in case somebody comes up with a more elegant solution.
