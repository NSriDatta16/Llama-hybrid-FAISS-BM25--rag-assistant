You're trying to convert a string (represented by the char * ) into a double . This is not something you can do with a regular built in type cast in C++ as all they do is reinterpret the bit pattern that is being referenced by the pointer. Instead you have to parse the command line argument to extract a double value from the string. As mentioned, you have several options: you can use atof for the conversion, but it's hard to determine if the conversion errored because both a string that can't be converted and one representing 0.0 give you the same result As Fred Larson mentioned, you can use boost::lexical_cast . That's a pretty elegant way to handle the problem and would most likely be my preferred one You can use iostreams to do the conversion You can write the conversion code yourself (just kidding)
