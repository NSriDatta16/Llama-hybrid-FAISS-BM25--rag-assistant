The error is not within your code! The UIWebView, especially from within the simulator uses a user agent something like this: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone Simulator; U; CPU iPhone OS 4_2 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.17.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/8C134 When you call the url provided it results in the error you are seeing. It's a server side error. You can alter your user agent by using this code, put it somewhere in the startup phase of your app so it's only set once: NSDictionary *dictionnary = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:@"Safari/528.16", @"UserAgent", nil]; [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] registerDefaults:dictionnary]; [dictionnary release]; With this I was able to open your page. It looks like the site returns different markup for the iphone, so the result with the code above will show the website, which is a bit large for the small display.
