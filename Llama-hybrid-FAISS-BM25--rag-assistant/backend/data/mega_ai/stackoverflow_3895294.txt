Probably not the answer you want to hear but there are no really good solutions available for embedding Office apps/documents in WPF/Winforms anymore. DSOFramer was about the only real choice, but it's dead and the KB has been removed. A web browser control is also plagued with problems. Although not confirmed to support Access 2010, the only solution I know of for embedding Office docs these days is http://www.officeocx.com/ . It has had its share of problems too - rumor has it that it is based off of DSOFramer.
