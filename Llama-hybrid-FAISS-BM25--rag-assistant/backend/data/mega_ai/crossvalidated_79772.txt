You may be thinking: "My specification is $Y_{T+1} = Y_Te^{u_{T+1}}$. Since $u_{T+1}$ takes symmetrically positive and negative values, we have that $e^{u_{T+1}}$ can be higher or lower than unity. So $Y_{T+1}$ can be higher or lower than $Y_T$. Why then the conditional expected value is $E(Y_{T+1}|\Omega_T) \geq Y_T$?" The answer is "because exponentiation is not a symmetry-preserving transformation". While a normal rv has its probability mass allocated symmetrically around its mean/median/mode, this does not happen with its exponentiated transformation, i.e. with a log-normal random variable, which has a mean value always greater than unity. So, "on average", the one-step-ahead forecast will be above the previous value of this specific process, which is by construction a sub-martingale.
