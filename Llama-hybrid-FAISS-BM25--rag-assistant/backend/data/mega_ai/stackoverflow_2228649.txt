How to upload the default checkout procedure in magento

i am trying to fix a magento shop that another developer built. The shop is multilanguage and i see the checkout progress block at step 3. you can watch it here: http://www.ac-sw.net/ I need to return back to the original checkout process, i tryed to upload the app/design/frontend/default/default/layout/checkout.xml, and the app/design/frontend/default/default/template/checkout folder without any change. How can i return back to the default and working checkout procedure? thanks a lot!
