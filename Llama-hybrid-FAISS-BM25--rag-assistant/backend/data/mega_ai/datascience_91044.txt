If we avoid a Neural Network, You should reduce the dimensionality of images e.g. PCA [ Assuming no translational variance among images ] Can try the same for the other two datasets with 50 features Then try the ML models If that doesn't work, we may try CNN for the image data. In that scenario, we will need a mixed architecture of simple Neural Network and CNN. Check this Paper Blog on the paper
