Alternative to RF in regression

I am trying to use RF in sklearn to predict our book sales. Our data is a set of dates, unit sales, and relevant discounts. Generally speaking, we sell a lot of books around their release date and then it quickly tapers off with clear peaks around discounts. I’ve been using random forest to predict the next day change, since trying to predict the raw sales wouldn’t generalize. Does anyone have any suggestions for different methodologies?
