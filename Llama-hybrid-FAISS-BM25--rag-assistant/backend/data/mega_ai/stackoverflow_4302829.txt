This is a reasonably common approach to reduce the amount of storage occupied by reporting data - a form of it is at the core of the star-schema pattern used for data-warehouse design, in which (to simplify) measures (the financial amounts in yor scenario) are stored in fact tables, and the context-providing static data (your attribute columns) are stored in dimension tables. An extra requirement will be to maintain the FinancialAttribute table; assuming that new combinations of attributes will appear in the data in future, you will need to add them to FinancialAttribute so that they can be linked to FinancialDetail . Depending on the implementation of your current reporting process, this may be a simple change.
