Computing the frequency into which x falls into the Borel $\delta$-algebra

I'm currently trying to make sense of the papers: Clustering processes by Daniil Ryabko ( link ) Online Clustering of Processes by Azadeh Khaleghi ( link ) Both of them make use of the following metric Where $v(x,B)$ is defined in the following paragraph as follows I'm finding it difficult to understand how I would go about computing such a $V(x,B)$ from the definition given as the text is very technical. Could anyone give me an example how I could compute such a quantity? Perhaps an easy example?
