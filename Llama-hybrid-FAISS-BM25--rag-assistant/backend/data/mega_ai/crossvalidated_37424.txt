How to simulate from a Gaussian copula?

Suppose that I have two univariate marginal distributions, say $F$ and $G$, which I can simulate from. Now, construct their joint distribution using a Gaussian copula , denoted $C(F,G;\Sigma)$. All the parameters are known. Is there a non-MCMC method for simulating from this copula?
