I need to make my application height dynamic based on the size of a data grid which changes after a user does a search for specific items. Can someone help me with this. Also when im embedding in my html is there a javascript function i can call which can access applicatin height so i can set page accordingly? the javascript needs to be called from inside my html page so that i can get the dynamaic height
