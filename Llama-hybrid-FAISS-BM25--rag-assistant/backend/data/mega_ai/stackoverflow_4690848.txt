You should have a look at a framework, like symfony . Most frameworks make use of MVC and hence provide a good separation of your code. But is that so necessary to do it? Since i'm the only one who got to know what that files and what that page do? Yes, if you want to keep it maintainable in the long run. If you are not constantly working on the code, you will forget how some things work eventually and then you are happy if you have a proper separation and organization.
