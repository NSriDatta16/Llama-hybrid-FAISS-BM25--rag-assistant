Magento - block caching

In my header.phtml I have some code that lists out products in a navigation menu. The items in the menu are actually calls to Mage:: Looking the speed of my pages, this seems to slow down page load times. I have looked around the Magento forums etc and it seems that I could possibly cache these calls to Mage that are called in my header. How could I do this? Thanks
