Businessess and people are truly, completely, separate to the business ? They have nothing what so ever in common, even not "the day they were born" ? The business does not treat the both of them as "counterparties" ? What I'm trying to illustrate is that you look hard enough at the business, without the usually blindening glasses that the average IT (so-called) "professional" usually looks through, then you will very rapidly find the commonalities that you are looking for. Define a table in your database to record those commonalities (EVEN if it is nothing more than the identification), and make the addresses reference THAT table.
