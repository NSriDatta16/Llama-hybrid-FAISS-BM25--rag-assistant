It works exactly like image recognition. These filters are learned through back propagation in the CNN. On the image you show, you see that several filters are learned resulting of a convolution on the sequence of words (here 3 words per sequence). At the end of the training, these filters can detect specific interesting patterns. If you understand how CNN work for images, then you just have to know that these filters slides only on the columns of your input matrix, instead of squares in the case of images. The rest of the CNN works the same. The tricky part of CNN for text analysis resides in the embedding dimension selection and the maximum number of words of columns in the sentence matrix.
