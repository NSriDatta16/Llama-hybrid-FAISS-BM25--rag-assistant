Why is Eclipse using JUnit 3 when I have junit-4.3.1.jar in my build path?

I'm using Ganymede on Ubuntu Linux and I have junit-4.3.1.jar in my build path. I click File > New > Java > "JUnit 4 Test Case" when I create a new test, but when it's run, Eclipse appears to be using JUnit 3. I believe this is the case because it's ignoring my annotations. When I remove all test* methods, JUnit complains "No tests found". If I do the same with another test I already created, JUnit runs fine and finds my test named createTask(). So, it appears to be using JUnit 3 at times, and JUnit 4 at others. How do I force Eclipse Ganymede to use JUnit 4?
