Is there a way to make MonoTouch (runtime and associated library) a consumed and referenced library in a standard iOS project/application?

I'm liking Monotouch and would like to have an app that mixes both objective c and Monotouch. I've seen examples of MonoTouch apps that reference and consume static iOS libs, but is the opposite possible? i.e. Is it possible to have an iOS Xcode project that runs the MonoTouch runtime and consumes a MonoTouch compiled library? I have a MonoTouch license, and I'd love to do this so I can start embedding code MonoTouch code in new projects I work on that are conventional objective-c apps. Does anyone have any examples or tutorials about how to do this? Any help is greatly appreciated.
