I see two or three possibilities. On the one hand, you can fit a model on the most granular time unit you will encounter, e.g., for days. Then you can aggregate forecasts up to any desired time unit. On the other hand, as you write, you could fit separate models to each time granularity. Finally, if you are interested in expectation forecasts, then these should "add up" across time buckets: the sum of seven daily forecasts should be equal to the weekly forecast. You can leverage this by running models on each separate time granularity (whose forecasts will not be coherent), then post-processing the forecasts. This is the MAPA algorithm proposed by Kourentzes et al. (2014) . compositional-data refers to compositional targets . I don't see how your targets are compositional, but if they are, this earlier thread may be helpful.
