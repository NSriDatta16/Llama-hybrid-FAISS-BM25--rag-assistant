Instead of embedding browserfield, you may be better off creating a seamless (i.e. browserless) user experience by simply letting the mobile app do all the necessary handshaking with netflix. You'll need to set up a public domain server as your callback host for OAuth and have that negotiate your new session key/secret key and pass it back to your device. All the while, the device will need to maintain an open http connection to your public server in order to finally receive the credentials and proceed to request the user data directly from netflix. The whole round trip should not take more than roughly 15 seconds so HTTP timeouts should not be an issue. You'll need to first study(i.e. "screen scrape") the netflix login html page to extract the necessary/relevant html form param names etc. Good luck.
