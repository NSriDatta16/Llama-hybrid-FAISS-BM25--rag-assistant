Interpreting Regression Results with Ratio Independent Variable

I am running a simple regression as part of an exploratory data analysis with my dataset, where my outcome is the number of children that an individual has and my primary X is the average change in their wages throughout their career. The current form of average change in wages is a decimal number (i.e. .10 if average wage is 10%, .03 if 3% etc...) I essentially would like to see if wage growth/decline throughout one's career is correlated with the number of children they have. However, I was wondering if I should use log-transformations to standardize my Y and X variables as it does not seem intuitive to interpret the results with my independent variable being a ratio or decimal number, while my is an integer. A simple regression for a random sample of 1000 individuals out of 80K in the overall sample shows the following, and that's why I was not sure how to interpret the findings clearly: Standard errors: OLS ------------------------------------------------------- Est. S.E. t val. p ------------------------- ------ ------ -------- ------ (Intercept) 5.57 0.26 21.68 0.00 average_growth_rate 0.00 0.00 Inf 0.00 -------------------------------------------------------
