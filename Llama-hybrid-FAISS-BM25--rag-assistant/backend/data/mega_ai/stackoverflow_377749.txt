Assuming that you use Windows Mobile (5.0 or 6.x) you could use that syntax to create a file as a shourtcut(*,lnk): SHORTCUT = XX#"\Program Path..."?\Icon File Path...,-Icon Number Where: XX = Count of characters to be included in arguments after the Program Path to process. Program Path = Target exe file location. Icon File Path = If exe file does not contain an icon image or you want to use another, this is the location of the file containing the icon image. Icon number = Index of icon image within the file, it starts with 0. Ex: 86#"\Storage Card\Logical Sky CEdit\cedit.exe"?\Storage Card\Logical Sky CEdit\cedit.exe,-101 I had test it, and works fine.
