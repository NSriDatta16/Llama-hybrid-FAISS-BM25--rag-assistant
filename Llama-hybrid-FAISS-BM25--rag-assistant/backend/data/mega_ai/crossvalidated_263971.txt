LASSO is not really a treatment for collinearity; it is a method of variable selection and model building. PCA does help with collinearity and does other things besides - it is a dimension reduction technique. The proper treatment of collinearity depends on your goals. It could be ridge regression, PCA, dropping variables on substantive grounds, getting more data, elastic net or perhaps some other methods that I am forgetting.
