Note: Option 1 was supposed to address the OP's original question. Indeed, this is similar to Ben's answer (to the original question). Later the OP updated his question by asking something slightly different. Therefore, Option 2 is my answer to this updated question. Option 1. If you want to make comparisons in terms of weight , you can plot side-by-side distributions split by a given condition. Here, I am summarising the distributions using boxplots via the ggplot2 package of R ; an alternative could be to use violins, as Ben suggests in his answer. If you want to compare the presence vs absence of asthma , for each type of gender, you could do my_data $asthma asthma) ## males and females in separate panels ggplot(my_data, aes(col=asthma, x=asthma, y=Weight))+ geom_boxplot()+ facet_wrap(~gender) If, on the other hand, you wish to compare gender, for each condition of asthma , then you can do # asthma 0 and asthma 1 in separate panels ggplot(my_data, aes(col = gender, x=gender, y=Weight))+ geom_boxplot()+ facet_wrap(~asthma) To obtain violins instead of boxplots in the above code just replace geom_boxplot() with geom_density() . Option 2 (updated question) The idea is to compute a $2 \times 2$ frequency table for asthma vs gender for individuals having weight less than or equal to a given value. By varying this weight value, one obtains a series of $2\times 2$ frequency tables, which can then be plotted by, e.g. a barplot. The R code below shows how to perform these calculations and how to plot the results. Again, depending on the emphasis one can split the windows by gender or by asthma condition. I'm choosing 20 equally-distant weight values but you can change it at your will. my_data $asthma asthma, labels = c("no", "yes")) # the number of weight values, e.g. the number of bars (see below) n $Weight)[1], to= range(my_data$ Weight)[2], length.out=n) hist(my_data$Weight) points(weight_cuts, y=rep(0,n), pch=20) # computes the distribution of asthma conditionally for unit # with weight weight_thersh or lower. wcond_table $gender = factor(c(rep("female", 20), rep("male", 20), rep("female", 20), rep("male", 20))) dd_long$ asthma = factor(c(rep("noasthma", 40), rep("asthma", 40))) Now, for the plots, if you want a window for every kind of gender, that is if you want to compare asthma vs non-asthma within a given gender you may consider this ggplot(dd_long, aes(y = counts, x = weight, fill = asthma))+ geom_bar(stat = "identity")+ facet_wrap(~gender) On the other hand, if you want to compare gender for a given condition of asthma, then you may consider this. ggplot(dd_long, aes(y = counts, x = weight, fill = gender))+ geom_bar(stat = "identity")+ facet_wrap(~asthma) As per my last comment, if you want to leverage yourself from binning the weight, you'll have to use a logistic regression or a GAM as suggested in another answer. But, since this is an exploratory data analysis, I do not see any issue with what you call p-hacking and in my opinion, "hand-made" calculations give precious insight into the data.
