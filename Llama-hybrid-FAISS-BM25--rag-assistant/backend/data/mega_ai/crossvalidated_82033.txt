(1) Your approach is correct; (2) Use the same mean value and standard deviation of training data to scale your test data before PCA implementation; (3) The same as (2). The general approach for the weight updates is the same between online and offline learning. The only difference is that ofï¬‚ine learning will sum the error over all inputs (batch gradient descent), while the online learning will compute the error for each input once at a time (stochastic gradient descent). But both should use the same scaling method.
