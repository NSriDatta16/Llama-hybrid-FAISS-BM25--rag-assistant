Learning materials about Time Series Forecasting?

I am a beginner in Time Series Forecasting meaning I have created some simple forecasting models and used them and I am also familiar with Stats and Probability but not that good just some basic concepts. I don't know the fundamentals of how they work and the maths behind them and their concepts. I am not that good at maths but I can learn if I will get a roadmap or some advice. Note: I only know python not R. So, please only recommend courses, books, and articles which use python. Thanks
