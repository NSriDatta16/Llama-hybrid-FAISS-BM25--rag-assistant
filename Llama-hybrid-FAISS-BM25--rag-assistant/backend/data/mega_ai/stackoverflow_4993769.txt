I am not absolutely sure that it's the same issue, but as far as I remember this used to happen a lot when you do AJAX loads of page fragments. Then you don't get anything more useful than this message. However if you try to load the address of the AJAX request itself in your browser (replacing post parameters with get parameters if needed), you will get a "normal" debug page.
