Analytic (inverse sampling variance) weight in stata

I have a question about using aweight in regression in Stata. I have school level data (mostly percentages) but I want also to take school size into consideration. According to Stata manual: aweights, or analytic weights, are weights that are inversely proportional to the variance of an observation; that is the variance of the $j$th observation is assumed to be $\sigma ^2/w_j$, where $w_j$ are the weights. Typically, the observation represents averages and the weights are the number of elements that gave rise to the average. Since my data are school averages, it seems to be the most fitting way to incorporate school size into the regression. But someone points out if I want to use school size I could just include it in the regression. Could someone help explain what is the difference, using weights or include them in the specification, and when aweights should be used?
