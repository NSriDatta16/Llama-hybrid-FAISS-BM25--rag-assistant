You need to learn about Virtual Memory . Yes, it's likely that if an OS does not have Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) that all programs will have their stack at the same VIRTUAL address. but that doesn't mean the OS has to move the previous program's stack just to context switch to another program, because via virtual memory it just needs to make sure the two programs have the same base VIRTUAL address, but each virtual address can have a different PHYSICAL location. (this is whole paragraph is entirely dependent on the OS), As to your second question, execve replaces the current running program with the program to be executed, this includes replacing the current text/data segments as well as the stack, so the program executed will not see the previous program's stack.
