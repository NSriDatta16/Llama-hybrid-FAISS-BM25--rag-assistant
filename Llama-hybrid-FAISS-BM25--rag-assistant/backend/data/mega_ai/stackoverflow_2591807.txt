That's probably a security issue. If you're running the bulk insert from a SQL Server job, make sure the user account of the SQL Server Agent service has rights to open the file. If you're running the query from a regular connection, SQL Server will impersonate you and then try to read the file. However, by default, SQL Server is not allowed to act as someone else.
