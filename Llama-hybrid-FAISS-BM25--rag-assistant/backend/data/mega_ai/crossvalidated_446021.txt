Please read https://autobox.com/pdfs/regvsbox-old.pdf to get an idea of causal analysis in time series. Essentially one pre-whitens the data in order to be able to use standard methodologies to IDENTIFY a possible model. http://www.math.cts.nthu.edu.tw/download.php?filename=569_fe0ff1a2.pdf&dir=publish&title=Ruey+S.+Tsay-Lec1 will also be of some help. If you post your data in a csv vile I will try and help further. EDIT AFTER RECEIPT OF DATA: I took 62 quarterly values fro the Y variable (freq) and the X variable INDEX into AUTOBOX , a piece of software that I have helped to develop, It treats the problem in an holistic manner incorporating differencing when necessary , error variance components to stabilize the model's residual variance , outliers/pulses/season pulses as needed. Sometimes software has features that are unneeded for a particular problem ... sometimes (this case) the data requires a sequence of complex modelling steps that are non-trivial. Your particular data set is non-trivial There is an R version of AUTOBOX . Here is the plot of the two series visually suggesting some linkage. Mode identification required using a filter on both Y and X of the following form yielding cross-correlations that can be interpreted to suggest the form of the Transfer Function model. Here is the first iteration . The residuals from this model suggested possible improvements incorporating an ar(1) augmentation and 2 seasonal pulses suggesting latent deterministic seasonal. An examination of the model's residuals suggested a deterministic change point in the model's error variance using the TSAY test for constant error variance here [ ] . While it is true that the model error variance is larger at higher levels of Y (suggesting the need for a log transform of Y), it is more trueer that the model's error variance changed/increased deterministically between time region 1-26 versus time region 27-64 4 . This is visually obvious when one looks at a plot of Y by itself The final model is here with acf/pacf of the model's residuals here The forecast for Y depends on forecasts for X which are shown here based upon the AROMA model for X leading to a forecast table for Y and an accompanying graph The Actual/Fit and Forecast graph is here
