Collection with multiple values in key

I'm looking for a Collection type data structure to implement the following. Say I have a class like this: class Person() { String homeTown; // key String sex; // key String eyeColour; // key String name; long height; // other stuff.... } I am processing multiple Person objects. I want to organise them into sets whereby each set contains Person objects with the same homeTown, sex and eyeColour. At the moment I am implementing something like this: Map > = new HashMap >; where the key is a concatanation of the homeTown, sex and eyeColour. This works but seems a bit untidy - can anyone suggest a more elegant solution or a better data structure to use, thanks?
