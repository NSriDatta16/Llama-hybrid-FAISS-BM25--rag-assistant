@weichsel's answer is accepted as it solves this for most normal people ;), but I switch this setting often enough that getting the template-generated files with the statically-defined company name is still a bit of an annoyance each time I start a new project. Having to do the "Get Info then type the name" dance also takes up too much time if you do it often enough. Here's my ultimate solution: Create a folder like "Set Company" with my shell scripts in it for each company I use Each script contains a version of this terminal command specific to each company: defaults write com.apple.Xcode PBXCustomTemplateMacroDefinitions '{"ORGANIZATIONNAME" = "My Company";}' I make each script executable so that I can simply double-click in Finder to set my current company. This page helped me set this up. Basically, you just Rename each .sh script file to .command Set the permissions of each script to be executable. I couldn't figure out how to do this in Finder, but in terminal it's simply chmod +x mycompany.command Easy as that. Now to start a new project I simply double-click whichever company I plan to use then I'm off to coding. Hope this helps someone else.
