The correct way to compare coefficients on the same scale is to rescale the predictors themselves . A common transformation is to turn continuous predictors into Z-scores by subtracting the sample mean and dividing by the sample standard deviation. (Gelman[1] recommends two standard deviations ) This will change the values of the coefficients, because they are now measured in "standard deviations" rather than "units" of each input. But this is in fact your goal: since they coefficients are all measured on the same scale, they will all be directly comparable. This will not change the predictions because the predictors enter into logistic regression linearly. [1]: Gelman, A. (2008), Scaling regression inputs by dividing by two standard deviations.
