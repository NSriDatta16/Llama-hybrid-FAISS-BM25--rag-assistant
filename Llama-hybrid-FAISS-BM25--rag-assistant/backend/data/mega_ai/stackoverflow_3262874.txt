Trained Spam Machine Learning Classifier/Model

I have a list of sentences about 17 million. I need to identify sentence as spam/ham/unsure. Are there trained models present on the internet to which I could just feed in my data as a "test" set and the system would classify my sentence as spam/ham ? Note : The sentences aren't e-mails.
