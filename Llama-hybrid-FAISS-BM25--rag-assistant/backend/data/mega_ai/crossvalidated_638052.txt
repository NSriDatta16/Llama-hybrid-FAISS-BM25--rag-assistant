nlags in kpss does not take a slice (window) of the time series. Instead, it specifies the autocorrelation structure for the estimation of the covariance matrix in the test. See this for details. If you want to test for presence of a unit root in a slice (window) of the time series, do the slicing beforehand and then supply the result to the kpss function. Regarding nlags in kpss , keep it as nlags='auto' unless you have some additional information about the autocorrelation structure.
