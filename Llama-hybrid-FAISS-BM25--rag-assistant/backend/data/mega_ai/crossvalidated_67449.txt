I work in the credit scoring field. Even though I like exploring different approaches I find that logistic regression is often good enough if not the best approach. I have not surveyed the most recent papers on the topic but from memory in most papers you will see that other approaches such as neural nets model typically do not offer significant lift in terms of predictive power (as measured by GINI and AR). Also these models tend to be much harder to make sense of to a layman (often the most seniors executives do not have backgrounds in statistics), and the scorecard approach using logistic regression seems to offer the easiest to explain models. True, most scorecards don't take into account interactions, but again there is no study in the literature that can clearly demonstrate that incorporating interactions consistently and significant increase predictive power. Having said that, there has been recently some interests in building scorecards using survival analysis techniques as it holds a few advantages over logistic regression. Namely, we can more easily incorporate macro economic factors into the model, we can use more recent data in the model build instead of having to rely on data at least 12 months ago (as the binary indicator in logistics is usually defined as defaulted within the next 12 months). In that regard my thesis could offer another perspective in that it explores building credit scorecards using survival analysis. I showed how survival analysis scorecards "look and feel" the same as logistic regression scorecards, hence they can be introduced without causing too much trouble. In my thesis I also described the ABBA algorithm which is a novel approach to binning variables. https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fftpmirror.your.org%2Fpub%2Fwikimedia%2Fimages%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2F2%2F2f%2FAbout_Time_-_Building_Credit_Scorecards_with_Survival_Analysis.pdf&ei=8D8MUorrJs2Trgf56YCwCQ&usg=AFQjCNGxWRH1naJS4UqH_ckwzTx3GsaP8g&sig2=kcEvjUUcn_wT93igxpYYDA&bvm=bv.50768961,d.bmk Update: I make no claim to whether my thesis is any good. It's just another perspective from a practitioner in the field.
