Strange, it should 'remember' it is custom MDX and open it in custom MDX mode, so you see the written query as opposed to the drag&drop query designer. I have had something like this happen before, it turned out to be down to a problem with either source control, or some small (Manual) change to the RDL's code - We ended up reverting to an earlier version and all was well. Any of these apply? Have you tried creating a new report, giving it custom MDX, then reopening it? Do it as a new project, without source control, and it should be fine.
