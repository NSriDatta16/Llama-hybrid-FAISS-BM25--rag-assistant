Adding predictor variables and/ or systematic judgement to time series forecasts

I have a ways to go with my forecasting general education --- but I'm doing a seasonal time-series forecast for predicting sales order volumes. It's mostly software sales, which does have a seasonality and clear trends. I initially have run triple exponential/ Holt-Winters model, which seems to be alright. Thing is -- I'd like to incorporate sales events in the pipeline (new clients on the horizon, possible future promotions) -- as well as perhaps a way to systematically incorporate a judgement variable -- aka forecasts from the sales director, or other experts. For example - say we forecast we will do 1000 orders in January. However, sales is talking to a client that has signed on and estimates 200 orders a month. That can probably just be added, perhaps? But sales is also talking to a client that does 500 orders a month, however, the deal is uncertain. And there are 4-5 of these deals on the horizon. As a rough prediction, would I ask sales a probability of closing the deal? That might be biased or completely made up. Do I assign rough probabilities based on the stage of the deal? Obviously, accuracy will not be high. To be honest, these new deals probably will account for 10% of the forecast in a year. Predicting them will be a bear, but including them would be far more accurate than a model that ignores them. Also, I've done a lot of reading where a statistical model + judgement outperforms a statistical model or expert judgement by itself. Is there any systematic way to do this? Even forgetting the judgment forecast for now, how do I add regression variables to a time series? I've vaguely heard of something called an ARMAX, but I'm not sure if that's the right direction.
