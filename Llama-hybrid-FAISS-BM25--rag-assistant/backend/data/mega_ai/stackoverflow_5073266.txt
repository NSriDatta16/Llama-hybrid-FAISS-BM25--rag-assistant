Let's first indent your code: def average(l): for i in range(len(l)): # Line 1 for j in range(len(l[0])): # Line 2 l[i] / l[j] # Line 3 return l l is a list of lists like [[46, 27, 68], [26, 65, 80]] At Line 1, i will be your items of outer list which are lists themselves [46,27,68] At Line 2, j will be elements of your first list only. At Line 4, you index a list with another list and it throws an error! Few notes. You don't have to iterate using len and range. Just iterator over the elements for element in mylist: pass Use builtin such as sum to calculate the sums (Btw, you are not doing that and averages would require it). And the logic is calculate the average of the inner elements first and then move to the outer list (if you want it).
