There are tables which provide factors out to subgroups of 25 for most Shewhart charts. There are also equations available for the various factors, but for subgroups of 1440, the calculations for the factors may simply not be worth it. For example, the equations for two of the factors are presented in this answer . If a Range chart with averages over several hours works best, then randomly sample 15–25 units out of the 1440 available and construct an $\bar{x}-R$ chart with these samples. You may even find random samples of 15–25 units may be acceptable on an hourly basis. Not every data point that is produced needs to be calculated. "If the $\bar{x}$ chart is being used to detect moderate-to-large process shifts, say on the order of $2\sigma$ or larger, then relatively small sample size $n=4, 5,$ or $6$ are reasonably effective. On the other hand, if we are trying to detect small shifts, then larger sample sizes of possibly $n=15$ to $n=25$ are needed."—D.C. Montgomery, Introduction to Statistical Quality Control Based upon the need, samples are selected at random or at regular intervals and grouped over the desired amount of time. Control limits are then calculated in the normal way based upon the sampled data. The other thing to consider is your data type or if changing data types can prove more useful. For example, $c$ charts or $p$ charts may have the limits you need, and subgrouped into attribute data counts or percentages of 1440 could be entirely appropriate.
