Build one model including the class variable as a categorical feature. Since it is a high cardinality feature, there are different techniques that you can use: One hot encoding (would create around 300 variables based on different classes) Label encoding (would be a single variable but will assign weights to different classes - not ideal) Hashing trick - use a hashing function to reduce the number of features Embeddings Cluster the different classes together
