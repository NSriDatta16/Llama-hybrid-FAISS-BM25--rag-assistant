Not a direct answer but some pointers to very interesting and somehow similar questions (yeah, they are about blobs and images but this is IMO comparable). What are the downsides of storing files as BLOBs in MySQL? Storing Images in DB - Yea or Nay? Images in database vs file system https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=images+database+filesystem Do the same problems exist with NoSQL systems like Cassandra? NoSQL for filesystem storage organization and replication? Storing images in NoSQL stores PS: I don't want to be the killjoy but I don't think that any NoSQL solution is going to solve your problem (NoSQL is just irrelevant for most businesses).
