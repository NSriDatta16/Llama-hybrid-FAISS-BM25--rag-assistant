If you are talking about data weights, I dont know. In fact I am not sure that any of the standard SVM implementations have data weights (each data point has a weight). If you are talking about CLASS weight, at least in the libSVM implementation, they are multiplicative terms -wi weight: set the parameter C of class i to weight*C, for C-SVC (default 1) (from the libSVM page http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ ) so there is no gain in scaling them.
