Variance of ratio of a time series of random numbers

Say we have a time series( $X_0, X_1, ..., X_n$ ) with only the first element $X_0$ known, rest being random. How can we express: $$ {\rm var} \frac{X_n}{X_0} = f({\rm var} \frac{X_i}{X_{i-1}})$$ Don't know how to proceed beyond writing the left side as $$\frac{X_n}{X_0} = \prod\frac{X_i}{X_{i-1}} $$ Intuitively, the left side has to be equal to sum of variance of consecutive terms plus some covariance terms but not sure how to get that. Thanks for helping!
