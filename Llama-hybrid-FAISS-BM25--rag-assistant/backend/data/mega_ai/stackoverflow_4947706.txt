Android: Reading specific nodes from XML without parsing entire document

I'm feeling kind of dumb here. I am storing sets of data that are always organized at a top level by Chapter > Scene > Dialogue. Dialogue always has several attributes and sometimes has additional data that is also always stored in an organized hierarchy (Sets of conditions, or sets of choices, each with attributes of their own to be read). Imagine a choose-your-own-adventure book and all of its rules being stored in an XML document. This seemed like the best way to store it, I'd welcome a contradiction. I will always start on Chapter 1, Scene 1, Dialogue 1. Each dialogue, either through attributes or conditions, will always direct me to a single new node, for example, Chapter 3, Scene 2, Dialogue 8. I will never have to parse the entire document looking for chapter, scene, or dialogue tags. However, I do want to parse the given Dialogue node to look at its included sets of conditions or choices. I can not for the life of me find how to specify, in Android, the equivalent of: XMLResourceParser parser = getResources().getXml((R.xml.script).getChild[CHAPTER][SCENE][DIALOGUE]); And while I could parse the entire document every time and iterate off to match my indexes and know where I am, that seems completely uncalled for. Any thoughts? Everywhere I look people are looking for solutions to problems that require reading the entire document and the answer is always on how to use the parser.
