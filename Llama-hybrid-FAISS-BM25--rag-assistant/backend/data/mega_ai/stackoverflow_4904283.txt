What is the best way to manage add-on products in Magento?

I have an Magento-based ecommerce store and I want to have product add-ons (e.g. chocolates) that customers can add to their orders. Add-on products should not be visible in the regular catalog. My products either will have add-on products or not (i.e. I'm not doing different combinations of add-ons for different customers) If I add a new add-on product, it should show on every product that has add-ons enabled What is the best way in Magento to create add-on products? Are there any modules that will work well for this.
