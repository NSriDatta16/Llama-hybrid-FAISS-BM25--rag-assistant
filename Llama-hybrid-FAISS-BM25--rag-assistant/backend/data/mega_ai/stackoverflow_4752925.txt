I would say take a look at this post http://sqlblog.com/blogs/andy_leonard/archive/2008/07/15/installing-sql-server-2008-rc0.aspx and pay attention to this...notice the add current user and add... options?? Also notice mixed mode...it is all there You can also change the account after the fact in the service itself
