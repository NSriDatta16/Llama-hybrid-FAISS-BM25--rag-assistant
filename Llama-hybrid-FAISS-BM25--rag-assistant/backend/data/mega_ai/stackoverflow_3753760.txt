I would strongly recommend using a 3rd-party API like the Google Geocoding API to take such input and parse it into a location with discrete parts (street address, city, state, country, etc.) Then you could use those discrete parts to search your database if necessary. Map services like Google and Bing have solved this problem way better than you or I ever would, so why not leverage all the work they've done?
