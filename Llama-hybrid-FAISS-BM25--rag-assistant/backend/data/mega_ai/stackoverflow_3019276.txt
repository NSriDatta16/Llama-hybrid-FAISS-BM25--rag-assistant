Hibernate (JPA) Entity with Static collection as a member

Is it possible to have a static collection as a member of a hibernate entity? Say I have an object Question: public class Question { private String category; ... } Would it be possible to populate a static Set that is a distinct set of all categories in the Database? I know I could just query this, but I was wondering if there was a more elegant solution, as it seems like something that other people may have come across.
