ssh & script problem

I am having a strange problem while doing ssh . I am not sure where the term Unmatched ` is coming from. What I need to do is run script that logs information of what I am doing on the terminal to text file. After ssh - Sun Microsystems Inc. SunOS 5.8 Generic Patch October 2001 This is /etc/motd, last updated 3 Feb 2003.

ATTENTION: Unsecure Telnet and FTP will be turned off soon. Please make arrange to use ssh or sftp. Putty(telnet) and WinSCP(ftp) would be a good replacement. Unmatched ` d13.ucs.louisiana.edu% bash bash-2.04$ script -a myInformation.txt Script started, file is myInformation.txt Unmatched ` d13.ucs.louisiana.edu% When I tried to start the script with name myInformation.txt , you can see the message I am getting - Script started, file is myInformation.txt . But again I am getting that message Unmatched ` and is coming out of bash , as you can notice. What is the problem ? Any insights suggested would be very great. Note: file with name myInformation.txt is being created but nothing goes in to it. As I have even tried running certain commands like ls and then exited the script with ctrl+d . But when I open the file, nothing is there. .cshrc `# @(#)cshrc 1.11 89/11/29 SMI if ( `uname -s` == "Linux") then # /etc/csh.{cshrc,login} set the csh and tcsh environments for Linux # We just modify a few here: set history=20 savehist=20 exit 0 endif umask 027 # add here additional directories set lpath = () set path = (~ ~/bin $lpath /usr/local/bin /usr/ccs/bin /usr/dt/bin /usr/openwin/bin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/ucb .) unset lpath set noclobber # Comment out the next line if you WANT core dumps (to debug via dbx,adb,gdb...) limit coredumpsize 0 # An alternative to the above is to symlink ~/core to /dev/null .... # Note that a core file can put you over quota, necessitating a command-line # login [pick from the CDE Options menu] to be able to remove it. if ( $?prompt == 0) exit # Put here cmds suitable just for interactive c-shells set history=20 savehist=20 time=10 autologout=28800 #set ignoreeof set filec set notify #alias ls 'ls -F' alias mail mailx alias nissql /pkgs2/mysql/bin/mysql -h calvados.ucs.louisiana.edu -u cs4601d -p cs4601_d .login # @(#)local.login 1.5 98/10/03 SMI if (`uname -s` == "Linux") then exit 0 endif if (! $?DT ) then # Insert HERE and commands that are interactive, or alter the terminal # characteristics.
