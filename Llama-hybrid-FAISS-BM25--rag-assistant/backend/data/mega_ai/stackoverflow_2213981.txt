EC2 - possible to run Windows on an EC2 Linux instance?

If you are handling all your own licensing(working under a BizSpark license), is it possible run Windows on an EC2 instance marked for Linux/Unix? I am considering migrating a dedicated server I have to EC2 but was not able to find guidance on this. I have been told that you get complete control over the instance to install whatever you like, but wanted to know if anyone else has tried this. Thanks for the info! Update: Replacing a dedicated virtual with 512MB memory and 10GB storage. Hosting mostly one-off sites and blog or three.
