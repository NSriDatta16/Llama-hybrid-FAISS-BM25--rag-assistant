How can I debug applications under Java Web Start (JNLP)?

I know how I can debug a remote Java VM with Eclipse, but how can I do it with a Java Web Start program. I have a problem that only occurs in Java Web Start. It must be security related. I need a solution that will work with a current Java VM like 1.6.0_12.
