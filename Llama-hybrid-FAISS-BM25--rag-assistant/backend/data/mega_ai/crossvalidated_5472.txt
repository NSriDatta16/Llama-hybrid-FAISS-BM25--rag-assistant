Standard Q where I work is along the lines of: Have a look at this output of a multiple logistic regression from a statistical package you claim to have used (preferably one we use too). XXX is the independent variable of principal interest. How woud you interpret the results for a colleague with knowledge of the subject matter but no formal statistical training? (If necessary prompt for separate interpretation of point estimate, CI, p-value).
