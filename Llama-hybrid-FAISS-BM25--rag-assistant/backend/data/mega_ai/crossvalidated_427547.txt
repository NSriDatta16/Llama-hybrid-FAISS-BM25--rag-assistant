jointModelBayes output

Consider the following example from a workshop by Dimitris Rizopoulos workshop . We have the following joint model: \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} y_i(t) &= m_i(t) + \epsilon_i(t) \\ &= \beta_0 + \beta_1t + \beta_2(t \times \text{ddI}_i) + b_{i0} + b_{i1}t + \epsilon_i(t), \hspace{1cm} \epsilon_i(t) \sim N(0, \sigma^2) \\ \\ h_i(t)& = h_0(t)\exp(\gamma \text{ddI}_i + \alpha m_i(t)). \end{aligned} \end{equation} Here $b = (b_0, b_1)' \sim N(0, D)$ , and \begin{equation} log(h_0(t)) = \gamma_{h_0,0} + \sum_{q=1}^Q\gamma_{h_0,q}B_q(t,v). \end{equation} Using code from slide 96: library(JM) library(JMbayes) #Fitting linear mixed effects model lmeFit The summary displays: Call: jointModelBayes(lmeObject = lmeFit, survObject = coxFit, timeVar = "obstime") Data Descriptives: Longitudinal Process Event Process Number of Observations: 1405 Number of Events: 188 (40.3%) Number of subjects: 467 Joint Model Summary: Longitudinal Process: Linear mixed-effects model Event Process: Relative risk model with penalized-spline-approximated baseline risk function Parameterization: Time-dependent value LPML DIC pD -Inf 12743.78 1708.641 Variance Components: StdDev Corr (Intercept) 4.5930 (Intr) obstime 0.5745 -0.0268 Residual 1.7174 Coefficients: Longitudinal Process Value Std.Err Std.Dev 2.5% 97.5% P (Intercept) 7.1967 0.0057 0.2217 6.7563 7.6278 Now, if you look into the jointFitBayes object and look at the mcmc list, we find 8 samples (corresponding to 8 parameter vectors, where a vector could be of length 1). The list contains samples for (among others) D and tauBs. The posterior mean for tauBs is 186.5855, and the posterior mean for D is \begin{bmatrix} 21.0959 & -0.0708 \\ -0.0708 & 0.3300 \end{bmatrix} . In the help section it states: ?jointModelBayes tau the precision parameter from the linear mixed effects model (i.e., τ = 1/σ^2 with σ denoting the error terms standard deviation). invD the inverse variance-covariance matrix of the random effects. But, there is no description about tauBs or D. If D is the variance-covariance matrix of the random effects, then why does it not match the variance component part of the summary?: \begin{bmatrix} 4.5930 & -0.0268 \\ -0.0268 & 0.5745 \end{bmatrix} . In addition, from the summary, the posterior mean for $\sigma$ is 1.7174. This would mean that the posterior mean for $\tau$ should be 0.3390448. But, the posterior mean for tauBs is 186.5855. What can tauBs be? Example extended: we can use the joint models to predict survival probabilities in the future. This can be done as follows (see slide 157): sfit However, if I do the following, cf slides 127 and 157 in the workshop, I receive an error: #Fitting linear mixed effects model lmeFit Finally, using sfit I obtain the following plot However, in the workshop on slide 157 (with corresponding plots on slides 156), the same code plots the median survival probability with corresponding $95\%$ prediction intervals. Why is this?
