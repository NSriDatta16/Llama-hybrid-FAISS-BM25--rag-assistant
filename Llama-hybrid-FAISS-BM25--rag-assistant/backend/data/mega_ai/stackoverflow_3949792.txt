Large organizations that I've dealt with are always dynamic ecosystems that are evolving all the time. They tend to oscillate between "dispersion is better" and "centralization is better" with a period that is somewhere between 1-5 years. If the organization is on its "centralization is better" cycle, there's an enterprise architecture group that will claim tool selection and standardization as their responsibility. They'll have a committee of wise men/women that dictate selections from on high. They're usually conservative, as all large organizations tend to be. They like mainstream, proven technologies that are produced by other large organizations that have deep enough pockets to be sued if anything goes wrong. This enterprise architecture group will usually have the final say. They own the production servers, and nothing unapproved can appear on production servers. But there's always a guerrilla war going on in the lines of business. Depending on their appetite for innovation and risk, each group can be searching for unapproved technologies to give them an edge. They'll prototype things to see if they can persuade the enterprise group to allow them to continue. This continues until the "dispersion cycle" begins and someone, usually a new incoming CIO, decides to break with the past and try "new ideas". And the circle of life continues.
