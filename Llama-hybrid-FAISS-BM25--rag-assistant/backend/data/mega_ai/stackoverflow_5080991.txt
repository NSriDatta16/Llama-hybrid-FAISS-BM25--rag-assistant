I am using "URL Parameters" as in PDF Open Parameters to get to a certain PDF Page or bookmark. There is something for highlighting too, but not searching and highlighting AFAIK. I also do have some issue ( see Fragment lost ) using it with the WinForm WebBrowser control, nevertheless I find the approach useful.
