You say you are "currently writing a large scale ASP.NET app". If you have made significant progress on it, you are already pass the point where you can justify using Google app engine or Azure. Both require significantly different architectures than you have build with a traditional application due to language support, database differences, and maturity. Google App Engine is Python only so switching to it would require a complete rewrite Big table is not a relational database and requires very different coding patters. SQL Data Services originally announced to be non-relational as well, but is moving to be more relational. I have not seen how close to a standard MSSQL database it currently is. I would consider Google app engine to be a relatively immature platform so far. Database functionality is limited, you cannot run background processes, profiling and performance tuning tools are limited at best. Azure is currently in limited community preview, and so is not even available to ship a product on today. While there are many very valid reasons to use a cloud architecture, moving to it will require significantly different architectures. Think about what effect changing that architecture (and possibly waiting for platform availability) will do to your release date. If you are early in your project, cloud vs. not cloud is a great question to ask. If you have well on your way, I think that the importance of getting to shipping code and leveraging the work you have already put in should trump any benefits to the cloud you may see.
