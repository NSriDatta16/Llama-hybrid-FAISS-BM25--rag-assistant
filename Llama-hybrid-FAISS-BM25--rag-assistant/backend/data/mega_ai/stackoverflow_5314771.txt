This is the basic comportment of Exception : if you don't catch directly an exception this one is thrown to the upper element and so on to the "Root script". Attention, you must catch the Exception, otherwise you'll get an error. You can also "re"throwing an Exception from a catch block, like this: catch(PDOException $e) { throw $e; }
