Can the Bonferroni correction or another correction for multiple comparisons be used in a logistic regression?

Can the Bonferroni correction or another correction for multiple comparisons be used in a logistic regression? I have only seen it used in ANOVAs. Also, is there a test I can use in SPSS for this?
