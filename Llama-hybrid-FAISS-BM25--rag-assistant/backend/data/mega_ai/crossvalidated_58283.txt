In general it's not the best model selection strategy to remove parameters just because their confidence intervals overlap zero. This applies just as much to ARIMA modelling as to multiple regression (see e.g. here ). Each one you remove changes the estimates of the ones remaining. Stepwise removal may be a better solution, but is still rather arbitrary. At the end of it there are combinations you won't have explored, for no good reason, & you can't say what the overall error rate or power of the selection process might be. Better, as you suggested, to use AIC, & keep hypothesis tests for use with some meaningful predetermined null hypotheses. Better too, to confine your attention to a plausible set of models given prior knowledge. In this case what could be so special about lags 1, 3, & 9? And the real test will come with out-of-sample forecasts.
