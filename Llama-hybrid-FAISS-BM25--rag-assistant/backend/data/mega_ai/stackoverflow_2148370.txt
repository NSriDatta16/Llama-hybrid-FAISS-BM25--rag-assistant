Can I make a non hosted HTML5 app with local storage?

I have a PHP/MySQL site I'm thinking about converting into a HTML5/JavaScript that could be run off of a users computer locally. I would like the user to be able to download my site, extract it and use it without a network connection. A static mirror of this site would hundreds of megabytes while the actual data is under 10 megabytes. Is there a way to preload the HTML5 web storage ahead of time? Or would I have to use JavaScript to load the web storage if doesn't have my data? Any ideas or pointers? Thanks
