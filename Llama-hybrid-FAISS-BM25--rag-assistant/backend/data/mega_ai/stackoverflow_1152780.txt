How much load can a standard Jira on Tomcat installation take?

We are running Jira on a 4 way 32 bit RHEL box with 4 GB RAM with no problems so far. However we anticipate an increase in the number of users and would like to know the maximum no. of simultaneous requests that a Tomcat-Jira server can handle. (The Jira application is deployed on a standalone tomcat server that runs nothing else, so even Tomcat only statistics would help). Currently we average around 6000 hits a day. Does anyone have any statistics from their setups for a comparison?
