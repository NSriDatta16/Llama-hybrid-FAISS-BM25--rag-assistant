No... You will need the computer to have mysql and your compiled code. What you CUD do if your database is not too big is hardcode the data storage and retrieval in your code itself.. in that case you wont need mysql installed there.. OR you cud allow network access to mysql on another machine(server) in that case u only need mysql on the server
