Recommendation using Random Forest

I am trying to write my own recommender system. I have data set of user-item rating matrix. But I do not have profile information about either items or users. I already built pure CF using cosine and Pearson. I am trying to build a recommender system using the random forest. I read some paper but those are the random forest in model-based recommender systems. Your help would be much appreciated.
