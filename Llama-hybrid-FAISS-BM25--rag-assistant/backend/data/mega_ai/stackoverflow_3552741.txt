jQuery move div around in DOM

I know this has been asked many times, but I don't understand what is incorrect about my code. I have a series of DIV 'columns' containing some 'object' DIV s. I'm trying to move object DIV s from one column to another using the code below. I don't receive any errors, just nothing on the client and nothing to suggest in debug that anything is amiss. Can anyone suggest why the following doesn't work? $(".column-heading").droppable({ accept: ".column-item", drop: function (ev, ui) { //alert(this.id); //alert(ui.draggable.attr("id")); $(ui.draggable.attr("id")).appendTo($(this).parent()); } }); A sample column I am trying add/remove from is: Status 1 Agreement 1 Agreement 2
