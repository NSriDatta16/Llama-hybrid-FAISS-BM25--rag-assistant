I use JDK6_17 on XP with an older computer and don't notice the difference you experience. My timings where betweenn 20-22 in both cases. I then changed the sleep time to 10ms and the timings are remarkably similiar. For the default layout: Average time in between events: 31.236842105263158 Average time in between events: 31.236842105263158 Average time in between events: 31.236842105263158 For the Border layout: Average time in between events: 31.236842105263158 Average time in between events: 31.23766447368421 Average time in between events: 31.236842105263158 In fact I can't believe they are identical in 5 of 6 cases. By default the content pane of a JFrame does use a BorderLayout. So when you add components to the frame all you need to do is: frame.add(topComponent, BorderLayout.NORTH); frame.add(centerComponent); frame.add(bottomComponent, BorderLayout.SOUTH); and the frame will add the components to the content pane at the proper location. Why are you changing the layout of the frame, instead of the content pane. Normally you would only ever change the layout of the content pane. The root pane of the frame is use to hold the menu bar and the content pane. So maybe you change the default layout manager of the entire frame you are causing some problems?
