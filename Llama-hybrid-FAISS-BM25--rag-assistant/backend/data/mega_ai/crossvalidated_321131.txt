Often time (read nearly always) untreated level shifts and one-time anomalies create havoc with simple arima model identification. As @AdamO Interrupted Time Series Analysis - ARIMAX for High Frequency Biological Data? elegantly wrote the correlogram should be calculated from residuals using a model that controls for intervention administration, otherwise the intervention effects are taken to be Gaussian noise, underestimating the actual autoregressive effect. If you wish I will try and help further by inspecting the actual data. Please post it a csv column format.
