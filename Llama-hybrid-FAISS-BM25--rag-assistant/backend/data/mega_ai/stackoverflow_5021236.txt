Retrieving default UI colors on iPhone

PREAMBLE: since iOS 13 with its dark theme, there's a proper notion of system colors on iOS. See the UIColor class. Here's my iPhone project with a XIB file with a regular UIButton on it. The button has a text color - a nice shade of blue, RGB(50, 79, 133) to be precise. Is there a quick and proper way to retrieve that color value in runtime? Not the color of this particular button, but the default text color of UIButtons? Preferably as a UIColor * or a CGColorRef . Is there a notion of system colors on iPhone, or this is just a default enforced by the presets in the Interface Builder? Yes, I can do some elementary math and convert the RGB into the floating-point (UGH!) representation that UIColor uses. Anything more elegant than that?
