As far as I understand magento's cron system, it works in 2 phase: it checks the modules config.xml to find out the methods which have to be run by cron and insert them into the database ( cron_schedule ) it get the info from this table and run the methods matching the scheduled_at column with actual time. As you say there are entries in your cron_schedule table, the first phase is ok So in order to check if your cron executes fine, you actually have to setup a cronjob in your server, which would be your computer if you're working locally. It's actually very simple on ubuntu, I guess it will be more complicated on windows, but (guessing again) not imposible. Or maybe refreshing your browser pointing to your cron.php file a few times would every 5 minutes (as you have it configured in your config.xml) would do the trick, but setting up a cronjob would be quite more eficient :) Hope That Helps edit: here is waht my cronjob looks like, if it helps you: */5 * * * * wget -q http://magento.local/cron.php
