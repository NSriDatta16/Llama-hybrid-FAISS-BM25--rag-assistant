Pressing stop in Eclipse outright kills the interpreter (though it actually fails fairly often). Like using kill / taskkill , the process is unaware of it's demise. Ctrl+C snippet from Wikipedia... Control-C as an abort command was popularized by UNIX and adopted in other systems. In POSIX systems, the sequence causes the active program to receive a SIGINT signal. If the program does not specify how to handle this condition, it is terminated. Typically a program which does handle a SIGINT will still terminate itself, or at least terminate the task running inside it. Ctrl+C is a control signal to interrupt the program, but as you may have noticed in the middle of that paragraph, programs can specify how to handle the signal. In Python, Ctrl+C throws a KeyboardInterrupt exception which is normally caught and then Python exits cleanly. Even if you're killing the interpreter with Ctrl+C it may handle it so that it cleans the environment before exiting. I included the following because you asked "Is there a way around it?" If you are wanting to stop on raw_input(...) calls, you could use Ctrl+Z to send EOF. I looked around, and there seems to be no way to send Ctrl+C / 0x03 in Eclipse, unfortunately.
