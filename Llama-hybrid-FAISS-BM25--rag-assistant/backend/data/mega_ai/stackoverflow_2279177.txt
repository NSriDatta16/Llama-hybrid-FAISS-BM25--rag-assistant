Here is an alternative regex solution. The problem can be reprased as "how do I insert a space before each uppercase letter, before doing the split": >>> s = "TheLongAndWindingRoad ABC A123B45" >>> re.sub( r"([A-Z])", r" \1", s).split() ['The', 'Long', 'And', 'Winding', 'Road', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A123', 'B45'] This has the advantage of preserving all non-whitespace characters, which most other solutions do not.
