Design decision: spring webflow transitions vs JSF action handlers

Here in our application we are using Spring webflow 2.0.x and JSF1.2. Please clarify me when to go for webflow transitions and when to go for JSF beans. for example in a single page we are having more than 20 controls in each page. like buttons, datatables, tabs, etc. and we are using a4j(richfaces) tags for Ajax requests. so, on each event a portion of the page would get rendered most of the times. currently we are writing action handler part in flow xml files.. like wise it has become a huge file with aroung 300 lines of code and with more 30 transitions which re-renders fragments of the page. is this the right way to implement or should i modularize/design into JSF components. Please draw the clear line that 1) when to go for transitions and when to go for JSF Bean Handlers. 2) how would be the data exchange should happen between these two kind of components(beans)? can we access flow variables in JSF components? Thanks in advance
