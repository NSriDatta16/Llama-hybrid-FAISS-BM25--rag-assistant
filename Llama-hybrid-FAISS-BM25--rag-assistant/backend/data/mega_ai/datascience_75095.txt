What is the 1 Unit in the contraint of SVM: $y_i(wx_i+b) \geq1$

I am following this note on SVM. The constraint, $y_i(wx_i+b) \geq 1$ , basically said all inputs, $x_i$ , lie at least 1 unit away from the hyperplane on the correct side. What does it mean by 1 unit? In 2D space, does it mean moving the hyperplane, $w$ , up by 1?
