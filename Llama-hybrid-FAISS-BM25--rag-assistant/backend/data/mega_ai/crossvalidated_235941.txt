For a rough estimate: There are 8760 hours in a year, and thus 2920 3-hour blocks. Assuming that the failures always occur in these blocks (and excluding cases where A might be dead from 1 to 4 PM and O dead from 2 to 5, for example), there's a 2/2920 = 0.07% probability of O at any given block of time. Since you claim that the failures are independent, this means that given that A is down, there is a 0.07% chance that O is down as well. Combining these, there is a $(2/2920)^2$ probability that both will be down at any given block; in the course of a year with 2920 block there are thus an average of 4/2920 = 0.0014 blocks where both A and B are down, and you really only expect it to occur once every thousand years or so. For a more exact answer: The exact statistical model of your process is a Poisson process with dead time. There is a given rate at which failure occur, but once they occur there is a period of time (3 hours) where nothing else happens. There are some analytic ways of modeling this (see here for example), but the rough estimate above is going to be close, and would likely be easier to write a small Monte Carlo simulation in Python than it would be to apply the analytic formalism (though for such small rates that could take a while).
