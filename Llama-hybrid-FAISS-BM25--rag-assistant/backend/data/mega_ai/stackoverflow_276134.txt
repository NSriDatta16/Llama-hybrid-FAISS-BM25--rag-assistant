How can I setup different SSL-Certificates for vhosts on Apache?

I have a web-server, that serves different domain-names, but has only one IP-address assigned. That works fine with virtual hosts in Apache. Now I want SSL-encrypted connections for the websites. How can I set different SSL-certificates for the different vhosts? Using different IP's for the different hostnames would be an solution - not very elegant but possible. But I want to know, how I can use different SSL-certificates for different vhosts. So I look for a solution with only one IP-address.
