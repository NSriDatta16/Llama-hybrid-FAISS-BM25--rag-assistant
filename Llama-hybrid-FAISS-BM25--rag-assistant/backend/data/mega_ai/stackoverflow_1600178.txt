You need to ask yourself a qustion, what is my controller responsible for? IMHO, controllers should act as mediators between the View and the Model, where Model in this case includes Services. That said, there are never strict rules on where to put what. Unlike zealots posting strict answers, I would take the pragmatic approach. Will adding file system dependancy to your database service make it more useful? Will it result with type explosion - your service would need to have the file system dependency injectet == +1 interface +1 concrete implementation +1 test class in case of unit tests etc. Somtiems it's not worth it, so use you own judgement.
