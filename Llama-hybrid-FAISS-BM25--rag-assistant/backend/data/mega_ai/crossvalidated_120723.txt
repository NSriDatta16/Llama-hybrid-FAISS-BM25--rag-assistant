It really depends on whether there were pre-treatment differences in the preLevels of the Treatment and Control group. Ideally, especially in a clinical trial, the groups would be randomly chosen and identical before treatment. In that case, absolute differences, percentage differences, and pre-post ratios will correlate very highly and will show much the same thing. If you were in a situation where you had groups that differed at baseline, it would be a different story. If you imagine that, for some reason, the treatment group started off at an average cholesterol of 200 while the control group started at 100, absolute differences and ratios would give you very different results. If the cholesterol of the treatment group dropped 20 points (absolute) and the control only 10, percentage and pre-post ratio measures would show no difference between groups, while absolute values would pick up on the difference. In that case, absolute values would likely be the right choice of measure. In general, ratios and percentages can be dangerous because they can hide differences such as the one I just described, so I would tend towards testing absolute differences first, and only using ratios etc when the situation makes them specifically appropriate.
