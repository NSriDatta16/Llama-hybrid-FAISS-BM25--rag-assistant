Your best bet here is going to be to abandon the datagrid and use a ListView instead, and inside the ListView you will want to show a UserControl of your own design. I did something similar for an application I built. In your XAML for your ListView you will want to set the ItemContainerStyle and inside that you'll want to display your custom UserControl (in which you can use a Grid to setup the rows/colums and their spans). It basically looks like this: The AgentStateControl is my custom control, and it has two rows, the second has a bigger span on the columns. You can create that control however you want.
