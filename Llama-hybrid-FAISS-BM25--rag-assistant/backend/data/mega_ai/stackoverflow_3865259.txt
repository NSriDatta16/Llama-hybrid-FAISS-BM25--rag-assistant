There is no way to write a constructor for bag::iterator because iterator is a typedef name, which are prohibited from being used as constructor names: 14882:2003 12.1/3 a typedef-name that names a class shall not be used as the identifier in the declarator for a constructor declaration. There is even an example in the standard, although in a different paragraph, 7.1.3/5 : typedef struct { S(); //error: requires a return type because S is // an ordinary member function, not a constructor } S; You will have to give that struct a name, if you want a user-defined constructor. The typedef struct { } name; style of programming is usually discouraged by C++ style guides anyway, in favor of struct name { }; .
