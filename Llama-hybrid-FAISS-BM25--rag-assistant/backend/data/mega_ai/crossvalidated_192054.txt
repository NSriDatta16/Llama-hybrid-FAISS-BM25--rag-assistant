When is it appropriate to use linear regression vs. Naive Bayes?

Based on my readings, it appears as though linear regression lends itself to cases where both X and Y are numerical and you have a large sample size, whereas Bayes is better for categorical variables with a small sample size. Is there a criteria for scenario type? My scenario in this case is measuring my own tiredness level everyday, and seeing if that correlates with whether I had breakfast that day, or the noisiness level at night. I plan to have a new intervention every week and A/B test to see if there's a high correlation or not (eg only breakfast every other day). I was trying to use Bayesian statistics to analyze my data, eg P(tired | breakfast), but the calculations became trickier when I had continuous variables like P(time it takes to fall asleep | noise level). What is the best method for evaluating correlation between different variables and my tiredness levels if I am making interventions?
