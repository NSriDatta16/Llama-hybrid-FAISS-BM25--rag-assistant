Why is this 'for' loop not working?

I have a Javascript object called TweenManager which contains an array of Tween objects. The TweenManager should call the step() method on each tween in the 'tweens' array and all the tweens should run at the same time. However, what's actually happening is that the TweenManager only runs one tween at a time, and doesn't start the next one until the previous tween is complete. Here's the code for the tween manager UPDATE: It might make more sense to look at it here //Manage all tweens function TweenManager(){ this.tweens = new Array(); this.timer; this.start = function(){ this.timer = setInterval(this.run, 1, this); } // Loop through all tweens and call the step method this.run = function(myself){ console.log(myself.tweens.length); // stop the interval if the tween array is empty if(myself.tweens.length == 0){ clearInterval(myself.timer) } // loop through all tweens and call the step() method // !! Here's there the problem appears to be for(i = 0; i The problem appears to be in the for loop. I have a hunch that this might have something to do with passing in this in the setInterval , although it's just a hunch, I don't understand what the problem could be. I get confused with variable scopes and whatnot. Here's the Tween Object (Yup, ripped off form Robert Penner) // Tween a number, add a suffix and insert it into an element function Tween(b, c, d, element, suffix, decimal){ this.t = 0; this.c = c; this.d = d; this.b = b; this.element = element; this.suffix = suffix; this.step = function(){ if(this.t != this.d){ this.t += 1 var flip = 1 if (this.c And here's the implementation tweenManager = new TweenManager(); tweenManager.addTween(0,80,300, $("#el1"), "&deg;", false) tweenManager.addTween(0,60,400, $("#el2"), "&#8217;", false) tweenManager.addTween(0,12.5,300, $("#el3"), "", true) tweenManager.start() As always, any help, hinting or nudging the the right direction is greatly appreciated.
