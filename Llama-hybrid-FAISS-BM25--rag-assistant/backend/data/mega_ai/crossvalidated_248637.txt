Given that your goal is to seasonally detrend the data, your regression model will be something like $$R[t]=f[t]+\epsilon$$ where $R[t]$ is the radiation time series, $f$ is the (sinusoidal) trend, and $\epsilon$ is the residual (detrended) data. Your question is about the ( marginal ) distribution $p[R]$, which appears to be bimodal. However this does not necessarily imply that the ( conditional ) distribution of the residuals $p[\epsilon]$ is bimodal! In fact, if you plot a histogram for your sinusoidal trend $f[t]$, you should find that it is bimodal all by itself (with modes corresponding to the peak and trough). I would suggest trying a simple sine curve fit* to the data, then look at the distribution of the residuals . (*For example, use whatever linear regression routine, but pass in $\sin[2\pi t/T]$ instead of $t$; assuming your period $T$ is known, e.g. 1 year.) Update: Here is a simple example to illustrate the above ideas. (This should not be taken as a full solution!) The figures below correspond to $$f[t] = 38\times\exp\left[0.3\times\sin\left(\tfrac{2\pi\,t}{365}\right)\right]-18$$ and $\epsilon = 2.5 z$ where $z$ is white noise with a standard normal distribution (total number of points is $n=1001$, on a uniform grid over $t\in[0,365]$). This gives the following time series below The corresponding (bimodal) histogram is Notes: I put in the exponential simply to break the symmetry of the two modes. For this model the data $R[t]$ cannot simply be log-transformed. This example also assumes your data is censored (i.e. "$35$" really means "$\geq 35$"). Finally, the model form above could be fit to your data using nonlinear least squares. (Really there is 1 nonlinear parameter, the coefficient inside the exponential, so the least squares problem is "separable".)
