How are S3 (Amazon Simple Storage System) storage prices calculated?

I'm not quite sure if this is the correct stack exchange site for this question, but i've found no site which fits better. I'm planning to use S3 for my next project, but i'm not sure how the prices for the storage is actually billed. I would have no problem if i would use S3 just for throwing gigabytes of data in and almost never delete data. But thats not the case. What if I store an 1 megabyte file in S3, delete it after 1 hour and put another 1 megabyte file onto S3? Will I be billed for 1 megabyte of storage for that month, or 2 megabytes? Amazon states: First 1 TB / month of Storage Used I don't think they will just bill whats stored on my S3 account at the end of the month and will bill that. The other way around - bill me for every store request as "storage used" will not work either, because the stored file might be stored for a long time, during multiple billing months. I hope someone has the answer to that, i couldn't find anything :-)
