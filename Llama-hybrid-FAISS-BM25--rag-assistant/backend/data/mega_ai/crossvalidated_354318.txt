Tools that will try to find an exact model using different math combinations?

Lets pretend that I didnt know newtons law of gravitation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation but I had data for all variables (F,m1,m2,r) Is there any tooling that will just iterate through lots of different equations until it arrives that the correct formula? another example - lets say I didn't know how to do a 3D rotation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix but I have lots of data. Any machine learning that could spit out the exact formula?
