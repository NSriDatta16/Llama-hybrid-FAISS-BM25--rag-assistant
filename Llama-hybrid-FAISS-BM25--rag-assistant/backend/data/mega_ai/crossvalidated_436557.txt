The rolling up of the outliers into a lower category will certainly cause some bias, but it's impossible to know how much, without knowing what the actual quotes were. If none were much over $400 then it won't be much of a problem. If some were much higher, it could be a big problem. Also, binning the quotes isn't a great idea as it loses information. You should leave each price as a price and not bin at all. If you only have the data in this format, then I would try ordinal logistic regression, instead of linear regression.
