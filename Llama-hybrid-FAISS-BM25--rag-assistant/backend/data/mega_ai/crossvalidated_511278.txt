As to how two apparently similar methods give such different results: This is due to how the predictions are generated. For a new observation, in a classification RF, each tree's prediction is a class label. The final RF prediction will take a majority vote over these predictions. This works well for for classification, but the proportion of trees that predicted class A is generally not a good estimate of the probability of being in class A; it tends to be more extreme. in a regression RF, each tree's prediction is a numeric value (in this case the proportion of class A observations in the terminal node the observation ended up in). The final RF prediction will take the average over these predictions. This may yield better estimates for the probabilities.
