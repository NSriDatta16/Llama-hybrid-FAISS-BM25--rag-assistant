A Neural network with one layer using linear activation is a linear regression. If you have a multi-layer neural network that only uses linear activations, it will reduce to linear regression . In other cases, it is a different algorithm . The same applies to logistic regression: it is the simplest, single-layer neural network with sigmoid activation, but if you add more layers, it is a different algorithm. You cannot use neural networks to "find" parameters of linear or logistic regression unless you mean the special cases mentioned above.
