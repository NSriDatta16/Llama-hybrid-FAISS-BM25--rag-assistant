PermanentTaskFailure on deferred : permanent failure attempting to execute task

I'm reading a lot of this kind error in my application's log lately: Permanent failure attempting to execute task Traceback (most recent call last): File "/base/python_runtime/python_lib/versions/1/google/appengine/ext/deferred/deferred.py", line 258, in post run(self.request.body) File "/base/python_runtime/python_lib/versions/1/google/appengine/ext/deferred/deferred.py", line 124, in run return func(*args, **kwds) File "/base/python_runtime/python_lib/versions/1/google/appengine/ext/deferred/deferred.py", line 146, in run_from_datastore raise PermanentTaskFailure() PermanentTaskFailure Reading this other related question with similar issues, it seems that the problem could be Python path manipulation . The problem here is that in the stacktrace there's no indication of what is causing the trouble. I'm not doing any path shenanigans on my source code and I really can't find what could be generate this kind of issue. Sources: worker.py - contains the deferred functions admin.py - admin controllers that calls deferred tasks stackprinterdownloader.py - core lib that calls other deferred tasks Any hints?
