My recommendation would actually be to change your model. Why not have a ForeignKey in Link to LinkSection ? Or, if it's not OneToMany, perhaps a ManyToMany field? The admin interface will generate that for free. Of course, I don't recommend this if links don't logically have anything to do with link sections, but maybe they do? If they don't, please explain what the intended organization is. (For example, is 3 links per section fixed or arbitrary?)
