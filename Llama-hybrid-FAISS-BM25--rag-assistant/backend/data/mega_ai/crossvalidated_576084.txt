Is it possible to do this with graph neural networks? Yes, this is possible using various GNNs architectures, and you usually do not need to set a maximum number or nodes. For example, Tox21 dataset has chemical compounds which has different number of nodes, and the aim is to predict if a compound is toxic or not. You can find some papers here , or search google scholar to find GNN papers that benchmark on it.
