Automatically generate nested table of contents based on heading tags

Which one of you crafty programmers can show me an elegant php coded solution for automatically generating a nested table of contents based on heading tags on the page? So I have a html document thus: Animals Some content goes here. Some content goes here. Mammals Some content goes here. Some content goes here. Terrestrial Mammals Some content goes here. Some content goes here. Marine Mammals Some content goes here. Some content goes here. Whales Some content goes here. Some content goes here. More specifically, I want a linked table of contents in the form of a nested list of links to headings on the same page: Table of Contents (automatically generated by PHP code) Animals Mammals Terrestrial_Mammals Marine_Mammals Whales
