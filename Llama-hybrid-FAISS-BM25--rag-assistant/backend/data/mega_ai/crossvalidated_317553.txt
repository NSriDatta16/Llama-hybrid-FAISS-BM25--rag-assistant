Even within the disciplines, there is sadly no council that ensures consistent usage. However, in my experience the key distinction as that in early econometric panel models they tended to be referring to the intercept, whereas in other fields they are referring to anything. Consider a model predicting how much a person weighs, where you have 10 observations taken over 10 years for 1,000 children. In econometrics the 'fixed effects' model is one where you have a separate intercept for each of the 1,000 children (such models are not typically estimated with dummy variables, but it is OK to think of them that way). The random effects model is one where you instead assume that the intercept is a random variable and estimate its mean and variance. Now, let's add into the model a predictor which is the height of the child. If we estimate a single coefficient, we treat the effect as being fixed. If we instead treat it as a random variable, we estimate the average effect and the variance of the effect (if assuming normally distributed random variables). If you have some predictors that are assumed to be random variables and others that are not, be they the intercept or anything else, you have a mixed model.
