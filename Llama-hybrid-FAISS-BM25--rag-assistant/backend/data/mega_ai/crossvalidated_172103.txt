Using Bayesian settings , the problem is fairly easy. Given a model $M$ with distribution function $F()$ and parameters $\vec{\theta}$, update the model with the data you have and derive a posterior probability. Then, using marginal likelihood , you could see what model fits the data best regardless of the parameters.
