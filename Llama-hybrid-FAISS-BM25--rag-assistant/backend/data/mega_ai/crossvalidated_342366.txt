Here's the example you ask for in your title question. I'm doing this purely from memory, which will either prove that this is actually easy, or that my memory is lousy: $ARIMA(0, 1, 1)(0, 1, 1)_{12}$ has the form $(1 - L)(1 - L^{12}) y_t = c + (1 + \theta L)(1 + \Theta L^{12}) \epsilon_t$ where $L$ is the lag operator. Multiply the terms out to get $(1 - L - L^{12} + L^{13}) y_t = c + (1 + \theta L + \Theta L^{12} + \theta \Theta L^{13}) \epsilon_t$ $y_t - y_{t-1} - y_{t-12} + y_{t-13} = c + \epsilon + \theta \epsilon_{t-1} + \Theta \epsilon_{t-12} + \theta \Theta \epsilon_{t-13}$ $y_t = c + y_{t-1} + y_{t-12} - y_{t-13} + \epsilon + \theta \epsilon_{t-1} + \Theta \epsilon_{t-12} + \theta \Theta \epsilon_{t-13}$ It's the same principle to get any multiplicative SARIMA model. From what I remember, a good reference on this is Box, Jenkins et al. Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control .
