Bayesian output vs frequentist. Which should I rely on? MLM/ RE HLM

I have 2 questions. 1)My Bayesian output is providing some trouble. I have data that will vary across 5 countries. This means my group level has a small n of 5. This results in my data hovering around the mean and provides different results from the frequentist. When trying to decide how to interpret the data and ultimately make a decision, should I explain why the data are hovering around the mean, interpret the effects, but then rely mainly on the frequentist results? 2)Also, I am getting mixed answers on what a significant intercept means for an HLM model. Can anyone help? bayesian: Mean SD Intercept 2.32905 2.5980 var1.2 -0.23847 2.6300 var1.3 -0.51286 2.6157 cor 1.59379 0.7850 var1.2:cor -0.04556 0.7991 var1.3:cor -0.03126 0.7846 here it seems like there is no credible difference between the levels of var. cor is credible but the interaction between levels of var are not? How would I interpret the intercept? That should be var1.1 on y. frequentist: mod1 |t|) (Intercept) 7.291e+00 7.396e-01 6.000e+00 9.859 4.25e-05 *** var1.2 -9.489e-01 6.420e-01 6.000e+00 -1.478 0.1867 var1.3 -1.883e+00 7.229e-01 5.000e+00 -2.605 0.0445 * cor 3.056e-01 1.986e-01 6.000e+00 1.539 0.1782 var1.2:cor 1.385e-01 1.867e-01 8.000e+00 0.742 0.4802 var1:3:cor 3.298e-01 2.100e-01 7.000e+00 1.570 0.1635 here it seems the only significant level of var is var1.3. here cor is not significant. and neither are the interactions with var? How would I interpret the intercept? That should be var1.1 on y. And again, which should I rely on?
