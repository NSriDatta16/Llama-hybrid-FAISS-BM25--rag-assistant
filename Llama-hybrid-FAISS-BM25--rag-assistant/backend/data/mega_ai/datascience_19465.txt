AUC and classification report in Logistic regression in python

I have been trying to implement logistic regression in python. Basically the code works and it gives the accuracy of the predictive model at a level of 91% but for some reason the AUC score is 0.5 which is basically the worst possible score because it means that the model is completely random. Also the classification report returns error: "UndefinedMetricWarning: Precision and F-score are ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no predicted samples. 'precision', 'predicted', average, warn_for)". Does anyone know what should I change so it works properly? import numpy as np import pandas as pd from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score from sklearn.metrics import classification_report data_file = pd.read_csv('loan.csv', delimiter=',') # variable preprocessing data_file['loan_status'] = np.where(data_file['loan_status'].isin(['Fully Paid', 'Current']), 1, 0) loan_stat=data_file['loan_status'] loan_stat=loan_stat.astype(np.float64) m = { 'n/a': 0, ' Here is the link to the data: https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data/downloads/lending-club-loan-data.zip
