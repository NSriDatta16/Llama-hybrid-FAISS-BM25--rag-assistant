Neural Network: MLP for regression with 3 continuous features, 1 categorical

I am starting to study Neural Network. I want to build a MLP where I will feed it: 3 features which are continuous one feature which is categorical (48 classes) How can I do this? Before adding the categorical feature, I was using 'relu' activation function and 'lbfgs' as a solver in MLPRegrssor in sklearn. I was wondering: how can I integrate this variable into the network? Should I do one-hot encoding? Should I keep relu as activation function or should I try sigmoid, softmax or something like that?
