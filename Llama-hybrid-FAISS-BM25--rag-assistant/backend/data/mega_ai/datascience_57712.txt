As karthikeyan mg mention in his answer, you could use the explained variance score to get an idea of how many columns you can drop. Unfortunately, there isn't a magic number to know in advance. If you write code in Python, you should read this blog post in towardsdatascience.com An Approach to Choosing the Number of Components in a Principal Component Analysis After you rescale your data to 0-1, you can run this snippet of code and get a plot of variance loss for each components number you choose. #Fitting the PCA algorithm with our Data pca = PCA().fit(data_rescaled) #Plotting the Cumulative Summation of the Explained Variance plt.figure() plt.plot(np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)) plt.xlabel('Number of Components') plt.ylabel('Variance (%)') #for each component plt.show() This is the result from the blog post. As you can see, the variance starts to drop a lot after the 5 components. So, this number might be the one you could use.
