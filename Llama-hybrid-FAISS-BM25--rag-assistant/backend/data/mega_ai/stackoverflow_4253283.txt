You can use netcat to send a working, canned HTTP request: command cat httpreq.txt | nc www.whatismyip.com 80 httpreq.txt (make sure to end the file with at least two blank lines) GET / HTTP/1.0 Host: www.whatismyip.com User-Agent: netcat Referer: http://www.whatismyip.com/ > ... but you will still need some mechanism to parse the HTTP response. Even if you can find a "what is my IP" web service that returns only the unadorned IP address in plain text (freeing you from having to parse HTML), you will still need to parse off the HTTP response headers. What facilities do you have that might allow you to do some string parsing? BASH? sed? awk? Edit: looks like superfro found a plain-text "what is my ip" service, and an easy way to parse off the HTTP response headers.
