Visualizing a spline basis

Textbooks typically have nice example plots of of the basis for uniform splines when they're explaining the topic. Something like a row of little triangles for a linear spline, or a row of little humps for a cubic spline. This is a typical example: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_introcom_a0000000525.htm I'm wondering if there is an easy way to generate a plot of the spline basis using standard R functions (like bs or ns). I guess there's some simple piece of matrix arithmetic combined with a trivial R program which will spit out a pretty plots of a spline basis in an elegant way. I just can't think of it!
