What should be the image resolution for Nexus One or Droid?

As Android supports multiple devices from different manufacturers there are different screen resolutions supported. The table that is available at https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support is not very clear to me. It shows WVGA and FWVGA in MDPI for Large Screens and HDPI for Normal screens. So, if the image is kept in drawable-mdpi and its resolution is 320 * 480 then which image will be taken by Large Screens device of MDPI. Moreover, there are two screen resolutions for HDPI i.e. 480 * 800 and 480 * 854. So, with what screen resolution the image should be built. I want to place the background image which looks distorted in WVGA emulator since its resolution is 320 * 480. I have read about nine patchable images but I think they are better for button images and edittext images so that they can stretch according to the data in it. Can someone please guide me in this?
