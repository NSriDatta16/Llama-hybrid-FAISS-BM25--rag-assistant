SVM classifier for uniform distribution

We have a dataset where in each attribute class, the values are distributed uniformly something similar to the following image where safety is one attribute of the dataset: If all other attributes have the same situation then how does SVM classifier perform on this dataset? Which kernel should be used with it?
