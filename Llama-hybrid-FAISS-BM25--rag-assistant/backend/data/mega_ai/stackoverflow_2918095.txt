here is what I see that are good on Mac's for web dev CSSEdit (only for Mac) - this package makes CSS editing so much easier. The X-ray function is a must have. Firebug has somewhat similar capability and free, but it's just not as well implemented as CSSEdit, and I searched for Windows equivalent and found none. Probably better support with Adobe software than Linux :p Coda or Espresso (only for Mac) are two other web developing suit I personally think are much better then Dreamweaver. System is fairly hassle free. Less time dealing with system. More time for coding, or whatever it is that you want to do. Exposé windows management is a great time saver too Time machine back up is another gem. Easy to setup, and saved my butt quite a few times. Colors system on Macs are better than Windows as far as I know Parallels Desktop or VMWare are fast enough to debug IE, so no reboot or a separate computer necessary. (Sorry, not sure what the Fedora situation is though) OS interface is much better than windows (again, no Fedora experience here). It takes about 2 weeks to get used to (from several friends experience). After that, there is usually no turning back. There are cons of course, but right now I can only think of one: Notebook's screen sucks… all TN panels. They are maybe good enough for average users, but for any color critical work, it's just no up to the snuff, so if you get a notebook, you wanna get a decent external monitor.
