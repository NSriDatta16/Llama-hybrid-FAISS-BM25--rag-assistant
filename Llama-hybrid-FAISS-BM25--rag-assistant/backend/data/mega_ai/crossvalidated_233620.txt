No, it's not merely a heuristic. It's quite deliberately intended to be a model for the conditional distribution of the response. Logistic regression is a particular case of a generalized linear model (GLM), in this case for a process where the response variable is conditionally Bernoulli (or more generally, binomial ). A GLM includes a specification of a model for the conditional mean of the response. In the case of a Bernoulli variable, its conditional mean is the parameter $p_i$ , which is explicitly the probability that the response, $Y_i$ is $1$ . It is modeled in terms of one or more predictors. Here's the model for the mean for a single predictor, $x_i$ : $$P(Y_i=1|x_i)=\frac{\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}{1+\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}$$ So it is (intentionally) a model for the probability that the response is $1$ , given the value of the predictors. The form of the link function $\eta=\log(p/(1-p))$ (and its inverse $p=\exp(\eta)/(1+\exp(\eta))$ ) is no accident either -- the logit link (which is what makes it logistic regression) is the natural (or canonical ) link function for a binomial response. Other choices of link function are possible (and they, too will be models for the probability of a 1). Other common choices for a binomial response are the probit and the complementary log-log but the logistic is by far the most common.
