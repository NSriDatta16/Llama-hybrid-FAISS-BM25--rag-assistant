How do I select differing rows in two MySQL tables with the same structure?

I have two tables, A and B, that have the same structure (about 30+ fields). Is there a short, elegant way to join these tables and only select rows where one or more columns differ? I could certainly write some script that creates the query with all the column names but maybe there is an SQL-only solution. To put it another way: Is there a short substitute to this: SELECT * FROM table_a a JOIN table_b b ON a.pkey=b.pkey WHERE a.col1 != b.col2 OR a.col2 != b.col2 OR a.col3 != b.col3 # .. repeat for 30 columns
