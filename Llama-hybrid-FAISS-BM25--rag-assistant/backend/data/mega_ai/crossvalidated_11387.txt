Classification of sequences of symbols

Let's say i have sequences of symbols which can have five values : A, B, C, X, Y. The average length of sequences is around 7. It is important that the symbols A, B, C have a bigger importance than X and Y which may be consider as 'whatever different from A, B or C' I need to classify those data among two classes : positives and negatives. The positive class is composed of sequences generally well aligned like X X A B Y C A B C X X A Y A X B C X X Note that positive examples have generally symbols A,B and C in that order. Negatives examples look like more 'messy' like B X A X X X X C C A Y Y X X B My first thought was that entropy was the key of that problem. I checked various papers but nothing was really satisfying. So my question is: Which features would you use for a classification purpose?
