Your execution plan results may be deceiving. In SQL 2005, the fulltext engine is an external service, so SQL cannot accurately report on what's happening in that piece of the puzzle. I'm not sure what performance issues you've heard of in 2008, but in 2008 the fulltext engine becomes fully integrated with the database, making it much more efficient in a case like yours where you're joining a database table against a set of fulltext results. If upgrading is an option for you, I'd encourage you to pursue that option. See: SQL Server 2008 Full-Text Search: Internals and Enhancements
