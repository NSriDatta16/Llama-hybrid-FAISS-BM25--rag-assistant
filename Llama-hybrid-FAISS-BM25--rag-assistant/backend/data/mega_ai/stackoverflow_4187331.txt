Changing Product Options Layout in Magento

How do you change the layout of the product options box? I have created a Configurable product with color options. I notice that Magento demo store doesnâ€™t display the product options consistently. My options box appears spanning the entire column for what is just a 1 character choice. I would like the options to display at the very least like this product: http://demo.magentocommerce.com/zolof-the-rock-and-roll-destroyer-lol-cat-t-shirt-1.html Any help you can provide would be much appreciated. Thank you.
