C programming: Dereferencing pointer to incomplete type error

I have a struct defined as: struct { char name[32]; int size; int start; int popularity; } stasher_file; and an array of pointers to those structs: struct stasher_file *files[TOTAL_STORAGE_SIZE]; In my code, I'm making a pointer to the struct and setting its members, and adding it to the array: ... struct stasher_file *newFile; strncpy(newFile->name, name, 32); newFile->size = size; newFile->start = first_free; newFile->popularity = 0; files[num_files] = newFile; ... I'm getting the following error: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type whenever I try to access the members inside newFile . What am I doing wrong?
