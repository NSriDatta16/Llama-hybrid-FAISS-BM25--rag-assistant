How to present multiple distributions with R?

I have a stochastic simulation on NetLogo in which my agents accumulate "wealth". Of course, every run gives me different outputs but with pretty much the same distribution. I use histograms to keep track of the distributions during the simulation, but I would like to produce an image that sums up what happened in the, say, 50 runs that I executed. Someone suggested to make a histogram with the means of the distributions, but I don't know how to perform that. I'm also looking for something that is not computationally huge, since I'm keeping track of also other variables during my simulations. Does anyone have a suggestion? Thanks a lot!
