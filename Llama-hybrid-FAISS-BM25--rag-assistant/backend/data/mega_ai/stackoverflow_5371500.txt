Due to lack of popularity and the license which is unsuitable for libraries you won't find many users of this framework. So I'll give you a placeholder answer. The performance comparison is out of scope here, and could not be objective or meaningful anyway. I have no clue about MongoDB (their website is pretty slow, which indicates no immediate benefit of researching it further). But I've glanced over Vork: In comparison to other frameworks it seems a bit disorganized. The naming of include files sans extension is quite unique and actually charming. But the class and directory structure isn't. It follows the Pretend-MVC fallacy. But my biggest concern is that it encourages oldschool SQL concatenation and escaping (and the naming of said escape function looks dated). The templating API looks interesting, but I did not research that much. ( API usability is the crucial part of frameworks, not performance. ) Website doesn't appear very inviting, and this impacts the documentation (which isn't quite complete.) On the upside, it comes with a lot of utility code. So if you find an intersection of features that you need, then that's a reason to try it out.
