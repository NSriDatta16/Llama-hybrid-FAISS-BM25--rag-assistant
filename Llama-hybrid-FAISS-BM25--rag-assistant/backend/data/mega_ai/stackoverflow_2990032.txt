Put the estimate in hours: Estimate how much time you currently spend, and how much time you'd spend Put the estimate in customer complaints: Estimate your current number of bugs. Estimate how many of those bugs the new system would have caught. Find out the percentage of bugs reported by users, and document how many fewer bugs will be user visible. Add to the hours: Figure out how long it would take to fix the bugs that would be caught, and tack that onto the hourly estimate. Add a non-quantifiable "salability". With the extra time, we build extra features. With fewer bugs, that's fewer demos where sales guys shoot themselves in the foot. How many extra copies of software can we sell if we do this? The last bit won't be successful; it's there primarily to focus attention on the first two metrics; hours and customer-visible defects.
