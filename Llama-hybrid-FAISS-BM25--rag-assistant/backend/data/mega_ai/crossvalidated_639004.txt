Here is a quote from Larry Wasserman's book "All of statistics" $^{[1]}$ that offers a different perspective on the topic. On page 92, he writes: Some texts interpret confidence intervals as follows: if I repeat the experiment over and over, the interval will contain the parameter 95 percent of the time. This is correct but useless since we rarely repeat the same experiment over and over. A better interpretation is this: On day 1, you collect data and construct a 95 percent confidence interval for a parameter $\theta_1$ . On day 2, you collect new data and construct a 95 percent confidence interval for an unrelated parameter $\theta_2$ . On day 3, you collect new data and construct a 95 percent confidence interval for an unrelated parameter $\theta_3$ - You continue this way constructing confidence intervals for a sequence of unrelated parameters $\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots$ Then 95 percent of your intervals will trap the true parameter value. There is no need to introduce the idea of repeating the same experiment over and over. An example would be weather forecasts: Every day, the forecaster could present a confidence interval for the probability of rain. Because we never have the exact same conditions, the underlying parameter is different every day. On average, 95 out of 100 confidence intervals will trap the true parameter value. I don't know if this helps with the interpretation of a particular interval but I find the perspective a refreshing alternative to the often-read "standard interpretation" referring to the repetition of the exact same experiment. For some suggestions of how to interpret a concrete confidence interval, see the paper by Rafi & Greenland (2020) $^{[2]}$ . Here is a relevant section of their paper: [...] we exploit the fact that a 95% CI summarizes the results of varying the test hypothesis H over a range of parameter values, displaying all values for which p > 0.05 [56] and hence s References $[1]$ Wasserman, L.
