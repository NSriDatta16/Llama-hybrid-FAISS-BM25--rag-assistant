Latex command with line break

I am trying to create a command in latex that, when invoked such as \test{\ab}{TEST} , will create a new command defined as \ab[1]{\raggedright TEST: \\ \hspace{0.5in} #1} . What I am trying to do is something along these lines: \newchar{\ab}{TEST} \ab{This is a line TEST says.} That would execute to yield TEST: This is a line TEST says. Failing that (which I do hope is possible), I could settle with another command I have drafted. But the issue there is I need a way to place and newline after the text without the user having to specify it. Thanks ahead for all the help!
