A session is your server or applications idea of a person. In default PHP, when you create a session, a cookie is sent to the browser for storage. Every time the browser makes a request, it will send the cookie along and the server will lookup the information it has associated with that cookie. Sessions are good for storing user settings or server information because the user only ever sees the session key. With cookies you can set a preference independent of the user or session at your site. Like the style of the page or whether this is a shared browser. This information will be sent with requests from that browser, so can be accessible from server scripts. The bonus with cookies is that javascript can use their values for processing without backend support (for static pages), and that the user can change them themselves. Good advice above should be followed: put nothing in cookies you wouldn't want anyone to see. Not only can the user see them, anyone with access to the users computer or the network connection between you and the user can see them.
