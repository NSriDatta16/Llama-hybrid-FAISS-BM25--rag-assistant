Using Trend as a feature in time series sliding window?

I have a time series, and i am using overlapping sliding window to extract features from each window and label it accordingly. In this Overlapping window of size n, i want to extract trend (linear fit) and use as a feature, any ideas how can i use it, for now i am taking slope coefficient and intercept as a feature from each window. is taking slope and intercept of linear fit in a window as feature is okay, or are there any other techniques i can use? Because my goal is to consider trend of each window in to DL model. Please give your suggestions and ask for more clarification if required. UPDATE: The blue box is window_1 (blue box), i am extracting features for each window and labeling them, as we can see the linear trend (approx, red line) in this window is slightly upward, and in window_2 (violet box) it is downward, i want to put this information in terms of features, how to do that? is taking coefficients of slope and intercept sufficient or something else i should do? So in Deep Learning model entire window will be one observation. Thanks, and i hope it should be more clear now.
