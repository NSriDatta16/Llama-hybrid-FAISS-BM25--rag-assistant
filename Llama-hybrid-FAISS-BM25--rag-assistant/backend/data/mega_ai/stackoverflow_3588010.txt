You can use the join ($this->db->join();) methods provided by the active record library to specify how to connect the two tables but if you're looking for more ORM style retrieval try the Doctrine Library for Codeigniter I'm not 100% sure if it will support it but it's what frameworks like symfony use to get this behavior. The new version of Codeigniter (2.0) will include a more ORM style model retrieval. ORM is one of the big reasons for Kohana (a fork of Codeigniter) that actually includes try active record.
