endence of this space. She labels the former as exploratory creativity and the latter as transformational creativity, seeing the latter as a form of creativity far more radical, challenging, and rarer than the former. Following the criteria from Newell and Simon elaborated above, we can see that both forms of creativity should produce results that are appreciably novel and useful (criterion 1), but exploratory creativity is more likely to arise from a thorough and persistent search of a well-understood space (criterion 3) -- while transformational creativity should involve the rejection of some of the constraints that define this space (criterion 2) or some of the assumptions that define the problem itself (criterion 4). Boden's insights have guided work in computational creativity at a very general level, providing more an inspirational touchstone for development work than a technical framework of algorithmic substance. However, Boden's insights are also the subject of formalization, most notably in the work by Geraint Wiggins. Generation and evaluation The criterion that creative products should be novel and useful means that creative computational systems are typically structured into two phases, generation and evaluation. In the first phase, novel (to the system itself, thus P-Creative) constructs are generated; unoriginal constructs that are already known to the system are filtered at this stage. This body of potentially creative constructs is then evaluated, to determine which are meaningful and useful and which are not. This two-phase structure conforms to the Geneplore model of Finke, Ward and Smith, which is a psychological model of creative generation based on empirical observation of human creativity. Jordanous and Keller emphasize the need for a "tractable and well-articulated model of creativity." They extracted 694 creativity words derived from a corpus of empirical studies in psychology and creativity research spanning 60 years and clustered them based on lexical similarity. As a result, they identify 14 key components of creativity, which form the basis of the framework "Standardised Procedure for Evaluating Creative Systems" (SPECS). These components include aspects like "dealing with uncertainty," "independence and freedom," "social interaction and communication," and "spontaneity & subconscious processing". Co-creation While much of computational creativity research focuses on independent and automatic machine-based creativity generation, many researchers are inclined towards a collaboration approach. This human-computer interaction is sometimes categorized under the creativity support tools development. These systems aim to provide an ideal framework for research, integration, decision-making, and idea generation. Recently, deep learning approaches to imaging, sound and natural language processing, resulted in the modeling of productive creativity development frameworks. Innovation Computational creativity is increasingly being discussed in the innovation and management literature as the recent development in AI may disrupt entire innovation processes and fundamentally change how innovations will be created. Philip Hutchinson highlights the relevance of computational creativity for creating innovation and introduced the concept of "self-innovating artificial intelligence" (SAI) to describe how companies make use of AI in innovation processes to enhance their innovative offerings. SAI is defined as the organizational utilization of AI with the aim of incrementally advancing existing or developing new products, based on insights from continuously combining and analyzing multiple data sources. As AI becomes a general-purpose technology, the spectrum of products to be developed with SAI will broaden from simple to increasingly complex. This implies that computational creativity leads to a shift of creativity-related skills for humans. Veale and Pérez y Pérez consider "optimal innovation" proposed by Giora et al
