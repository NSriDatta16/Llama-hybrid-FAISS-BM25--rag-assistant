You can use BIO encodding ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging) ): mark whole the region that contains names with Is (including separators - I would deal with them later) and the rest characters with Os plus B for the Beginning. This is a problem of sequence labelling there is a number of alternatives to RNN, like LSTM, HMM and variations, CRF and hybrids.
