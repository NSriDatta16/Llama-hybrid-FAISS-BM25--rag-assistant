A couple of extra notes on top of what @RobertLong already answered: As Robert also noted, the interpretation of the coefficients from generalized linear mixed models are conditional on the random effects. Most often this is not the interpretation you are looking for. For more info on this check here . You have fitted the model with the default Laplace approximation. This may be inaccurate, especially for dichotomous data. You should better fit the model with the adaptive Gaussian quadrature by specifying a value much greater than one for the nAGQ argument of glmer() .
