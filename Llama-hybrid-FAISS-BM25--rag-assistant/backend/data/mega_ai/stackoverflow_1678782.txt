My open source project #SNMP Suite has a tiny project named "TestAgent". It is a WinForms based small utility to test out very basic SNMP agent functionality. This is what I use to test out #SNMP MIB Browser. It is far from mature. But if you like, it shows how to use #SNMP library to send and receive SNMP packets. If you want to port something from other languages, snmp4j has a test agent too in Java. http://sharpsnmplib.codeplex.com
