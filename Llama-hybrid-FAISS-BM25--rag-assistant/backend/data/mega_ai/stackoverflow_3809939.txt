As everybody said #pragma is used to disable the warning coded 4530 .. But from MSDN , C++ exception handler used, but unwind semantics are not enabled. Specify /EHsc Also, When the /EHsc option has not been enabled, an object with automatic storage in the frame, between the function doing the throw and the function catching the throw, will not be destroyed. To get rid of this, Compile the sample with /EHsc to resolve the warning. It is unwise to disable all the warnings as they creep in. And in this case instead of silencing it, you can compile it with the /EHsc option... Hope it helps..
