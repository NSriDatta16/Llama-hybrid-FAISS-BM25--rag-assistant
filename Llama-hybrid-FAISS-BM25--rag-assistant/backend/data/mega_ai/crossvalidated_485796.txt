Armistead (2016) provides the solution, which is that the score - which he calls Doolittle’s $i_1$ - should in fact be rendered as $\frac{(ad-bc)^2}{(a+b)(a+c)(b+d)(c+d)}$ Armistead explains on p.65 that The equations from Doolittle’s era display an obsolete notation, and are occasionally misstated. Hogan and Mason (2012, table 3.3, p. 36, and p. 52) represent Doolittle’s $i_1$ as $\frac{(ad-bc)}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)(b+d)(c+d)}}$ , which yields the square root of Doolittle’s $i_1$ instead of the true value. This appears to be a substantive misunderstanding of Doolittle’s measure; the authors also incorrectly represent $i_1$ as being the equivalent of $\sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n}}$ instead of $\frac{\chi^2}{n}$ .
