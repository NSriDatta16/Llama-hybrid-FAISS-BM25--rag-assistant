The expected value is a priori very abstract and there is no reason to think that it's the most probable outcome; as other have point out, it's easy to construct random variables for which $$P( X = E(X) ) = 0$$ (and the same with density if $X$ is continuos) The only justification for the expected value, and the reason why we "expect to see it often", is the Law of large numbers : if you have $n$ independent identically distributed variables $X_i$, then $$\frac {X_1 + \dots + X_n}{n} \to E(X)$$ (for a suitable meaning of $\to$ which is pointless to investigate at the moment) What does it mean? Imagine that you throw a coin with probability $p> \frac 12$ of landing head, which we will associate with the number $1$, and probability $1-p$ of landing tail (that is, $0$). What is the most probable outcome? 1! (that is, head) What is the expected value? $$E(X) = 1\cdot p + 0\cdot(1-p) = p$$ Now clearly "p" will never happen (it's either head or tail, either 0 or 1). But launch the coin 10.000 times ,and record the times it came up head over the total number of throws. This number captures what we intuitively think of average ("average number of heads"). And the law of large numbers tells you that this number will be close to $E(X) = p$
