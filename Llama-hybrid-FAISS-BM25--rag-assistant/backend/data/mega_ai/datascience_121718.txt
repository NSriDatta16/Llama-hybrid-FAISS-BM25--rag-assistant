Generate Synthetic Data Indicating Original data's Trend

I am using timeGAN from ydata-synthetic repo. Given a trained model synth , we generate synthetic data by: synth_data = synth.sample(2000) This will generate 2000 sequences randomly. My question is, what if the original data has trend, and we wish to generate synthetic data which indicates the trend (similar size as original data)? For example, suppose original data looks like below and somehow we wish to generate synthetic data which also indicates the trend. Is it possible to do it? What I can think of is to increase seq_len to properly cover the trend. Please help. Thanks.
