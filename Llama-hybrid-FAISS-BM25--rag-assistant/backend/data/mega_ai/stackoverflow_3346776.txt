I'm not really sure i'm answering the correct question. I'm thinking "if i pass a function a symbol instead of a value how can it use the value that symbol represents? is that close? (def a 4) (defn my-inc [x] (+ (eval x) 1)) user> (my-inc 'a) 5 I'm sure there is a more elegant way than using eval.
