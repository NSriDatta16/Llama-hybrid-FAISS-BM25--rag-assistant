No. Age is a continuous variable and should not be binned (if this can be avoided). Same for BMI. Most $\chi^2$ tests treat variables as nominal, which would waste a lot of information in your case (assuming you have continuous data). If you want to estimate the association between BMI and age, consider calculating Pearson's r or Kendall's $\tau$. If you want to test whether BMI is distributed similarly (homoskedastic) across the range of age in your data, consider the Breuschâ€“Pagan test .
