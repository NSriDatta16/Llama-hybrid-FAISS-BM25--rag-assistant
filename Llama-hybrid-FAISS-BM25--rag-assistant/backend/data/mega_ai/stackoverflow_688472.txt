Remembering terminal states in OS X (like Fluid for the shell...)

I have a few different things open in the terminal whenever I'm developing -- log tailing, Ruby console, plain shell in a certain directory, and so on. How do I: start all those things at once, hopefully in the right position on the screen? make them distinct so I can switch to them with Quicksilver / Alt-Tab? Fluid solved this problem with all of my web apps, so now I want to do it with my terminals. And while we're on the topic, has anyone found a working solution for getting OS X to remember window positions on an external monitor? If I unplug it and plug it back in, I have to drag everything back to the same position (although at least Mercury Mover makes it possible to do it with the keyboard.)
