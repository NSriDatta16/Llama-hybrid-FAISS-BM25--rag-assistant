You said your integer-valued variables have a fixed range, which makes things relatively easy. You will need to encode them as several features rather than one. If they are categorical (there is no inherent natural order within them), you can use one-hot encoding (i.e. the "fifth option" is represented as (0,0,0,0,1,0,0)), this is the common practice. If they are ordinal (discrete, but with an order), using one-hot is possible, but it's even better to use (1,1,1,1,1,0,0). The closest reference I'm aware of is "A neural network approach to ordinal regression" . PS: If they can assume arbitrarily high values, it depends on the problem and goals at hand. For example, they can be represented as one variable with an accordingly adjusted cost function.
