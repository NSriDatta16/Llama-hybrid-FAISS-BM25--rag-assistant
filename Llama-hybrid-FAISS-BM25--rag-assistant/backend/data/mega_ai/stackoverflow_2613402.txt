See if binding the event only to mouseup helps: $(document.body).bind("mouseup", function(e) { if ((window.getSelection().toString() != "") && (!ContextMenu.shown)) { ContextMenu.show(e); } }); From what I unserstand you don't need to bind it to the mousedown event. I think, if you bind it to the mousedown event and the user makes a selection by dragging the mouse (and pressing the button), your context menu is shown ( mousedown ) and the click handler is bound to the document while the mouse button is still pressed . Thus, after releasing the mouse button (as of finishing the selection), a click is performed and the previously bound click handler gets executed , making the menu disappear again. I could be wrong though ;)
