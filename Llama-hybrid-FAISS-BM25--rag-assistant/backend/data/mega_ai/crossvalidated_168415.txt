Random forest in R using unbalanced data

I'm trying to build a Random Forest classifier in R that will identify people with a diagnosis. In the ecological setting (medical examination) there will probably be a rough 50%/50% proportion, but in my training set I have data from the general population, so I have ~1400/180 N. If I sample 180 N from the non-diagnosed sample I get roughly 90% accuracy in both groups (fair, but I want a bit better). If I use the entire dataset, I get 98% accuracy for nonclinical and 60% for clinical (useless). I have ~150 features, and the other psychometrics of the tool/data set are very good. I'm trying to use the classwt argument to correct with weights, but can't get anything useful out of it. forest
