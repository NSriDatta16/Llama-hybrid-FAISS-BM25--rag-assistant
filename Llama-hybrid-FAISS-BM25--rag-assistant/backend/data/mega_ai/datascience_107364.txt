Tableau Calculated Field Help

Tableau newbie here would really appreciate some help with a calculated field. Let's say I have some data: Patient ID Appointment Date 10001 1/1/2019 10001 4/5/2018 10001 2/3/2021 10002 3/2/2019 10002 3/5/2018 10003 1/1/2019 10003 1/3/2021 I want to get the previous appointment date in a separate column, based on the sorted ascending appointment date per patient. I'd like my output to be: Patient ID Appointment Date Previous Appointment Date 10001 1/1/2019 4/5/2018 10001 4/5/2018 NULL 10001 2/3/2021 1/1/2019 10002 3/2/2019 3/5/2018 10002 3/5/2018 NULL 10003 1/1/2019 NUll 10003 1/3/2021 1/1/2019 Eventually, I want to get the average time between each appointment. I've attempted using LOD functions with window functions, but I can't figure out how to partition based on Patient ID (but I could be doing it wrong). Would anyone have any ideas on how I can achieve the output I want? Thanks in advance!
