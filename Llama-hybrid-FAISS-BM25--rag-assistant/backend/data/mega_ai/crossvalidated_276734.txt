Principal component analysis on signal â€¦ dealing with replicates

I have a spectrum data (wavelength(x) versus absorption(y)) for 25 unique samples that is almost exactly to the problem presented in this thesis: https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui//bitstream/handle/11250/2371385/12296_FULLTEXT.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y . I have about 10 samples that are one kind of biological sample and 15 that are another. For each sample there are 6 highly similar but different replicates (for a total of 25x6 datasets). See attached image of one. I can handle the test and validation sets, however I don't know how to handle the replicates. My thoughts are to: Average the Y values to produce a single dataset, Randomly pick one replicate for each sample and throw the others away, Treat all replicates as unique individual observations (essentially 125 of them), or Something else. I suspect that; #1 is invalid, #2 will end up losing a lot of data, and #3 is statistically improper. What is the correct solution?
