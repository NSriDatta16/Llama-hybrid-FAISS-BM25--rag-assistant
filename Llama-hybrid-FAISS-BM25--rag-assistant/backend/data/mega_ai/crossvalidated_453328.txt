Empirical results of Machine Learning/Deep Learning in practice

The machine learning community often talks about over-fitting and other statistical issues. Are there any stats on how many models actually fail to reproduce good results after being deployed in actual use cases? In many projects stakeholders might not even notice that deploying a ML model in fact hurt their business than whatever was used before. Or maybe the idea of marketing "Machine/Deep Learning or AI" as a companies flagship in itself helps get some more business (even if the intelligent part makes things worse). In this regard, is there a paper that discusses how far applied machine learning has come?
