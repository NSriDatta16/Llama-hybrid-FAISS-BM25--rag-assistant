Best practice is a social phenomenon, depending on the society that you will be working in, so your best answer would be to read existing MIPS asm code from whatever environment you expect to interact with. Examples that come to mind from my own world are the assembler sections of Linux kernel, the MIPS startup code from GCC or the assembler fragments of the MIPS port of glibc. If you'll primarily be interacting with other projects, it's best to absorb and imitate the coding practices of that community.
