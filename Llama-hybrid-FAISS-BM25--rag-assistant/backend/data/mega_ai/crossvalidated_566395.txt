You can use linear models for ordinal dependent variables. This requires slightly stricter assumptions than the more advanced ordinal response models, but you can still do it, in the same way you can perform a linear regression with a binary outcome variable. It may not be the most appropriate model and there may be other forms of models that yield more accurate predictions or a better fit to the data, but that doesn't mean the simpler models are wholly inappropriate. If you are a first year psychology undergrad and are being asked to find the relationship between predictors and an outcome, you are being asked to use linear regression. Ordinal regression isn't even taught to most grad students in psychology (i.e., you can get a PhD in psychology and never learn about ordinal response models, even if you use ordinal dependent variables in your research); it is considered an advanced statistical method. If you are interested in learning about it, I recommend you do so, but you should start with logistic regression for binary responses first (and some psychology grad students don't even learn that!).
