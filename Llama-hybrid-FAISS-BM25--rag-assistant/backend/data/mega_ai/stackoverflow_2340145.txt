Note that usage of named mutexes is discouraged for security reasons. Any process (even one running under guest account) can create a mutex with the same name before your process was started. Solving these security problems is usually harder than just not using named mutex at all. To solve your problem, you just need to store process handler or process ID and then look for a window with that process ID. This is similar to the way task manager works.
