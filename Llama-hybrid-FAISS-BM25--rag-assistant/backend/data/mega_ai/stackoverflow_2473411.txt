I have the solution in a few steps, this is the plan we are not going to create a service project with a a windows form, instead we are going to create a visual studio solution that contains a windows service project, a windows form project and a setup project. The idea is to have a database or a file or anything you are comfortable with storing data in which you would store the parameters your windows service will always use to run. So your windows service and your windows form application should be able to modify and retrieve data from it. To the Main Form Of Your Windows Application drag and drop a NotifyIcon on the form, in the properties tab, browse and select an .ico image(You can sreate one in visual studio but that is another topic you can get on google or contact me) That it will display in the system tray when you run the application and the main form is active or shown, try it, run the application. Add both of them as outputs in the setup project of the solution. To Add a project to a setup project they must be in the same solution. Right click the setup project in the solution explorer, highlight add and then select project output, add the windows service and the windows form outputs and you will see them in the solution explorer under the setup project. adding a windows service goes further than this but that also is another topic google it Creating shortcut for the windows application and adding it to the startup folder is also another topic google or contact me. NOTE Program your form in such a way that the close button doesn't show and the form goes Me.visible = false and double clicking the icon in the system tray is the only way to set me.visible=true.that way anytime the computer starts up, your windows form application is also started and visible is immediately set to false but since it has a notifyicon with an icon image, it will show in the system tray and double clicking it makes the form visible to edit the settings that you are storing for the service, the service also starts automatically since you would have set it in setting up the service in the setup project. my mail is iamjavademon@gmail.com for a better illustration using screen shots And explain in full
