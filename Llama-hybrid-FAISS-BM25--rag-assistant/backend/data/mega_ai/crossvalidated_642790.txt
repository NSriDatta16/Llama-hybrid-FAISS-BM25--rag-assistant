The answer is: it depends . All papers on synthetic data analysis report the result across multiple datasets. That is because as with standard ML there is no single best algorithm for prediction, the same extends to data generation. For example, let's look at TabDDPM: Modelling Tabular Data with Diffusion Models by Kotelnikov et al. where they look at 15 datasets, while some methods are consistently good, no method is outright bad. (Side-comment: CTGAN is not SOTA for tabular data - diffusion model are) Our dataset characteristics make a big difference. Synthetic data from the services mentioned have the following properties: A lot of preprocessing AND post-processing done to them before we get them. That saves us time as well as gives us (some) quality assurances. (e.g. for PII information, for missing values, etc.) They are (very often) generated by algorithms that have been trained not only to our query dataset, but also additional ones that have similar characteristics. That often allows them to appear more natural as well as potentially enhance their external validity. Almost certainly come from a known algorithm we already have access too. Because of their size, most (all) of these companies don't have dedicated R&D departments, so they will have to methodology-wise shop from "outside", like the rest of us. So, are the synthetic data generated by specialised data generation services better than what we could produce ourselves? Maybe . In any case, if you consider using these services, I would strongly urge you to: a. have your own baselines beforehand and b. compare between different services before committing to one. As you mention yourself, running something like a simple TVAE or CTGAN to compare against what a paid service offers, is not prohibitively difficult. Similarly, based on my personal experience, synthesized data from external providers can be of vastly different "quality" levels; being able to compare between multiple ones was an eye-opener.
