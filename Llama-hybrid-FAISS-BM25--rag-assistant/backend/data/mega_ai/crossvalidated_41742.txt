Server Monitoring

I am trying to code a program that reads the status of a list of servers, records the time they fail, stores it , and using this data it chooses a server that will MOST probably fail next time, and shows it. I will need some help to approach this problem. Will you suggest a Markov Chain Model? or something else?
