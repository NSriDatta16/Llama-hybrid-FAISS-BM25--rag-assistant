Assume that you have a viewController and a xib file which has a UILabel on this. The steps to connection the UiLabel (also the xib file) your viewController are: 1) In the header file, create UiLabel object and property for it IBOutlet UILabel *label; @Property (Nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UILabel *label; and synchthesize it in implement file 2) Open your xib file in Interface Builder Double click on "File's Owner" then select the viewController in dropdownlist of pop-up windows to connect your xib file to controller 3) right-click on file's owner, on the pop-up dialog: point and drag the plush (+) next to "View" and drop it on View row point and drag the plush (+) next to "label" and drop it on the label on the view => now the label and the view on xib file is connected to you controller
