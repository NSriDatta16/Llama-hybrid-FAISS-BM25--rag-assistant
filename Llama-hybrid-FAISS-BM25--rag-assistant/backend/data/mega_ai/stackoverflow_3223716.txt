"I would rather choose fast-executing dirty code over something which might be more elegant or clean, but slower." If I were writing a pixel renderer for a game, perhaps I'd consider doing this - however, when responding to a user's click on a button, for example, I'd always favour the slower, elegant approach over quick-and-dirty (unless slow > a few seconds, when I might reconsider). I have to agree with the other posts - profile to determine where your slow points are and then deal with those. Writing optimal code from the outset is more trouble than its worth, you'll usually find that what you think will be slow will be just fine and the real slow areas will surprise you.
