"On/off problem" resources

I need to study in depth the on/off problem with different approaches: frequentist, bayesian - frequentist hybrid, profile likelihood. The on/off problem is a counting experiment where you observe $n_{on}$ events when the source is "on" in the time $T_{on}$ and $n_{off}$ events when the source is "off" in time $T_{off}$ and you want to make inferences about the source power (the simpler case power > 0 ?) Do you know some good books? Some references on the problem: Tucker 2008 Cousins Linemann & Tucker 2008 Cranmer 2011 (page 36)
