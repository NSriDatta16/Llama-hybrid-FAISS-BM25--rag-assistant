I agree with @Maarten Buis in broad terms, but more can be said. The predictors for this problem are not well explained, but appear to be indicators for soil type. An objection in principle to linear regression with a percent response is that the predicted value can go outside $[0, 1]$ or $[0, 100\%]$, which is absurd scientifically (biologically, in this case) as well as statistically. However, whether it does that within the range of your data is an empirical point and in some cases the linear regression and the logistic regression may yield very similar predictions. However, if you have any values near or at $0$ and/or near or at $100\%$ it is unlikely that a linear fit will be a good idea. A related but not identical point is that nonlinearity within the range is more plausible than linearity. A further related point is that variability can not be constant. As the mean goes to $0$, the variance goes to $0$ too, as the only way the mean can be $0$ is if all values are $0$. A similar point applies to $100\%$: if the mean is $100\%$, then the variance is $0$. That also motivates working with logits. On your comment that "a percentage is not a quantitative variable in the way that blood pressure is a quantitative variable". It is difficult to know what you are driving at here. A percent scale is often, as it appears to be here, essentially a scale for the mean of a binary variable. It is different from counted or measured variables, but no less valid.
