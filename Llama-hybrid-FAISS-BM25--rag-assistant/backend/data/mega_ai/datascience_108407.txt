Are most deep learning models online learning models?

I'm online learning starter. from my perspective, online learning model is the model which can update its paramater with data flows(I've seen a article pointing out that incremental model is irrevalent of time while online learning emphasizes the data flows in time-series). Here I regard them as one thing. And in my view, most deep learning can be fine tuned,as we fine-tune a pre-trained bert model, is that means a deep learning model can be fine tuned is equivalent to the deep learning model is a online learning model only if I receive the data flow as soon as possible. BTW, I Googled online learning, result relevant to this are rarely found, so as to Google scholar. Is this field is not hot anymore? Or I entered wrong keyword,Please let me know. Thank you.
