Region Proposal Network is a subcomponent of the Fast RCNN and Faster RCNN architectures. It proposes candidate boxes and scores whether there is an object in this regions. RPN loss and objectness loss must be losses of this predictions. Regressor loss is the loss of the prediction of bounding box coordinates, and classifier loss is the loss of prediction of object classes in bounding boxes. IOU is acronym for intersection over union, and it gives how much bounding boxes are overlapped. In RPN it is calculated between suggested boxes(anchors), and ground truths. Higher IOU scores means suggested box includes an object of interest. Average precision is the average of the areas under the precision recall curve for each of the object classes.
