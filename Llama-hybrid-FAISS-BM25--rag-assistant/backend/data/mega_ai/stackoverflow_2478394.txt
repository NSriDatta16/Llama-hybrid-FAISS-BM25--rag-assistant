Easiest would be to use Mootools or jQuery. Both have "drag" interfaces to handle this sort of thing, and handle all the cross-browser compatibility problems. If you're fixed on rolling your own, then the basic process is to attach mousedown/mouseup events on the parent div to initiate the dragging stuff, slap a handler on mousemove to capture the motion events, and adjust the parent div's scroll offsets as appropriate.
