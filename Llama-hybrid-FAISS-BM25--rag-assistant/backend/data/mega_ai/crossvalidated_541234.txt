What you're referring to in the first part of the question, is the beta-binomial model . where binomial distribution is assumed as the likelihood and beta as a prior, hence by conjugacy posterior is also a beta distribution. Your problem description in the second part describes a different scenario because it is multivariate. If you know that $p_1 > p_2$ , this means that the parameters are dependent and you are talking about some multivariate distribution for the parameters (vs two univariate beta distributions). In such a case, you cannot use two (independent) beta-binomial models. The constraint can be imposed by choosing a multivariate prior for the parameters. For such a model you won't have a closed-form solution, so you would need to use MCMC or some other kind of approximate inference.
