There are a variety of uses for offsets in logistic regression, whether for specific factors or the outputs of other models. For specific factors, they may be included or excluded from the final implementation. Included, if the goal is fix them in the final model, whether to force assumptions (based upon past experience) or restrict influence. Excluded, if the goal is to control for those factors {maturity effect, disparate impact}. For model outputs they can be i) part of a full development process to stage in groups of variables; ii) to incorporate new data sources in new samples without affecting the original model; iii) to validate a model's ranking abilitys pre- or post-implementation.
