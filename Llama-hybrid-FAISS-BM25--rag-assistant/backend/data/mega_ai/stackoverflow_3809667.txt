Thanks to Margus' direction, I focused on getting the image before extracting the pixel information. Here's a workable solution using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) , which requires Python 2.x. import ImageGrab import time time.clock() image = ImageGrab.grab() for y in range(0, 100, 10): for x in range(0, 100, 10): color = image.getpixel((x, y)) print(time.clock()) I don't think it gets any simpler than that. This takes (on average) 0.1 seconds, which is a little slower than I'd like but fast enough. As for having Python 3.x and 2.x both installed, I separated that into a new question . I'm still having some trouble with it, but it's generally working.
