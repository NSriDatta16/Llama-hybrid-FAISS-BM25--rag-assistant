I haven't tried this myself, but here are the steps that /should/ work. This needs to be a C#/VB/etc script. Change the definition of the class to contain a /new/ member of type datetime. Run the linq query to load all the rows from the table, and run a for loop which will populate new datetime variable based on old string variable. Save the objects to table. //now your table storage contains objects with new and old definition of that variable Remove the old field from class definition Load the objects from table again and save them w/o doing anything but marking them dirty. This /should/ get rid of the old member from serialized structures inside the table. Now, if you want the new datetime field to take the name of the original string variable do steps 1 thru 5 again, this time moving the data from one field into another. The only difference is that you don't have to do conversion again. In general, this is a complete PITA and one of the banes of object databases and storage services.
