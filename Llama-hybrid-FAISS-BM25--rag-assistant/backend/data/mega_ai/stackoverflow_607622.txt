You want to have postfix deliver to a local mailbox, and then use a webmail system for people to access that stored mail. Don't get hung up on postfix - it just a transfer agent - it takes messages from one place, and puts them somewhere else, it doesn't store messages. So postfix will take the messages over SMTP, and put them in local mail files. Then IMAP or some webmail system will display those messages to your users. If you want the mail integrated in your webapp, then you should probably run an IMAP server, and use python IMAP libraries to get the messages.
