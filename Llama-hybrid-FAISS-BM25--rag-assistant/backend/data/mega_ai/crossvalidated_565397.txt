How to interpret RMSE of 0 with a lot of features

I have 122 features for a regression problem. Here are some stats on a random forest model using RMSE: With no scaling or dimensionality reduction: Train RMSE: 0.0 Test RMSE: 0.0 CV RMSE: 0.0 With scaling and dimensionality reduction to 2 components: Train RMSE: 0.03 Test RMSE: 0.01 CV RMSE: 0.03 How can I tell if the model without scaling/dimensionality reduction is overfitting if the RMSE is 0 for all cases? I know you should scale before regression and PCA, but why does that seem to be performing better? Or it is just misleading with the 0s?
