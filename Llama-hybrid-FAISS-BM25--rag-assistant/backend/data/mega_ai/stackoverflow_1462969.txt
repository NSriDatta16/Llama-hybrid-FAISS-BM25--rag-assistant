The java.awt.color namespace seems to only concern itself with color spaces. There's no such concept in .Net as a color space. Everything in .Net is based on RGB (RGB color space) except perhaps some new XAML attributes in WPF. The java.awt.color namespace includes considerations for such ideas as CMYK ( C yan, M agenta, Y ellow b L ack) which is used in printing applications only. My guess is that unless you are indeed working on an application that sends CMYK color data to a printer then you don't need to worry about it. The colors in .Net are based around RGB or aRGB (even the gray scale. The RGB values are simply all equal so RGB(128,128,128=MediumGray)
