It is always a good idea to keep your css files and javascripts organized within your web application. Have two main folders 'styles' and 'scripts' in the root folder of your application. Inside each of these folders, create sub folders that reflect specific module in your app like 'jquery', 'blueprint' etc and place those files over there.
