Trim bar like the GarageBand and iMovie ones

I'm creating a Mac app which needs a trim bar like the GarageBand and iMovie ones. I need a library to get the audio waves to draw them on a NSView. Anyone knows a good library for that? I think he was referring to the track editor (cut/copy/paste/move).
