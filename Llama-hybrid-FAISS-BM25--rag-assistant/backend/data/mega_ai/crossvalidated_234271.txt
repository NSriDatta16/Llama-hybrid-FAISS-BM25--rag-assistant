PCA in the case when all directions have equal variance

In the case where I have an orthogonal $m \times n$ matrix $X$, and the covariance matrix of $X$, let's call it $C$, is such that $C_{ii} = 1$ for all $i$ such that $1 \le i \le n$ and $C_{ij}=0$ otherwise, how would I pick the direction of maximal variance for PCA, given that each direction has equal variance? Could I just pick any direction in my matrix $X$?
