Python already has a free module that can handle topic modelling in text. You may want just want to use that because text processing can be dirty business (a lot of junk), so I would use their modules located here and you can read about the algorithms separately. A good introduction to statistical nlp is ofcourse Christopher Manning Foundations of Statistical NLP book. A very popular indexing algorithm is the Latent Semantic Indexing algorithm found here .
