How to display a "busy" indicator with jQuery?

How do I display a spinning "busy" indicator at a specific point in a web page? I want to start/stop the indicator when an Ajax request commences/completes. Is it really just a matter of showing/hiding an animated gif, or is there a more elegant solution?
