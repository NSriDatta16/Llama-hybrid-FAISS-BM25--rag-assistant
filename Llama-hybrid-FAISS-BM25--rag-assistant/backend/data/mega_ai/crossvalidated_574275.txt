Your model is a regression with a (linear) time component and a time-treatment interaction. Otherwise you explain nothing about the problem or the data you are working with. In this very general setting, you cannot interpret regression coefficients (either main effects or interactions) causally without further assumptions about the data generating process. The reason: correlation is not causation as you probably already know. Regression tells us something about the relationships between the outcome Y and the predictors X and T (ie, about correlations). Extra conditions are required to interpret those relationships as causal. In other words, it's true that if X causes Y and its causal effect increases/decreases with time, then the interaction term is non-zero. But the interaction term is non-zero under a variety of other situations where X doesn't cause Y . Since there is no generic argument that regression reveals causal effects, you need to focus on your specific problem/data/question to demonstrate causality.
