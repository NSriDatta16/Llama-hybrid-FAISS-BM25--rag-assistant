Yes, in general, you can. This approach you want to use is sometimes called "Micro-Averaging": first, sum all TN s, FP s, etc for each class, and then calculate the statistic of interest. Another way to combine the statistics for individual classes is to use so-called "Macro-Averaging": here you first calculate the statistics for individual classes (A vs not A, B vs not B, etc), and then calculate the average of them. You may have a look here for some extra details. The page talks about Precision and Recall, but I believe it applies to Matthew's coefficient as well as other statistics based on contingency tables.
