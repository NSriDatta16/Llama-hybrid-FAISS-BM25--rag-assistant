I come from a traditional biostatistics/epidemiology background, and EDA are definitely useful, although it doesn't mean doing histograms/correlation plots just for the sake of it. With the preeminence of machine learning and prediction, I do feel that it is practiced less and less often these days though. If you are in medical statistics/epidemiology, then you are usually presented with "rectangular" datasets, i.e. datasets where your rows correspond to individual participants, and columns are variables (features in machine learning terms). You typically only focus on the variables that are relevant to your questions, and that generally won't be more than a dozen or so. It is of course possible that you have more. For example, you may have data collected over time, or biomarkers, or even genetic data. In these cases, you will need to find out the best practices for dealing with these data first. Often this will involve some kind of dimension reduction or summarization. What we emphatically don't do is to just throw everything into a machine learning model and see what predictions it generates. In other words, there's a strong emphasis on understanding your model. Given the emphasis on understanding the model, EDA is indispensable in that it helps us to identify reasons for various unexpected behaviour or bias in our model fitting. For example, there may be one variable you expect to be very important, and it turned out that it wasn't. You look at the histogram, and you see that the vast majority of it were 0. Or Likewise, there may be patterns in missing data, and you need to understand them and how they may bias your results. In summary, EDA is not something you do before your main analysis and forget about. It's something you keep doing together with your main analysis, to try and understand the picture better.
