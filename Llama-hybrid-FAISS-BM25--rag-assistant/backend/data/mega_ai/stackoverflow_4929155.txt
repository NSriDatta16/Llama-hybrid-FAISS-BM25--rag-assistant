Magento V2_SOAP Problem/ Error

Before today my Magento soap worked fine, i could do a logon and a session string would be returned. I have tried the same thing today and it did not work. version 1.4.2.0 I have tried to connect to 2 different Domains, with each set up with magento and i get the same error. Can anyone tell me why that would be? this is the error i am getting. {"Possible SOAP version mismatch: Envelope namespace http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/ was unexpected. Expecting http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/ ."} and this is the code i use with Web Reference string url = "Url"; string apiUser = "User"; string apiKey = "Key"; _magentoService = new MagentoService(); _magentoService.Url = url; var logOn = _magentoService.login(apiUser, apiKey); string logon2 = logOn.ToString(); The same problem with version 1.5 stable
