I'm working on prediction of time series and my stacked LSTMs alone does not capture well the trend and seasonality of my data. I decided to add features from a Holts Winter regression as an additional input and the result is way better. It slightly overfits but in my case that's not an issue. In my case, I like the fact that my statistic (holts winter) model can capture well the global trend, and the network can find other non linear relations between datapoints. I guess it's a good idea to combine several models.
