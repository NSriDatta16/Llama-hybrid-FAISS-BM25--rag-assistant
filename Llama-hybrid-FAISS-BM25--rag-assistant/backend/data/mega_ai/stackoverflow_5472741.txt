I can think of two options: You could override the devise invitable controller, see: Anyone have experience with devise_invitable? In my case, I wanted to pass the name of the invitor. I add an integer attribute 'invitor' to the User class. This is the id of the invitor Person. Don't forget to add 'invitor' as attr_accessible in the model. I already had a 'name' string attribute in the User class. In the app/views/{users|devise}/invitations/new.html.erb (path may vary depending on how you generated the views) add a hidden form field with the logged in user (invitor): ... current_user.id, :hidden => true %> ... In the email text app/views/{users|devise}/mailer/invitation.html.erb I can refer to the invitor: ... has invited you to , you can accept it through the link below.... Not that elegant, but it works. Improvements that survive updates of the devise_invitable gem are welcome.
