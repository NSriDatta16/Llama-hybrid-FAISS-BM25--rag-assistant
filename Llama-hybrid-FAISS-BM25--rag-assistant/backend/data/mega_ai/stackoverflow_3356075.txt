using both basic and Integrated authentication

We would like to use Integrated Windows Authentication if a user accesses our SharePoint site from within our organization, and Basic Authentication (using SSL) when someone tries to authenticate from outside our organization. Reading, it seems IE will try Windows Auth no matter what and ignore Basic Auth from outside our organization. This is undesirable because the user is required to enter in the DOMAIN into the login box (users are notorious for calling our helpdesk about this). Basic Auth allows us to specify a default domain. Windows auth does not do this. Hence the desire to use Basic Auth for outside, Windows Auth for inside. What is the solution to enabling Windows Auth inside the network, and Basic Auth outside our network? Do I need to setup two separate sites inside IIS (one for windows auth, another for basic)? Would this require 2 different Host Names? Is there a solution I am not thinking of here? Thanks all.
