How best to hold 1000 different data series using TimeSeries module in Python?

I want to create a massive TimeSeries object which will hold 1000 different financial markets data series, each storing 1500 daily-data points. I'm quite new to the TimeSeries module and am a little confused as to how I would best go about it. So a few basic questions: 1) Should I use a huge numpy array of 1000x1500 and simply feed that to the time series constructor function time_series()? 2) If I do this how will I index each series by name (eg "S&P500" or "GOLD" for example)? I know I will be able to access the array by date, but will I have to have a separate data structure to link series names with their column numbers in the large array? 3) Or should I use a structured data type as per the example given in the docs( http://pytseries.sourceforge.net/core.timeseries.html )? If so, how do I append series one by one to the timeseries, since I don't want to create a massive non-numpy structure to feed to the time_series() constructor in one shot? Advice on where I can get some good examples for financial markets and timeseries module in general would also be appreciated. Thanks.
