In addition to Han's suggestion to average samples, als consider calibrating your threshold value. Under different environments, with different microphones and different audio channels, "silence" can mean a lot of things. The simple way would be loowing to configure the threshold. Alternatively, allow a "Noise floor measurement" where you acqurie a threshold value. Note that the samples are linear, but levels in audio processing are usually given in dB . So depending on yoru target audience, you may want to convert readings and inputs to/from dB.
