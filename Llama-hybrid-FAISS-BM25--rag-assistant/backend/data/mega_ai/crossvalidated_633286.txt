This should be a comment on @turdus-merula's answer, but I don't have enough reputation. In Section 6 of (Schnabel et al., 2015) , the authors found that length-normalized word embeddings also encodes the word frequency information. This could be a counter argument on (Schakel and Wilson, 2015) 's: Word vector length furnishes, in combination with term frequency, a useful measure of word significance.
