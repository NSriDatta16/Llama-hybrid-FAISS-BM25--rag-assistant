Adobe AIR, URLRequest, and local ports

I'm looking at writing an app with Adobe AIR, but I wanted to figure out if this is feasible with the platform first. (Mostly new to Flash and AIR) What I would like to do is know ahead of time what local port a URLRequest will be using. If possible, I would like to hold a connection open even and keep using the same socket. What I'm basically trying to accomplish is doing some NAT-Traversal and port negotiation ahead of time. Once I have both the client and the server negotiated, I'd like them to connect and basically use HTTP in a peer-to-peer way to stream media, like this sample: var s = new air.Sound(); var url = "http://www.example.com/sounds/bigSound.mp3"; var req = new air.URLRequest(url); var context = new air.SoundLoaderContext(8000, true); s.load(req, context); s.play(); The problem is that I don't see this happening unless I can get some information from AIR on what ports it's planning to use. I would be OK with creating my own Socket connections to the server and using them, but I would need a way to leverage the Sound framework to stream in the same way from a socket. Ideas? Thoughts? Thanks!
