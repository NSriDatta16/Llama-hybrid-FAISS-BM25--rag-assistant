Yes, backpropagation is always used for optimization. The algorithm needs to adjust the weights and biases to minimize the cost function. But in computer codes, one doesn't have to do this explicitly. Packages like tensorflow have inbuilt functions for optimization. The convolution layers exist to make sense of the image 'structure'. But after a few such layers, the required features are extracted, and a fully connected layer is used. The fully connected layers are like normal neural network layers (not CNN), where every node can influence every node of the next layer.
