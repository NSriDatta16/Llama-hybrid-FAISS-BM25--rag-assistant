To avoid duplication, overall, I think the Set is probably the data structure of choice. Using the AppUser in the Set of members in the organization probably is the right call. There is nothing wrong with having a bidirectional relationship with entities, they just require a bit of thought and planning. The important thing to be mindful of is which entity controls the relationship so that when you go to add an AppUser to an Organization you do not end up in an infinite loop of additions by trying to use the addOrganization to an AppUser, which then tries to add that user to the organization, etc.
