I take it you are really interested in the prediction of new test scores rather than answering which intervention method is the most succesfull. If this is not the case we can apply statistical methods rather than machine learning models. One approach could be to align the test score sequences (input and output) so that they have the same length and a 0 for missing values. This transposes your data into a regular seq2seq problem feedable to an LSTM. Each record is now comparable. Do keep in mind that your model predicts based on how it was trained. It will predict missing values (missed tests) as well like this. You could then either train on all 80k (minus validation set) sequences or apply windowing to generate more sequences. Other (one hot encoded) features can be added to each sample as well. Beginning or end.
