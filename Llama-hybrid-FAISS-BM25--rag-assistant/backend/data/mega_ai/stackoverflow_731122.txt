I strongly recommend that you use keys rather than passwords. If you use ssh keys properly, you do not need to use expect, as the scp command won't ask for any user input. If you have command line ssh installed, you can make a key like this: ssh-keygen -t dsa Then simply follow the instructions provided, and save the key to the default location. If you put a passphrase on it, you'll need to use some sort of ssh agent, either the command line ssh-agent or pagent on windows. You can also create an ssh key with the putty suite's puttygen. To set up the key for authentication, simply put a copy of id_dsa.pub on the host you want to scp to in the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
