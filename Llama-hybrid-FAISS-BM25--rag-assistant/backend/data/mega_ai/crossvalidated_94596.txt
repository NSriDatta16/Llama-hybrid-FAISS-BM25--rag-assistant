Computational Complexity of Prediction using SVM and NN?

I've seen answers discussing the complexity of training SVMs and neural nets, but how about for predicting new responses once a model has been trained? For context, I'm working on an app that should produce predictions in near real-time given incoming pixel data and I'm looking for a machine learning algorithm that can handle complex separating planes and predict as fast as possible.
