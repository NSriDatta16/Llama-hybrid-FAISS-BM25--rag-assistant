How to consider categorical variables in distance based algorithms like KNN or SVM?

For example lets say I have a dataset with independent features age, gender, name, and income. While my dependent variable is load approval status. If I want to use KNN or SVM, do I need to convert gender into a numerical variable? and if yes, how is it used in algorithms such as KNN or SVM which are distance based algorithms?
