I've experienced problems where SSRS behaves differently when accessing by its FQDN and an IP address. It would help if you can turn on logging and see what the exact error number is. One of the causes is to do with the host headers; SSRS checks to see if they match the local machine or not, and as the IP address you're giving doesn't match the loopback adapter or the local name, it denies the login. This blog has a quick method or two to resolve that, and it will at least knock off one of the possibilities: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/lukaszp/archive/2008/07/18/reporting-services-http-401-unauthorized-host-headers-require-your-attention.aspx
