I have tried with all the CookiePolicy available and also setting "user-agent" stuff without success. From what i see with java - verbose there's a trapped exception in getCookie() method that raises: org.apache.commons.httpclient.util.DateParseException Probably cookie received from site (i can see it with Cookie Editor on firefox) has something not good for httpclient; have a look at this thread for the same problem. From what i see, you need to enable logging and check what httpclient does on cookie parsing.
