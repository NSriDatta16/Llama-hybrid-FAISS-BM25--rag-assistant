This really depends on what browsers you're comparing. For example, Safari Mobile and Safari for Mac are quite similar to one another, so much so that you often see the same page on both. However IE for Pocket PCs is much different than IE8 and pages would render somewhat differently in those two. Usually, site operators check the UserAgent string that all browsers have, to see which browser it is. Then, it's up to the site operator to show a mobile site or a regular site based on whether they want to or not. PPK has a great list of all browser quirks and features, at quirksmode.org .
