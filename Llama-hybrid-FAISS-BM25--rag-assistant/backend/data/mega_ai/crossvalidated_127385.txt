Method to identify the point in which the slope of a predicted probability becomes significant

I'm running a logistic regression in which I'm predicted a binary response from a continuous predictor... I'm interested in determining the exact point in which the predicted probability (exponentiated y-hat / (1 + exponentiated y-hat) becomes significantly different than the average y-hat (or average predicted probability of the discrete event... I was thinking of some sort of Johnson Neyman technique, but am unsure how to begin this exercise... Would like to do this in R at the end of the day, but not required for an answer.
