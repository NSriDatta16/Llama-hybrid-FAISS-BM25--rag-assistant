This is thing that may be hard to understand: if on average 95% of all confidence intervals will contain the parameter and I have one specific confidence interval why isn't the the probability that this interval contains the parameter also 95% ? A confidence interval relates to the sampling procedure. If you would take many samples and calculate a 95% confidence interval for each sample, you'd find that 95% of those intervals contain the population mean. This is useful to for instance industrial quality departments. Those guys take many samples, and now they have the confidence that most of their estimates will be pretty close to the reality. They know that 95% of their estimates are pretty good, but they can't say that about each and every specific estimate. Compare this to rolling dice: if you would roll 600 (fair) dice, how many 6 would you throw? Your best guess is $\frac{1}{6}$ * 600 = 100. However, if you have thrown ONE die, it is useless to say: "There is a 1/6 or 16.6% probability that I have now thrown a 6". Why? Because the die shows either a 6, or some other figure. You have thrown a 6, or not. So the probability is 1, or 0. The probability cannot be $\frac{1}{6}$. When asked before the throw what the probability of throwing a 6 with ONE die would be, a Bayesian would answer "$\frac{1}{6}$" (based on prior information: everybody knows that a die has 6 sides and an equal chance of falling on either of them), but a Frequentist would say "No idea" because frequentism is solely based on the data, not on priors or any outside information. Likewise, if you have only 1 sample (thus 1 confidence interval), you have no way to say how likely it is that the population mean is in that interval. The mean (or any parameter) is either in it, or not. The probability is either 1, or 0. Also, it is not correct that values within the Confidence Interval are more likely than those outside of that. I made a small illustration; everything is measured in °C. Remember, water freezes at 0 °C and boils at 100 °C. The case: in a cold lake, we'd like to estimate the temperature of the water that flows below the ice. We measure the temperature in 100 locations. Here are my data: 0.1 °C (measured in 49 locations); 0.2 °C (also in 49 locations); 0 °C (in 1 location. This was water just about to freeze); 95 °C (in one location, there is a factory that illegally dumps very hot water in the lake). Mean temperature: 1.1 °C; Standard deviation: 1.5 °C; 95%-CI: ( -0.8 °C...... + 3.0 °C). The temperatures within in this confidence interval are definitely NOT more likely than those outside of it. The average temperature of the flowing water in this lake CANNOT be colder than 0°C, otherwise it would not be water but ice. A part of this confidence interval (namely, the section from -0.8 to 0) actually has a 0% probability of containing the true parameter. In conclusion: confidence intervals are a frequentist concept, and therefore are based on the idea of repeated samples. If many researchers would take samples from this lake, and if all those researchers would calculate confidence intervals, then 95% of those intervals will contain the true parameter. But for one single confidence interval it is impossible to say how likely it is that it contains the true parameter.
