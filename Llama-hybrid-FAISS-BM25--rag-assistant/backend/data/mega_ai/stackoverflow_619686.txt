I have had the very same issue as well for many months now. When I open a different tab, start debugging, close a tab, or even sometimes just edit the code, my installation of VS2005 will hang for 5-10 seconds, sometimes longer. I've tried running it without Outlook running, disabling Edit and Continue, enabling the LARGEADDRESSAWARE switch with the Visual Studio Command Line (4gb of RAM in a 32 bit machine), and nothing seems to work. I'm going to try defragging my hard drive this weekend but I don't think that a fragmented hard drive would have such a pronounced effect on an application. If you found a way to fix your problem, I'd really love for you to share it here.
