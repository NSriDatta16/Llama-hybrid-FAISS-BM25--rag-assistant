This happened to a few people that i had to install a click once application i developed. Basically something happened in their installation of .NET and the needed .DLL's were not moved to the GAC. It's very simple to fix, basically You need to copy stdole.dll from C:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\Primary Interop Assemblies\ to C:\Windows\Assembly ... that should fix your issue. Including them in the application isn't the best idea, this will fix it for ALL click once applications rather then just that one you are currently building. P.S. Dragging the files to the location will work, you might get an error if you try to copy it.
