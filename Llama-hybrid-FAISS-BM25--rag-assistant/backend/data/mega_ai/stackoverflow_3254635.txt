If you choose not to embed your swf files, then I found (about 3 years ago) that I had problems getting IE to pick up Flash files from subdirectories. As a work around I had to make sure that the swf file was in the same folder as the page that was accessing it. I'm sure there is a more elegant solution, but in the shorter term that should do the trick.
