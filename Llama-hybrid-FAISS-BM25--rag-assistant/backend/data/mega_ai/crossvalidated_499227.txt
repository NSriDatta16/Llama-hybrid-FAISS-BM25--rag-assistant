On the question "how do I correctly interpret the coefficients of age and age_squared", I favor an answer based on the specific industry. For example, new tech companies in social media needs a CEO with a new perspective and acquaintance with current and upcoming trends (so, likely younger, a negative coefficient on the quadratic term). A computer company that has been around awhile needs a combination of creativity and seasoned marketing skill (so, say middle-aged perhaps, near-zero quadratic coefficient). Conversely, a cyclic natural resource company needs a CEO who is conservative with a longer-term view (so older, a positive quadratic term). So, the age_squared variable could be a possible proxy to account for the characteristic average age of the CEO in industry sectors of existing successful (survivors) companies. [EDIT] Per a comment, explicitly in the case of a negative binomial (NB) regression model where the dependent variable is the number of patents and for independent variables the age of a CEO and its squared term (resulting in an inverse U-shaped relationship), I claim an interpretation from the structural form of the NB regression model, represented as follows: ${_ = exp(ln(_) + _1X1_ + _2X2_ + â‹¯ + _X_i)}$ So implicitly, for a one unit change in the explanatory variable, the difference in the natural logs of expected counts for the response variable is expected to change by the respective regression coefficient, given that other predictor variables in the model are held constant. Per my prior remarks above, for example, with a negative (or positive) coefficient times a positive change in the independent variable, there is a corresponding multiplicative effect on the response count by a factor less (or greater) than one. So, my prior comments above on positive/negative effect should be viewed as in a multiplicative corrective sense, which possibly could indeed result 'in an inverse U-shaped relationship' with a quadratic term.
