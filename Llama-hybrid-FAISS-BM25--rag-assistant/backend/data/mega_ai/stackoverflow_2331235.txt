May I suggest reading the FAQ on SQLite thread safety ? Threads are evil . Avoid them. SQLite is threadsafe. We make this concession since many users choose to ignore the advice given in the previous paragraph. But in order to be thread-safe, SQLite must be compiled with the SQLITE_THREADSAFE preprocessor macro set to 1.
