I found this here : -(void)mouseDown:(NSEvent *)theEvent { NSRect windowFrame = [[self window] frame]; initialLocation = [NSEvent mouseLocation]; initialLocation.x -= windowFrame.origin.x; initialLocation.y -= windowFrame.origin.y; } - (void)mouseDragged:(NSEvent *)theEvent { NSPoint currentLocation; NSPoint newOrigin; NSRect screenFrame = [[NSScreen mainScreen] frame]; NSRect windowFrame = [self frame]; currentLocation = [NSEvent mouseLocation]; newOrigin.x = currentLocation.x - initialLocation.x; newOrigin.y = currentLocation.y - initialLocation.y; // Don't let window get dragged up under the menu bar if( (newOrigin.y+windowFrame.size.height) > (screenFrame.origin.y+screenFrame.size.height) ){ newOrigin.y=screenFrame.origin.y + (screenFrame.size.height-windowFrame.size.height); } //go ahead and move the window to the new location [[self window] setFrameOrigin:newOrigin]; } It works fine, though I'm not 100% sure I'm doing it correctly. There's one bug I've found so far, and that's if the drag begins inside a subview (a tab itself) and then enters the superview (the tab bar). The window jumps around. Some -hitTest: magic, or possibly even just invalidating initialLocation on mouseUp should probably fix that.
