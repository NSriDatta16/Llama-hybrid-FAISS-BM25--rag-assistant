debugging css ipad

I'm create a website specifically for the ipad. What tools should i use to help me debug CSS? I'm developing from a desktop environment, but testing and viewing my changes on the iPad. I use firebug to debug your normal website. But my ipad website doesn't show up at all in firefox. It shows up in Safari, but Sencha's drag, touch and slide event handlers don't respond well to my mouse events. What tool do I use to debug css (and possibly javascript) issues on an ipad website built with Sencha?
