sklearn random forest and fitting with continuous features

Does anyone know how the python sklearn random forest implementation handles continuous variables in the fitting process? I'm curious to know if it does any sort of binning (and if so, how it does the binning), or if a continuous variable is just treated as a categorical variable? I'm hoping it's not the latter...thanks! Also, I'd be open to using some R implementation if anyone knows about that.
