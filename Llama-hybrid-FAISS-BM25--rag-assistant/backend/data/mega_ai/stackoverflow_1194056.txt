Querying table storage data with Windows Azure

This question has 2 parts. Is there a way to view the data that is stored locally. I understand that local table storage is actually done using SQLExpress behind the scenes. Where is that SQLExpress database located and can I open it using any query tool? Is there a specific account I need to use? Once the application is deployed to the Azure services, how do I query the data? The Google App Engine has a data viewer / query tool, does Azure have something similar?
