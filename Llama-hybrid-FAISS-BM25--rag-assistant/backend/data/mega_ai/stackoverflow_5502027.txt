search engine script that can index hash-fragment urls

i was wondering if anyone had a link or tutorial for a search script that indexes urls with the # fragment. For instance my url 'mysite.com/#About/index' isnt recognised by search engines etc. But i was wondering if there is a script i can use in my website that will help visitors search through these urls? Entering 'mysite.com/#About/index' into an address bar would return the single page interface with the dynamic content loaded into it already. I might be thinkin way ahead of myself but maybe a search script that indexes all pages then before displaying results sticks a '#' after the first '/' and takes off the '.php' from the end. Is this even possible?? Able to use php jquery and mysql
