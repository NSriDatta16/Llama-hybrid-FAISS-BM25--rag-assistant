Regarding what you wrote it is better for Child to be Runnable that runs in a Thread http://www.javabeginner.com/learn-java/java-threads-tutorial then regarding the question of whether it is a good way the answer is : it depends what you want to do LOL You can look into several things: Catching various exceptions like InterruptedException reading up a synchronized to prevent simultaneous access/modifications. instead of sleep you can check the observer class/design pattern to control when your threads wake to do there tests Finally I would like to great you to the wonderful world of Threading your app in Java :D Edit: as Dave L pointed out as well you need to pay attention to clean up what you reference otherwise you'll end up with zombies in you program ^^
