The only elegant solution is to use a Bayesian model where the predictor is coded with indicator variables that are constrained by prior distributions that respect the ordinal nature of the variable. The R brms package brm function handles ordered factor variables automatically in this way. If doing traditional frequentist regression models, the best we usually have time to do is to treat the ordinal variable as quadratic, i.e., include $x$ and $x^2$ in the model, the latter term so as to not assume linearity. We would use regression splines for continuous variables where knot location is not problematic due to excessive ties. When an ordinal variable has less than, say, 4 levels, it is not too inefficient to treat it as categorical using the usual indicator variable approach.
