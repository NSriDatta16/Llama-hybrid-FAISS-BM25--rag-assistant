Matching training and testing datasets

This is more a general question on machine learning in general, but I have two datasets ~75k rows of patients and 100 columns (call it training and testing )--each column is either a numeric predictor corresponding to how many times they've visited a specific physician, or a factor (two examples are Gender and 10-year age bins). There are also two outcome arrays training.obs and testing.obs that correspond to how many days each patient has spent in the hospital. Let's say I wanted to train a linear model model , and cross-validate it with the testing set by testing.pred and take the RMSE of testing.pred and testing.obs . The two datasets are greatly different, in terms of factor ratios (i.e. a larger proportion of males in the training set), and distribution of numeric predictors. Would it make sense to match these two datasets by sampling training , or will I lose model accuracy because I'm excluding rows? How would I go about doing this?
