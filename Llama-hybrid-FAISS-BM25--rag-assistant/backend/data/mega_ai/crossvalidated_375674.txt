In the absence of better information, the mean value of the target variable can be considered a simple estimate for values of the target variable, whether in trying to model the existing data or trying to predict future values. This simple estimate of the target variable (that is, predicted values all equal the mean of the target variable) will be off by a certain error. A standard way to measure the average error is the standard deviation (SD) , $ \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar y)^2}$ , since the SD has the nice property of fitting a bell-shaped (Gaussian) distribution if the target variable is normally distributed. So, the SD can be considered the amount of error that naturally occurs in the estimates of the target variable. This makes it the benchmark that any model needs to try to beat. There are various ways to measure the error of a model estimation ; among them, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) that you mentioned, $ \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat y_i)^2}$ , is one of the most popular. It is conceptually quite similar to the SD: instead of measuring how far off an actual value is from the mean, it uses essentially the same formula to measure how far off an actual value is from the model's prediction for that value. A good model should, on average, have better predictions than the na√Øve estimate of the mean for all predictions. Thus, the measure of variation (RMSE) should reduce the randomness better than the SD. This argument applies to other measures of error, not just to RMSE, but the RMSE is particularly attractive for direct comparison to the SD because their mathematical formulas are analogous. Edit: Someone asked me offline for a citation that supports the idea of the SD being a benchmark for the RMSE. Personally, I first learnt this principle from Shmueli et al. 2016. Sorry, but I do not have the book handy, so I cannot cite a page number. Shmueli, G., Bruce, P. C., Stephens, M., & Patel, N. R. (2016).
