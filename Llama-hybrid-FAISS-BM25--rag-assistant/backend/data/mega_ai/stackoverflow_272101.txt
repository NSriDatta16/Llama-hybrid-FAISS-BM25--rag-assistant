Embedding a YUI Treeview inside a menu

I want to have a website navigation menu, where whenever someone clicks on it, a treeview with checkboxes appears, where they can select nodes in the tree. Is this possible with YUI Treeview ( http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview/ ) or will I have to make it myself?
