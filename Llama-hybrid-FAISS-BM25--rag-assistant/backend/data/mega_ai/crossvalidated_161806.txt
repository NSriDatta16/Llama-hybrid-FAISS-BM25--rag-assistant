What are the goodness of fit variables in classification trees?

I have used multivariate linear regression for one of my projects, and used r-square and p vals to evaluate the model. I couldn't find what such metric we would use for decision trees and random forests. Do we have any standard metrics for decision trees, equivalent to goodness of fit and statistical significance (like p vals for regression)?
