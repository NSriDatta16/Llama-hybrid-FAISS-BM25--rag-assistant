Google is a complex beast, so there is always a chance that you'll get caught out. However, if you're only planning to use a paragraph or two from Wikipedia then I cannot see why Google would mind, as long as you were to provide a link to reference the article. The other option is to rewrite the information yourself, then to link to Wikipedia to reference the information. This is a method I use often for technical pages, as this way I get credited by Google for the content and Wikipedia is correctly referenced for both Google and user (using the Harvard Referencing System).
