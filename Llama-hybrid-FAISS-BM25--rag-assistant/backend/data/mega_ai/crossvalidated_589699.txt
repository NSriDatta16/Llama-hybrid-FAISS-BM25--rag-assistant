I have found a possible application. After been generated several tabular synthetic datasets I have seen the following: I have used small sample size tabular data (less than 30 samples) and I have generated synthetic data with for example 1000 samples. The relative contrast in synthetic data is much higher than original data. In fact I have seen that this contrast in original data is close to the Ck value (see theorem below). Theorem 2 (from Hinneburg et al.): Let $\mathcal{F}$ be an arbitrary distribution of two points and the distance function $\lVert \mathbf{.} \rVert$ be an $L_k$ metric. Then, $\lim_{d \to +\infty} E = \left[ \frac{Dmax_k^{d}-Dmin_k^{d}}{d^{1/k-1/2}}\right] = C_k$ where $C_k$ is some constant dependent on $k$ and $\frac{Dmax_k^{d}-Dmin_k^{d}}{d^{1/k-1/2}}$ is the relative contrast $\zeta_{\mathcal{L}_k}$ ( $\mathcal{L}_k$ is the norm). Then the metric $Dmax-Dmin$ will converge at $C_k$ when increrasing the dimensionality $d \to +\infty$ . $C_k$ illustrates the concentration phenomenon (Beyer et al.). Example: Synthetic data created with python library nbsynthetic ( https://github.com/NextBrain-ml/nbsynthetic ) Results: Conclusions: This can be a prove that generated synthetic has higher contrast and is more suitable for finding patterns and quantify it. If Ck values from original and synthetic data are the same ¿does it means both distributions are close? ¿Could me a 'distance metric' to check if synthetic data is 'similar' to original data?
