Comparing logistic regression models b/w non-independent samples

I have run a fully adjusted logistic regression model for a sample whose data was collected in the year 2000. The outcome is retirement, and the predictors are individual characteristics, like age, gender, etc, and some health predictors as well. I have run a second logistic regression model for a sample whose data was collected in the year 2008, with the same outcome and set of predictors. I now want to compare the model coefficients using various methods, i.e. as an interaction term (predictors x year (2000 or 2008)), and using a Wald test to compare logit coefficients between the two "groups". My problem is that about 50% of the people sampled in 2000 were sampled again in 2008 (that is if they didn't have the outcome in 2000, i.e. had not yet retired). So I am wondering what are the limitations this setup causes? What should I be checking (in addition to the degree of overlap) that can estimate the effects of this design? So for example, how can I quantify the "issue" to explain to my readers the degree to which it is a problem? And finally, is there anything I can do to reduce any weaknesses the design causes?
