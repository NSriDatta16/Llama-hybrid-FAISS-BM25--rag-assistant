Short answer since I don't have time for better: this is a challenging problem; binary data almost always requires some kind of binning or smoothing to assess goodness of fit. It was somewhat helpful to use fortify.lmerMod (from lme4 , experimental) in conjunction with ggplot2 and particularly geom_smooth() to draw essentially the same residual-vs-fitted plot you have above, but with confidence intervals (I also narrowed the y limits a bit to zoom in on the (-5,5) region). That suggested some systematic variation that could be improved by tweaking the link function. (I also tried plotting residuals against the other predictors, but it wasn't too useful.) I tried fitting the model with all 3-way interactions, but it wasn't much of an improvement either in deviance or in the shape of the smoothed residual curve. Then I used this bit of brute force to try inverse-link functions of the form $(\mbox{logistic}(x))^\lambda$, for $\lambda$ ranging from 0.5 to 2.0: ## uses (fragile) internal C calls for speed; could use plogis(), ## qlogis() for readability and stability instead logitpower I found that a $\lambda$ of 0.75 was slightly better than the original model, although not significantly so -- I may have been overinterpreting the data.
