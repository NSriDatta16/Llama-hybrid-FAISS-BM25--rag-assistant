Bold + Italic Shortcuts in Document-Based Applications

I've been reading into using the First Responder as a proxy object, and dragging connections from buttons in order to create usable actions (align left, right, etc). However, by default, the First Responder doesn't contain Bold and Italic actions. I tried adding these actions by opening my Menu.xib and dragging the (Font > Bold) menu item to the first responder and setting it as a boldIt function (custom) but that overwrites the existing action (Font Manager: Addtrait). Is there a way to somewhat efficiently add a bold/italic button on the document.xib? Seems like a lot of work for something so common. New to Obj-C Best, Zach
