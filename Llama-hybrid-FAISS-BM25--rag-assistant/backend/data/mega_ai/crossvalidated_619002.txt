To continue my comment, if there are two alert types (that vary within participants) and 3 possible orders (that do not vary within, only between participants), and 3 reaction time measurements per participant, I would organize the data like this: id_nro alert_type order RT 1 2 1 4.6689560 1 1 1 3.7079620 1 2 1 1.3768914 2 1 2 2.0971152 2 1 2 2.0333446 2 2 2 3.2799651 3 2 3 2.4166309 3 1 3 2.7533185 3 1 3 2.4714532 4 2 1 2.4571295 ... #this is generated example data so ignore the weird "reaction times" And I'd analyze the data with a multilevel model (e.g. linear mixed model) with alert type (as categorical/factor predictor) predicting reaction time and including the random intercept of participant (to deal with repeated measures) and the fixed effect of order (to control for order).
