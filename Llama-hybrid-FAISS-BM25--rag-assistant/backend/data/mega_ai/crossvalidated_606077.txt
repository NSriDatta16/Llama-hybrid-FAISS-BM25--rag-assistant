Knots in splines method, ns and rcs in R

Actually I want to use "ns" method but since I have a problem ( Error in visualize splines logistic regression with ns ) to visualize log odds with "ns" method I forced to use "rcs" method. I understand how "ns" is working but I am confused by knots and coefficients in "rcs" method.
