An algebra of the joint and conditional 'operators'

In treatments of Bayesian methods you typically see terms combining joint distributions with conditional distributions such as $P(A,B|C)$ and $P(A|B,C)$. Expressions arise such as the chain rule $$ P(A,C|B) = P(A|B,C) P(C|B). $$ I find I'm often caught out by such manipulations. For example, moving the $C$ from the LHS of the conditional sign to the RHS we need to multiply by $P(C|B)$, not by $P(C)$. To tune my intuition, what I would like to see is an algebra of the joint and conditional 'operators' (comma and mid) but try as I might I haven't been able to find such an algebra or derive it myself from first principles. Does such an algebra exist?
