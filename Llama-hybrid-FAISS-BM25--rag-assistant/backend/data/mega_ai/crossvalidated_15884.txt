Often, disease data like this is performed with a generalized linear model, as its not necessarily a great application of time series analysis - the months often aren't all that correlated with each other. If I were given this data, here's what I would do (and indeed, have done with data similar to it): Create a "time" variable that's more accurately described as "Months since 1/1/2000" if I'm eyeballing your data correctly. Then I'd run a general linear model in R using the Poisson distribution (or Negative Binomial) and a log link with roughly the following form: log(Counts) = b0 + b1*t + b2*(t^2) + b3*cos(2pi*w*t) + b4*sin(2pi*w*t) Where t is the time described above, and w is 1/365 for a yearly disease like flu. Generally its 1/n, where n is the length of your disease's cycle. I don't know offhand what it is for TB. The two time trends will show you - outside normal seasonal variation - if you have meaningful variation over time.
