Implementing a PHP file uploader. Some basic technical questions

I am currently working on a file uploader (something like rapidshare) but on a very small scale. However, one thing i am concerned about is how do i organize files ? If i place all files in a single uploaded directory, pretty soon (in about a month) the number of files in that directory will reach a million. Will this slow anything down on my system ? Will file accesses and lookups take more time ? How do i counter this problem ? Also, i am looking to implement a multi-server upload. Meaning the admin can choose multiple servers where the file can be uploaded. How will this work ? Will the user upload to my server and my server will instantaneously upload via FTP or some other mechanism to the other server ? The users should not be able to download the file via a download manager. Also, resume functionality should not be supported for normal users. How do i implement that. Can i provide a direct file location access to the user downloading the file ? Or will i have to "serve" the file using a script and fopen, fread and print ? Thanks for all your help i really appreciate any answers.
