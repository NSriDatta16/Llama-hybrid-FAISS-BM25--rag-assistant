You would typically use Poisson or Negative Binomial (the latter if rates are assumed vary across patients), if the outcome is 0, 1, 2, 3, .... events in a time period - possibly with a log (observation time) offset. Logistic regression, if it's yes/no, but if you know when the event happened, time to event methods would typically preferable for a number of reasons (one group may have more/earlier drop-outs, if everyone has an event the only way treatments can differ is in the timing etc.). That you have multiple observations per subject from different periods is indeed important (e.g. one patient may simply have a high chance of getting AEs due to being a bit frail). You account for this by the random effect that tries to take into account how much the outcomes for a patient in one period tells you about his/her oitcomes in another period.
