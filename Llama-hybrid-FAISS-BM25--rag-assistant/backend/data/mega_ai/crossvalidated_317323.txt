Silver has written about his affinity for Bayesian methods in The Signal and the Noise and elsewhere. I found this book, which is teaches a bit about Bayesian inference through Python examples was a good read on a complicated topic: http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/ It's available on the web and as an iPython notebook, but you can also buy a hard/e-book copy and support the author's awesome work.
