Difference between Sequential Importance Resampling and Sequential Monte Carlo

I'm trying to understand this paper but I can't figure out what the difference between SIR and SMC is. I thought that SIR is an example of SMC but the authors seem to distinguish between them. They state: In this section, we show how it is possible to use any local move—including MCMC moves— in the SIS framework while circumventing the calculation of distribution (9), where (9) corresponds to the importance distribution. However, I don't see why this would be a problem in SIS and how SMC is different. I would be very grateful for help!
