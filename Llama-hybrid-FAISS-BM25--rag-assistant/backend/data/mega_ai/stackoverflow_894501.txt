The HASHING algorithm is the algorithm used to determine the hash code of an item within the HashTable. The HASHTABLE algorithm (which I think is what this person is asking) is the algorithm the HashTable uses to organize its elements given their hash code. Java happens to use a chained hash table algorithm.
