XSLT support in Android 2.1 (and older)?

I am currently looking for a third party library to process XSL stylesheets in Android. I know Android 2.2 has added the javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory , but unfortunately we need to be able to support older versions of Android. Are there any third-party libraries available that I can use to transform XML with XSL? I've had a look at Xalan, Saxon and XT, but from my understanding these just provide implementations of javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory and still require the core abstract classes.
