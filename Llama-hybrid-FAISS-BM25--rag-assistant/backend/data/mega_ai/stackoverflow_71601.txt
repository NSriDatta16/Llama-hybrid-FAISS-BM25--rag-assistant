Nooooo!!! Don't implement method_missing on your controller! And please try to avoid action_missing as well. The frequently touted pattern is to add a route: map.connect '*', :controller => 'error', :action => 'not_found' Where you can show an appropriate error. Rails also has a mechanism called rescue_action_in_public where you can write your own error handling logic -- we really should clean it up and encourage people to use it. PDI! :-)
