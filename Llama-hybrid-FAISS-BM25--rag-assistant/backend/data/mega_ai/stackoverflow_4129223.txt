Fulltext search has some bizarre quirks. For example, the behaviour described in the last paragraphs of this page could be the reason for your problem: .... for example, although the word “MySQL” is present in every row of the articles table shown earlier, a search for the word produces no results: mysql> SELECT * FROM articles -> WHERE MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('MySQL'); Empty set (0.00 sec) The search result is empty because the word “MySQL” is present in at least 50% of the rows. As such, it is effectively treated as a stopword. For large data sets, this is the most desirable behavior: A natural language query should not return every second row from a 1GB table. For small data sets, it may be less desirable. The answer here would be to add more rows, or use boolean search. If you need weighted search results, check out the comment Posted by John Craig on December 16 2009 7:01pm on the linked page for a workaround suggestion.
