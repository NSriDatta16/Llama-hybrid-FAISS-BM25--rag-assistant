Edit : updated answer for sample file. I'm assuming you want to search each asset for certain tags. If so, the following worked for me: import lxml.objectify # Parse the file. tree = lxml.objectify.parse('sample.xml') root = tree.getroot() # Which elements to find. to_find = set(['presence/faction', 'presence/value', 'fake']) # Go through each asset in the document. for asset in root.findall('asset'): # Check for each element. for name in to_find: node = asset.find(name) if node is not None: print 'Found %s, its value is %s' % (name, node) else: print 'Unable to find %s' % name The output was: Found presence/value, its value is -1000.0 Found presence/faction, its value is Dvaered Unable to find fake Found presence/value, its value is 100.0 Found presence/faction, its value is Empire Unable to find fake
