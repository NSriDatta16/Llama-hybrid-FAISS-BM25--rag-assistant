Take a look at a post in Healthy Algorithm: http://healthyalgorithms.com/2011/11/23/causal-modeling-in-python-bayesian-networks-in-pymc/ also in PyMC's totorial: http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/tutorial.html Maybe you would try the following code clip (assuming you have imported pymc as mc): A = mc.Normal('A', mu_A, tau_A) B = mc.Normal('B', mu_B, tau_B) p_C = mc.Lambda('p_C', lambda A=A, B=B: >, doc='Pr[C|AB]') C = mc.Bernoulli('C', p_C)
