I'd say that the workflow of sign up, get e-mail, click on link in e-mail is now fairly ubiquitous and wouldn't put off the majority of users. I wouldn't go as far as saying that in general users expect this and would distrust a site that didn't do this, but it is getting that way. It gives an added sense of security to users who now know that you're discouraging spammers in the first place rather than just dealing with them after the fact. See also backslash17's answer about ensuring that the owner of the e-mail address is the one doing the signing up.
