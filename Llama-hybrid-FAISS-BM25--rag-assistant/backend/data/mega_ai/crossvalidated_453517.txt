I've done some digging on CV and my question posed in the Edit of my post essentially boils down to how many runs of a simulation need to be performed to assess "confidence" in outputted results . I have found several answers in this regard, all pointing to the equivalence (via convergence in probability and in respect to the estimating the population mean) of (1) running a single simulation with $mn$ replications, then reporting the estimated mean (2) running $m$ simulations, each with $n$ replications and then averaging the results. Advantage of multiple simulations in old-fashioned Monte Carlo? averaging after n trials of monte carlo simulation or not? which is better statistically? I also recall reading a comment by @whuber some time ago indicating that the bootstrap does not require simulation, but I can't seem to find the particular post where this comment is stated. Regardless, bootstrapping clearly falls into category (1) above. We do not run the boot() R function $n$ = 10000 times (say) where each run averages over $m$ = 10000 replications; instead, we draw simply draw $n$ 10000 bootstrap samples for a single simulation ( $m$ = 1), find the sample mean, and then call it a day. However, there is no reason why we can't simply adopt option (2) for bootstrapping -- we just have to be very patient. Option (1) can greatly save on CPU time and RAM, especially if simulations are computationally-intensive. In the end, it seems that both my colleague and I are correct in our thinking, it's just a matter of how much time one has (and wishes) to devote.
