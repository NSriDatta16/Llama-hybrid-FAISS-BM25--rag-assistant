This is expected, every new web request is actually new thread. And every web request reset stuff like CurrentThread, CurrentCulture and so on. What are you trying to do is authentication session. There are many possible solutions. But to suggest something I have to specify technology you use. For example, ASP.NET ASMX Services can use Forms Authentication. Also they are aware about ASP.NET Session. With WCF, you can enable ASP.NET support, so you will have same stuff like for ASP.NET ASMX Services. But you also can leverage on Windows Communication Foundation Authentication Service . Anyways need more info from you.
