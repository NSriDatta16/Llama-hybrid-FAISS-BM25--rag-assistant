In the case of logistic regression, you obtain an equation but the output is a binomial classification. This is a common misconception. Explicitly, a logistic regression does no classification, instead returning predicted probabilities of event occurrence. However, the machine learning terminology seems to refer to problems as “classification” problems when the observed outcomes are categorical (e.g., dog vs cat), which is a major use case for a logistic regression. This terminology is at odds with the standard English definition of classification, yes, because so many of the models used for these “classification” problems do no explicit classification. What you do with the predicted probability is separate from the logistic regression. I think this resolves the dispute. The divergence in terminology works fine for me, someone with experience in statistics and machine learning. Where it seems to hurt people is when they are first learning and think logistic regression models explicitly make classifications, and software package having predict methods that return the category with the largest predicted probability instead of the predicted probability does not help. Finally, logistic regression models do not have to be used for predictive modeling. All of the usual ideas from linear regression about parameter inference and causality can apply, and practitioners interested in these ideas might not be particularly interested in getting great predictive performance.
