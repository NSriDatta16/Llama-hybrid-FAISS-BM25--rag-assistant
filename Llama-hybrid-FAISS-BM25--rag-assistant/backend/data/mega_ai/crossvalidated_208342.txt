To gain better insight into your data you need to know specifically what information is going to be useful to you. You may want to do one of the following, although by no means is this an exhaustive list: Describe your data Interpolate: guess at values of your variables that are within the observed ranges Extrapolate: predict values of your data that are outside the observed ranges, such as predicting how your variables will change over time or how often can you expect to get values larger than a certain threshold. Describing data usually has to do with aggregating it to capture it's key characteristics. This is especially important in communicating your results to other people because you can clearly and succinctly characterize the data set. To this end you can use graphics to communicate your results (density plots, histograms, heat maps, scatterplots etc.) or summarize your data with numbers (for example using a measure of central tendency like the mean or median and a measure of variation like the standard deviation or interquartile range). To interpolate you can often use some kind of ad hoc way of modeling your data. for example you can use smoothed histograms or loess trend lines (for time-series data) to guess at unobserved values within observed ranges. This could be useful if you dropped a time frame, for example if there was a temporary problem in data collection but would like to estimate how many clients had problems during that time. Finally to extrapolate you need a model of the data generating process. Here you need some assumptions about how the data came to be distributed as it is. For example you could check if your throughput data was "generated" by drawing form a Poisson distribution. If you use a statistical distribution to model your data you can ask all kinds of questions. For example if your data comes from a Poisson distribution the mean of the distribution can be interpreted as the average number of concurrent requests.
