If you're repeating parts of your view code, a partial is a good idea. If the code you're reusing is a little different between your pages, make use of the parameters you can pass the partial. As for the CSS, I'd suggest keeping it outside your partial/template. If you have a lot of partial specific CSS code, create a "partials" folder under web/css and name the css files to match your partials (If you think the overhead is worth the organization).
