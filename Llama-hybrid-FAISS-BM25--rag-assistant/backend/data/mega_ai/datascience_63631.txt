This is more a comment than an answer but the adjustment part is likely to depend on the model you have. So it will be difficult to give you a general method. If your model is a simple rule base one, the adjustment could consist in adding another rule, if it is a neural network then you'll go with backpropagation to adjust the weights of the nodes, if it's a Bayesian tree then you could grow another tree taking into account your new outliers, if it's Bob, your dear colleague, you'll have to make sure that he takes the new info into account next time he classifies something as being an outlier.
