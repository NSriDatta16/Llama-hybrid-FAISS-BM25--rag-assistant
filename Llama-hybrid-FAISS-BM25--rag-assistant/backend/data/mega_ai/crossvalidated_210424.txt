Mann-Whitney U suitable for my analysis procedure?

I examine the relation of written language of investors and investment performance of investors. N=52 Dep. variable -> investment success; binary (1/0) (Acquisition/no Acquisition) (N = 28/22) Ind. variables -> many language measures; in percent of total language First step should be to find language variables that might relate to investment success. I want to perform either a two sample t-test or a Mann-Whitney U-test of a lot of linguistic measures to compare the samples of successful and not successful investments. Now the question is which test to choose, because... t-test might be problematic, because the two samples mostly aren't normally distributed. My professor told me not to transform the measures when comparing the two samples. Mann-Whitney might be problematic, because I subsequently want to deepen the analysis and perform correlations and logistic regression. Because of the small sample size I was advised to run a OLS regression to double check my results from the logistic regression. Let me summarize my problem: Is the Mann-Whitney enough when I want to do other analyses later on? Wouldn't it make more sense to perform t-tests, because I have to perform an OLS regression at a later stage?
