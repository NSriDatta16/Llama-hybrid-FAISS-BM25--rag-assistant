Flurry analytics crashing with Windows Phone 7

I've integrated Flurry (http://www.flurry.com/) into my phone 7 app. The only code needed is this line in application launching FlurryWP7SDK.Api.StartSession(ApiKeyValue); However, as soon as that line is hit the application crashes with a KeyNotFoundException. The stack trace is included below. It appears to be querying isolated storage settings and failing when the key doesn't exist. Does anyone have any experience with this error or even successfully integrating flurry into a Phone 7 app? at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowKeyNotFoundException() at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.get_Item(String key) at System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageSettings.get_Item(String key) at A.ca98fb38190f0d5cad84c67a779d17229.c204dba68825403c905efd7bfd067b17b(String ce0360de492f1f363775feaf6d6a8ced5, Object c8d4be677f7ee63f6756e13f285072523) at A.c3f1105d518a239d73e2236200494de25.set_cfca54db015a16ab23de44b4d5c65e9a3(String c8d4be677f7ee63f6756e13f285072523) at FlurryWP7SDK.Api.StartSession(String apiKey) at AppName.App.Application_Launching(Object sender, LaunchingEventArgs e) at Microsoft.Phone.Shell.PhoneApplicationService.FireLaunching() at Microsoft.Phone.Execution.NativeEmInterop.FireOnLaunching() Edit After discussions with Flurry support it appears that the KeyNotFoundException is caught by Flurry code. However if your debugger settings are to break when the exception is thrown you will break into the debugger regardless. Continuing execution will then work because the exception is caught and handled by Flurry. I can't verify that this is the solution because I no longer have access to the dev environment that was indicating the error, but it appears to be a likely solution.
