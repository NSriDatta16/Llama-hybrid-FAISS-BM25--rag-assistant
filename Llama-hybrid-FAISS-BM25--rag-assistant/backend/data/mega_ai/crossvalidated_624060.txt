The values are the same because you don't allow the mediation effects to vary by the treatment. You are using linear models with no treatment-mediator interaction. Generally, this should produce output that doesn't split the mediation effects by treatment group, but there might be a bug in mediation that makes it do this. A quick glance at the source code didn't reveal such a bug, but it may be more nuanced than I can see. If you want to impose the (unnecessarily) strict criterion that the treatment doesn't interact with the mediator, then you can just report the average. Otherwise, I would recommend using a richer and more flexible model that allows for the possibility of such an interaction.
