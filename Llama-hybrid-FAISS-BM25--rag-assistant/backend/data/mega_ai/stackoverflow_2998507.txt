What is the best way of embedding a java applet into my webpage?

I've been looking into putting a little Java application in my web page, but the more research I do, the more confused I become about how I should do it. Sun suggests many ways of doing it, but it looks suspiciously like it's from the Netscape era. So, should I use , as suggested by eclipse, , or ? And how should I use the correct tag?
