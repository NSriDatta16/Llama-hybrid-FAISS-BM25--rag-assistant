Ultra simple iPhone App Doesnt Display a Label - why?

I have just done a tutorial for a Hello World iPhone App. It doesn't work :-( Here's what I did: Create a view based application called HelloWorld Drag a Label onto HelloWorldViewConroiller.xib that says "Hello World" Click Build and Run According to the book I am reading, I should see the label's text on screen. Instead I see a gray screen with nothing. What am I missing? Note: I tried this using a Window based application and that didn't work either - blank screen.
