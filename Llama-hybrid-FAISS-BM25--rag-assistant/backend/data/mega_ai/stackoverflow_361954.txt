I think one of the biggest examples is that expert users tend to play with an application . They say, "Okay, I have this tool, what can I do with it?" Your average user sees the ecosystem of an operating system, filesystem, or application as a big scary place where they are likely to get lost and never return. For them, everything they want to do on a computer is task-based . "How do I burn a DVD?" "How do I upload a photo from my camera to this website." "How do I send my mom a song?" They want a starting point, a reproducible work flow, and they want to do that every time they have to perform the task. They don't care about streamlining the process or finding the best way to do it, they just want one reproducible way to do it. In building web applications, I long since learned to make the start page of my application something separate from the menus with task-based links to the main things the application did in a really big font. For the average user, this increased usability hugely. So remember this: users don't want to "use your application", they want to get something specific done .
