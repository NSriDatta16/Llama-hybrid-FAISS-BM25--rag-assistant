Perhaps what you are looking for is the Combining Multiple Models (CMM) approach developed by Domingos in the 90s. Details for using this with a bagged ensemble of C4.5 rules is described in his ICML paper Domingos, Pedro. "Knowledge Acquisition from Examples Via Multiple Models." In Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Machine Learning . 1997. The pseudocode in Table 1 is not specific to bagged C4.5, however: To apply this to Random Forests, the key issue seems to be how to generate the randomly generated example $\overrightarrow{x}$. Here is a notebook showing one way to do it with sklearn . This has got me wondering what follow-up work has been doing on CMM, and if anyone has come up with a better way to generate $\overrightarrow{x}$. I've created a new questions about it here .
