It is not completely clear to me what are you trying to achieve here, an example would probably help. Adding one of the "insignificant" dependent variables to a regression with the "significant" one and checking if the effect is still there should probably answer the question from the second paragraph. More systematically, I would estimate a seemingly unrelated regression system of three equations and look at the correlation of their residuals, including testing of cross-equation equality of the parameters.
