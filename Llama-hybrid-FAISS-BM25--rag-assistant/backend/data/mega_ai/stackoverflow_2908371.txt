Alan Kay, who coined the term "Object-Oriented Programming," has explained his thinking on a few occasions. Essentially, he got the idea from biology â€” the way each cell is a self-contained entity and only interacts with other cells through "messages," without knowing anything about how the other cell actually works, and all these autonomous entities add up to a living organism. He thought that this way of dividing responsibility up, with lots of entities that took care of themselves and communicated only by sending messages, would make it easier to keep programs organized. He's also said that he views the World Wide Web as an extension of this model.
