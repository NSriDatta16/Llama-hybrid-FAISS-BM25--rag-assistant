Neural Network for Multiple Float Output

I have a dataset containing 40 input columns and 12 output columns (float values). I supposed it's a regression problem and I am wondering of how to choose the ideal architecture of the Neural Network i didn't find examples of neural Network regression with multiple output What is the right way to do it?
