I will answer your questions from my experience in learning Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) in university and the way my PGM teacher defined probabilistic inference . Knowing the material of this class was based on [1], I assume you could find more precise answers in this book. In answer to 2: Probabilistic inference is a type of statistical inference. From [2] and [3], statistical inference makes statistical propositions about a population, which includes point estimate , interval estimate , hypothesis rejection , clustering and classification . "Probabilistic inference" was introduced and roughly defined in the PGM context as any marginalisation task of a probability function, whether it is a marginal probability computation or finding the most probable outcome (for e.g. classification). It thus enters in the definition of statistical inference as making a proposition on the underlying probability distribution of the population. To illustrate mathematically some marginalisation tasks in the context of PGM, let $\mathcal{X} = \{X_1, \ldots, X_n\}$ be a set of random variables. For a given bayesian network $(\mathscr{G}, \mathbb{P}_{\theta})$ or markovian network $(\mathscr{H}, \mathbb{P}_{\theta})$ with $\mathbb{P}_\theta$ , then the following routines are considered probabilistic inferences : Computing a marginal or conditional probablity: For $\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{X} \subset \mathcal{X}$ , we want to answer: $$\mathbb{P}_\theta(\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{e}) = ~?.$$ Most probable realization: For $\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{X} \subset \mathcal{X}$ , we want to answer: $${\rm arg}\min_{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\mathbf{x}}\mathbb{P}_\theta(\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{e}) = ~?.$$ In answer to 1 and 3: It was the first time I had seen this terminology. The term does make sense, since you make inference on questions that are directly related to probabilities. I cannot answer whether it is used solely in CS or the PGM context.
