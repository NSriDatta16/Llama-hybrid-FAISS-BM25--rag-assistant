Aging a dataset

For reasons I'd rather not go into, I need to filter a set of values to reduce jitter. To that end, I need to be able to average a list of numbers, with the most recent having the greatest effect, and the least recent having the smallest effect. I'm using a sample size of 10, but that could easily change at some point. Are there any reasonably simple aging algorithms that I can apply here?
