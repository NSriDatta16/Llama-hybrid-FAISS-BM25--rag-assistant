What is the relation and/or difference between Game Theory and Markov Chain Model?

I am doing some work regarding my master's thesis in networks security. I have decided to work with Game Theory, calculating the Nash Equilibrium for a two player zero sum game. However, I have also read that Markov Chain Model can be used to calculate Nash Equilibrium and this is confusing me. What is the relation between both Markov Chain and Game Theory?
