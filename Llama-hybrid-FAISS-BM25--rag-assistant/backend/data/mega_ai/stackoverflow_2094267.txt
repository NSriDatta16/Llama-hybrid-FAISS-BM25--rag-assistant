Here is the approach I would take: Create the script Create a SQL script with a CURSOR in it (the only reason I say cursor is because you are passing Student Name and Age to a different stored procedure) Read the StudentName and Age into @variables Execute the stored proc with appropriate parameters Fetch next row and loop IMP : TEST the script Save the script in a SQL file for further reference. In SQL Server Agent Create a new job point it to the appropriate database Paste the SQL Script (from above) into the script area of the job Create an appropriate schedule (daily, at 3:15 am) If operators and SQL Mail are setup, add those so that you can get email notifications Save the job IMP : TEST the job
