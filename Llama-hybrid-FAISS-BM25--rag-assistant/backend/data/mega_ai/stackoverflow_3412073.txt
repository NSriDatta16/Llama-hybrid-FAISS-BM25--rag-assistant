Rename Pdf from Pdf title

I want to organize my pdf file downloaded from the internet. It is clear that many of them are ill-named. I want to extract the real title from the file. Here many of them are generated from Latex and I think from the compiled pdf we can find the \title{} keyword or something like that. I want then use this to rename the file. I can read the meta-data using pypdf. But most pdf does not contains that title in its metadata. I have tried it with all my collections and find none! Two questions: 1. Is it possible to read pdf title compiled from the pdf compiled from latex. 2. Which library(mainly in C/C++, java, python) can I use to get that information. Thanks in advance.
