I've really enjoyed Head First iPhone Development , though the current edition is a little out-of-date. There'll be a new release this year , with iOS 4 and iPad coverage (which might be out-of-date by the time it's released, if iOS 5 SDK hints at being released sometime this year to Paid Registered Apple Developers) Edit : The new release is out. Second Edition. Covers XCode 4.2 and everything you could possibly need :)
