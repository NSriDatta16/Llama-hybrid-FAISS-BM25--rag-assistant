In ecological research, nonrandom assignment of treatments to experimental units (subjects) is standard practice when sample sizes are small and there is evidence of one or more confounding variables. This nonrandom assignment "intersperses" the subjects across the spectrum of possibly confounding variables, which is exactly what random assignment is supposed to do. But at small sample sizes, randomization is more likely to perform poorly at this (as demonstrated above) and therefore it can be a bad idea to rely on it. Because randomization is advocated so strongly in most fields (and rightfully so), it is easy to forget that the end goal is to reduce bias rather than to adhere to strict randomization. However, it is incumbent upon the researcher(s) to characterize the suite of confounding variables effectively and to carry out the nonrandom assignment in a defensible way that is blind to experimental outcomes and makes use of all available information and context. For a summary, see pp. 192-198 in Hurlbert, Stuart H. 1984. Pseudoreplication and the design of field experiments. Ecological Monographs 54(2) pp.187-211.
