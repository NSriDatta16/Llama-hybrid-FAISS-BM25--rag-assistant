Rather than a potential rewrite of the entire application in WPF you can do a partial migration by embedding WPF controls in a WinForm app. You add an ElementsHost to the toolbox this resides in the System.Windows.Forms.Integration namespace and is part of .Net 3.0. This can then be dragged on to the form or added in code. The control has a child property which in turn can be a WPF UIElement. WPF is far more powerful in the area of styling and customising the look of a control than custom drawn controls done the old way in Winforms however there is a learning curve. Is this your requirement? WPF works fine with XP. Just a few thoughts.
