Separating alphabetic characters in C++ STL

I've been practicing C++ for a competition next week. And in the sample problem I've been working on, requires splitting of paragraphs into words. Of course, that's easy. But this problem is so weird, that the words like: isn't should be separated as well: isn and t . I know it's weird but I have to follow this. I have a function split() that takes a constant char delimiter as one of the parameter. It's what I use to separate words from spaces. But I can't figure out this one. Even numbers like: phil67bs should be separated as phil and bs . And no, I don't ask for full code. A pseudocode will do, or something that will help me understand what to do. Thanks! PS: Please no recommendations for external libs. Just the STL. :)
