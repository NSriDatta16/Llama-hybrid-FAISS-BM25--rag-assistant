I'm sorry to say there isn't a good way to do cross-browser video without being able to force your users to install something. That is why every video site uses flash, since it's the nearest thing to a standard - but of course flash has some gaps in coverage, the most significant being iPhones. Windows Media Player has only about 70% penetration and Internet Explorer somewhat less. By going this route you will end up with 1 in 3 users unable to view your videos. Either bite the bullet and move to Flash as a video player or just give your users a download link. A download link is a very easy way to support almost every user, if you can do that.
