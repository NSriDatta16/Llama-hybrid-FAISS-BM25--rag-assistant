When you receive "Directory Services reported the following error: Your Apple ID or password was entered incorrectly. (-20101)" from Application Loader, this means that your username and/or password has changed or it's in correct. Solution: 1)Open Application Loader. 2)Click Window->Run Setup Wizard (Shift-Command-S). 3)Read the information on below the "Welcome to Application Loader." text 4)Click "Next". 5)Enter your iTunes Connect information (Apple ID and Password). If there are multiple developers on the account, use the Team Lead/Agent account information. 6) Click "Next". 7) If the information is correct you will get "Your iTunes login information has been verified." and if not you will get the same error as before and you will can always go back to re-enter the correct iTunes Connect information (Apple ID and Password). I hope this helps.
