There is no silver bullet regarding how to organize your headers. However one important rule is to keep it consistent across the project so that all persons involved in the project know what to expect. Usually typedefs and defines are at the top of the file in my headers, but that can not be regarded as a rule, then come class/template definitions. A rule that I follow for C++ is one header per class, which usually keeps the headers small enough to allow grasping the content and finding things without scrolling too much.
