Drupal : How to export node content to other website?

I want to fetch contents from my Drupal site and show it on another site using CURL. I already have a module that creates a URL (menu) in Drupal and outputs the requested node using node_load() method. This way, I can select which specific fields to output to the requesting site. However, I also have a module that alters the node's content. What is does is when a node is viewed, it looks for the img tags in the content and replaces the source attribute with its thumbnail version. In this module I look for a specific attribute of the node : $node->content['body']['#value'] And replace the img tags if present.. My problem is when i call node_load() in the menu I defined on the first paragraph, it doesnt have that $node->content['body']['#value'] that's why the image tags are not replaced.. Thanks!
