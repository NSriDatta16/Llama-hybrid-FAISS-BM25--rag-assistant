Bayesian Updating Without Conjugate Prior

I'm trying to create some kind of iterative Bayesian algorithm, which continuously updates as more data is gathered. However, the distribution of my data is such that there does not exist a conjugate prior, so I'm thinking of using something like Gibbs sampling to generate my posterior distribution. However, if I want to do another iteration of this Bayesian algorithm with new data, is it possible without a conjugate prior? Because I only have the samples of the posterior distribution, not the actual distribution. Thanks!
