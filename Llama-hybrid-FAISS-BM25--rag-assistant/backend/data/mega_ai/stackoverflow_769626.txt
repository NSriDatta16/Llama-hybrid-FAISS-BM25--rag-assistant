I need help figuring out the best way to query this in rails

I'm having a problem coming up with a query that would work for these models. I have three models that are connected. An Organization has many Users, and Users have many StatusEntries Basically this means I could do Organization.find(1).users.find(1).status_entries And have a list of status_entries returned to me. The problem is I am trying to find a list of status_entries for a specific Organization. I am having trouble coming up with a way of doing this that is not overly complicated and is elegant. Any help would be much appreciated.
