Discrete weather data causing issue in predicting spatial yield

I want to incorporate the weather data into predicting spatial yield. Major data used: 4 years spatial yield data from a 10-ha crop field 4 years of daily weather data such as rainfall from a weather station nearby Other spatial information such as soil survey. The aim to predict spatial yield on that field for mapping. Models considered multiple linear regression model decision trees neural network I used to treat the rainfall data as continuous variables so I have the columns like this: "year" "yield" "Rain09.01" "Rain09.16" "Rain10.01" "Rain10.16" "Rain10.31" "Rain11.15" "Rain11.30" "Rain12.15" "Rain12.30" "Rain01.14" "Rain01.29" "Rain02.13" "Rain02.28" "Rain03.15" "Rain03.30" "Rain04.14" "Rain04.29" "Rain05.14" "Rain05.29" "Temp09.01" "Temp09.16" "Temp10.01" "Temp10.16" "Temp10.31" "Temp11.15" "Temp11.30" "Temp12.15" "Temp12.30" "Temp01.14" "Temp01.29" "Temp02.13" "Temp02.28" "Temp03.15" "Temp03.30" "Temp04.14" "Temp04.29" "Temp05.14" "Temp05.29" But it seems to affect the prediction because of its discrete nature. What is the best way to combine the weather data in predicting spatial yield? Or should I have them in columns: "year" "yield" "Rain" "Temp" "fortnights" ? Similar question here but no answer yet How to model whether discrete count data are statistically-enriched in certain regions for spatial data?
