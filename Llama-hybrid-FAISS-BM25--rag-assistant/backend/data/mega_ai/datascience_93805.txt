Why do we need to concatenate in a U-Net?

You might be familiar with the U-Net , a machine learning network deceived for image segmentation. It's basically an encoder/decoder network with some direct links between encoder and decoder segments: I would like to better understand the reason behind those gray lines! What is the idea behind copying one part (cropped) of the outputs of the convolutional segments (before max-pooling) and concatenating it to the inputs to the individual up-convolutional layer?
