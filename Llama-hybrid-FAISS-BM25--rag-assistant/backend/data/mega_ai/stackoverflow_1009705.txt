COFF format - as found on Unix, at any rate, is reasonably well organized. There are lots of sections in it. There was also a tool, mcs for 'manipulate comment section' which could be used to remove material. The tool is available on Solaris for ELF (which is an extension of COFF), and probably elsewhere. What this might mean is that you can find the program and use it on the MS object files. On the other hand, it seems unlikely that the complaints would be resolved by removing the debug information; the debug information should not affect the running (or linking) of the program. That said, the information found via Google 'microsoft lnk4009' is non-conclusive; two entries appear, but both end up showing 'LNK4099' rather than 'LNK4009' messages.
