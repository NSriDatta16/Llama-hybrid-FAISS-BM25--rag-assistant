I don't know a simple or easy solution for this but I think you can quickly hack something together. First you can generate a HTML file from the SVN log using the svn2html.xsl stylesheet from the svn2cl tool . If you don't like it it's actually not difficult to write something like that as you can read in this blog post . Second you could somehow modify the Doxygen output to include a link to the html file generated in step one. I don't know much about that but maybe the doxygen manual page about customization is a good start. Third you could write a small build file for your documentation that automates step one and two possibly using make or a shell script or a batch file. Not very elegant but a start.
