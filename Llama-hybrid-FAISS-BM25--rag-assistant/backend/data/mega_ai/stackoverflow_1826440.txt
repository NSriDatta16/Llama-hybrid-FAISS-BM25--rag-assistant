SSRS Row Group + Column Group = RowNumber Issue

I'm back with another SSRS question :-) I'm dealing with survey data. I have a procedure that's returning an organization's response counts per question. So my report is defined as Group on Organization for row and Group on answer for columns. Both the number of organizations and answers are variable. That's working as expected. I've tried adding a RowCount next to the organization so that I can show rank, but the fact that each org has one row per question means that I'm getting eight rows per org. Here's an example: Here is my report definition: The rank expression is currently: =RowNumber(Nothing) Ideally, the rank would be 1, 2, 3, 4, etc... I've tried scope to the row group, column group and nothing. No help. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!
