Let's simplify with two groups: group A: 2 people, both smoke, therefore 100% of smokers group B: 10 people, 1 smokes, therefore 10% of smokers Now group A and B together have 3 smokers over 12, hence 25%. How can you get to that 25% by averaging? Consider the relative weight of the two groups: $$100\% * \frac{2}{12} + 10\% * \frac{10}{12} = 0,25 = 25\%$$ More info here .
