Remember that PDF is inherently a print medium (300dpi and higher), while your average .jpg is intended for screen viewing (72-100dpi). If you don't supply source images with approximately the same resolution as the document you're inserting it into, the PDF display engine will have to do all kinds of scaling to make things fit. Once when you insert the image to stretch it out to the size you want, and then downscaling again to make the PDF fit on your screen.
