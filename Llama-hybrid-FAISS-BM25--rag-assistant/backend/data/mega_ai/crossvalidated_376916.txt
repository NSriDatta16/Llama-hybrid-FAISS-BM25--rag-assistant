Implementation of WAE-GAN does not match with the description in the paper

According to the litterature and specifically to this paper , the wasserstein autoencoders is an encoder-decoder architecture. So it must contain encoder and decoder parts. in the algorithm description of GAN-based WAN, in the requirements, there were initialization of encoder, decoder and latent discriminator. In parallel, I saw many implementations of GAN based WAE on github in tensorflow, there were all implemented through a discrminator and generator parts. No autoencoder architecture. So my question, are those implementations correspond to another architecture beside the WAE-GAN ? or maybe I didn't understand the connection between the paper and the implementation. Here you will find some links for implementation: implementation 1 implementation 2 implementation 3
