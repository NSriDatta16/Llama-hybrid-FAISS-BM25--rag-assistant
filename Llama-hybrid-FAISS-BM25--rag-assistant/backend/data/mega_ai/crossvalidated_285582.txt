Cointegration with lagged variables

Let us say that I have two economic time series $Y_t$ and $X_t$ (both $I(1)$) and that I have good theoretical reasons to expect that the values of $X$ influence $Y$ with a one-period lag. Then, I want to test for cointegration, to see if a long-run relationship like $Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{t-1} $ holds. When performing the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, should I test $Y_t$ and $X_t$ or $Y_t$ and $X_{t-1}$? By logic, I would say that using the latter is the right thing to do, but is it legitimate from an econometric point of view? In other words, should I test for $Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{t-1} $ or $Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{t} $ (and just select the right lag structure for the short-term coefficients)?
