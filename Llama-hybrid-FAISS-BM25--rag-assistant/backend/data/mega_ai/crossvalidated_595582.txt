How to classify unseen data as anomaly

I trained a CNN model with 6 different classes (labels are 0-5) and I am getting more than 90% accuracy out of it. It can correctly classify the classed. I am actually trying to detect anomaly with it. So what I want is, if any data comes which my model has never seen before or never been trained on similar data then it will be classified as anomaly while the other data point will be classified normally (from 0-5) same as before. I do not have any abnormal data to train my model, I just have the normal data. So the rule would be, if any incoming data point does not belong to any of the six classes then it is anomaly. How can I do it?
