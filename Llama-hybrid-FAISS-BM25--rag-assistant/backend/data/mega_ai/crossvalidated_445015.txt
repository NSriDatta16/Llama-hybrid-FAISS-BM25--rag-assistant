Which pdf to choose for the prior of an angle?

I have a system in which one uncertain variable is a direction in two dimensions. If I want to define a prior for this, is there an elegant way to reflect the fact that the parameter space dimension for this variable is circular (i.e., the distance between 359.9 degrees and 0.0 degrees is less than 359.9 degrees and 300.00 degrees)? I can think of some janky solutions with coding (reflecting values outside the bound of 0 and 360 back to the other end), but is there a space in which this solution is more elegant? And which prior should I use if I want to reflect e.g. a quasi-Gaussian preference for a certain direction?
