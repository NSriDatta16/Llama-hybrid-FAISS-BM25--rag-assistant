The automated build part can be done in multiple ways - TFS, TeamCity (what we use), CruiseControl.NET , etc. That in turn could call a build script in NAnt (again, what we use), MSBuild, etc. As for stopping and installing a service remotely, see How to create a Windows service by using Sc.exe . Note that you could shell/exec out to this from your build script if there isn't a built-in task. (I haven't tried this recently, so do a quick spike first to make sure it works in your environment.) Alternately, it's probably possible (and likely elegant) in Windows PowerShell 2.0 .
