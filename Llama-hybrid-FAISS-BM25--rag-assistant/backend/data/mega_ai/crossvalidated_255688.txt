Why VIF is calculated on every value of a predictor in R?

I'm currently working on a logistic regression model and I wanted to pinpoint the VIF for every predictor inside the model. I've found that packages 'car' and 'HH' have the same vif function, so I proceeded computing it using one of the two functions above. The glm call follows: logitA1 As far as I know, VIF is computed on every single predictor, and not on every single value of every single predictor, but the results of the vif call are: CodeSnippet = 1.013995, I(Weekday == "Weekend") = 1.005570, I(GMTHour == "Afternoon") = 1.439526, I(GMTHour == "Evening") = 1.374073, I(GMTHour == "Night") = 1.322700, I(BodyLength == "Medium") = 1.082132, I(BodyLength == "Long") = 1.072741, I(TitleLength == "Medium") = 3.534710, I(TitleLength == "Long") = 3.547255, SentimentPositiveScore = 1.056977, SentimentNegativeScore = 1.036823, NTag = 1.015646, AvgUpperCharsPPost = 1.011055, URL = 1.014852, I(UserReputation == "Low") = 1.450856, I(UserReputation == "Established") = 1.447942, I(UserReputation == "Trusted") = 1.021978 As you can see, the VIF is calculated on every single value of the predictor for categorical variables on which I've used the wrapping function I(), and VIF values are the same on the values of a single predictor, so I assume real VIF is not far from those values for every single predictor. I would like to know, though, why I got those results? And how can I be sure of the real VIF value for a predictor with multiple values, like BodyLength or TitleLength or UserReputation?
