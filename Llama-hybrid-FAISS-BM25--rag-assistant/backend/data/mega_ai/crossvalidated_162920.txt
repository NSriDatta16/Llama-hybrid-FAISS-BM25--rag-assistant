Is Representer theorem valid with constraints on coefficients?

By the representer theorem, we have that in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space the function being learnt in a regularizer + loss function problem under some conditions, can be represented as $\sum_i \alpha_i k(.,x_i)$. Then for the corresponding ML problem at hand an optimization is performed to learn the $\alpha$'s. If say there was a constraint put on $\alpha$'s during this optimization, does it make the representer theorem not hold, regardless of what the constraint be?
