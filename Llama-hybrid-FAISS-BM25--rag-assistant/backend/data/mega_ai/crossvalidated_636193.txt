What is density function produced by taking the mean of a finite number of values from a non-normal distribution?

I have a distribution described by the density function 2x*exp(-x^2). I would like to get the distribution that would by produced by taking the average of n observations drawn from this original distribution. I think eventually this will converge to a normal distribution via the central limit theorem, but want to get an idea of the shape of the distribution in the intermediate cases.
