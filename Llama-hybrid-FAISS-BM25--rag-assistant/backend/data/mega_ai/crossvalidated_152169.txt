So many things can go wrong with this prediction that I hesitate to answer. If we look at Quantity per day we get .05 for the first period, .02 for the second period, .06 for the third period, and .04 overall. Note we don't have enough information to estimate trend or determine seasonality. Lacking any knowledge of the underlying data generation mechanism, I would retreat to a simple average forecast and assume .04 per day for all future periods. For 182 days, this would be 6.6.
