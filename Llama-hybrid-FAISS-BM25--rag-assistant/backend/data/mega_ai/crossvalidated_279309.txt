Getting the Average (?) of data from literature review

I have reviewed many literature, and extracted their data. I wanted to get the average of the values of each property. Say, I have 50 journal articles which reported the metal composition (as % composition) (of Gold, Copper and Lead) of e-wastes. How do I calculate the average % composition of Gold (or Copper or Lead) from all the data from the 50 journal articles? Is this also a meta analysis? Thanks!
