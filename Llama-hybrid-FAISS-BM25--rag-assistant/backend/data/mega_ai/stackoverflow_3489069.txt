Suggestions for an ASP.Net webforms application architecture?

I created an empty Visual Studio solution and added two projects: Backend(Class Library type) that will have the.edmx file for accessing information; and Frontend(ASP.Net type) that will have the database in the app_data folder. Is this a good architectural design or is there a more proven way to organize this type of application?
