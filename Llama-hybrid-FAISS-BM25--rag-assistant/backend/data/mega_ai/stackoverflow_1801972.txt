jQuery Conflict with mousewheel

I'm a designer doing a commemoration project for Red Cross Australia's 2004 Tsunami clean up efforts. The project is a timeline to commemorate all the work that has been done for the last few years. Note: As a first time user I wasn't allowed to include more than 1 link, so I'm sorry for all the urls I have pasted in. I'm using two jquery plugins to create the timeline: This horizontal scroll plugin from JQuery for designers See here for a direct link to the demo timeline- I have also used the Colorbox jquery plugin for displaying pictures and media There is functionality on the timeline for users to click and drag or use the mouse scroll wheel. I have an issue where the mouse scroll wheel doesn't work after I add the colorbox code to the page. The timeline works fine on its own as does colorbox, its just when they are added together. As a designer primarily, I donâ€™t know how to fix the issue, but I have narrowed down the focus to some sort of conflict when the jquery.min.js file is linked to for the colorbox plugin. The mouse wheel scrolling returns if I remove the link to this js in the head. Any suggestions would be welcomed.
