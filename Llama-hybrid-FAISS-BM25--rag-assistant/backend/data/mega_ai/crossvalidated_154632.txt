One way to do up to 4 dimensions, is to have a 2D array of graphs. It can stretch readability a bit, but if you have a full page and each graph is relatively simple, that might work. Seaborn in Python does this nicely, for example: http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/examples/faceted_histogram.html http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/examples/many_facets.html Another option for dimensionality reduction would be to do principal components analysis on the MSE, and then graph the contour map against those the first two PCs. I think the answer to your question in particular is highly dependent on the distribution of the MSE. If the distribution has a single global minimum and few local minima, I'd graph the MSE through that point against the two most informative axes, and then have separate graphs to explain the effect on MSE of each of the other variables. If there's some particularly interesting relationship between two of the predictors, that'd be worth a graph as well.
