They mainly differ in the link function. In Logit: $\Pr(Y=1 \mid X) = [1 + e^{-X'\beta}]^{-1} $ In Probit: $\Pr(Y=1 \mid X) = \Phi(X'\beta)$ (Cumulative standard normal pdf) In other way, logistic has slightly flatter tails. i.e the probit curve approaches the axes more quickly than the logit curve. Logit has easier interpretation than probit. Logistic regression can be interpreted as modelling log odds (i.e those who smoke >25 cigarettes a day are 6 times more likely to die before 65 years of age). Usually people start the modelling with logit. You could use the likelihood value of each model to decide for logit vs probit.
