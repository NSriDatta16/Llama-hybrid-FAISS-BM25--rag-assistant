It sounds like you want something like this: class Point { final int x; final int y; Point(int x, int y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; } } class Line { final int slope; final int intercept; Line(Point p1, Point p2) { this.slope = ...; this.intercept = ...; } } class Points { public void doIt(ArrayList points) { ArrayList lines = new ArrayList (); for (int i = 0; i (For the peanut gallery, yes there is scope for micro-optimization. But no, it isn't worth the effort unless you've profiled the program and found there to be a real and significant bottleneck.) [For a more elegant and scalable solution, override the equals(Object) (and hashcode() ) methods on Line class and replace the lines list with a TreeSet. This will reduce O(N**2) comparisons to O(NlogN) comparisons. But that's overkill for a basic programming exercise.]
