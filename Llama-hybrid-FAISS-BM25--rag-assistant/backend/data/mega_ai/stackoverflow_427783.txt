Your problem may arise from the fact that you're using a tag incorrectly. Spans are supposed to be inline elements and you're styling it as though it were a block element. Admittedly you can force a span to behave as a block element by adding the right style, but this may not always be honoured by the various browsers out there. Ideally you should be using a div instead. You can then use either p tags or further div tags to indicate the paragraphs (ideally p, since semantically they actually are paragraphs rather than unrelated blocks of text).
