I've been finally able to fix the issue by performing the following 2 steps: Removing refs/remotes/deep from packed-refs Removing .git/logs/refs/remotes/deep But still have the issue with fetching. I need to use branches = branches/*:refs/remotes/* for normal branches and branches = branches/deep/branches/*:refs/remotes/deep/branches/* for deep branches. Unfortunately the former specification includes the later, so I'm getting the error "fatal: Cannot lock the ref 'refs/remotes/deep'" as git-svn tries to create deep branch according to the first spec. So far, I do that by manually commenting the first "branches" and fetching specific revisions with deep branches, but this is not a good options as there are too many revisions to fetch for both cases. UPD: I have found the simple but not elegant solution for the remaining issue. I'm using branches to specify paths to deep branches and fetch to specify every branch of the first level.
