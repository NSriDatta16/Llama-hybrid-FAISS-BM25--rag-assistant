I'd bet that there are several classes named "StringUtil", "StringsUtil", "Strings" or anything along those lines on the classpath of any medium sized Java project. Most likely, any of them will provide a join function. Here are some examples I've found in my project: org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils.join(...) org.apache.wicket.util.string.Wicket.join(...) org.compass.core.util.StringUtils.arrayToDelimitedString(...) As you might want to get rid of some external dependencies in the future, you may want to to something like this: public static final MyStringUtils { private MyStringUtils() {} public static String join(Object[] list, String delim) { return org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils.join(list, delim); } } Now that's what I call "elegant" ;)
