Ereader-Style Pagination

I am grabbing text data from XML files, and want it to display in book page-like format inside a UIWebView on iPad. The XML files are coming out of a .epub , and each one contains a single chapter of a book, divided up only by p tags. I want to dynamically paginate these files into book-like pages based on the size of the UIWebView , which is a full iPad screen, as well as by user-selected font size. I am currently loading a blank html page with related css into a UIWebView , grabbing paragraphs based on number of characters as Strings from the XML, and printing these into the html using StringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString and the innerHTML property. Obviously, doing this by number of characters creates improperly spaced, oddly formatted pages, but I'm not sure how else to "paginate" the text. What I am looking to do is something akin to the app "eReader" on iPad: http://www.ereader.com/ . They seem to be breaking a single file up into pages dynamically, and loading it into UIWebView s. How is this done?
