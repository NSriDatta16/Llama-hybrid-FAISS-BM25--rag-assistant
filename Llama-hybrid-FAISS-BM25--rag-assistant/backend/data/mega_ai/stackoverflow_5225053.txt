How do I improve my parsing technique?

I am writing a pythonic parser for a custom language and as of now I have something like this: re1 = re.compile(r"...") re2 = re.compile(r"...") re3 = re.compile(r"...") re4 = re.compile(r"...") ... ... Now I am reading the input file and for each line if I find a specific keyword then I am using a particular regular expression. Obviously, this is making my life a living hell because I am doing something like this: if line.find("keyword1") >= 0 # Uses re1 to match the string invoke_handler1() elif line.find('keyword2") >= 0 # Uses re2 to match the string invoke_handler2() ... At the same time, I do not want to match a given line with all possible regular expressions because that would be a waste. Without discarding everything that I wrote up until this point, is there an elegant way of solving this problem and make it more efficient and readable?
