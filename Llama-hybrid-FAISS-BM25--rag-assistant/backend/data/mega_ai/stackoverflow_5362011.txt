Upcasting has absolutely no meaning in your example (in fact I can't imagine any case where it has any) and should be avoided as it only confuses developers. Some IDEs (IntelliJ for sure) will issue a warning in this line and suggest removing upcasting). EDIT: This code gives the same results because all object methods in Java are virtual, which means the target method is discovered by the actual type of the object at runtime rather than by reference type. Try making callme() static and see what happens.
