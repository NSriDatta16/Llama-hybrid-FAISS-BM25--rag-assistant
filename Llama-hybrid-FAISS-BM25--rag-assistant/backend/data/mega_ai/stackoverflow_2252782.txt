If you have a lot of buttons and want to do fancy things with them, I recommend using layers . Your UIView will handle interpreting which layer had the touch (hit testing) and respond appropriately. If all you're doing is managing a whole bunch of buttons with various effects and animations, this might be an easier route. As for bad engineering, not at all. If you take a look at the associated guides, you'll see core animation and layers does require hit testing (though that's relatively easy), but it's far cleaner than the UIView doing all the drawing and more efficient than many subviews. It slips right between those two approaches nicely. Full disclosure: I'm just wrapping my head around how to best leverage this stuff myself, but for more complicated interactive controls.
