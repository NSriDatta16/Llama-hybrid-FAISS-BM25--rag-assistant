You use logistic regression when your response variable is binary (0/1) or a proportion (10/30) so you can't relate it to a gaussian distribution which is continuos and has no boundaries. That's why you specify "family="binomial" to perform logistic regression in R and family="gaussian" to perform linear regression.
