You'd want to use something like the UI plugin to facilitate the actual dragging/dropping/reorganizing. I don't know of any libraries that will pick out DOM objects and AJAX information to a server in a particular fashion, so you would probably have to code something like that yourself to suit your specific needs. It might help to know what sort of DOM node you're trying to send. If you're building something like a custom WYSIWYG, sending the entire node might be the best approach without losing information. If you're doing something simple like allowing users to drag and drop to reorder a list something like the following code might suffice: var toPost = ''; function handler(data) {//handle server response} $("ul#container li").each(function(){toPost+=this.getAttribute('rel');}); $.post('processing_script.php',{data:toPost},handler); I checked into how Google handles these. If you drag and drop an element on the iGoogle homepage, a GET request is sent to the Google handling script with the following parameters: et '4af26272PQUMZP8V' mp '19_1:4_1:7_1:13_1:16_1:18_2:2_2:3_2:14_2:11_2:_opt_3:17_3:6_3:12_3'
