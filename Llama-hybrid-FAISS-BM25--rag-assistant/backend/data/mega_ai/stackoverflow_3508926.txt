NSNumberFormatter removes trailing zeros

I have used NSNUmberFormatter in a cell of NSTableView. This NSNUmberFormatter is dragged from the IB library and put in the table view cell. Then from the inspector constraints are modified. However during run of the aplication when I enter some values which has trailing zeros e.g. 9.100, the cell displays only 9.1. How do I retain the trailing zeros as well?
