The mean of $f(p_1,\ldots,p_k)$ is defined in terms of the distribution of $(p_1,\ldots,p_k)$, namely $$(p_1,\ldots,p_k)\sim \mbox{Dirichlet}(\alpha_1+n_1,\ldots,\alpha_k+n_k).$$Hence, if the data $(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$ changes, so does the distribution of $(p_1,\ldots,p_k)$, and the means $$\int f(p_1,\ldots,p_k) \pi((p_1,\ldots,p_k)|(n_1,\ldots,n_k))\,\text{d}\mathbf{p}$$ differ. Averaging successive means as $(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$ grows does not make sense from either a probabilistic (this is no longer a mean against a fixed distribution) or from a Bayesian (the final posterior distribution contains all the relevant information) viewpoints.
