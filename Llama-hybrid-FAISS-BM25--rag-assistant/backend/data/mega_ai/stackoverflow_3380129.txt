Parsing the Freebase Topic HTTP API - JSON & Javascript

I am trying to parse a JSON output: http://www.freebase.com/experimental/topic/standard?id=/en/colonel_sanders I'd like to put the basic data into an array using Javascript. In the "properties" object I'd like to grab any "text" element one level under "properties" as a label and grab the "text" under the "values" object to match the label. For the above I would get: "description": "Harland David Sanders, better known as Colonel Sanders... "Organizations founded": KFC "Cause of death": Leukemia "Date of death": Dec 16, 1980 "Place of death": Louisville "Date of birth": Sep 9, 1890 "Gender": Male etc... I have some code which recursively runs through the JSON but I am a novice with javascript and JSON and am having a lot trouble in step one: Firstly, grabbing the "text" trying by identifying an element as being "an element of" the main properties object; then Secondly grabbing from the associated values array any text element (if the value is a collection then I would like to concatenate the strings from the text or otherwise ignore it). I hope that make sense. nb. the code I use is similar to here: http://tlrobinson.net/projects/javascript-fun/jsondiff/
