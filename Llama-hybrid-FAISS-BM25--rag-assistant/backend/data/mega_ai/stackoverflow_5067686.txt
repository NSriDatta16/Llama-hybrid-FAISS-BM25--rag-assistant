well, there is not too much to do while we're talking of inserting data from textarea to mysql database. For the strings placed into query, Mysql requirements are not so complicated. Only 2 rules to follow: inserted data should be surrounded by quotes. some special character in the data should be escaped. Note that this operation has nothing to do with security. It's syntax requirements. Assuming you're adding quotes already, the only thing you have to add is escaping. Depends on your encoding, you can use addslashes or mysql_escape_string or mysql_real_escape_string functions. However, other parts of query require more attention. If you're curious, refer to my earlier answer with complete guide: In PHP when submitting strings to the database should I take care of illegal characters using htmlspecialchars() or use a regular expression? HTML tags has nothing to do with database and require no special attention. However, for displaying data from untrusted source, some precautions should be taken. It was described in this topic already, only I have to add is you can't trust to strip_tags when used with second parameter.
