It doesn't depend on the number of inputs directly. Your network has to be large enough to capture the structure of the problem and the data. This process would involve some trial and error experimentation For challenging predictive modeling problems, deep neural networks may be a heuristic approach. For the number of neurons and how much they should descend too, use trial and error. We cannot specify the “best” number of neurons analytically. We must test. Exploring and implementing more such models would help you develop better intuition about these, still involving some trial and error. Read more here
