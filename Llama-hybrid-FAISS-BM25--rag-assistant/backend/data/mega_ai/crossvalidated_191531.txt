Different AIC definitions

From Wikipedia there is a definition of Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) as $ AIC = 2k -2 \log L $, where $k$ is the number of parameters and $\log L$ is the log-likelihood of the model. However, our Econometrics notes at a well-respected university state that $ AIC = \log (\hat{\sigma}^2) + \frac{2 \cdot k}{T} $. Here $ \hat{\sigma}^2 $ is the estimated variance for the errors in an ARMA model and $ T $ is the number of observations in the time series dataset. Is the latter definition equivalent to the first, but simply tuned for ARMA models? Or is there some kind of conflict between the two definitions?
