Elegant way to get all objects of a specific type in an Objective-C array

I know I can do for (id obj in array) { if ([obj isKindOfClass:[Elephant class]]) [elephants addObject:obj]; } but I feel there must be a more elegant way of doing this. I've looked at filtering arrays but can't come up with a good predicate. Thoughts?
