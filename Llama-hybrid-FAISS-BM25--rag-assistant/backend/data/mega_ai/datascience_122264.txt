Training GPT Model with Swagger Documents, Need Help with Model Fit

We are currently developing an application that performs actions based on user input using 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0613'. For example, if a user enters the prompt "create a user with the name Potter and the role wizard," it should call the add_admin method available in our SDK. To enhance the capabilities of the application, we would like to train the underlying GPT model using our Swagger document(of the API which the SDK internally calls). The Swagger document contains valuable information about the API endpoints and request/response structures. However, we are facing difficulties in adapting the current GPT model to incorporate this specific training data.
