worst case can be found by assuming that both lists have an element in common and it's the last one on each list: this will lead to going through the first list by checking all elements of the second (you are using in_array but assume you do it by hand, it's the same thing O(m) : complexity). So you are going n times through the second list, complexity will be O(n*m) where n is the length of the first list and m the length of the second.. To find average complexity you should consider a solution that is average with respect to what you are computing.. it's quite easy and I leave it as an exercise.
