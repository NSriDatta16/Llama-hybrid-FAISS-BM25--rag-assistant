detecting persons on video/frames

I am learning neural networks and i have set goal to train NN to detect persons on camera/video. I understand basic concept of NN. What i am not sure is how should i approach this goal. If i wanted to train NN to recognize human it would be classification problem - its either human or not, i would put training data set of human and non human object for it to learn. However, how should i train NN in this type of scenario? What would output layer look like? Would the output be just the coordination of humans or how can i train it to detect all persons on video/camera? How to approach this? What came to my mind is to output layer be composed of nerusons which activision consist of vector ( x coords , y coords , width, height ). However in this case, i would have to neuron for all combination? Wouldnt that be overkill? Thanks for help.
