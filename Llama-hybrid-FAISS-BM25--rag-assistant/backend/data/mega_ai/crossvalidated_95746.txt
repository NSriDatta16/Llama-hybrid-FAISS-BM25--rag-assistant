Poisson random variable- variance

Let us model the number of winter storms in a given year as a Poisson random variable. Suppose that in a good year the average number of storms is 3, and in a bad year the average is 5. If the next year will be good with probability 40% and bad with probability 60%, find the expected number of winter storms next year. E[X] = 5*.6 + 3*.4 = 4.2 Next, find the variance of the number of winter storms next year. I know that Var[X] = E[X^2] - E[X}^2 so when I calculated this I got: E[X^2] = 5^2(.6) + 3^2(.4) = 18.6 and E[X]^2 = 4.2^2 = 17.64 so Var[X] = 18.6 -17.64 = .96. However, this is not the correct answer. Any ideas of where I am going wrong?
