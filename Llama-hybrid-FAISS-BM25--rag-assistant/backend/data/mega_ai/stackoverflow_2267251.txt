iPhone Cookie Persistence

In my iPhone app, every time I relaunch my cookies are cleared. This is using the NSURLRequesst and NSHTTPCookieStorage. And no, they are not session only cookies. How can I get NSHTTPCookieStorage to keep my cookies around, and if I can't, what is the proper way to store them (preference, keychain, etc.).
