Are you using a non-linear kernel? try a linear kernel first. Actually, try logistic regression first, with 6 features it will be fast and easy and give results similar to an SVM with linear kernel. It's hard to know whether an error rate of 0.03 is "poor" without knowing how many positive and negative samples are in your data. For example, it there's only 10% positives, then an a error rate of 10% is poor (not better than random). If there's 50%, then not as bad. Hence it's better to use other measures like area under ROC curve or precision/recall (precision still depends on % positives, ROC doesn't). You should definitely use cross-validation like in the first answer, but if your model is still nominally "bad" in the training data regardless of how much you tune it, then there's little hope for it being good in cross-validation, and either your features are not useful or your model is not relevant to the problem.
