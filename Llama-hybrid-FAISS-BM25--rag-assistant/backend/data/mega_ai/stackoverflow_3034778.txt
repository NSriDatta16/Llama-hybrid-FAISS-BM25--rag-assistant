There are a handful of resources that together make Rails very easy to learn. The API does have a learning curve, and it could definitely be better, but once you get over the initial learning curve with Rails, the API starts to feel a lot more helpful. The Rails Guides are a very good place to start. These are the other resources that make Rails very easy to learn: Railscasts.com Railsforum.com Amazing video tutorials here: www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-rbar/everyday-active-record http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-rbforms/mastering-rails-forms The Rails books from Pragmatic Programmer are excellent. It's worth buying Rails Recipes, Advanced Rails Recipes and Agile Web Development with Rails. If you buy all these books and the videos, you're still looking at less than $100. Considering what they empower you to do with Rails, it's a very good deal.
