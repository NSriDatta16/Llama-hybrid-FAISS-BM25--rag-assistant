Latent space of VAE

I have trained a VAE on a new dataset and it has converged nicely. I am able to interpolate between samples, etc, with expected results. However, when I randomly sample the latent space with z = [np.random.normal(0,1) for _ in range(len(latentspace))] I do not get the expected results. Looking at the data, I realized that while each of my vectors has ~ mean 0 and variance 1, if I look at real data, some positions consistently have mean > 0 or N(0,1) but as a result, this doesn't work.
