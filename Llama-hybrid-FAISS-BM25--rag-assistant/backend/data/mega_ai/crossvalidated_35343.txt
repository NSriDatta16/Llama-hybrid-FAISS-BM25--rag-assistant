Since there are no answers, I will at least post what I have gotten so far: The as.bugs.array function in the R2WinBUGS package was created for this purpose. According to the documentation ( ?as.bugs.array ): Function converting results from Markov chain simulations, that might not be from BUGS, to bugs object. Used mainly to display results with plot.bugs. Thus, it is possible to obtain a plot from LINE.out in your example, although it does not plot the correct variables: plot(as.bugs.array(sims.array = as.array(LINE.out))) It will take a little bit more work to determine the correct way to transform the LINE.out , and the LINE.samples object from example(jags.samples) may be an easier place to start.
