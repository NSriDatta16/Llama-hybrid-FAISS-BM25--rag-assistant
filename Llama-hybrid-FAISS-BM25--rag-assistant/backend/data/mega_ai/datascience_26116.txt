How to select a model based on statistical analyses?

I've been statistically validating the performance of different Deep Learning models in classifying parasitized and normal cells. In the process, I could find that there is no statistically significant difference in performance between the pre-trained CNN models. In the absence of such significance, which model am I supposed to choose?
