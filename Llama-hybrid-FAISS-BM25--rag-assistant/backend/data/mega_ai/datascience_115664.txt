Yes, this is a thing. Maybe looking into the paper "ConvXGB: A new deep learning model for classification problems based on CNN and XGBoost" will give you an intuition - although it does take advantage of CNN instead of RNN [...]. The contributions of this paper are: – A new deep learning model for classification problems called “ConvXGB” based on combine between CNN and XGBoost. – The ConvXGB architecture consists of a net with several stacked convolutional layers and with XGBoost as the last layer of the model. It differs from the traditional CNN, because there is neither a pooling layer nor a Fully Connected (FC) layer . This introduces simplicity and reduces the number of calculation parameters, since it is not necessary to bring weights from the FC layers back to re-adjust weights in the previous layers. – ConvXGB uses auto feature learning effectively and predicts class labels, with higher accuracy than the two individual models, which are the current prototypes for modeling, and other extant models, e.g. Decision Tree Classification, Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Classification.
