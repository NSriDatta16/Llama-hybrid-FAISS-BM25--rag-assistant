Metrics for interoperability maturity assessment The following approaches propose some metrics to assess the interoperability maturity, LISI: Levels of Information Systems Interoperability OIM: Organizational Interoperability Model NMI: NC3TA reference Model for Interoperability LCIM: Levels of Conceptual Interoperability Model EIMM: Enterprise Interoperability Maturity Model Smart Grid Interoperability Maturity Model Rating System For the several interoperability aspects identified previously, the listed maturity approaches define interoperability categories (or dimensions) and propose qualitative as well as qualitative cross cutting issues to assess them. While interoperability aspects are not covered by a single maturity approach, some propositions go deeply in the definition of metric dimensions at one interoperability aspect such as the business interoperability measurement proposed by Aneesh.
