It's just impossible, due to PHP nature. PHP script being run for a fraction of second and then dies . With all it's variables and associative arrays and other stuff. That's why a database intended to be data storage between distinct HTTP calls. Thus, don't pretend to be a smartmass, let the things go natural way: one page that queries database for the list of data, with typerlinks to detail page, passing unique record id via HTTP GET query string one details page that queries database for the details, based on passed id. here is a very basic example of such application, using templates, to give you an idea: $v) $row[$k]=htmlspecialchars($v); } else { $row['name']=''; $row['id']=0; } include 'form.php'; } ?> details page template called form.php "> "> Return to the list and main page template called list.php Add item "> this is example of admin page, letting you add and edit records. however, the page tat just shows the data will be pretty much the same.
