orithm on top of the Rete network, but it cannot be said to fully implement Rete II, in part due to the fact that no full specification is publicly available. Rete-III In the early 2000s, the Rete III engine was developed by Charles Forgy in cooperation with FICO engineers. The Rete III algorithm, which is not Rete-NT, is the FICO trademark for Rete II and is implemented as part of the FICO Advisor engine. It is basically the Rete II engine with an API that allows access to the Advisor engine because the Advisor engine can access other FICO products. Rete-NT In 2010, Forgy developed a new generation of the Rete algorithm. In an InfoWorld benchmark, the algorithm was deemed 500 times faster than the original Rete algorithm and 10 times faster than its predecessor, Rete II. This algorithm is now licensed to Sparkling Logic, the company that Forgy joined as investor and strategic advisor, as the inference engine of the SMARTS product. Rete-OO Considering that Rete aims to support first-order logic (basically if-then-else statements), Rete-OO aims to provide a rule-based system that supports uncertainty (where the information to make a decision is missing or is inaccurate). According to the author's proposal, the rule "if Danger then Alarm" would be improved to something such as "given the probability of Danger, there will be a certain probability of hearing an Alarm" or even "the greater the Danger, the louder should be Alarm". For this it extends the Drools language (which already implements the Rete algorithm) to make it support probabilistic logic, like fuzzy logic and Bayesian networks.
