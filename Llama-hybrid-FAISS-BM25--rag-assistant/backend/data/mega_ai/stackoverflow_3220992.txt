Apparently its easier in C++ style, but as you said there aren't any easily available documentation. To Write cv::Mat in a file just create a FileStorage variable and then write the matrix in the style you use cout to print on screen. cv::Mat someMatrix; //you create and assign values to someMatrix however you plan to. FileStorage fs("myFile.yml", FileStorage::WRITE); fs Reading is also similar to cin style, but its better you take a look at the below link to have a better understanding. On 2nd page in section Data I/O they have shown examples on how to use XML/YAML. opencv C++ cheatsheet(different than cheatsheet in the documentation PDF)
