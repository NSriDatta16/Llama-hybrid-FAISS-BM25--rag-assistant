Should plots for time series use a logarithmic scale for duration/time?

I was reading this tutorial on ggplot2 and was struck by a bit where it said that durations are typically best displayed along a logarithmic scale Is this an established principle? The author states the claim as if it were, but I've never seen them plotted like this (at least not in phonetics), and to me, a linear scale makes more sense (time moving at a constant rate and all). If it is an established principle, I would appreciate some references and maybe an explanation of why this is the case.
