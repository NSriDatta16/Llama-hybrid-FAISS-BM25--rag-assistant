Quartz seems like a nice solution. I've recently (this year) had to write a custom task scheduler on a major project I was working on. They too could not use the Windows Task Scheduler, and also wanted the ability to execute custom functionality by virtue of uploading assemblies (via an ASP.net website) and have the service execute the appropriate task at the specified time. The thing was honestly a bit of a nightmare (not so much to design and implement, but the scheduling logic was a bit of a drag). I'd highly recommend exhausting all other avenues before deciding to "roll your own" (a.k.a reinvent the wheel!).
