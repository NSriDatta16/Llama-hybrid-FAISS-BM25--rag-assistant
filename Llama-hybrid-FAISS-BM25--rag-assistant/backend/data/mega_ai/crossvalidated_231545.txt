Bayesian posterior distributions

I have the model $y_{i,t}=x_{i,t}'\beta_{i} + \epsilon_{i,t}$ where $x_{i,t}$ is a k-dimensional vector of explanatory variables and $\beta_{i}$ is a k-dimensional parameter vector, where $\beta_{i}=\Gamma'w_{i}+\eta_{i}$ where $w_{i}$ is an l-dimensional vector of explanatory variables and $\Gamma$ is a $l\times k$ parameter matrix. Assuming that $\epsilon_{i,t} \sim N(0,\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2})$ and $\eta_{i} \sim N(0,\Sigma_{\eta})$ and also assuming uninformative priors for the parameters $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}, \Sigma_{\eta}, \beta_{i}$ and $\Gamma$ I cannot seem to find their posterior distributions. Any help ? The reason I need their posterior distributions is to use Gibbs sampling later to estimate them.
