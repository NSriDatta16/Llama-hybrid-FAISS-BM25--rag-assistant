I suggest reviewing the literature / work by the mixmod group and by Raftery 's group. Both have methods for model-based clustering involving both feature selection and without feature selection. Heuristic based methods may be appropriate for your but the performance of both heuristics, and the model based methods, tend to be highly influenced by your data inputs and your data pre-processing (as below). Typically in a business case, you have variables from many different distributions. This poses problems in mixture modeling; and, you have not specified (a) if this is (or isn't) the case in your data, and (b) (if so) how you wish to deal with it. Another concern is how knowledgeable you are about your data. How confident are you that you can actually select the most important features? Questions What types of variables do you have? What are there distributions? What is there correlation structure (you mentioned poor results, without detail, from PCA)? How are you pre-processing your variables? If you provide additional detail on your data, a more complete answer can be provided.
