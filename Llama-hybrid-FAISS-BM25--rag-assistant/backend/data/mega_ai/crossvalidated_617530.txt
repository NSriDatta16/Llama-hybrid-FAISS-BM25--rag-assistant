I am working with a dataset of 110.000 rows. Each row only has categorical data, most of which is also nominal. Each of these rows represents an event that has several parameters (again, nominal) and an outcome. The question I'm trying to answer is what combination of parameters gives the best result. In this case, the result is the amount of times a combination of parameters is positive or negative. Because there is no numerical value to work with, I'm not sure what to do. I already calculated the average of each single parameter and also included the standard deviation and did a chi squared test to see what values of a certain parameter are likely to be different from the rest (p
