The variables userid and code in the URL are made available to PHP in an array called GET: echo $_GET['userid']; // 564979 If you have a hash (or fragment) in your URL, this won't get back to PHP: www.mysite.com?val=1#part2 In the above, PHP can see the domain and the val variable, but not #part2 . Sites that use the hash to significantly change the page (eg GMail) use javascript to pull in new content when the hash changes. Be sure to sanitize your variables before using them, to avoid malicious users being able to hack into your system. This is a big topic, but read up on the following: Data Filtering PHP Data Objects Sanitize and Validate Data with PHP Filters If you don't sanitize, someone could change your url so that the variable is set to: ;DELETE * FROM mytable; When you query your db without sanitising your inputs, you could lose all your data.
