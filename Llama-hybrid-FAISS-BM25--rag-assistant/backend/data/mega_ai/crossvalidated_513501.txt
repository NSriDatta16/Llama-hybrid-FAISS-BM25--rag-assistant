If you want to look deeper into the sample coverage of the bootstrap, it is worth noting that simple-random-sampling with replacement gives an "occupancy number" that follows the classical occupancy distribution (see e.g., O'Neill 2019 ). Suppose we have an original sample containing $n$ data points and we take a bootstrap resample, also with $n$ points. Let $K_n$ denote the number of data points in the original sample that appear in the resample. It is well-known that this quantity follows the classical occupancy distribution, with mass function: $$\mathbb{P}(K_m=k) = \text{Occ}(k|n,n) = \frac{(n)_k \cdot S(n,k)}{n^n}.$$ (The values $(n)_k = \prod_{i=1}^k (n-i+1)$ are the falling factorials and the values $S(n,k)$ are the Stirling numbers of the second kind .) The mean and variance of this occupancy number are: $$\begin{align} \mathbb{E}(K_n) &= n \bigg[ 1 - \bigg( 1-\frac{1}{n} \bigg)^n \bigg], \\[6pt] \mathbb{V}(K_n) &= n \bigg[ (n-1) \bigg(1-\frac{2}{n} \bigg)^n + \bigg(1-\frac{1}{n} \bigg)^n - n \bigg(1-\frac{1}{n} \bigg)^{2n} \bigg]. \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ Taking $n \rightarrow \infty$ we get the asymptotic equivalence: $$\mathbb{E}(K_n) \sim n \bigg( 1-\frac{1}{e} \bigg) \quad \quad \quad \mathbb{V}(K_n) \sim \frac{n}{e} \bigg( 1-\frac{1}{e} \bigg).$$ Consequently, as $n \rightarrow \infty$ the proportion of the original data points that are covered by the resample converges to $K_n/n \rightarrow 1-1/e \approx 0.632$ . Whilst this is a slightly more complicated presentation of the issue, examination of the classical occupancy distribution allows you to fully describe the stochastic behaviour of the sample coverage.
