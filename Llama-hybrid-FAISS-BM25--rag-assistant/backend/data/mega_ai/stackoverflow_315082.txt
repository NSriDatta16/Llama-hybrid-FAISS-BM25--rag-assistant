If your process genuinely needs gigabytes of virtual address space, then upgrading to 64-bit really does instantly remove the need for workarounds. But it's worth working out how much memory you expect your process to be using. If it's only in the region of a gigabyte or less, there's no way even crazy fragmentation would make you run out of 32-bit address space - memory leaks might be the problem. (Windows is more restrictive, by the way, since it reserves an impolite amount of address space in each process for the OS).
