I think you're trying to tag/classify your products into product "buckets" like faucets? If so, the features you've proposed are ill-suited to a statistical approach. You should investigate word vectors as features. https://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/paragraph_vector.pdf You will still need to annotate a dataset, or provide "faucet" for each of some set observations for training. You could use the NLP techniques you're already employing to automate a portion of that work, effectively giving you a "suggestion" for you to review and edit if necessary.
