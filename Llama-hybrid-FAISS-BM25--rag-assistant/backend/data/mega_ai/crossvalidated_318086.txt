Using Index (ratio) for time series analysis

I am doing a multivariate time series analysis. However, one of my time series is the Productivity Index . The time series consist of quarterly data from 1971 to 2015. The index is such that 2010 = 1, meaming that the average value of all four quarters in 2010 is equal to 1. The remaining values for every quarter are expressed according to the index value. Can I proceed with the time series? What implications do the index values have on my results?
