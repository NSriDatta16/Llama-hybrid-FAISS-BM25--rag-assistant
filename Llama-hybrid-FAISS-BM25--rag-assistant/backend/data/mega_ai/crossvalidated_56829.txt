Bootstrapping involves a random process, so there is uncertainty in your estimate of the confidence bounds. This will show up as these confidence bounds being rather ragged with only 100 replications. With 100 replications the lower bound will be based on the 2nd and 3rd smallest occurrences. So only a few "weird" samples can influence your estimate of the lower bound (and similarly the upper bound). If you take 20,000 replications the lower bound will be based on the 500th smallest occurrence, and thus tends to be a lot more stable.
