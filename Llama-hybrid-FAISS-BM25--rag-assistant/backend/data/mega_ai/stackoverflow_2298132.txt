From what you have described, it's apparent that you are dealing with files of different types (xml, raw, etc). I would write interfaces in this scenario for sure, as you have the same process but with different code details in each case. For example, you have the TransportFile "thing" that either sends using the SFTP port or the FTP. You can specify the port in a constructor or by any other means. "WaitForResponse" can be best implemented by having your "GetResponseActvity" implement the AsynchCodeActivity provided by WF4.0. For each specific task, you might need a helper class for your "general purpose" actvities. The nice thing about WF's is that you can do all of the customization for the differnt customers in the designer by dragging and dropping these activites and configuring them with these helper objects.
