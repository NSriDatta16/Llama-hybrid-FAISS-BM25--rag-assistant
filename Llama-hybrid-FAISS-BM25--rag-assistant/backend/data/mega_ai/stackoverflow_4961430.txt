Get current JNLP information

I'm running an application from a jnlp file that contains useful information such as the vendor, a description, and other field. What is the most reasonable way to get this data at Runtime in order to build an "About" dialog ? Is there a way to detect that the application has been launched without Java Web Start ? Thanks for your help. Pierre
