This is an artifact of the stochasticity of MCMC sampling. The best you can do is set a specific seed before each run, using set.seed() : set.seed(123) fls1 = bms(datafls, burn = 50000, iter=100000, g = "BRIC", mprior = "uniform", nmodel = 2000, mcmc="bd", user.int=F) set.seed(123) fls2 = bms(datafls, burn = 50000, iter=100000, g = "BRIC", mprior = "uniform", nmodel = 2000, mcmc="bd", user.int=F) This causes the initial conditions of R's random number generator to be the same before you run your samplers, so the results of fls1 and fls2 will be the same.
