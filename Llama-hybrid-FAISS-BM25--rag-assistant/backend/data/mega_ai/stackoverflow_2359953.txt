The book Algorithms of the Intelligent Web by Haralambos Marmanis & Dmitry Babenko (Manning ed. 2009) provide a primer into this kind of things. This book covers a rather broad spectrum of areas where "smarts" can be applied to web applications. Because of this, many topics receive at a rather superficial treatment, BUT each chapter includes very relevant references for digging further. Also, code-wise, the working examples found in the book are made available in a code.google.com project (sorry however, mostly java, not C# as suggested in the question) I cannot think of other AI resources specifically focused on Web applications, but many areas of AI-at-large are relevant the "intelligent web", in particular: Natural Language Processing [some] Neural Networks Machine learning and classifiers
