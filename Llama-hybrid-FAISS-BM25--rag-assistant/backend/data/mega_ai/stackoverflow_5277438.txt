I think you're on the right track. In a project you need to address three documentation needs User Documentation This include a document stating what the application is about, and how to start it/access ut. Development Documentation This includes at least the Javadocs, a description of the source code directory structure, the build process (ie, how to compile the project), compiler time dependencies, development standards, how to set up a database for development, and how to get the source code from the repository. These are the minimum you need to get others to work in your project. Additionally as the project complexity grows I like to put together a series of "How To" for common tasks in the system (ie: "How to leave an Audit Trail for a given Operation", "How to use the Logging framework", "How to manage exceptions", etc), a description of the main Domain classes and their relationship. If you use a database, and the database schema is not exactly one-on-one with the domain classes, I'll add a schema documentation. Deployment Documentation This is basically the installation manual of the application, describing any steps needed to make it run: putting the WAR in Tomcat, running scripts against a database, configuration files that needs to be modified, etc,etc. As you see, you already partially addressed two of them. Start small and simple, and add the rest as the need arises. It also helps to check if your organization has any documentation standard.
