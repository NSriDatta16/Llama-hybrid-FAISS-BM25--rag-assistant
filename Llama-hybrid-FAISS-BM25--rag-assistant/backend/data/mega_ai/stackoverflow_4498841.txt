HTTP redirection mechanism includes two steps: HTTP server returns a 301 HTTP status ("Moved Permanently") with a new location (URI) HTTP agent (capybara in your case) re-sends previous request to the new location You are to find a way to recognize 301 HTTP response status (shouldn't be hard) using Capybara's DSL. Also, you may want to turn Capybara's "follow_redirect" (or something similar) option off in order to prevent step #2. Hope it helps.
