This appears to me to be a misunderstanding by the authors. Wager and Athey (2018) (the article mentioned as "(8)") rely on an assumption that they call "unconfoundedness", which is sometimes also called "strong ignorability" or "conditional exchanegeability". Notably, the assumption is that treatment is independent of the potential outcomes conditional on some covariates $X$ . However, to distinguish the scenario when $X$ is the empty set, one might distinguish between "conditional" unconfoundedness, when $X$ is not the empty set, and "unconditional" unconfoundedness, when $X$ is the empty set. Kunzel et al. (2019) seem to interpret Wager and Athey's assumption of "unconfoundedness" to mean "unconditional unconfoundedness", and therefore claim the method that relies on this assumption not to be valid when conditional unconfoundedness is required, which is the case for the simulation in the quoted text. But that is clearly not how Wager and Athey intended it, since, as you mention, they explicitly mention modeling the propensity score and the assumption is formally stated as being conditional on $X$ where $X$ can be a set other than the empty set. So to me, this is an omission caused by a misunderstanding by Kunzel et al. (2019) about what Wager and Athey's assumption of unconfoundedness means. References Künzel, S. R., Sekhon, J.
