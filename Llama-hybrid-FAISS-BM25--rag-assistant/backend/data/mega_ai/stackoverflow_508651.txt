ASP.NET Hosting on Virtual Servers running on VMWare

My Company is running several international websites for selling insurance products. Our current setup is a Webfarm with multiple Loadbalanced Webservers hosting our ASP.NET applications. The backend is a single - yet powerful - SQL Server. (all in one data center) Our network admins want to move to virtual servers running on VMWare . Scenarios could be Webfarm : Multiple standard webservers, Loadbalanced (current setup), Session state on SQL Server Virtual Webfarm : Multiple virtual servers, loadbalanced on one physical VMWare Host, Session state on SQL Server 2.a same as above but with multiple physical hosts Single Virtual Webserver : One big powerful virtual webserver, no loadbalancing required, session state can be kept in process There is a big hype around virtualization and I can see the benefits, but have no experience with this. I cannot tell what issues we will face and to what we should pay special attention. Does anyone have experience with such a virtual setup? What are general recommendations? I tend towards 2a. I am afraid of having all webservers on one single physical machine. Many thanks in advance to share your thoughts.
