ETS or ARIMA model

I have a time series data set and want to predict my data in the future. I would like to when to use a ETS or an ARIMA model? Is is true that you can only use a ETS model when a data is non-stationary? And when a data is stationary you need to difference it first and then use an ARIMA model to make some forecasting? I am doing the forecasting in r.
