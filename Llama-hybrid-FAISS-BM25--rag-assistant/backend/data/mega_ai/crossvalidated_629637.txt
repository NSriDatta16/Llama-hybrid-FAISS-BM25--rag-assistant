what's the model/data drift metric for time series forecasting?

Suppose that I have time series forecasting model, e.g. forecasting point of sales revenue in various economic scenarios represented by indicators such as inflation or interest rates. I build a model $\hat y_{t+h|I_t}=f(X_{t+h|I_t}|\hat\theta_\tau)$ , where $X$ are set of scenario variables and $\theta$ - model weights/parameters that were estimated at time $\tau , .i.e. some time ago relative to current time t; h - forecast steps ahead. I denote all that is known and observed at or before time t as $I_t$ . I can obtain fit statistics from estimation of $\theta$ , and also can obtain forecast errors from past periods $y_{s+h}-\hat y_{s+h|I_{s . I'm looking for a suitable metric that would help determine whether the model needs to be re-estimated or maybe even re-built due to the drift in data since the model was estimated. I was thinking too obtain the one step ahead forecast errors $r_s=y_{s+1}-\hat y_{s+1|I_{s}}$ for periods $s\le \tau$ and $s>\tau$ and compare their distributions, e.f. compare means and variance assuming they are independent random value draws. I could run ANOVA or similar to determine whether they look similar.
