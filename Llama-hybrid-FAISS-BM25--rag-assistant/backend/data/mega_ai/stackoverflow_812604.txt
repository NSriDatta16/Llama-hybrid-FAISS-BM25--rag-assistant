I see two major benefits to Git over SVN: No single point of failure. GitHub went down today and many people complained, but they could keep working with their teams because each checked out copy is a full repository that can be diff'd, merged, etc. Eliminates political problems. As organizations grow, the number of internal projects increases, and thus the number of dependencies. Git makes it easy for each organizational unit to "own" copies of each project, which can make reduce headaches when creating new versions. It also means that a team can start up their own branch, make improvements, and then offer the branch back to the primary owners version of the project -- all without going through the headaches of getting permission on a different group's systems.
