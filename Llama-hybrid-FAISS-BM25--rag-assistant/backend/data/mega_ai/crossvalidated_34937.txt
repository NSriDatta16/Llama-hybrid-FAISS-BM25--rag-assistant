Comparison: "Metric MDS gives the SAME result as PCA"- procedurally- when we look at the way SVD is used to obtain the optimum. But, the preserved high-dimensional criteria is different. PCA uses a centered covariance matrix while MDS uses a gram matrix obtained by double-centering distance matrices. Will put the difference mathematically: PCA can be viewed as maximizing $Tr(X^T(I-\frac{1}{n}ee^T)X)$ over $X$ under constraints that $X$ is orthogonal, thereby giving axes/principal components. In multidimensional scaling a gram matrix(a p.s.d matrix that can be represented as $Z^TZ$) is computed from euclidean distance between rows in $X$ and the following is minimized over $Y$. minimize: $||G-Y^TY||_{F}^{2}$.
