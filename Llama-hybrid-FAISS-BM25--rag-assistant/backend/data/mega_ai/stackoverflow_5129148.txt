In theory, you (and all the world) should be using 303 as you have noted. But also, most browsers react to a 302 like they should react to a 303. So, overall, it seems that it won't matter if you send 302 or 303. In the link you provided for the 303 specification, theres an interesting note: Note: Many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 303 status. When interoperability with such clients is a concern, the 302 status code may be used instead, since most user agents react to a 302 response as described here for 303. It's important to note the pre -HTTP/1.1 user agents, so maybe this was important a while ago, but I don't believe it is the case now. So, all in all, it's up to you (I could bet whatever you want that browsers won't change their behavior against 302 statuses never, for fear of breaking the internet for their users).
