What algorithm can I use to forecast the time series?

Now the above is my graph. The x axis coordinates corresponded to the minutes. An week contains 10080 minutes. So that is the length of the entire X axis. The graph shows the up time (time during which a particular PC is switched on) of a PC. If y=1 then the PC is on else off. Now if I take the data for multiple weeks then there will be some sort of seasonality. My question is what technique will be suitable for this problem? I have tried ARIMA but I think the lag order should be about 10000. It is not working with such a high lag.
