How to reproduce a plot with fitted value graph and lowess smooth graph superimpose?

I have a binary response variable (y) and continuous explanatory variable (age). I utilised logistic regression to analyse them. I have a plot of y against age. What I want to do now is superimpose the fitted value plot and lowess plot on it. So how do I do that? This is what I have come up with so far: plot(y~age) GLM Is this right/ the best way?
