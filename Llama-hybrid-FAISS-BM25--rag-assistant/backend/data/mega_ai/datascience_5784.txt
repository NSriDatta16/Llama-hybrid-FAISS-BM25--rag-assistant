At least based on what I and other data analysts/scientists do in my company, your technical topics list seems sufficient. But I would also add: Visualization (ggplot2 in R, matplotlib in Python, d3.js for really cool stuff) Design of experiments Communication skills are also quite important. For more inspiration, here's a good "curriculum" represented as a metro map: http://nirvacana.com/thoughts/becoming-a-data-scientist/ Let me also recommend building up a portfolio of data science projects. This could consist of your analyses of data sets you find online (e.g. on UCI ), Kaggle competitions, or class projects (e.g. via Udacity or Coursera). That way, you can give direct proof of your technical skills, your communication in the form of reports or graphics, and your ability to extract insight.
