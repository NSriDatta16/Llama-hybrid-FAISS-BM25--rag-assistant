Method .getText() returns a string not a number, if that string contains non-numeric characters (i.e. a letter, a space, nothing at all) then parseInt will throw a NumberFormatException. Since your using KeyEvent, as soon as you press say "7", the event is fired before 7 is entered into the text box. Thus the text box still only contains "", which is where the error comes from. You may wish to also listen to the keyUp event instead. You need to enclose your code in a try catch block. private void fahrTextKeyTyped(java.awt.event.KeyEvent evt) { try { int fahr = Integer.parseInt(fahrText.getText()); int cels = (int)(fahr / 1.8 - 32); celsiusText.setText(cels + ""); } catch(NumberFormatException ex) { //Error handling code here, i.e. informative message to the user } } An alternative is you could filter out non-numbers on keydown event, see example here - http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/java107/java107.html (Creating a custom component - NumberTextField)
