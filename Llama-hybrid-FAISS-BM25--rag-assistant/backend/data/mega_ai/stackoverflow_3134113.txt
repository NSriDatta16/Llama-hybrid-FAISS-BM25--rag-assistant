Facebook - How to add Like button inside a Static FBML?

Has anyone here tried to add a Like button on a static FBML (a fan page)??? Not sure if this is possible by simply embedding the Like button plugin on to the static FBML, but I tried the iframe version and it didn't show up... Any ideas how to integrate??? Thx!
