What it sounds like is that the web application is using the same data context between calls. Restarting the web server or recycling the associated Application Pool in IIS should have the same effect as redeployment if I'm right. If this is the case, then you need to rework your data retrieval methods to use a new data context every time. Roughly: public List GetData() { MyDataContext context = new MyDataContext(); return context.MyData.ToList(); }
