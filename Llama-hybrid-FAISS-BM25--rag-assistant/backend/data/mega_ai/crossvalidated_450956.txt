For tree based model, it can automatically handle redundant features, i.e. less useful features will not be selected as a split point. So you do not need to manually handle feature selection problems. In many implementations of random forest or tree based boosting, the algorithm will automatically select a subset of features to build each tree. Therefore, from computational complexity perspective, thousands features are fine (In your case you only have 50 features.)
