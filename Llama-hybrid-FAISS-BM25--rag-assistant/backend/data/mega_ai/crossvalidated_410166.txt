Am I reading my dataset right?

Since I'm new in deep learning I have some questions. I made some tests with keras and mnist dataset and everything was OK. Then I decided to try with some of my datests. You could find the dataset here: dataset . I'm not sure if uploading dataset on such service is OK for the community. The model is simple classifier and the target property is at position 0 in the dataset. The thing that worries me is that the model is build quite fast - about 1 second per epoch. I'm not sure if I read my data correctly and I need an advice for the model that I made. So thanks in advance for the time you spare to help me. Here is the code that I used: from numpy import zeros as zero from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout import tensorflow as tf f_train = open("train.csv", "r") train_data_x = zero((10764, 512)) train_data_y = zero((10764, 1)) n=0 for line in f_train.readlines(): line = line[:-1] train_data_x[n]= line.split(",")[1:] train_data_y[n] = line.split(",")[0] n+=1 f_test = open("test.csv", "r") test_data_x = zero((7177, 512)) test_data_y = zero((7177, 1)) n=0 for line in f_test.readlines(): line = line[:-1] test_data_x[n]= line.split(",")[1:] test_data_y[n] = line.split(",")[0] n+=1 model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(256, input_dim=512, activation='relu')) model.add(Dropout(0.5)) model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu')) model.add(Dropout(0.5)) model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu')) model.add(Dropout(0.5)) model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')) model.compile(loss="binary_crossentropy", optimizer="adam", metrics=["accuracy"]) model.fit(train_data_x, train_data_y, epochs=20, batch_size=128, validation_split=0.25, verbose=2) test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_data_x, test_data_y, batch_size=128,verbose=0) print(f"test_loss: {test_loss}; test_acc: {test_acc}") Edit: Reupload dataset
