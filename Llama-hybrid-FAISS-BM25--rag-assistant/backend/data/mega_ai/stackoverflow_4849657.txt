I would recommend using the IsolatedStorage class. There you can store a file which is directly "linked" to your application. Have a closer look to it in MSDN IsolatedStorage . You may use a file assembly scoped . Anyway each user MAY navigate through the file system to your applicationData folder and open this file manually (although it is rather unexpected)
