How to automate time series analysis/monitor (descriptive)?

For example, here is a traffic graph from google analytics: You can see that first there is a spike, and then a long plateau time, and then increase to a slightly high stage (but more volatile), and then drop down to 0. My question: is it possible to detect/describe them when they occur ? Specifically, to automatically tell me: Is there any stable trend recently? Is there any spike/drop down recently? Is there any upward/doward trend recently? For example, at 2018 Aug, it tells me there is a spike, and at 2018 Oct, tells me there is new stable trend, and a Feb 2019 tells me that it might enter a higher-level with more volatility. Reasons for doing this: we might have many time series to watch, so we can automate some simple/obvious tasks. How can I do it? is there any related Python/R packages? (maybe like https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling ) I think it's possible. We may need to handcode what is stable/spike/dropdown, specify the significant level. and determine the window size. A naive approach can be using predictive time series packages like Facebook Prophet , and send alert when time series is not aligned with the prediction.
