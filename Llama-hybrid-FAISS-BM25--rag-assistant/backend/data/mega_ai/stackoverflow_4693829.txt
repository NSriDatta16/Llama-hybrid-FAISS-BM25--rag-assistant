I use to have a similar problem, as workaround or maybe a Fix you can change the query lookup results = SearchQuerySet().filter(content__startswith='Sri Ragh') The issue is that django-haystack doesn't implement all lingos from search engines. Of course you can do this. results = SearchQuerySet().raw_search('READ THE SEARCH ENGINE QUERY SYNTAX FOR GET WILDCARD LOOKUPS') As Django-haystack says, this is not portable.
