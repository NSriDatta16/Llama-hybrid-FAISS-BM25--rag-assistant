How to find "P for trend" in logistic regression?

When I read some articles that used logistic regression, many of them report OR values (usually adjusted ones) plus the "p for trend." Usually, "p for trend" is put when presenting a set of OR's related to dummy variables concerning an ordinal variable. For example: if y (0 / 1) is predicted using various IV's including educational level, then the education variable is a variable that would be fractured into dummy variables: Secondary school: OR = 1 Diploma: OR = 1.12 Bachelor: OR = 1.70 Master: OR = 2.41 PhD: OR = 2.39 -------------> P for trend = .010 my question is how to get such p-value? I tried to find out in SPSS, but did not find such option. I also made some search in R, and still found nothing. I saw a link in a google search mentioning "p-for-trend" in SAS and Stata (and actually I didn't know what they are talking about, because I don't use the codes of these 2 software). Note: although Stata is user interface + coding software, I still couldn't find such option (for p-for-trend) in its user-interface options.
