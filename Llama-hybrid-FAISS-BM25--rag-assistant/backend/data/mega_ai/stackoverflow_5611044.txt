Creating a User Interface From a Data Model

I already created my xcdatamodel file. Then I follow instruction in http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/XcodeCoreDataTools/Articles/xcdCreatingUserInterface.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006854-SW1 So I created a new project. I select iOs Application Window Based Application. Then I follow the instruction of option dragging the entities into the main view. Nothing happens. What should I do? Any video tutorial?
