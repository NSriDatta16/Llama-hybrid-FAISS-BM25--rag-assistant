(1) almost all classification algorithms assume an equal cost of misclassification. Will thus be dependent of the ratio of 1/0 in the dependent variable. Will thus often not be useful (without adjustment) when the ratio of outcomes is large. (2) this is known known issue. use cost sensitive models (C50) or oversample minority case /oversample minority case to impose a different (your preferred) cost ratio onto the model, rather than using default 1:1 ratio Update: (1) the Kunh book: Applied Predictive Modeling - has a chapter on this (2) for random forests, the Andy Liaw paper is often referenced: Using Random Forest to Learn Imbalanced Data
