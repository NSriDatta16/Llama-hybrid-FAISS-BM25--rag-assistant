If you want a rule-based interpretable answer, a very simple way to start off is to use decision tree (and next step to use random forest). Decision tree would be able to select the most relevant features (caffeine, workout) and explain in better detail what value of these features causes the label to be Yes or No (or probabilities using regression tree). I would use simpler models for a smaller dataset instead of going for neural network architectures (following the principle of "Occam's razor")
