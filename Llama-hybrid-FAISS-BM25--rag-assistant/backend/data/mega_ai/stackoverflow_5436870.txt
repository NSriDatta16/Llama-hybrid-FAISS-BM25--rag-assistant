DevExpress XtraGrid: Make column visible to user

I have a grid with lots of columns (ca. 100). I've written a column selector context menu (which has each letter of the alphabet and then as subitems all the columns beginning with that letter). When the user clicks in the context menu I want to make the column they have chosen visible to the user (preferably in the middle of the visible grid). I don't want to actually mess with the column order, I just want to make sure a column is visible to the user. Any ideas?
