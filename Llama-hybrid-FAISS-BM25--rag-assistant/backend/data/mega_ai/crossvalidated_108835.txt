Just to add to what the others said already. I think your confusion is well founded. There is no clear-cut answer to your question as far as I can see. Answering your question depends on your ability to clearly delineate the role locus of attention plays in the connection between stress and well-being. Hypothetical constructs are often too fuzzy for this. The confusion in your example arises because "locus of control" can act as a moderator or a mediator depending on the context. Moderators serve to influence/modify the relationship between two other variables by either amplifying or attenuating their interaction. But it doesn't serve as the necessary causal mechanism for their interaction. In your example, locus of control would be a moderator if it influences the relationship between stress and well-being, but isn't a necessary link to establish that relationship. Stress will probably still have an influence on well-being and there are numerous other psychological factors that could influence the relationship between well-being and stress quite independently of locus of control. Mediating variables, on the other hand, are vital in establishing the relationship because they make the interaction possible; take them away and the interaction stops. The line is very blurry in your case, but my gut tells me that locus of control masquerades as a mediator because of the phrasing, but it is actually a moderator.
