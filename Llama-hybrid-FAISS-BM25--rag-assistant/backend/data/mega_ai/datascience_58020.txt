What do I need to learn in order to really understand Machine Learning?

I've graduated with a math major in undergrad, but mostly focused on algebra (Galois Theory, Knot theory, etc.). I work in something unrelated right now, but now I want to study machine learning. The question is, what kind of knowledge should I have if I want to really understand machine learning? Say, here are some things I can think of, but obviously I'm missing a lot, I'm assuming. "Fundamentals" (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Coding, etc.) Probability (but what specific areas?) Statistics (but what kind?) Algorithms Differential Equations But what else? Or what subfields of what I've mentioned above are particularly important (i.e. Bayesian statistics)? Edit: I am currently considering a graduate program in ML, and wanted to know if this is something I really want to do / know more about it / prepare myself.
