It really depends on your data requirements, your database schema and the UI technology. For web sites I've had a lot of success with nested UL/LI tags created from hierarchical "paths"; this allows me to hide/check/etc all checkboxes under a parent by finding the child list. I use the "path" technique from Itzak Ben-Gan; he has lots of MS SQL Server-related stuff on his site at www.sql.co.il and also has an article "Maintaining Hierarchies" on www.sqlmag.com , with downloadable code . HTH.
