Best way to approach sensor fusion

I'm fusing acceleration data from an accelerometer and the derived acceleration from a distance sensor to learn about sensor fusion. The derived acceleration (2nd derivative) from the distance sensor was fairly noisy. I used a moving average filter to clean up the data and it seems to match the accelerometer data fairly well. I was going to use a weighted average of the two measurements to combine the sensor data to provide a more accurate (hopefully) acceleration as described by this link . I've got a few basic questions: Is sensor fusion even worth it in this case? It looks like the accelerometer is generally more accurate - so would I just be decreasing the accuracy by adding the measurements from the distance sensor? Is a weighted average the right algorithm to be using in the first place? Thanks!
