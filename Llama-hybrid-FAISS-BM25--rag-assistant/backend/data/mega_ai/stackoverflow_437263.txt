I prefer Microsoft Unity for IoC, for NHibernate make sure you look into Fluent NHibernate and say good bye to the xml garbage! I wrote my own version of the Web Client Software Factory that leverages Unity instead of ObjectBuilder(1) that's included as I ran into numerous issues with it, at some point it will be blogged about in a series of posts but the source code is already on my site which you can view in my profile. If your project is for an enterprise in all honesty I would recommend against using the MVC Framework. It's such a large derivation from web forms that you will find many developers that don't live and breathe coding will not be able to use it correctly and you will constantly be fighting to keep the MVC usage correct as most developers will treat it the same way as web forms.
