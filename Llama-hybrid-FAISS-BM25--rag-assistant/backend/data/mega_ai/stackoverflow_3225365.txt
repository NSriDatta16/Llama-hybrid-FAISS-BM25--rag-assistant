"Standard" math has no notion of algorithmic complexity. That's reserved for computer algorithms. There are ways to analyze the dynamic behavior of solutions of equations. Things like convergence matter a great deal to mathematicians. You can ask what the algorithmic complexity of euler integration versus fifth-order Runge-Kutta for integration. They would compare based on number of function evaluations required and time step stability. But what's the "running time" of the solution to Fermat's Last Theorem? What about the last of David Hilbert's challenge problems? Is the "running time" for those a century and counting? What's your running time for solving a partial differential equation using separation of variables? When you think about it that way, do you have a better understanding of why people would be put off by your question?
