I don't know Clojure, so I can't tell if you have some detail wrong in your code, but using StringBuffer and appending the input line by line is the correct way to do it (well, using a StringBuilder initialized to the expected final size if known would bring significant but not dramatic improvements). If you run out of memory, then maybe the content of your BufferedReader is simply too large to fit into your memory and there is no way to have it as a single string - in that case, you'll either have to increase your heap size or find a way to process the data one small chunk at a time. BTW, if you know the size of your input, a more efficient method would be to use a CharBuffer and fill it by using Reader.read() (you'll have to pay attention to the return method and use it in a loop).
