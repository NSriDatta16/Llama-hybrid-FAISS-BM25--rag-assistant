Combining additive and multiplicative effects in logistic regression

I want to figure out how to do a logistic regression (alternatively GLM w/ logit link) where some featured affect the output linearly (additively) while others affect it multiplicatively. That is, in standard logistic regression, you have: $$ P(y)=\sigma(ax_1+bx_2+cx_3+dx_4) $$ Where P(y) is the probability that $y=1$, and $\sigma(*)$ is the sigmoid/logit link function. What I want to do is: $$ P(y)=\sigma(ax_1x_2^b+cx_3+dx_4) $$ Note that here essentially $x_2$ scales $x_1$. Also, note that while the regressors, $\{x_i\}$ are continuous, the output variable $y$ is binary, so log transforms wont work. Also, to give more info on the specific problem, I am trying to predict a rats behavior. My regressors are position, speed, and 3 others. I believe that speed does not independently/additively contribute to the output, but modulates/scales the effects of position. I do not know the strength of this scaling, although I believe it should range from either nonexistant (i.e. the $b=0$ in above equation) to linear (i.e. $b=1$ in above equation). Please let me know ways to approach this.
