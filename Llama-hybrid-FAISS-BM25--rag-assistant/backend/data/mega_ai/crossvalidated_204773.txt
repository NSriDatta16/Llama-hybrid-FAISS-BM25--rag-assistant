Oh man... The problem was within the loop in the holdout method. for(i in 1:nrow(testing.set)){ prediction = predict(model, testing.set[i,]) if(prediction != training.set[i,length(training.set)]) { wrong = wrong + 1 } } The prediction was being tested against the TRAINING set's ith value, not the testing set. So, the correct loop is: for(i in 1:nrow(testing.set)){ prediction = predict(model, testing.set[i,]) if(prediction != testing.set[i,length(testing.set)]) { wrong = wrong + 1 } } Seems my proof reading accuracy is much worse than my linear svm's.
