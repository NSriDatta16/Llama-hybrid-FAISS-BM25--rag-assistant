how do I select AVG of multiple columns on a single row

How can I select average of multiple columns? Suppose I have some data like: X Y Z ------------- 6 3 3 5 5 NULL 4 5 6 11 7 8 I want to get something like AVG ------------- 4 5 5 8.66666667 I tried select avg(x, y, z) from table But it doesn't work. Any ideas on a query to do that?
