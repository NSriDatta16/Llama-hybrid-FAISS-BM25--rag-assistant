How to code an artificial neural network (Tic-tac-toe)?

I want to play Tic-tac-toe using an artificial neural network. My configuration for the network is as follows: For each of the 9 fields, I use 2 input neuron. So I have 18 input neurons, of course. For every field, I have 1 input neuron for a piece of Player 1 and 1 neuron for a piece of Player 2. In addition to that, I have 1 output neuron which gives an evaluation of the current board position. The higher the output value is, the better is the position for Player 1. The lower it is, the better is it for Player 2. But my problem is: How could I code that neural network? My idea was to use an Array[1-18] for the input neurons. The values of this array are the input weights. The I would walk through the array using a loop. Whenever there is a neuron to be activated, I add the weight to the output value. So the output value is the sum of the weights of the activated input neurons: Output = SUM(ActivatedInputNeurons) Do you think this is a good way of programming the network? Do you have better ideas? I hope you can help me. Thanks in advance!
