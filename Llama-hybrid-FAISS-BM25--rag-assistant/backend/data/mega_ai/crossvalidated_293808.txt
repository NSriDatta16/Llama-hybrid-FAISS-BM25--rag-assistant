Trying to get the relative difference between two groups with negative values

I have two groups A and B which have few duplicating values. So the overall data point is less than the summation data points from group A and B It's because group A and B data are simply taken out from the overall data. The group A values are: 0.008385618 0.003966736 -0.000549212 -0.0161096 -0.008572115 0.008385618 0.003966736 -0.000549212 -0.0161096 -0.008572115 -0.013914553 Then group B values are: -0.008572115 -0.013914553 -0.017750119 -0.021683121 -0.022425818 -0.022540774 -0.022554941 -0.022357409 -0.017750119 -0.021683121 -0.022425818 -0.022540774 -0.022554941 -0.022357409 The overall data which does not have duplicating values from group A and B is as follows: 0.008385618 0.003966736 -0.000549212 -0.0161096 -0.008572115 -0.013914553 -0.017750119 -0.021683121 -0.022425818 -0.022540774 -0.022554941 -0.022357409 I am trying to get the relative difference of group A from group B. Currently I used the following formula. |(group A average - group B average)/(overall data average)| - 1 and I get the result of 0.266286801 May I know whether this is correct? If not, may I know what formula should give me the correct answer?
