I just answered this question about scrolling a div horizontally, I also included some code to use the mousewheel or just grab and drag with the mouse... maybe some of that code will give you an idea? To elaborate a bit, the mousewheel function gives you the event object and the delta. $('#container').bind('mousewheel', function(event,delta){ if (delta > 0) { // mousewheel is going up; } else { // mousewheel is going down } }); The value of delta depends on how fast you scroll the wheel. I've seen a range from +50 to -50 if you try really hard :P
