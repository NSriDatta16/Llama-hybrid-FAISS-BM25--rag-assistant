Automating an ASP.NET Web Form

I have an ASP.NET web form that reads a file and writes some data to a database. I need to run this process on a scheduled basis. Currently, I have a scheduled task that calls a batch file. The batch file then opens Internet Explorer and navigates to the URL and the process is fired. There is another scheduled batch file that closes Internet Explorer. Surely, there is a more elegant way to do this.
