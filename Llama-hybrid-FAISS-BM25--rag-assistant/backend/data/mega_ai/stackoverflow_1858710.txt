A brute force algo. might give you the best results. Firstly, locate a rectangle/any quadrilateral bounding the input points. Finally, for each point inside the rectangle, calculate distance from other points. Sum the distances of the point from the input set. Say this is the 'cost' of the point. Repeat for each point and select point with min. cost. Intelligence can also be added to the algo. it can eliminate areas based on average cost, etc... Thats how I would approach the problem at least... hope it helps.
