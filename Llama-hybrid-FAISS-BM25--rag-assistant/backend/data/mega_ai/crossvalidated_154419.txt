Time series Analysis using LS

I know this is a bit of a broad question but generally if I have a time series and I want to measure whether it has trend according to time I do the following: I regress the series against time, time^2 and time^3 and get that only time^2 and time^3 are statistically significant whereas time is not (has a p-value of over 0.9) but then I do the regression with only time and I find that it IS significant (p-value 0.000). So should I say that the series does have a trend based on the 2'nd result of statistical significance or say no not really based on the 1st regression. Thanks
