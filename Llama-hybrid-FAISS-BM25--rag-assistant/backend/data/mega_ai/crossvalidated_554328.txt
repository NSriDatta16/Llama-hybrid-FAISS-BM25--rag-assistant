Can I Use the loo function to help me choose between a Poisson and Bernouilli distribution in bayesian

I have two models exactly similar, but Iâ€™m using a Poisson distribution for one and a Bernoulli distribution for the other. Can I trust the information coming out of loo to help me choose? The Bernoulli model comes on top. rbpa
