Occurrence certainty

I think the best way to ask this question is with a hypothetical situation. Let's say I have a sensor that measures on average one occurrence every 3 days with a standard deviation of about 4. I want to move that sensor to a new unknown location. How many days can I leave the sensor in this new location until I'm confident that this location will not produce an occurrence? Like 6,7,8 days...? In this plot I have included, the data is 93 days where integer occurrences are recorded. The average occurrence per day is 2.95. The std is 4.03. 0 is by far the most common value. In the data (which you cant see in the histogram) the longest stretch of 0 entries was 6 days. So if I move the sensor to some unknown location, how many days can it sit there reporting 0's until I'm confident that this unknown location doesn't experience occurrences
