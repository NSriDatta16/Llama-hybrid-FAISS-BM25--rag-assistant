If I understand you correctly, you have a data set of around 1000 individuals, each with a measurement of a variable of interest, followed for different lengths of time. About 150 individuals have an event, and the rest are thus censored. A possible scenario is that individuals with a low value on the variable of interest are censored earlier for some reason. If they are censored before they get a chance to have the event, it might look like a low value on the variable of interest is associated with a lower risk of having the event in the logistic regression, but in the cox regression, there will be no such association. I'll give a fabricated example: Consider we have a study of cohort of 60-year-olds. We measure their body mass index (BMI) at the start of the study (our variable of interest). We then follow the cohort and note a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia as the event (outcome). In the logistic regression we see that lower BMI is associated with dementia, but in the cox regression this association is not significant. The reason for this is that those in the cohort with high BMI (particularly those who are obese) have a much higher mortality between 60-70 due to cardiovascular disease associated with obesity, so many will die (which in this study equals being censored) before developing dementia which makes the dementia diagnoses more common in individuals with lower BMI even though there is no causal link. Here is a quick simulation done in R. I simulate a cohort of 10000 individuals of the same age (say, 60), followed for 20 years. The outcome measure is Alzheimer disease, and the true hazard ratio of BMI is 1 (no effect). The competing risk event is death, and the hazard ratio of BMI is 1.2: library(survival) set.seed(1) h1 Now we'll run a logistic regression: summary(glm(alzheimer ~ BMI, data=df, family=binomial)) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.641915 0.173920 -3.691 0.000223 *** BMI -0.032803 0.006457 -5.080 3.77e-07 *** exp(-0.032803) [1] 0.9677292 We can see that the odds ratio of having Alzheimer dementia is 0.97 (per 1 point of BMI) with a p-value of far below 0.001. Now in the Cox regression model: summary(coxph(Surv(time,alzheimer) ~ BMI, data=df)) coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(>|z|) BMI -0.007752 0.992278 0.005999 -1.292 0.196 exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 BMI 0.9923 1.008 0.9807 1.004 The HR is 0.99 but with confidence intervals overlapping 1 (no effect), and a corresponding p-value of 0.196. So in this case, the competing risks scenario will make it look like there is a highly significant effect in the logistic regression model, but the Cox regression model will reveal that this is not the case. There may of course be other reasons for an association between the variable of interest and observation time in the study, but I think it's likely that there is some sort of association between your variable of interest and the observation time in the study. If you could provide a bit more information about your study, we might better help you to understand what's going on.
