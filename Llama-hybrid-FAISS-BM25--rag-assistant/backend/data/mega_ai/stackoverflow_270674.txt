Print PDF from ASP.NET without preview

I've generated a pdf using iTextSharp and I can preview it very well in ASP.NET but I need to send it directly to printer without a preview. I want the user to click the print button and automatically the document prints. I know that a page can be sent directly to printer using the javascript window.print() but I don't know how to make it for a PDF. Edit: it is not embedded, I generate it like this; ... FileStream stream = new FileStream(Request.PhysicalApplicationPath + "~1.pdf", FileMode.Create); Document pdf = new Document(PageSize.LETTER); PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.GetInstance(pdf, stream); pdf.Open(); pdf.Add(new Paragraph(member.ToString())); pdf.Close(); Response.Redirect("~1.pdf"); ... And here I am.
