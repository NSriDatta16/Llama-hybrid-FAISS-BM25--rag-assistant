In your ARIMA specification, the middle number in both the first and the second bracket is zero. That means, there is no [simple] differencing and no seasonal differencing. Thus your series appears to be mean-stationary (rather than integrated or seasonally integrated). (As far as I know, the AR and MA parameters yielded by the auto.arima function are restricted to be in the region of stationarity; meanwhile, nonstationarity can be introduced by [simple] or seasonal differencing.) Given a mean-stationary process, you should actually expect the point forecasts to converge to the mean of the process. That is one of the intrinsic features of a mean-stationary time series. And that is also why these kind of processes are called "mean-reverting". Regarding weekends, you have only supplied the frequency as frequency=24 , and auto.arima will not guess whether there is weekly, monthly or other kind of seasonality besides what you have specified. You could indeed create some dummies and supply them using xreg to account for the day-of-the-week pattern.
