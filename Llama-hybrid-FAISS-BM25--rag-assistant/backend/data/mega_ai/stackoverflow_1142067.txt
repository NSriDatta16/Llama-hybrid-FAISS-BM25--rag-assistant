Change browser levels in Sharepoint

I have a very peculiar problem. I had written some custom columns for SharePoint. Recently, I found these custom columns break when I group the list items in SharePoint. Now the problem is peculiar because, these custom columns work perfectly in FireFox browsers, they break only in IE! After googling around for browser compatiblity issues in SharePoint, I found that SharePoint classifies the supported browsers into browser levels. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc263526.aspx According to that article, IE is a Level 1 browser, while Firefox is a level 2 browser. How does SharePoint detect the browser levels? Using the user agent headers? Is there any way I can change this browser level only for a that particular page? I need to demote this particular page request to Level 2, so that IE is served up pages which are meant for FireFox. Can this problem be solved using javascript? If so, I can write a content editor webpart which will load that script at page load... If this problem can be solved using a SharePoint object model, I can write a hidden webpart which will force the page to be served up in firefox compatiblity mode.
