http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_reduction maybe you have heard of PCA (principle component analysis), which is a Dimension reduction algorithm. Others include LDA, matrix factorization based methods, etc. Here's a simple example. You have a lot of text files and each file consists some words. There files can be classified into two categories. You want to visualize a file as a point in a 2D/3D space so that you can see the distribution clearly. So you need to do dimension reduction to transfer a file containing a lot of words into only 2 or 3 dimensions.
