My answer is no. The goal of OO design is to optimize for the ease of specifying program behavior. The goal of database design is to optimise for ease of data storage/retrieval. These goals are very different and can and will lead to very different decompositions of the problem domain. It's possible to map one to the other, but then you will encounter the impedence mismatch, as others have mentioned, which is basically the technical consequence of the different goals of the two models. Jorg mentioned the " Vietnam of computer science " article in the comments, which is worth a read. You can skip the historical stuff on Vietnam, if you're short on time.
