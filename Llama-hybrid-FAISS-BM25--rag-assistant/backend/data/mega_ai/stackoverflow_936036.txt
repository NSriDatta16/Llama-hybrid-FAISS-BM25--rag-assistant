There is indeed a slightly more elegant way (at least in the functional sense) to calculate the Cartesian products, which uses the functions that exist within the List class. (There's no need to involve sequences or loops here, at least not directly.) Try this: let xs = [1..99] let ys = [1..99] xs |> List.map(fun x -> ys |> List.map(fun y -> x * y)) |> List.concat Slightly longer admittedly, though more functional in style, it would seem.
