Polls are not historical trends. A Bayesian would inquire as to the historical trends. Since Abraham Lincoln, there has been a Republican party and a Democratic party holding the presidential office. The trend for party change 16 times since then from Wikipedia has the following cumulative mass function where time in years to a change of presidential party is on the $x$ -axis. After 8-years of a party in power, the odds are 68.75% that the voters vote for a change, just over 2 to 1. Moreover, since the 1860 election, Republicans have held the presidency 59% of the time versus 41% for Democrats. What made journalists, the Democratic party, and the pollsters think that the odds were in favor of liberals winning was perhaps wishful thinking. Behavior may be predictable, within limits, but in this case the Democrats were wishing that people would not vote for a change, and from a historical perspective, it seems more likely there would be one than not.
