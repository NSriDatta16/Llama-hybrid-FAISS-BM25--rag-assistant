Transitioning between the two during a single usage seems unlikely to be worth the effort, to me. If you want to do this via roll your own, you could define a second template parameter that allows the container type to be specified at compile-time. Then you would not need both vector and deque as members and the type switching code goes away. template class VectorDeque { // snip private: CONTAINER _storage; };
