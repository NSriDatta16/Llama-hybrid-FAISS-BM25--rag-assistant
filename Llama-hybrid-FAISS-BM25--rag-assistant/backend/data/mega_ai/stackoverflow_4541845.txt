How can I use EF in windows forms to insert new data?

Hi Maybe it's simple question, but it's my first time with EF + win app so ... I'm building win app with EF by adding edmx as data source then drag and drop the tables to get navigator and binding source .. when I press the add button in the navigator it allows me to enter new data but when I save the context I get NULL data for all fields except the auto increment field ( the ID field ).... What should I do to save many entries ...? DO I have to loop over all the entities in the binding source and add them to the context ?? Thanx in advance Update: I forgot to say that when i use data grid view it adds the items correctly but with "Details" it didn't ..
