JQuery Slide Panel with more than one panel

I have this jquery code which slidetoggles the content on click. This code works, I just want to know if there is a simpler way to do it. I have tried slice() with no luck. I'm trying to figure out a way to do this without having to write code for each item I want to toggle. Thanks, Kevin $("div.accord_panel").hide(); $(document).ready(function () { $("p.accord_header:eq(0)").click(function () { $("div.accord_panel:eq(0)").slideToggle("slow"); $("div.accord_panel:eq(1)").hide(); $("p.accord_header:eq(1)").show(); }); $("p.accord_header:eq(1)").click(function () { $("div.accord_panel:eq(1)").slideToggle("slow"); $("p.accord_header:eq(0)").show(); $("div.accord_panel:eq(0)").hide(); }); }); And the CSS: p.accord_header { margin: 0; padding: 0; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue' , Helvetica, Arial, Sans-Serif; color: #615E5A; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: bold; background-color: #f3f0ed } div.accord_panel { margin: 0; padding: 0; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue' , Helvetica, Arial, Sans-Serif; color: #615E5A; font-size: 9pt; display: none; background-color: #f3f0ed } and HTML: + El Salvador/San Diego de Tenango Task Force In partnership with Agros, Int'l since 2001, UPC has come alongside this rural village to encourage them as they move toward economic self-sufficiency. &nbsp;Most importantly we send service teams in January and July to renew friendships, share the love and gospel of Jesus Christ and participate in village activities.
