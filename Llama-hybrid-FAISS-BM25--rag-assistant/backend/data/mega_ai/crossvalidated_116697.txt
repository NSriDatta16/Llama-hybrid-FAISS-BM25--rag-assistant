(What a fun question! My answer is a reflection, and others might have interesting opposing viewpoints.) No. The pairs of ordinal numbers 1 & 4 and 2 & 3 both sum to 5. But suppose such variables were coding, for example, functional mobility in an individual, where 1 indicated no impairment, 2 impairment not requiring assistance, 3 impairment requiring assistance, and 4 immobility. The codes meaningfully represent a progression along a continuum of impairment. But problems obtain: The idea of summing 'no impairment' and 'immobility' does not necessarily have conceptual validity (beyond two individuals with different experiences). The substantive meaning of a sum=5 is unclear. The meaning of an average of these numbers (i.e. a normalized sum), for example 2.5 (the average of 1 and 4, or 2 and 3) means what? Requiring or not requiring assistance in this example? One of the individuals measured by the 1 and 4 pair will ever complete any kind of race, but both of the 2 and 3 pair will eventually traverse a distance. Recall also that the many different quantities in ordinal codes will be ordinally identical (i.e. preserve rank), but will be radically different in quantity. For example the same four values above might be coded 0, 1.5, 7 and 92, both the sums and the averages change then, and ordering is not preserved in the resulting sums compared to the 1, 2, 3, 4 codes.
