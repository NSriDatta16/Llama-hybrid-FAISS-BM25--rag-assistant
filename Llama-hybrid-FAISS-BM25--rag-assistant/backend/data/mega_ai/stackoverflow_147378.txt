Options for refactoring bits of code away from native C++?

So, one commonly heard comment when talking about performance is that you write your code with whatever language gets the job done fastest. If performance in specific areas is a problem, then rewrite those bits in C/C++. But, what if you're starting with a native C++ app? What options do you have if you want to write the easy bits, or refactor the old bits, in a language like Python, Ruby, C#, or whatever? Keep in mind that transferring data between the native and other sides is a must. Being able to simply call a function written in an "easier" language, while passing C++ classes as data, would be beautiful. We've got a crusty Win32 app that would benefit greatly if we could crank out new code, or refactor old code, in C# or something. Very little of it requires the complexity of C++, and dealing with the little fiddly bits is dragging down the programming process.
