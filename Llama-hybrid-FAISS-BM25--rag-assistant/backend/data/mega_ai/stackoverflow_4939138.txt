What is the goal of the re-authentication, i.e., what does the user need to prove? I'm presuming the application wants a sign-in token with a recent authentication timestamp (within, say, the last 10 seconds), so that the application is reasonably sure that the client system is really still under that same user's control. (Watch out for clock differences between your web server and your AD FS server, by the way.) In the coming months I will be investigating a similar scenario, and my current idea is to use the SessionAuthenticationModule.SessionSecurityTokenReceived Event , as described in this blog post by Vittorio Bertocci . However, that cannot be the entire solution, since this only forces AD FS to give out a token, but it does not force AD FS to give out a token with a recent authentication timestamp. So no answer yet, but perhaps these hints help.
