error in C++, what to do ?: could not find an match for ostream::write(long *, unsigned int)

I am trying to write data stored in a binary file using turbo C++. But it shows me an error could not find an match for ostream::write(long *, unsigned int) I want to write a 4 byte long data into that file. When i tries to write data using char pointer. It runs successfully. But i want to store large value i.e. eg. 2454545454 Which can be stored in long only. I dont know how to convert 1 byte into bit. I have 1 byte of data as a character. Moreover what i m trying to do is to convert 4 chars into long and store data into it. And at the other side i want to reverse this so as to retrieve how many bytes of data i have written. long *lmem; lmem=new long; *lmem=Tsize; fo.write(lmem,sizeof(long));// error occurs here delete lmem; I am implementing steganography and i have successfully stored txt file into image but trying to retrieve that file data now. EDIT: I am using Turbo Complier.
