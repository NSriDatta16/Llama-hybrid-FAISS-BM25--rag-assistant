Getting Google results in Java? Need help!

Right now, I'm trying to get the results from Google in Java, by searching for a term. I'm using a desktop program, not an applet. That in itself isn't complicated. but then Google gave me a 403 error. Anyways, I added referrer and User Agent and then it worked. Now, my problem is that I don't get the results page from Google. Instead, I get their script which gets the results page. My code right now simply uses a GET request on " http://www.google.com/search?q= " + Dork; Then it outputs each line. Here is what I get when I run my program: dork - Google Search window.google={kEI:"9myaS-Date).getTime()}}};try{}catch(u){}window.google.jsrt_kill=1; align:center}#logo{display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:103px;height:37px; Lots of stuff like that. I shortened it (A LOT) and put in dots to fit it here. So my big question is: How do I turn this whole mess into the nice results page I get when searching Google with a browser? Any help would be seriously appreciated, and I really need the answer fast. Also, please keep in mind that I do NOT want to use Google's API for this. Thanks in advance!
