In a frequentist generalized linear model like logistic regression the Bernoulli likelihood function and logit link function leads to the maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters. When it comes time to perform inference we could derive the sampling distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator and use its CDF to construct p-values and confidence intervals. A convenient way to approximate this sampling distribution is with a normal approximation, i.e. a Wald test on the log odds scale. This is not an assumption about the data generative process, it is a convenient approximation to the sampling distribution of our estimator (a function of the complete sufficient statistic). Because the logit function is a monotonic transformation we can back transform inference on the log odds to the odds scale or the Bernoulli proportion scale. This is analogous to using a logit link function in a Bayesian model with a normal prior distribution on the parameters so that the posterior is also a normal distribution. This posterior can be back transformed using the inverse link function to produce a posterior in the odds scale or the Bernoulli proportion scale.
