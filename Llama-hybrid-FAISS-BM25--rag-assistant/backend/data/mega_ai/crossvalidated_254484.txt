What does (ttest\$conf.int[2] - ttest\$conf.int[1])/2 mean?

I am trying to understand a code provided by my teacher. He has done t-test and then has stored (ttest$conf.int[2] - ttest$conf.int[1])/2 as a variable called "Confidence Interval Radius". What can this possibly mean? Observations for ttest are all accuracies from a predictor model (therefore all are in percentage) Results are as follows: Average accuracy = 41.23% Conf level=99% > CI Radius=5.87 Conf level=95% > CI Radius=3.97 Conf level=90% > CI Radius=3.18 What can I conclude from such results?
