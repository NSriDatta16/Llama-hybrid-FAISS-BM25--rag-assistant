I don't think there is a formal name for that kind of team - other than sensible ! :) To this end I certainly agree with Robert Harvey. Every solution will (usually) cover general areas such as UI, BL, Data; you'll also usually cover cross-cutting concerns like logging, deployment packaging, etc; and all of this will be using certain technologies. So, for a team to be appropriate for the project it will need to cover all of those things well - as a start. That's the "horizontal"view taken care of, the vertical view (implementing slices of functionality) is where those people need to interact - and that's where XP practices like peer-programming come in, and where cross-training can really start to happen. As a contrast to this, you might be interested by the "Surgical Team" approach, as outlined by Frederick Brooks in his famous book " The Mythical Man-Month ". There's also a link on that page to " Organization and Team Patterns ", which might be of interest.
