Since the two(the console application, and integration test app that makes client calls - as I understand) are separate application, so there should be a mechanism - a bridge - that would tell play as a mediator(socket, external file, registry, etc). Another possibility could be that you come up with an average time the console takes to load the services and use that time in your test app; well, just thinking out loud!
