Organizing hundreds of personal and example projects?

How do you organize projects when you have hundreds of them? Not layout within a project, but layout of the project root directories. I'm consolidating a decade+ of personal and example projects that are scattered all over the disks on several systems, and am looking for some organizational method that will let me keep the dozen or so active projects visible, and the archived projects findable. Most of the projects are learning experiments, cutting across bunch of different language and frameworks. Some of the projects are full-fledged, working applications that I reach into to reuse ideas and code. I'm using a flat namespace in a remote git repository for my personal stuff, but that seems like a less than ideal way of organizing things on my development systems. There must be something better than ~/active/ and ~/archive/. What works for you in this situation?
