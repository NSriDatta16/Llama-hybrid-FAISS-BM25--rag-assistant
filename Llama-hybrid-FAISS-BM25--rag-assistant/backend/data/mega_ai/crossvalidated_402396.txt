Logistic Regression with categorical predictors - how to report?

Hello Stack Exchange. I need to run a logistic regression to determine the significance of the effect of 5 categories of one variable on my dependent variable. I just can't find online anywhere how I report these findings? In papers I have read online I find people quoting "binomial logistic regression, regression coefficient: __, p I found a really good previous blog post on here that recommended using the likelihood ratio test to compare my model and its effects to a model that doesn't include my predictor variable... top reply on this post: Significance of categorical predictor in logistic regression However still here I don't see what I would quote in a written report of findings? The output of my logistic regression model : Call: glm(formula = `survival` ~ `cover` - 1, family = "binomial") Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.0051 -0.7259 -0.6159 -0.4279 2.2073 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) `cover`0 -2.34455 0.16149 -14.519 then I ran a likelihood ratio test to compare this to a model where cover did not predict survival outcome : my.mod1 The output of the likelihood ratio test: anova(my.mod1, my.mod2, test="LRT") Analysis of Deviance Table Model 1: `survival` ~ `cover` Model 2: `survival` ~ 1 Resid. Df Resid. Dev Df Deviance Pr(>Chi) 1 3500 3424.3 2 3501 3517.5 -1 -93.262 I still can't see here how I can quote an overall coefficient for my model. I need to be able to say % cover (categorical) had an effect on survival (but then don't know how to report this from my above outputs) Thank you so much
