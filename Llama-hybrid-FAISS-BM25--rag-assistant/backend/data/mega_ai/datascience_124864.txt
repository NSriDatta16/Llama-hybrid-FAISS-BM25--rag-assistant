How to deal with categorical disalignment in test and train in binary classification problems

I have a train and test datasets (600k observations) that have different categories for the same categorical variable. For example train has the categorical variable Letters having unique categories being {a,b,c,d,e,f,g}, while the test dataset has unique categories {a,b,c,d,e,f,h,l,m,n} for the column Letters. I am dealing with a binary classification problem and I am mainly working with Random Forest. Clearly, {h,l,m,n} are unseen in the train dataset, so I am not sure how random forest can make accurate predictions for these data. Which turnarounds are effective in these type of problems? I thought about clustering the data based on the correlation of other features using KMeans on the concatenated train and test and then include the Cluster category as a feature instead of Letters, however it is difficult to specify the correct number of clusters. I am new to data science so probably there are better ways to deal with this problem.
