Okay, the nice part about using Python is that it's almost pseudocode anyway. Now, let's think about the individual steps: How do you get the average between high and low?

Here's another hint -- you can run python as an interpreter and try individual statements along, so, for example, you could do high=23 low=7 then compute what you think should be the average or midpoint between them (hint: 15)
