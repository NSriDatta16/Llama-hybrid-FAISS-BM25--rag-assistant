The need of at least one state of the art project

I want to talk to one of my current employers about the need of having, at least one state of the art project, keeping in mind that this company have some very bad projects, bad when you think about the archtecture, bad in usability, bad when you think about code's elegance. I would love some opinions, as although he's a great guy and open to ideas, he have been bombed several times with ridiculous requests, or false promises of efficency or quality. I will have one shot for that, i guess, and I want a headshot . Anything that would support me in a discussion. As I am finding more evidences, i will post here. Please if you do have an opinion, or an experience, I would be more than glad to use it, when i'm facing the guy, trying to help this company out. Thanks.
