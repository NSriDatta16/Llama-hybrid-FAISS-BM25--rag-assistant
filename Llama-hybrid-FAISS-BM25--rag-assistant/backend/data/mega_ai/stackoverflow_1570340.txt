MS Access Rounding Precision With Group By

Why doesn't the average of the score of an employee of each month, when summed, equal the average of the employees score (ever)? Average SELECT Avg(r.score) AS rawScore FROM (ET INNER JOIN Employee AS e ON ET.employeeId = e.id) INNER JOIN (Employee AS a INNER JOIN Review AS r ON a.id = r.employeeId) ON ET.id = r.ETId WHERE (((e.id)=@employeeId)) Returns 80.737 Average By Month SELECT Avg(r.score) AS rawScore, Format(submitDate, 'mmm yy') AS MonthText, month(r.submitDate) as mm, year(submitDate) as yy FROM (ET INNER JOIN Employee AS e ON ET.employeeId = e.id) INNER JOIN (Employee AS a INNER JOIN Review AS r ON a.id = r.employeeId) ON ET.id = r.ETId WHERE (((e.id)=@employeeId)) GROUP BY month(r.submitDate), year(submitDate), Format(submitDate, 'mmm yy') ORDER BY year(submitDate) DESC, month(r.submitDate) DESC Returns Average Score : Month 81.000 : Oct 09 80.375 : Sep 09 82.700 : Aug 09 83.100 : Jul 09 75.625 : Jun 09 I know 80.737 is correct because I have tallied up the records by hand and done the average. But the average of this table (at 3 decimal places), is 80.56 which is too far off. Does group by mess with the rounding at each step?
