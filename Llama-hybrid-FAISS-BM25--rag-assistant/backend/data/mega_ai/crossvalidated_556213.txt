What are tests to determine the number of technical replicates neccessary to reach the true mean?

I have the following scenario: I am working with a quite variable material, so I am using technical replicates to estimate the mean sample properties. To test how many replicas I need to converge to the true mean value, I tested a lot of replicas (~30) for one of my sample (I can´t do the same for all of them because of time constraints). Assuming the true mean is given by the maximum number of replicas, I now want to test what amount of replicas are needed to already get close to it. I know there must be a test, where one takes the average of first 2, then 3, then 4, and so on, replicas, and plots them; afterwards randomly re-orders the data and does the same thing several times again. This way one ends up with an interval that finaly converges on the mean. However I just can´t remember the name of the method! Can anyone help me with that? Or does anyone have other methods they would recomend me for this problem? Thanks a lot!
