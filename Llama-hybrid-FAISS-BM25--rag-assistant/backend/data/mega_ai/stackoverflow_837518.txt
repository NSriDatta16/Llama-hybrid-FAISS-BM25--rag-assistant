Performance overhead of perform: in Smalltalk (specifically Squeak)

How much slower can I reasonably expect perform: to be than a literal message send, on average? Should I avoid sending perform: in a loop, similar to the admonishment given to Perl/Python programmers to avoid calling eval("...") ( Compiler evaluate: in Smalltalk) in a loop? I'm concerned mainly with Squeak, but interested in other Smalltalks as well. Also, is the overhead greater with the perform:with: variants? Thank you
