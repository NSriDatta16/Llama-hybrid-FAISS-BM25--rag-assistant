Does a lot of classes returns a better accuracy?

I have a supervised images classification problem, I am using Convolutional neural network model to solve it. there is 8 classes: what can be result in good accuracy to train the model on all the 8 classes, or to divide them into 2 models with 4 classes each; 8 classes Vs 4 classes in supervised classification to summarise: which is better to train a model on lot of classes or few classes ? Does a lot of classes returns a better accuracy ?
