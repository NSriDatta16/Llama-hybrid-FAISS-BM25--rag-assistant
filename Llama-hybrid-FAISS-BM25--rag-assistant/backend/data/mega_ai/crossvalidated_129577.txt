First, function princomp is deprecated, you should use pca instead. Second, as @ttnphns said, if you only have $200$ subjects, then there is no way you can get $1000$ principal components; maximum number is $199$. See here for an explanation: Why are there only $n-1$ principal components for $n$ data points if the number of dimensions is larger or equal than $n$? Third, as @Aksakal wrote, Matlab's pca assumes that rows in the data matrix correspond to samples, not variables. So you need to transpose your matrix. Having all of that in mind, here is the code: X = randn(3000,200); [eigenvectors, PCs, eigenvalues] = pca(X'); %// eigenvalues is an array of length 199
