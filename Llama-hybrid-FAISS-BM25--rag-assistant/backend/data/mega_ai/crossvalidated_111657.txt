How to get the baseline measurement in time series data?

I have a time series data of bike's rentals in which each row represents a specific hour and a number of bikes rented in that specific hour. The task is to predict the rentals for the last 10 days (of each hour) based on the historical data of the first 20 days of that month. Sample of the data: # datetime season holiday workingday temp humidity windspeed count 1 2011-01-01 00:00:00 1 0 0 9.84 81 0.0000 3 2 2011-01-01 01:00:00 1 0 0 9.02 80 0.0000 8 3 2011-01-01 02:00:00 1 0 0 9.02 80 0.0000 5 I have already built the model and now I wonder how do I know the baseline measurement so that I can say my model is X% better than the baseline measurements ? In general, how could I measure the quality of my model based on the training set I have ?
