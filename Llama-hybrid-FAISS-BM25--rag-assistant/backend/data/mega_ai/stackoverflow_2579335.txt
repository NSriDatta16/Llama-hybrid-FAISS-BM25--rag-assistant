One of my previous employers had this idea for splitting up development work: Project teams that would work on long-term projects, usually 3-6 months long on average, so that it was a given that these would be the big projects that wouldn't be done lightly. Continuing engineering team that would work on short-term features that could take up to a couple of weeks, along with bug fixes, and other maintenance work items. The key here is that this group has to be prepared to work in short quick cycles as their turnaround is supposed to be greatly different than the project team. I wasn't there long enough to see how well this turned out but it is a good idea to my mind. The main point is that there are lots of little bits of work that wouldn't get done otherwise but may be very useful for the overall company so this is a way to get those little bits done in addition to the bigger work items. Anything inbetween the two could be reviewed and either split into little bits for the CE team or wrapped into a project if there are enough similar bits in a common area,e.g. a service pack for a big group of applications would be how to take a few bug fixes and wrap them up for the Project team to do.
