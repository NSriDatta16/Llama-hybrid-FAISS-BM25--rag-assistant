getElementsByClassName IE resolution issue

I am having issues figuring out how to resolve the getElementsByClassName issue in IE. How would I best implement the robert nyman (can't post the link to it since my rep is only 1) resolution into my code? Or would a jquery resolution be better? my code is function showDesc(name) { var e = document.getElementById(name); //Get a list of elements that have a class name of service selected var list = document.getElementsByClassName("description show"); //Loop through those items for (var i = 0; i and I am using it on this page dev.msmnet.com/services/practice-management to show/hide the description for each service (works in Chrome and FF). Any tips would be greatly appreciated.
