Decoupling classes C#

This might be a bit vague, but I am working on a program where several classes that update the UI. I have made a "middle-man" class that basically takes all the UI requests (among other things) and routes them to the UI itself, that way the UI class only interacts with the middle-man. The problem is that the UI class has ~20 different functions in its interface, and all my middle-man class does is basically take calls from the lower-level classes and then call an essentially identical function in the UI, which makes me wonder if this is somehow defeating the whole purpose. I'm sure this is a problem that comes up a lot. Is there any more elegant way to do this? Thanks, PM
