Transformers can be used for classification tasks. I found a good tutorial where they used a BERT Transformer for the encoding and a Convolutional Neural Network for a sentiment analysis . You can also fine-tune a whole Transformer for the classification but this is usually pretty intense when it comes to the training and you definitely need a GPU.
