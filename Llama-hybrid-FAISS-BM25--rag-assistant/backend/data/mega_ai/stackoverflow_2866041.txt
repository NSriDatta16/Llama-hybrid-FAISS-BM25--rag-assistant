You were on the right track, in management studio: (1) Find SQL Agent and right click and select Job. (2) Give you job a name and description and then choose the Steps option on the left (3) In the Step options you can name your step, insert your script code, AND select which database you want the job to be performed on. (4) Next go to the Schedules option on the left and designate how often you want the job to run (pretty self-explanatory) (5) The Alerts, Notifications, etc options should also be utilized if you want to be informed on failure/success/etc. That's it pretty much.
