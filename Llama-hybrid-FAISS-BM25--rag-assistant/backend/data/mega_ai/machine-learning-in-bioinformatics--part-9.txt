ce has 1,253 nucleotides, the longest 2,368. The average length is 1,402 nucleotides. Database version: 13.5. Open Tree of Life Taxonomy Open Tree of Life Taxonomy (OTT) aims to build a complete, dynamic, and digitally available Tree of Life by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees along with taxonomic data. Phylogenetic trees have been classified, aligned, and merged. Taxonomies have been used to fill in sparse regions and gaps left by phylogenies. OTT is a base that has been little used for sequencing analyzes of the 16S region, however, it has a greater number of sequences classified taxonomically down to the genus level compared to SILVA and Greengenes. However, in terms of classification at the edge level, it contains a lesser amount of information Ribosomal Database Project Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) is a database that provides RNA ribosomal (rRNA) sequences of small subunits of domain bacterial and archaeal (16S); and fungal rRNA sequences of large subunits (28S). == References ==
