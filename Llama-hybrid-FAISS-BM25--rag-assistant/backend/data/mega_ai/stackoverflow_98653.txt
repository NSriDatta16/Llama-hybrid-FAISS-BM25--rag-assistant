From small to large projects

I've been quite used to working on small projects which I coded with 1,000 lines or less (pong, tetris, simple 3d games, etc). However as my abilities in programming are increasing, my organization isn't. I seem to be making everything dependent on one one another, so it's very hard for me to change the implementation of something. Any ideas for keeping my code organized and being able to tackle large projects?
