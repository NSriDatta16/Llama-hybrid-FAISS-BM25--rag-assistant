Keras itself provides some of the successful image processing neural networks pretrained on the ImageNet: https://keras.io/applications/ Other deep learning libraries also offer some pretrained models, notably: TensorFlow: https://github.com/tensorflow/models caffe: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo caffe2: https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/wiki/Model-Zoo pytorch: https://github.com/Cadene/pretrained-models.pytorch Lasagne: https://github.com/Lasagne/Recipes Many pretrained models for various platforms can also be found at https://www.gradientzoo.com . Moreover, if you are interested in some particular network architecture, authors sometimes provide pretrained models themselves, e.g. ResNeXt .
