You change your page number every time user drags the scrollview - simply using the fact that the dragging occurred you assume that the page changed - that's not always so. In your code just calculate your current page from contents offset and page width. This way you can calculate current page number (0-based): - (void)scrollViewDidEndDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willDecelerate:(BOOL)decelerate { if (scrollView == scrlView) { CGFloat xOffset = scrollView.contentOffset.x; int currentPage = floor(xOffset / scrollView.bounds.size.width); self.title = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d/%d", currentPage, totalPages]; } } Also you may be using incorrect delegate method - I'd use scrollViewDidScroll: method instead P.S. to show the number for a page that currently occupies more than half of the screen change the code to: int currentPage = floor(xOffset / scrollView.bounds.size.width + 0.5);
