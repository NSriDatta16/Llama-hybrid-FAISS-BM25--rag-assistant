Exclude extraneous values in a range

I have a range of readings from a test (for example:0.796, 0.109, 0.11, 0.11, 0.109, 0.109, 0.109, 1.78). I want to remove the extraneous values of these so that I get a more realistic view on the more accurate test result range. If I take the average (1.78) or the median (1.09) it doesn't give me that picture. I am not able to figure out how I could mathematically have a way to achieve this, because I don't want these extraneous values to skew my results.
