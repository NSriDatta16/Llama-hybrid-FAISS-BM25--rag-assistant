How should a math-paranoid programmer learn stats?

(this is the opposite of " introduction to statistics for mathematicians ") I'm a programmer who loves writing logic and even a libsvm vector embedding library to my name. Now I'm getting asked questions about: "exogenous factors" "sample randomness" distributions, confidence intervals, etc. There are plenty of self-taught programmers , so how should I self-teach statistics?
