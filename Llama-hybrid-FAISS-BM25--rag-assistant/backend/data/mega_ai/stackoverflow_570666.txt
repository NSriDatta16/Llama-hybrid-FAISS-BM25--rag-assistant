.NET Large Object Heap and JSON interaction

I have an asp.net application that serializes data to the client using JSON. Once load reaches a certain level, the app is spending an in-ordinate time in GC and after spending some time with WinDbg/SOS and related tools it appears that there is a substantial amount of LOH fragmentation taking place because the size of the generated JSON is frequently large enough to exceed the 86K boundary of the LOH. My question 2 fold 1) Has anybody run this specific scenario of JSON generation impacting and causing LOH fragmentation and 2) Does anybody have any suggestions on how to handle it.
