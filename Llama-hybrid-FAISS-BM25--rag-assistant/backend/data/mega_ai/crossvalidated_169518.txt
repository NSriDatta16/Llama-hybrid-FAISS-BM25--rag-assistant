What is the connection between Markov chain and Markov chain monte carlo

I am trying to understand Markov chains using SAS. I understand that a Markov process is one where the future state depends only on the current state and not on the past state and there is a transition matrix that captures the transition probability from one state to another. But then I came across this term :Markov Chain Monte Carlo. What I want to know is if Markov Chain Monte Carlo is in anyway related to Markov process that I describe above?
