If MS SQL Server Express Edition is being used then SQL Server Agent is not available. I found the following worked for all editions: USE Master GO IF EXISTS( SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[MyBackgroundTask]') AND type in (N'P', N'PC')) DROP PROCEDURE [dbo].[MyBackgroundTask] GO CREATE PROCEDURE MyBackgroundTask AS BEGIN -- SET NOCOUNT ON added to prevent extra result sets from -- interfering with SELECT statements. SET NOCOUNT ON; -- The interval between cleanup attempts declare @timeToRun nvarchar(50) set @timeToRun = '03:33:33' while 1 = 1 begin waitfor time @timeToRun begin execute [MyDatabaseName].[dbo].[MyDatabaseStoredProcedure]; end end END GO -- Run the procedure when the master database starts. sp_procoption @ProcName = 'MyBackgroundTask', @OptionName = 'startup', @OptionValue = 'on' GO Some notes: It is worth writing an audit entry somewhere so that you can see that the query actually ran. The server needs rebooting once to ensure that the script runs the first time. A related question is: How to run a stored procedure every day in SQL Server Express Edition?
