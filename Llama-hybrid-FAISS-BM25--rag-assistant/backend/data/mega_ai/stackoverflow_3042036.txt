Using jQuery's animate(), if the clicked on element is " ", the function should still return false?

I was reading jQuery's page for animate() http://api.jquery.com/animate/ Its examples don't mention about if using click me ... $('#clickme').click(function() { $('#someDiv').animate({left: "+=60"}); }) we actually still have to return false like in the old days? $('#clickme').click(function() { $('#someDiv').animate({left: "+=60"}); return false; }) (but then, those examples didn't use a for the "click me"... but used something else. Otherwise the page will jump back to the beginning of the page? Does jQuery have a more elegant or magical way of doing it?
