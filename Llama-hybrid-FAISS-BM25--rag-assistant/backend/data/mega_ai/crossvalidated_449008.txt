How to write descriptive statistics?

I am using logistic regression to look at the association between plaque and smoking, with adjustment for a bunch of potential confounders. In the descriptive statistics section, is it normal practice to look at the distribution of the outcome within different levels of predictor variables, or the distribution of the main exposure (smoking) among the different predictor variables? For example, for table 1, should I have Predictor variables (to the left) against Outcome (Yes/No) (at the top), or Predictor variables (to the left) against Smoking Status (Never/Ex/Regular) (at the top)?
