Here are the two examples we discussed. First one is using time as a categorical variable (so 1 coefficient per time, time0 is in the intercept term). > library(nlme) > summary(lme(anxiety~group+time,random=~1|id,data=df)) Linear mixed-effects model fit by REML Data: df AIC BIC logLik 7543.898 7607.555 -3758.949 Random effects: Formula: ~1 | id (Intercept) Residual StdDev: 7.357165 9.584044 Fixed effects: anxiety ~ group + time Value Std.Error DF t-value p-value (Intercept) 112.447 1.446703 891 77.72637 0 grouptreat -24.974 1.591393 98 -15.69317 0 timet1 -6.210 1.355389 891 -4.58171 0 timet2 -14.600 1.355389 891 -10.77182 0 timet3 -19.890 1.355389 891 -14.67476 0 timet4 -25.410 1.355389 891 -18.74739 0 timet5 -32.080 1.355389 891 -23.66849 0 timet6 -37.240 1.355389 891 -27.47552 0 timet7 -37.410 1.355389 891 -27.60094 0 timet8 -37.320 1.355389 891 -27.53454 0 timet9 -37.170 1.355389 891 -27.42387 0 (truncated) which is giving you a coefficient for each time, and a test is already done comparing each time>0 with time0, so for ex. timet9 is significantly different from time0 by -37.17 (p-values practically 0). Also there is a significant difference between the groups. Alternatively you could use time as a continuous variable. > df $timeC=as.numeric(substr(df$ time,2,3)) > summary(lme(anxiety~group+timeC,random=~1|id,data=df)) Linear mixed-effects model fit by REML Data: df AIC BIC logLik 7720.564 7745.088 -3855.282 Random effects: Formula: ~1 | id (Intercept) Residual StdDev: 7.23122 10.49891 Fixed effects: anxiety ~ group + timeC Value Std.Error DF t-value p-value (Intercept) 107.48864 1.2396866 899 86.70630 0 grouptreat -24.97400 1.5913927 98 -15.69317 0 timeC -4.39436 0.1155892 899 -38.01707 0 (truncated) where you can see that the slope is also significantly different from zero and equal to -4.39, so each week anxiety decreases by this much (on average).
