Adding site_slogan and site_missiong to $conf['i18n_variables'] should work if you have installed (and enabled) the Internationalization module. Once it's done, you should be able to set values for each languages by visiting the Site information administration page with the interface set in the language you want to edit the values for (ie. to edit the values in French, you should go to http://example.com/?q=fr/admin/settings/site-information ) as documented on the " Multilingual Variables " of the module's handbook. 2010/06/21 : Added Internationalization requirements and link to handbook page.
