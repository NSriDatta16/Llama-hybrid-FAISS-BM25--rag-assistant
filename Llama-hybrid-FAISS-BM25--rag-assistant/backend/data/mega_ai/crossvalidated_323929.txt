Is PCA effectively just a rotation of the data, if you were to keep all principal components?

If so, why would you apply another rotation after you already found the "variance-maximizing" - and in that sense optimal - rotation. Wouldn't the second rotation lead to a - again - non-variane-maximizing situation? Please enlight me.
