Simultaneous and Pointwise Confidence Bands for GAMs

I am performing a penalized B-spline regression on a simple time series of count data in R using the mgcv package. When I calculate a pointwise confidence band from the standard error of the fit based on the estimated degrees of freedom, it turns out to be slightly wider than the simultaneous confidence band produced by posterior simulation of the fitted GAM (as per: Confidence interval for GAM model ). As per Wood (2006), I'm using the Bayesian posterior covariance matrix from mgcv. Some difference may be attributable to using the t distribution for calculating the pointwise band and assuming a multivariate normal for the posterior simulation, but I had expected the latter to reflect more uncertainty about the mean response due to the multiple comparisons issue. Am I correct in assuming that approximate equivalence of the simultaneous and pointwise confidence bands is a special case, and if so, are there specific conditions required to obtain this result?
