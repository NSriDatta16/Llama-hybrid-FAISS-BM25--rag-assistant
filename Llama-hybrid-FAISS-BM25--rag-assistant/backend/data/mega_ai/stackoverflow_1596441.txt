Because there are so many ways to do edits--even within short periods of time like 500ms--including dragging and dropping, or cutting and pasting, large sections of text around within the document or from outside it --I don't know if there's going to be something that will cover all scenarios really well. This is certainly a non-answer to your question at face value, but I would consider carefully the trouble of developing and maintaining something like this compared to changing the interface to restrict the text size and breaking existing texts into smaller pieces. Maybe that's not possible in your situation, but if it is, I would guess it would be much less trouble in the end to dodge the issue in this way and just send full documents after an edit.
