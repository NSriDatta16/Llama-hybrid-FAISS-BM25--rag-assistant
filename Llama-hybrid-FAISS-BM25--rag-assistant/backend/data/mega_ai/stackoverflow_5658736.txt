Don't install jars in /Library unless you really know what you are doing (for example, maybe you need to install some encryption policy files). You'll be much, much better off if you keep your jars in a different location. Since you're using Maven, you could specify a different local repository by creating a ~/.m2/settings.xml file: ... /path/to/local/repo/ ... Then, use Maven to install the jars in your local repo and off you go. Personally, I keep my libraries under a folder like ~/dev/java/lib to keep them organized, and then I also install them using Maven into my local repo.
