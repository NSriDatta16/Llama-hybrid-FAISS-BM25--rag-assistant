Time series anomalies

Suppose I have some time series. I already removed seasonality, so it consists of trend, some events and error. I need to find the events, their length in periods,and their strength they had on the trend. My idea is to divide data into several "windows", and calculate the length and strength Do you know of a similar technique?
