Effective Sample Size for a cycle or mixture of kernels

The Effective Sample Size (ESS) of a univariate Markov Chain can be used to assess it performance. Is there a version of the ESS for when the Markov Kernel is a mixture $\alpha K_1 + (1-\alpha) K_2$ or a cycle $K_2 K_1$ of kernels? I suppose there might be different versions based upon whether $K_1$ and $K_2$ leave $\pi$ invariant or not.
