First of all, I would like to say that I have no weather prediction education. In my experience missing data is huge problem, especially when you don't have whole month or just a day (I was working on 1-hour samples, one day = 24 missing rows, one month = 750 missing rows). When it is very important feature, e.g. value which you are predicting, you should drop these rows, to avoid further problems. There is many approaches to cope with missing data. Second issue, which you should do is remove trends from your data. It is crucial step. Third issue, as you may know some of data may be chaotic, with high variance. E.g. 1-hour PM10 in some day may vary from 10 μg/m3 to 150 μg/m3. So it's good idea to work also on moving averages, to decrease variance: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231002004193 - it is here described a little - I cannot find free version of this article. 4th issue, if you have data from last 10 years, then you should choose last 3-4 for learning and evaluation. Because city was changing a lot during this whole time. Pollution from 2004 are really different than pollution in 2015. According to your first point, I was using neural networks(MLP, RBF net, SVM, linear regressions, random forest tree). I didn't use stats model like ARIMA. I had plans for using CRF or SSVM. I started working on data with MATLAB - but it was pain to fill missing values, to print charts, to describe the data. So I change enviroment to Python, and it was good choice. I had used Pandas ( http://pandas.pydata.org/ ) for working with missing data, for ploting data, for extracting data for learning. Then I start using sklearn ( http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ ) for non-neural nets methods: SVM, trees, Naive Bayes, LASSO, linear regressions. At the end I choose pybrain ( http://pybrain.org/ you can look at keras.io) for learning neural nets: MLP and RBF net. Finally I connect some methods in ensemble learning. I will don't share my master thesis, because it is not written in english.
