If I understand your question correctly, the problem you are trying to solve is a "multiclass classification" problem, so I'd suggest doing some research on that. Possible solutions range from Support Vector Classification (simple) to deep neural networks (harder). In most machine learning problems, it's best to start with a simple approach. This means that: You learn about simple patterns in your data You get a benchmark If the result from your simple is good enough, you can stop there :) I recommend checking out scipy's docs on classification models . Also if you're a beginner you might find this cheatsheet handy for similar questions in future.
