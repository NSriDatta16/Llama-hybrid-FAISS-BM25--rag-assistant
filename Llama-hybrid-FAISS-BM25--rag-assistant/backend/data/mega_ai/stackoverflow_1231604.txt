Maybe the production environment places the files in a different location. Try to check what folder the production server places his files and where the development does. These issues frequently happen when the development and live are using different operating systems or different IIS versions. Possibly the difference in storage location causes your reg-ex to fail. I am not a reg-ex pro so I don't know whether your regex might contain an error, but this is the first thing that I could think of. Also, is DEV your own machine? In that case: are you using IIS or are you using the ASP.NET development server? Because IIS and the ASP.NET development server integrated in Visual Studio behave different in certain situations. Also: directly "jumping into" an array location is considered bad-practice by many developers (I also think it is not very good to just jump into the array assuming the correct amount of items are there). Especially when using multi dimension arrays it can get tricky when errors occur. I have seen many complex code failing on array indexes and because there were no checks it was quite hard to debug them (I am talking about 5 or 6 dimension arrays).
