non-significant coefficient in logistic regression, use for ROC curve

I wanted to find the ability of a numeric continuous variable to predict mortality (dead/alive), and what cut off value to take in the continuous variable. I wanted to construct an ROC curve and find the cut off value to achieve this. I did a logistic regression, taking mortality (m) to be the dependent variable, and the continuous variable (v) to be the predictor. The p value of the coefficient I got for v was 0.19. The study take p value of Given that the coefficient is not significant, can this model be used for prediction, and ROC curve constructed using this model?
