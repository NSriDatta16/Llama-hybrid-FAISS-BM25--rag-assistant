You are comparing LASSO and subset selection. It is not quite clear how you tune the penalty intensity of LASSO $\color{red}{^*}$ , while for subset selection you use AICc as the criterion. It seems you are only considering nested models in subset selection. E.g. you select between models with lags $\{1\}$ , $\{1, 2\}$ or $\{1, 2, 3\}$ but not $\{2\}$ $\{3\}$ , $\{1, 3\}$ or $\{2, 3\}$ . This may or may not make sense depending on the application. Meanwhile, when using LASSO you consider any combination of variables; you do not use some sort of hierarchical penalty where a coefficient can be set to zero only if all of the subsequent coefficients are set to zero, given some ordering of variables. It can very well be this difference that is driving your results. If one of the nonnested combinations tends to work best, LASSO will select it and this will "contradict" the nested subset selection. Another difference between LASSO and subset selection is that LASSO will shrink some of the coefficients part of the way towards zero, in contrast to unpenalized models in the subset selection. This may yield improved performance and result in different variables with nonzero coefficients in LASSO vs. subset selection even if you consider nonnested as well as nested models there. I would not do LASSO on the model from subset selection based on AICc. I would either use LASSO as is or subset selection. Regarding the choice of the maximum lag length in LASSO, you could use subject-matter knowledge (perhaps macroeconomic theory). Consider how distant past is still relevant. If there are seasonal patterns, you could add as many lags as there are seasons. $\color{red}{^*}$ Typically, the penalty intensity of LASSO is tuned via cross validation. It is also possible to use information criteria such as AICc instead; I have seen it done in some papers. The rationale behind the latter choice is that AICc, AIC and leave-one-out cross validation are asymptotically equivalent. AICc is a convenient alternative when cross validation is problematic, e.g. in time series analysis that you are dealing with.
