This Markov Chain is not irreducible and is therefore not ergodic. That is the reason why there is no unique equilibrium distribution. More specifically: nonergodicity entails that the equilibrium distribution depends on the distribution of the initial state $X_0$ of this chain. This chain has two irreducible classes, {1,2} consisting of states 1 and 2, and {3,4} consisting of states 3 and 4. In the answer of @Siong Thye Goh, the parameter $\alpha$ has a precise interpretation, namely: $$ \alpha = \text{Prob}[X_0 \in \{1,2\}] $$
