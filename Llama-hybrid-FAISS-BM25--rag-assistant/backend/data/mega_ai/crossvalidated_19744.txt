If each single item in the questionnaire is ordinal, and I don't think that this point can be disputed given how there is no way of knowing whether the quantitative difference between "strongly agree" and "agree" is the same as that between "strongly disagree" and "disagree", then why would the summation of all these ordinal level scales produce a value that shares the properties of true interval level data? For example, if we are interpreting the results from a depression inventory, it doesn't make sense (to me at least) to say that a person with a score of "20" is twice as depressed as a person with a score of "10". This is because each item in the questionnaire isn't measuring actual differences in levels of depression (assuming that depression is a stable, intenal, organic disorder) but rather the person's subjective rating of agreement with a particular statement. When asked, "how depressed would you say your mood is on a scale of 1-4, 1 being very depressed and 4 being not depresed at all", how do I know that one respondent's subjective rating of 1 is the same as another respondent's? Or how can I know if the difference between 4 and 3 is the same as that of 3 and 4 in terms of the person's current level of depression.If we can't know any of this, then it doesn't make any sense to treat the summation of all these ordinal items as interval level data. Even if the data do form a normal distribution, I don't think it is appropriate to treat the differences between scores as interval level data if they were computed by adding up all the responses to a likert-items. A normal distribution of data just means that the responses are probably representative of the greather population; it doesn't imply that the values obtained from the inventories share important properties of interval level data. We need to be careful in the behavioural sciences about how we use statistics to speak to the latent variables we are studying, for since there is no direct way of measuring these hypothetical constructs, there are going to significant problems when we attempt to quantify subject them to parametric tests. Again, simply because we have assigned values to a set of responses doesn't mean that differences between these values are meaningful.
