When to use "fixed number of components" in a PCA

The question is relatively simple (and stupid maybe). When do I use a fixed number of components (especially in analyzing a questionnaire). Is it useful when I have literature to a validated scale/questionnaire? And how do I interprete my results when I have already a fixed number of components.
