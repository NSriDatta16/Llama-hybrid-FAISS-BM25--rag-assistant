At the heart of these metric based clustering problems is the idea of interpolation. Take whatever method you just cited, and let us consider a continuous variable such as weight. You have 100kg and you have 10kg in your data. When you see a new 99kg, the metric will enable you to approach 100kg --- even though you have never seen it. Unfortunately, there is no interpolation existing for discrete data. Another argument for this question is there is no natural way to do so. You want to assign 3 values in R and make them equal-distance between each pair, this would be impossible. If you assign them into different categories and run let's say PCA, then you lose the information that they reflect in fact the same category.
