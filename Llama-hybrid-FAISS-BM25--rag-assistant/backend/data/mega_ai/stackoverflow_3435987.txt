Here is the code I am using $("div_item").droppable({ drop: function(e, ui) { var param = $(ui.draggable).attr('src'); addlist(param); } }); Where addlist() is a function to get ajax contents and display in div like $('#div_item').append(msg.txt); 'msg' variable to get the item detail from ajax file. The problem is with id div_item. These are more than 20, colud be upto 60. I also want to restrict each div with a single dropped in it. Many thanks for your help
