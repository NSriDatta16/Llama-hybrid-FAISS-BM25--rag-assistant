Why should softmax be used in CNN

In the last layer of CNNs and MLPs it is common to use softmax layer or units with sigmoid activation functions for multi-class classification. I have seen somewhere, I don't remember where, that softmax is used whenever the classes are mutually exclusive and the layer with units containing sigmoid activation function are used in tasks with multiple labels, e.g. recognizing animals in an image which can contain numerous animals. Am I right? Is there any other deduction for distinguishing between them? I have seen here and here but they do not contain what I want.
