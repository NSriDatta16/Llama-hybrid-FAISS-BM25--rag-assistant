So as to interpret the results of a probit model, you have to compute the marginal effects. The marginal effect of an independent variable is the change in the probability of observing a certain outcome, if the independent variable changes by one unit, whereas all the other variables remain constant. In Stata, marginal effects can be computed via the margins command. Have a look a the following model, which explains union membership by the worker's age, the fact of being married and the fact of having a college degree: sysuse nlsw88, clear probit union age i.married i.collgrad margins, dydx(*) You will end up with the following output: Average marginal effects Number of obs = 1878 Model VCE : OIM Expression : Pr(union), predict() dy/dx w.r.t. : age 1.married 1.collgrad ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Delta-method | dy/dx Std. Err. z P>|z| [95% Conf. Interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- age | .0014378 .0032566 0.44 0.659 -.004945 .0078207 1.married | -.0469362 .0210713 -2.23 0.026 -.0882352 -.0056372 1.collgrad | .0978039 .0242385 4.04 0.000 .0502973 .1453105 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: dy/dx for factor levels is the discrete change from the base level. This means that if age increases by 1 year, the probability of being a union member will increase by 0.0014378 * 100 = 0.14378 percentage points. Being married decreases the probability of union membership by -4.69362 percentage points and having a college degree increases the probability by 9.78039 percentage points.
