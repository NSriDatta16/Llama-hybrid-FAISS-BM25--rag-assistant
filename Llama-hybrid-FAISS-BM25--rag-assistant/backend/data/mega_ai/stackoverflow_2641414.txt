Recursive vs. Iterative algorithms

I'm implementing the Euclidian algorithm for finding the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two integers. Two sample implementations are given: Recursive and Iterative. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm#Implementations My Question: In school I remember my professors talking about recursive functions like they were all the rage, but I have one doubt. Compared to an iterative version don't recursive algorithms take up more stack space and therefore much more memory? Also, because calling a function requires uses some overhead for initialization, aren't recursive algorithms more slower than their iterative counterpart?
