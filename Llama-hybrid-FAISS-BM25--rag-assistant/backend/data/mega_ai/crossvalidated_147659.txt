Logistic regression vs. linear regression on class probabilities

I have a bunch of data points, each of which represent a success or failure. Each data point is from one of ~40 conditions, each of which contains approximately 40 data points. All of my predictor variables vary by condition rather than by individual point. Ultimately, I want to understand how each predictor variable influences the probability of success. Would it be more appropriate for me to calculate percentage successes for each class and do a linear regression to predict these values, or for me to do a logistic regression on the individual points? Example data: Condition Var1 Var2 Var3 Succes A 1.5 20 .4 yes A 1.5 20 .4 yes A 1.5 20 .4 no A 1.5 20 .4 no B 2.0 10 .6 no B 2.0 10 .6 no B 2.0 10 .6 yes B 2.0 10 .6 no C 1.7 15 .2 no C 1.7 15 .2 yes C 1.7 15 .2 yes C 1.7 15 .2 yes
