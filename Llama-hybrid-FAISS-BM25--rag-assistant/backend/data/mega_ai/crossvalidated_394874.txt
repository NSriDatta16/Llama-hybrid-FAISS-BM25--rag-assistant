I solved my issue: If you train a CART tree only with the time series data (univariate) and validate the model with the time series test part (also univariate), you will get a pretty low error rate. The problem is, that you need independent variables (and not the time series target value itself) for further forecasting as an input. Otherwise you try to forecast data on data you don't have. That doesn't work.
