Random Forest has two methods for handling missing values, according to Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, who invented it. The first is quick and dirty: it just fills in the median value for continuous variables, or the most common non-missing value by class . The second method fills in missing values, then runs RF, then for missing continuous values, RF computes the proximity-weighted average of the missing values. Then this process is repeated several times. Then the model is trained a final time using the RF-imputed data set.
