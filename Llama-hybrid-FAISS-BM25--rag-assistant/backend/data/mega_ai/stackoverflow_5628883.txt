This is by no means a trivial problem to solve, though there is an abundance of research on the topic. Presently the most successful forms of machine learning in the speech recognition domain apply Hidden Markov Model techniques. You may also want to take a look at existing implementations of HMM algorithms. One such library in its early stages is ghmm . Perhaps even better and more readily applicable to your problem is HTK .
