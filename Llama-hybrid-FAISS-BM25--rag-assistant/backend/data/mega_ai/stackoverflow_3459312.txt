Runtime environments like VB6 and .NET treat COM as a first-class citizen and do not require the plumbing that midl.exe provides. A VB6 class is automatically a COM coclass that implements IDispatch. .NET has attributes like [ComVisible]. Their runtime environments implements the glue needed. No such glue in C++, you have to write it yourself. Or leverage a class library like ATL. It does however allow moving beyond the confines of oleauto, like implementing interfaces that derive from IUnknown and creating custom marshallers.
