This is certainly possible. You could, for example, call uniqid() and then check for an existing database by that name in case you happen upon a duplicate (though that's unlikely). However, I'm extremely wary of your overall approach. In general, you should not have to create tables (excluding TEMPORARY tables) at runtime. Instead, you could put data for all organizations in a single database, but with a simple column to distinguish which records are associated with which users.
