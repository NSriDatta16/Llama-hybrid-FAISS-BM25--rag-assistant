Display Time Based Gannt charts using JavaScript

We are using fusion charts for time based gantt charts. But these charts are not getting displayed as they require flash plug-in which is not supproted by iPhone. So I'm looking for pure javascript charts to get the same type of charts but I have not found any! I would appreciate if you can point me to right direction. If there are no such links then ,please let me know how we can create these type of charts using JS. I'm looking for following type of charts http://www.fusioncharts.com/widgets/Gallery/Gantt11.html?width=650&height=490 Thanks, Hari
