Difference when using Graphics.DrawString

I get different result using Graphics.DrawString when rendering a chart for ASP.NET website. Text looks fine on development environment but bold and ugly on production. Chart sample on production is here . I can not post the link on chart sample from development environment, but I uploaded it on AmiProject website with name GanttChartOnDevelopment.png I have checked that required font in installed on production server. Code I am using: FontFamily fontFamily = new FontFamily("Arial"); m_Font = new Font(fontFamily, 8, FontStyle.Regular); m_Bitmap = new Bitmap(bitmapWidth, RowHeight * taskCount, PixelFormat.Format24bppRgb); m_Bitmap.MakeTransparent(m_Bitmap.GetPixel(1, 1)); m_Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(m_Bitmap); m_Graphics.SmoothingMode = SmoothingMode.AntiAlias; m_Graphics.DrawString(Text, m_Font, new SolidBrush(Color.Black), new PointF(r.Right + 7, r.Top - 7)); I am using .net 3.5. Production server is Windows 2008, Development - Windows XP SP3. Please help to understand the reason of that difference and fix that.
