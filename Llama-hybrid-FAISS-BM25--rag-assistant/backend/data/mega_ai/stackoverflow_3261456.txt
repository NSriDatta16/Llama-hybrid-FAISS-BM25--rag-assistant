Google Reader - > create tweets, push to mysql database

I need to be able to create tweets from shared items on google reader (like reader2twitter does) and then push them for storage in a MySQL database. I know that the shared feed from reader is an atom feed, but beyond that, not even sure where to start. Can someone please point me to some resources, or tips on how I would even go about doing this? Thanks in advance, as always!
