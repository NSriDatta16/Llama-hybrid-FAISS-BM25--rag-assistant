Here are a couple things that have helped me speed things up or increase bandwidth over the last 10 years or so... 1) Turn off the Nagle algorithm when your nodes are physically close together on a fast link and the data in the packet is not smaller than the TCP packet overhead. MS did a paper about this . A counter example to this is when you have a satellite connection in your link and a packet takes 800 milliseconds one way due to the distances involved. In that case, Nagle is a good thing. 2) Make sure you have the MTU size set correctly for your link and your machine to avoid fragmentation issues. 3) If you're on Windows and outgoing packets are small and the latency is high, you should also set the socket option SO_SNDBUF to 0 to avoid transmission delays.
