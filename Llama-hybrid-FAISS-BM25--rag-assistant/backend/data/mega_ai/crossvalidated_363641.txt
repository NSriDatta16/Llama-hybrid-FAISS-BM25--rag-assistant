A "leaderboard" of sorts is maintained at this website, " Classification datasets results ". The maintainers attempt to keep track of published results of various neural network architectures. The leaderboard is not solely restricted to CNNs per se -- any network is admissible. But because all of the tasks tracked on the leaderboard are image tasks (as of this writing), it's likely that many of the networks will be CNNs since they are very effective at image tasks.
