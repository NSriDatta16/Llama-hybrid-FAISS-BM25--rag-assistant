"controlling for" a variable in retrospective cohort studies

I'm a doctor and I'm trying to teach myself logistic regression for biomedical research. In many papers, people will say that they use multivariate logistic regression analysis to pick from a list of possible predictors (IVs), those most related to the disease state (Binary DV - yes or no). They will further go on to say that this is true, even when controlling for some other variable. From reading other posts, my understanding is that when people say they are "controlling for" a variable, they mean that they included that variable in their logistic regression model and that variable was not significant. Is this correct? So, for example, we are looking at whether there is a significantly lower proportion of women compared to men in associate or full professor positions, but we need to control for the amount of time since graduation and whether they have a PhD. My understanding is that to do this, I would use SPSS to create a multinomial logistic regression model with associate or full professor (Y/N) as the dependent variable, Sex (M/F) and PhD (Y/N) as categorical "factors" and years since graduation as a continuous covariate. When I do this, I get a model, but here is where I get confused. SPSS compares the intercept only model to the final model and tells me that the Chi-Square value is 287, df 3, Sig 0.000. I thought this means that the model is valid. But then, the Goodness of Fit tests are Pearson Chi-Square value of 272, dF 123, Sig 0.000 and Deviance Chi-Squrae 171.78, df 123, and Sig 0.002. I thought that meant that the model is bad. So, my first question is - is this model valid, and can I use the parameter estimates to tell me whether each of these factors is a significant predictor of professorship independent of the others? Am I using the wrong tests to analyze this data? Thank you so much for your time and assistance.
