Maven command line

Is it possible to set environmental variables in a build profile as opposed to setting them in the command line? For instance, I want to enable the debugger when I'm using my test environment (-Denv=test). I want maven to do this: export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=4000,server=y,suspend=n" This way, I can quickly attach a debugger without having to type the same repeated line over and over. I don't believe the helps me in this case: ... -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=4000,server=y,suspend=n ... Walter
