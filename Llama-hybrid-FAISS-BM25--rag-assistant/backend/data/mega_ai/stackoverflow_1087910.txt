I think it is possible in some contexts - for example scalability of a web application could be quantified in terms of numbers of users, numbers of concurrent requests, mean and standard deviation of response time, etc. You can also get into general numbers for bandwidth and storage, transactions per second, and recovery times (for backup and DR). You can also often give numbers within the application domain - let's say the system supports commenting, you can quantify what is the order of magnitude of the number of comments that it needs to be able to store. It is however worth bearing in mind that not everything that matters can be measured, and not everything that can be measured matters. :-)
