Does it make sense to use dynamic time warping when clustering time series that all have the same length and sampling interval?

Comparing Euclidean distances with dynamic time warping (DTW): Will Euclidean distance perform better than DTW when clustering time series that all have the same length and sampling interval? Are there arguments in favor of DTW for this special case?
