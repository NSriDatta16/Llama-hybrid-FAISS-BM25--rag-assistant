regular expression in vba excel looking for groups out of a string

I am currently working on a vba project that has the end user copy/paste long strings of text into a worksheet and the code to parse out data from the junk in these strings and organize it from them. The strings will always be in different lengths, and have a different number of spaces between the data. However they will always be grouped the same way(i.e. the price comes first, some white space, unit price, some white space, and the id number). Is there a regular expression that will just pull the groups(both letters and numbers) out of the whitespace?
