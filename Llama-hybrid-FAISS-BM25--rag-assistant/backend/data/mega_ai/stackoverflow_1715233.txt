Here is another variant of second snippet error: int main() { int i = (int j = 0); return 0; } You can't declare variables inside ANY expression. Second () inside for is the same case - you can declare variable i inside for() but not inside nested expression placed into (). Hope I explained it in proper words, maybe more correct explanation exists. Actually both code fragments are odd.
