An occaisonlly connected Silverlight app is going to be a bear to write. All you have for durable storage is Isolated Storage. Same with XBAP. Do you need cross platform support for your apps? Why not just do a ClickOnce WPF app, and set it up to be able to switch between a live connection to a service layer and a disconnected mode? Multi-targetting WPF and SL can be done, but it is not easy. Check out the Prism project which includes guidance and a VS add-on to support multi-targetting.
