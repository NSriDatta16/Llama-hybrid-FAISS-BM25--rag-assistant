If you can, it may be easiest to go with the solution pointed out by Xiâ€™an. If that is not an option, then here are some alternatives. Some programming languages have an integration routine in-buildt and accessible from within their Bayesian procedures (e.g. SAS allows you to use adaptive quadrature via the CALL QUAD statement from within PROC MCMC for a user defined function defined in a preceding PROC FCMP). If that is not the case, then, if your programming language allows you to, you can program your own integration routine. Adaptive quadrature may be an obvious candidate, because it is not very challenging to program. In some MCMC sampling schemes that may not be attractive (e.g. for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, I believe adaptive quadrature would cause issues within derivatives due to the parameter value dependent number of terms). If you can get bounds on the error terms, then non-adaptive quadrature may do the job, but that is often challenging. For Hamiltonian Monte Carlo we may well be talking about Stan, and in that case we could also use the ordinary differential equation solver it provides to do our integration.
