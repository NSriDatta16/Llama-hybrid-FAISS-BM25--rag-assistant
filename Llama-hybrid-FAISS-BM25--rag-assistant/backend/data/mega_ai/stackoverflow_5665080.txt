Try using the options inherent in the .draggable() function at http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ basically it says you need to have the snap option set to true like this: $( ".selector" ).draggable({ snap: true, snapMode:'outer', snapTolerance:40 }); snapMode "...determines which edges of snap elements the draggable will snap to. Ignored if snap is false. Possible values: 'inner', 'outer', 'both'." And snapTolerance is "...The distance in pixels from the snap element edges at which snapping should occur." Or try using the grid option. This is created to do exactly what you want: "...Grid snaps the dragging helper to a grid, every x and y pixels. Array values: [x, y] Code examples": Initialize a draggable with the grid option specified. $( ".selector" ).draggable({ grid: [50, 20] }); Get or set the grid option, after init. //getter var grid = $( ".selector" ).draggable( "option", "grid" ); //setter $( ".selector" ).draggable( "option", "grid", [50, 20] ); Hopefully this helps you.
