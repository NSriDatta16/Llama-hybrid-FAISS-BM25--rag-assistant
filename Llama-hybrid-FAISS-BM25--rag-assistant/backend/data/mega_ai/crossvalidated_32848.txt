Can a percentage be used to calculate the mean etc. in a t-test?

I have data that includes the number of students in a class and the percentage of that group who achieved a preset pass level in a standard test. I have this data for a number if different schools in two population samples, about 30 schools in each. The class sizes differ considerably, so it seems take sense to use the percentage already given when calculating the t-test. But I also know that percentages shouldn't be averaged. I could calculate the number of students from the data given, but this does not reflect class size, which seems important. The percentage "automatically" reflects the weighting of class size. Any advice or thoughts about this problem appreciated. Example data to illustrate problem No students percent passed calculated no passed 28 7% 2 79 7% 6 28 51% 14 58 50% 29 Thanks Tim
