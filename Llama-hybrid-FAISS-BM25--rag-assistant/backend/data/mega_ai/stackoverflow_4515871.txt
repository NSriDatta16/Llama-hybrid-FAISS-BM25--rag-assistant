Python - Screen-scraping and controlling mouse in OS X

I'm looking into screen-scraping and controlling the mouse in OS X for a hobby project. I'm not looking for the most elegant way, but I need to be able to capture the screen every half a second or so. I've found that I could use the screencapture command-line tool ( screencapture -w -W -i ~/Desktop/capture.jpg ), but I'm worried that it might not be fast enough. I'm also looking for a way to send clicks, set the cursor position and obtain the cursor position. Sort of like what win32api provides: mouse_event , SetCursorPos and GetCursorPos . I've found this sample code that uses the PyObjC library to set the cursor position, but it's always moving my mouse to (0,0) instead of the coordinates I pass it. import objc class ETMouse(): def setMousePosition(self, x, y): bndl = objc.loadBundle('CoreGraphics', globals(), '/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework') objc.loadBundleFunctions(bndl, globals(), [('CGWarpMouseCursorPosition', 'v{CGPoint=ff}')]) CGWarpMouseCursorPosition((x, y)) if __name__ == "__main__": et = ETMouse() et.setMousePosition(500, 500) Edit: I'm running Snow Leopard (10.6) if it matters. Thanks!
