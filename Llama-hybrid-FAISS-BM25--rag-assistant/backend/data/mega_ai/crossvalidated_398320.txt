How do you design a regression experiment with many variables but samples are expensive?

I want to design an experiment to see which factors affect production quality. Quality can either be a binary response like "good" or "bad" or a quantitative value like noise level. There are 10 factors/attributes I'm interested in, and each factor can take on 4 values. Due to cost, I can only make 500 samples of product while varying the attributes in any way I like. This means there cannot be a sample for each unique combination of attributes. How big of a concern is this? After getting the data, I plan to run a regression to see which factors are significant. I might also try step wise regression or do model selection using F tests. Are these valid approaches? A few question: 1. Given the number of attributes, which is an "ideal" minimum number of samples to get a decent model, if samples are cheap? Does it matter if the attributes are numeric or categorical (in this case)? What if the response are multi-class? For example, there might be different failure modes of "bad" and I'd like to use those as response. Since logistic regression is usually not used for multi-class classification, what would be a better model for this case?
