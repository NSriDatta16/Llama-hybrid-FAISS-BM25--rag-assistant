Validation loss is less than training loss by 5 units. How this result is interpreted?

Iam training a Keras model for end-to-end speech recognition. I have my own dataset of speech containing about 400 wave files. Text transcriptions is also given as input. Model summary is: Layer (type) Output Shape Param # the_input (InputLayer) (None, None, 26) 0 layer_1_conv (Conv1D) (None, None, 30) 3930 conv_batch_norm (BatchNormal (None, None, 30) 120 rnn_bi (GRU) (None, None, 40) 8520 bt_rnn_bi (BatchNormalizatio (None, None, 40) 160 bidirectional_15 (Bidirectio (None, None, 40) 19440 bt_rnn_final (BatchNormaliza (None, None, 40) 160 time_distributed_15 (TimeDis (None, None, 29) 1189 softmax (Activation) (None, None, 29) 0 Total params: 33,519 Trainable params: 33,299 Non-trainable params: 220 None Optimiser used: Adelta() loss function: ctc_loss function. dropout: 0.5 training and validation loss in last epochs is: Epoch 392/400 27/27 [==============================] - 36s - loss: 19.9499 - val_loss: 16.5945 Epoch 393/400 27/27 [==============================] - 34s - loss: 18.9789 - val_loss: 14.1015 Epoch 394/400 27/27 [==============================] - 36s - loss: 17.9598 - val_loss: 14.2997 Epoch 395/400 27/27 [==============================] - 34s - loss: 17.1506 - val_loss: 15.1215 Epoch 396/400 27/27 [==============================] - 35s - loss: 17.4900 - val_loss: 14.0334 Epoch 397/400 27/27 [==============================] - 35s - loss: 17.7459 - val_loss: 14.7812 Epoch 398/400 27/27 [==============================] - 35s - loss: 18.3460 - val_loss: 14.4461 Epoch 399/400 27/27 [==============================] - 35s - loss: 17.4311 - val_loss: 15.5965 Epoch 400/400 27/27 [==============================] - 35s - loss: 17.6892 - val_loss: 12.4165 Can anybody explain me how this loss is interpreted? What could be the correct values of training loss and validation loss, so my model correctly predicts the output values? I tried reducing the loss and it did reduce, with difference of plus or minus 1 unit, but test tests were totally incorrect. Can anyone suggest me ways to gain correct test results?
