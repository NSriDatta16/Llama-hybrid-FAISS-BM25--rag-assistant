there will be button in the app and when user taps the button, internal apk (open source game) will be started. If you mean, that the application (the internal apk) will be started, then you don't understand how that works. So let me explain: an APK is not like an .EXE on a Windows system. I mean, you cannot just "run" an APK. An APK is a package which contains an application, and the only thing you can do with it is install it. The code you post above seems to invoke the android application installer, which would do that: install the app (not run it). As you can see, it's necessary that the app is in the external storage (SD card), and that's because the app installer cannot access your /res/raw directly. So, what you have to do is copy the APK from res/raw to the SDCard (Google is your friend), and then use the code above. Again, that won't execute the app, it will just install it. Once it's installed, you can execute it from your app doing something lile: Intent intent = new Intent(); intent.setClassName("com.android.bla", "com.android.bla.YourActivity"); startActivity(intent);
