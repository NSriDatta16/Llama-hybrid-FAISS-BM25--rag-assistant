Why do we sample from the uniform distribution in Metropolis-Hastings for acceptance?

For each iteration of the MH, sample $x'=q(x|x')$ , then the acceptance probability is computed: $$A=\min(1,a)$$ where $$ \alpha=\frac{p(x')q(x|x')}{p(x)q(x'|x)} $$ Now, I've seen that the algorithm samples from a uniform distribution $$ u\sim U(0,1) $$ to set the new sample as $$ x=x' $$ if $u≤A$ , retain $x=x$ otherwise. I have seen some derivation on how the MH algorithm samples from the target distribution $p$ as the stationary distribution of the Markov chain: $$ p(x'|x)=q(x'|x)A $$ if $x'≠x$ , otherwise $$ p(x'|x)=q(x|x)+\sum_{x≠x'}q(x'|x)A $$ Now what does the sampling from the uniform distribution have to do with deciding whether to accept the proposal $x'$ or retain $x$ ? Isn't it sufficient to accept the proposal if $A>0.5$ ?
