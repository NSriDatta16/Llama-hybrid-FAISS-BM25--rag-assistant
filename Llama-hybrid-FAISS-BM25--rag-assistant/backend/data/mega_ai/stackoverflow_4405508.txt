You don't say why you're hesitant to 'provide copies'. In general, I think a reasonable approach is to think about how you've set things up for yourself to use the convenience modules. Did you install them in site-packages (or equivalent), or did you just depend on them being in the directory you ran the code from? However you use the modules, is that situation ideal, or is there a way that would be nicer for you? Start with that, and figure out how to automate it through setup.py, which lets you put things wherever you want on the system (though I strongly discourage abusing this capability). Whether you distribute them as a tarball or with the package that needs them, you still have to maintain all of the files, so the only real question is whether you intend for those convenience modules to develop their own user communities with their own support requests, etc., or whether they're decidedly intended only for use in support of this other module. If you intend those modules to be used only for the one module, include them in the package, perhaps in a 'utils' package inside the distribution. Otherwise you're just cluttering the index with things people might think are useful, but are really joined at the hip with something else that drives the changes and maintenance of them. If you intend those modules to be generic, and intend to maintain them as such, and think they have use outside of supporting this module, distribute them separately.
