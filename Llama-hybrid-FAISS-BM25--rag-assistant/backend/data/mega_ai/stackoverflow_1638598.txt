This is a common problem with libraries implementing their own URL connection via Socket. Apparently, the JRE implementation of the URLConnection class can get to the browser information directly. We had to employ the technique as mentioned by oscargm above, i.e. on the appserver writing the request cookies to be the parameters to the applet AND getting to the browser's document cookies using JavaScript (this is for the case of SSO where the set of cookies may not be the same because of the intermediate agent -- proxy servers). Note that if the cookies are HttpOnly -- the javascript code will fail.
