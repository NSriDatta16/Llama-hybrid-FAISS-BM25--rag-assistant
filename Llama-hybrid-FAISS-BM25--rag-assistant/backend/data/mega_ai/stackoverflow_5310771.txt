A simple fix would be to create a GET only action with the same name as the POST only one, that justs redirects to the homepage. Creating a solution that will resume a form post after a log in would be quite a lot of work for minimal gain. UPDATE: Regarding the amount of work it would be to create all of these GET actions.. A more elegant option would be to create an attribute specifically for this scenario, something named like HttpPostOrRedirectAttribute , that you could use to decorate these post only actions rather than use the HttpPostAttribute . The behaviour of this would be that it accepts posts, but rather than throwing 404 performs redirects for other verbs.
