Apache2 SSL certificate file issue

I am new to https ( HTTP using SSL). I have managed to generate a self signed certificate file and have added the following lines to the apache conf file: SSLEngine on SSLCertificateFile /path/to/cert/file/myfile.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/key/file/myfile.key SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown The issue I am having is that when I try to restart my server I get the following error and am confused why it is not able to read it: Starting web server apache2 Syntax error on line 1 of /path/to/cert/file/myfile.crt: Invalid command 'MIIDtTCCAx6gAwIBAgIJAOnu0fcwBt1BMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBBQUAMIGZMQswCQYD', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration ...fail! Any ideas?
