A more elegant solution could be the following: let shapeExistsInList shapeType list = List.exists (fun e -> e.GetType() = shapeType) list let circleExists = shapeExistsInList ((Circle 2.0).GetType()) a However, I'm not very satisfied with this myself since you have to create an instance of the discriminated union for it to work. Grouping by shape type could work in a similar fashion.
