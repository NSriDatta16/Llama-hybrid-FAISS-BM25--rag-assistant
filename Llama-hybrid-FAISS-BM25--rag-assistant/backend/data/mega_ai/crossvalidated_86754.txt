A Chow test is a test to verify if your time series have a structural break. To do so, you fit a model on the entire range of your time series. Afterwards you fit the same model on a number of subsets of your time series, and compare the sum of error squares. Formulas are given on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_test And I believe that a 1-step Chow test checks if you have one structural break in your data, you can also check for multiple structural breaks (becoming a 2-step, or n-step Chow test).
