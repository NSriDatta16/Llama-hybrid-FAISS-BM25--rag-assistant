Add this line to the REQUEST_FILENAME conditions: RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /Servidor/agentesRainbow/index.php/$1 [L] Here is the updated .htaccess: RewriteEngine On RewriteBase /Servidor/agentesRainbow/ #'system' can be replaced if you have renamed your system folder. RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^system.* RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /Servidor/agentesRainbow/index.php/$1 [L] #Checks to see if the user is attempting to access a valid file, #such as an image or css document, if this isn't true it sends the #request to index.php RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /Servidor/agentesRainbow/index.php/$1 [L] #This last condition enables access to the images and css folders, and the robots.txt file RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php|images|css|public) RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /Servidor/agentesRainbow/index.php/$1 [L] # If we don't have mod_rewrite installed, all 404's # can be sent to index.php, and everything works as normal. ErrorDocument 404 /application/errors/404.php Hope it solves your problem!
