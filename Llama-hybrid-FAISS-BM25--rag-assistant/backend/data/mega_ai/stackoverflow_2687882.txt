You need a common location to store this. You could use the app.config even if this is a seperate assembly by defining a config section in the library assembly and referencing it you proceess app.config. Or you could just add a generic setting to appSettings and reference that without using strongly typed settings. If the value is user entered then you could use isolated storage. Finally you could put it in a well known location in the registry at install time. For code the following is encapsulted better public interface ICoreLib { void SomeMethod(); } public static class CoreLibManager { private static ICoreLib coreLib; private static volatile bool initialized; private static readonly object lockObject = new object(); public static ICoreLib CoreLib { get { Inititialize(); return coreLib; } } /// /// The inititialize. /// private static void Inititialize() { if (initialized) { lock (lockObject) { if (!initialized) { string configFile = // Fech from common location coreLib = new MyCoreLib(configFile); initialized = true; } } } } /// /// The my core lib. /// private class MyCoreLib : ICoreLib { public MyCoreLib(string configPath) { } public void SomeMethod() { } } }
