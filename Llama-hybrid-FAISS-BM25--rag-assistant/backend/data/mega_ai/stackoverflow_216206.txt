User interface for text mode LCD display

Does anybody know any resources on this subject? I'm developing an embedded application for 2x16 LCD display. Ideally I would like to have a general (display independent) framework, that could be used virtually on any display - one or more segment(s) LED, 1x16, 2x16 LCD, etc. Also would like to learn about general guidelines for such small user interfaces. EDIT: I'm interested in high-level functionality, how to organize the user interface - the menus, options and the user input. We don't dicuss the LCD controller issues here.
