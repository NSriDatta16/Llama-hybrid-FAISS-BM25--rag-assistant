Let's take a closer look at how switch ( $skyCoverage ) { case ( $skyCoverage >= 1.00 ): is evaluated. First let's substitute $skyCover by 0 switch ( 0 ) { case ( 0 >= 1.00 ): Now evaluate the case-condition switch ( 0 ) { case ( false ): And since (bool)0===false, it's a match (see http://docs.php.net/language.types.boolean#language.types.boolean.casting ). As pygorex1 said that's not the way switch/case works. You want an if (...) { } else if (...) { } else { } instead. (edit: using the "identical operator" === in "(bool)0===false" isn't a good explanation. switch/case performs a loose comparison , i.e it allows type juggling , like in 0==false which evaluates to TRUE)
