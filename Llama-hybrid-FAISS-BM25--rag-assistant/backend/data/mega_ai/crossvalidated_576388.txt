If you care the use of R, a selection of packages available are summarized in the CRAN task view on time series ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html ). Below is the relevant portion: Change point detection is provided in strucchange and strucchangeRcpp (using linear regression models) and in trend (using nonparametric tests). The changepoint package provides many popular changepoint methods, and ecp does nonparametric changepoint detection for univariate and multivariate series. changepoint.np implements the nonparametric PELT algorithm, changepoint.mv detects changepoints in multivariate time series, while changepoint.geo implements the high-dimensional changepoint detection method GeomCP. Factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) models are estimated by a Bayesian method with FAVAR. InspectChangepoint uses sparse projection to estimate changepoints in high-dimensional time series. Rbeast provides Bayesian change-point detection and time series decomposition ... Of these, Rbeast is also available as a library in Matlab and Python ( https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast ).
