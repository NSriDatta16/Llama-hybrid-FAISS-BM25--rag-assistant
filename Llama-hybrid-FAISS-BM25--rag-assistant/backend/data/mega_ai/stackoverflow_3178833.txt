You can save images in the simulator by going to Safari on the iPhone,iPad. Navigate to some URL eg, hot pictures of Megan Fox on google images. Click and hold on your favourite image of here, hopefully in a very hot pose. Then select save from the menu that appears. This normally does it for me. [UPDATED] Sorry this does not work on 3.2.2 but has worked in the past.
