Another thing you should be aware of in accounting systems is that no one should have direct access to the tables. This means all access to the accounting system must be through stored procedures . This is to prevent fraud, not just SQL injection attacks. An internal user who wants to commit fraud should not have the ability to directly change data in the database tables, ever. This is a critical internal control on your system. Do you really want some disgruntled employee to go to the backend of your database and have it start writing them checks? Or hide that they approved an expense to an unauthorized vendor when they don't have approval authority? Only two people in your whole organization should be able to directly access data in your financial database, your database administrator (DBA) and his backup. If you have many DBAs, only two of them should have this access. I mention this because if your programmers used float in an accounting system, likely they are completely unfamiliar with the idea of internal controls and did not consider them in their programming effort.
