The problem with this question, upon further reflection, is that there is not a posterior distribution of $E_{\theta_j}[g(\theta_j))]$ . If you are a true Bayesian, the expectation is just a number at this point. Therefore, it doesn't make sense fo try to characterize uncertainty for each expectation (and by extension, the distribution of the expectations).
