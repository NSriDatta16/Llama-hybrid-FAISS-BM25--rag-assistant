A table on which you only ever insert (and presumably select ) and never update or delete should be really stable. Are you absolutely certain you're protecting thoroughly against SQL injection attacks? Because those could (of course) delete rows and such if successful. You haven't mentioned which table engine you're using (there are several), but it's well worth running whatever diagnostic tools there are for it on the table in question. For instance, on a MyISAM table, run myisamchk . Or more generically (this works for several table types), use the CHECK TABLE statement. Have you had issues with the underlying storage? It may be worth checking for those.
