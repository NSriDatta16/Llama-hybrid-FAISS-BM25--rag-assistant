Using non-stationary time series data in OLS regression

I am using 1983-2008 annual data to test if both Gini coefficients and gross national saving in China and the US can affect the US current account balance. The data seem to be non-stationary, but I am a beginner and only know the basic multiple regression model and autoregressive distributed lag model, can I still use them to these models to test the effects? I know the models would be biased and not accurate, but do they give any useful information? My chosen control variables are real GDP, interest rate, dollar index and maybe some other national income components.
