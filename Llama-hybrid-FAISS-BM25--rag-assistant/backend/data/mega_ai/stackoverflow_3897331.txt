Split the file into N pieces. On each machine, load as much of the piece into memory as you can, and sort the strings. Write these chunks to mass storage on that machine. On each machine, merge the chunks into a single stream, and then merge the stream from each machine into a stream that contains all of the strings in sorted order. Compare each string with the previous. If they are the same, it is a duplicate.
