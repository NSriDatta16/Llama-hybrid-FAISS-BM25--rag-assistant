When is n small enough to abstain from having a global test set?

This question relates to model selection and validation. This post laid out three strategies on how to deal with very small n. In conclusion (option 3), one might resign using a global test set, but use every instance for training. The use of cross validation still allows to get average performance indicators on the validation folds (for the sake of this question: regardless if single or nested). Is there any (scientifically) safe rule on when one might abstain from having a global test set? The question is based on these two discussions: No need of global testing set with small n Possibilities to deal with small n, w/o global test set
