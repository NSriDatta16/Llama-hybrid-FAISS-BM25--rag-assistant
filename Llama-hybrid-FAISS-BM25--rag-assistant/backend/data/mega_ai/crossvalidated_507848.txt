Intuition for GloVe word embeddings

I am currently looking at the formulation for the GloVe word embedding model. I have a difficult time understanding the intuition behind why the ratio of co-occurence probabilities are used. The diagram below is used to illustrate the co-occurence ratios of two words under a certain context word $k$ The paper stated that through the ratios they were able to distinguish relevant words like "solid" and "gas" from irrelevant words such as "water" and "fashion". I don't see why that is the case. Suppose we have $k$ = fridge, then most probably the ratio $\frac{P(fridge|ice)}{p(frdige|steam)}$ will be bigger than 1. Does this allow us to group fridge together with solid and gas ? Paper link: https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf
