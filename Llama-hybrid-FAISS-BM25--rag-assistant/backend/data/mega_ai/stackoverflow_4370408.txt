Assembly video mode coordinates mapping to character coordinates

I am working on an 8086 dos assembly project , using video mode i was able to draw some lines and stuff but now i want to print some characters and found that ( interrupt 10,2 ) uses character (row,col) coordinates that is different than video mode coordinates what is the most elegant way to map between those two coordinates ? or there is a better way to print characters in video mode ? what i know currently is that i can do the mapping manually but it won't be accurate as there is no floating point operations in 8086...
