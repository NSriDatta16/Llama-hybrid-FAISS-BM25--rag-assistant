One big drawback is that DataSets are in-memory data structures which means the amount of memory consumed is linear to the amount of records you are returning (i.e. O(n) space complexity). On a server side app this will kill scalability. If you define a custom class T, then returning IEnumerable from your data access layer enables you to efficiently stream data from your data source (e.g. a Linq to Sql IQueryable provider) with O(1) complexity. Note: the same problem occurs if you return List or Collection from your data access layer because those are also in-memory structures. I've seen a lot of people do this in the name of elegance without consideration to scalability.
