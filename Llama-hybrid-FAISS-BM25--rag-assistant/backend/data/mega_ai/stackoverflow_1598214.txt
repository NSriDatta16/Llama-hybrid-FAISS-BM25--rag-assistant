php-gtk will give you the least hassle, however any choice comes with a bit of a learning curve. I'm now using php-gtk + the Roadsend PHP compiler to compile PHP desktop applications into native 32 bit ELF executables. I should also add, it was not my choice to use PHP for such a task, I would much rather write desktop apps using C or Python. In the above case, I inherited something that was prototyped using PHP, which never got re-written. It was faster to just get it to compile than it was anything else. I don't want to kick off a flame fest on the merits of using PHP as a prototyping tool .. in essence, any dynamically typed language could be used as such, depending on what had to be prototyped. I would, however, encourage you to keep going on your self-study, once you grasp the concepts of the gtk bits that PHP exposes, consider looking into Python if you want to create applications that will be released to the wild.
