Why and when would one begin with PCA on $X$ when predicting $y$?

From a very general point of view, when you have a dataset $X$ and want to predict a label $y$, what is the purpose of beginning with a PCA (principal component analysis) first, and then doing the prediction itself (with logistic regression, or random forest or whatever) from both intuitive and theoretical reason? In which case can this improve the quality of prediction?
