Of course it will change your beta since you change your X and since you do MCO I presume, it will change slightly the estimates. When you differenciate the series, the purpose is for autocorrelation in residuals, not on the estimate, basically you added a mobile average component to take account of autocorrelation in residuals. Basically, you just cumulatively add the diff-forecast to the last cumulative obs. Lets yd be the diff data and y the original then: yt+1 = yt + ydt+1 yt+2 = yt+1 + ydt+2 = yt + ydt+2 + ydt+2 and you continue like that First of all, you should do unit root test for each variable serie to see if one is I(1) or I(0) cause if you have at least one I(1) in a linear combination, you will have a I(1) target variable. What I suggest you if you are motivated to learn and if you have a fair strong relationship between those series is the VAR modeling, especially the VECM (johansen cointegration) that can be pretty good.
