To make it work, just replace the line that says: if(isDraggable == "true") with: if (isDraggable) The reason is that isDraggable is an object, if it exists (i.e. the "draggable" method on the ".title" div worked) then it will be true (exists and is non-zero), but it will not be equal to 1 , which is the numeric value for true , so your original test fails and you never call the function.
