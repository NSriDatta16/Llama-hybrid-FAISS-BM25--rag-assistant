Synthetic Control when leaving treatment

I'm trying to do a comparative analysis using synthetic control to compare a country that went from a dictatorship to democracy to it's dictatorial synthetic twin. As I understand it, synthetic control has been used for some of this issues, but only when the dictatorship began. Is it appropriate to build the synthetic dictatorial twin with democratic or non-dictatorial countries to estimate the effect of entering democracy? Would it be appropriate to try to estimate the synthetic control group back in time, using data from when the treatment ended to today, and then letting the synthetic twin go back in time to compare the control with the actual country before the treatment? (say, if the synthetic control would need to start from a lower level to reach today's levels, this would be evidence in favour of the dictatorship having some negative impact)
