Simulation of correlated stochastic processes based on some time series

I'd like to simulate power output time series of other wind farms based on measured outputs of one (or more) wind farms. Specifically, I have data on power outputs of wind farm A : $$ \mathbf{x}^A = [x^A_1, x^A_2, ..., x^A_T] $$ How can I simulate $\mathbf{x}^B$ , $\mathbf{x}^C$ , ... during time $[1, T]$ ? There must be some correlations between $\mathbf{x}^A$ , $\mathbf{x}^B$ , $\mathbf{x}^C$ , which doesn't matter as long as it makes sense. It is hard to obtain satisfying statistical models for $\mathbf{x}^A$ . Even if you do, those must be based on lots of other factors like wind speeds, angles, temperatures, etc ... which will make the simulation too complicated. I have thought about bootstrapping for dependent data, but the method is to resample from the same object, so I cannot simulate $\mathbf{x}^B$ by bootstrapping $\mathbf{x}^A$ . I am trying to reproduce woods2013simulation , but it is based on methods in frequency domain, with which I am not familiar. Does anyone have simpler methods? Why I want to simulate outputs of other farms is that I don't have enough data. Example My intention can be illustrated by data from Aneroid Energy . Power outputs from three wind farms in NSW Australia are considered. Their latest power outputs on April 24, 2020, can be visualized by the following three coloured lines. The values are normalized by their own capacities so the y axis is the capacity factor. Note that the black line indicates the average wind power output in Australia. Because SAPHWF1 and WRWF1 are close to each other, so they are expected to have similar fluctuations. Now, suppose I only have the series of SAPHWF1 , how can I simulate those of WRWF1 and BODWF1 ? Moreover, what if I don't have historical data at all? For example, I imagine there is a new wind farm next to BODWF1 , how can I simulate a reasonable realization?
