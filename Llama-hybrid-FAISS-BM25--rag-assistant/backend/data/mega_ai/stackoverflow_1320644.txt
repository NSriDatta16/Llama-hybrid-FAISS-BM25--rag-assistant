Instead of questioning the value of code in multiple assemblies, question the value of clumping all of your code in one place. Would you put everything in your kitchen in a single cabinet? Circular references are circular references, whether they happen between assemblies or within them. The design of the offending components is most likely sub-optimal; eschewing organization via assemblies ironically prevents the compiler from detecting the situation for you. I don't understand the statement that you can organize code just as well with folders as with projects. If that were true, our operating systems wouldn't have the concept of separate drives; they would just have one giant folder structure. Higher-order organizational patterns express a different kind of intent than simple folders. Projects say "These concepts are closely related, and only peripherally related to other concepts."
