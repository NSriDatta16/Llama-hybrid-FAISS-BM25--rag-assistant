jQuery - add editable and draggable elements

I use jQuery and I call a backend system with AJAX / JSON to get a list of projects which should be listed as small notes, like this one: http://www.psdgraphics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/sticky-notes.jpg function getAllProjects() { $.getJSON("allprocets, function(data) { $.each(data, function(id, data) { alert(data.id); alert(data.name); }); }); } and I have a HTML div area in which the project notes should be placed: But how can I create with jQuery such elements which are editable (the name which is printed on the note) and draggable (only in this projectlist area)? Draggable will work, if I add for example a CSS class class="draggable" include jQuery UI and set $(".draggable").draggable(); But first, I have to render the project list and make notes... Does anyone know and can help me? Thank you in advance & Best Regards.
