It sounds an awful lot like the anti-pattern One True Lookup Table . Google it! Here is a list of bad things I came up with in less than 1 minutes: You won't be able to enforce referential integrity All relation have to be either many-to-many or one-to-many You won't be able to handle attributes (100 qty of article_id=1 sold in store_id=7) You will only be able to deal with single column keys The table will be bigger (thus slower on average) The indexes will also be bigger (thus slower on average) It may cause unnecessary contention Optimizer statistics will become skewed Database maintenance becomes harder I could easily come up with more, but I don't think it's really needed ;) When one doesn't have much database experience, it feels like a good thing to do, to reuse stuff and use "common" structures, but databases rarely benefit from it. Use separate tables for your relationships. Eventually, you will do that anyway.
