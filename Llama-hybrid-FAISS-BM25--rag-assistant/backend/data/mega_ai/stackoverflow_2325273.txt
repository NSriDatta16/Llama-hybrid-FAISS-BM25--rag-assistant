gzip works on all text, including JavaScript If you want to do more compression (e.g. by using YUI compressor before gzipping) then you could get your server to do it, but it would be easier to do it before uploading. The trick is to automate the build and publish process â€” so you run a script that does the compression then uploads the result, rather then drag'n'dropping files manually or similar.
