You will want to escape the request using javascript: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_escape.asp On the C# end you can HTML Encode / Decode for storage and re-rendering. The issue is with injection attacks, thus C# yells anytime you allow html to be passed in plain text. When you are aware you will be dealing with HTML you should always encode it before sending it to your controllers. ~Vulgarbinary Edit to add new syntax: var input = { id : GetGUIDValue(), html : escape($("body").html()), type : 'exposure' } $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: " ", data: input, success:function(data) { } }); Another Edit: Originally from: http://kseesharp.blogspot.com/2008/01/c-equivalent-of-javascript-escape.html Microsoft.JScript.GlobalObject.unescape("KC%27s%20trick%20/Hello") will unescape your string. Sorry for the delay had to go dig through prior examples I had of this to see what the full unescape syntax was.
