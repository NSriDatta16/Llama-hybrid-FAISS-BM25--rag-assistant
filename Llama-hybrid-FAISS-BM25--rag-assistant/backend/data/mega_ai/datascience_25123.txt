Can anyone suggest code to use or a guide for getting started with CNNs in Python? If you are a noob to CNN, Keras is the recommended starting point. The code is self-explanatory and easy to understand. Here is a link to a simple classification related task on facial images tutorial using Keras. You can also start with MNIST classification and understand the core concepts of CNN. Once you understand the fundamentals, you can try and experiment with other libraries like Tensorflow, Theano, Pytorch...etc.
