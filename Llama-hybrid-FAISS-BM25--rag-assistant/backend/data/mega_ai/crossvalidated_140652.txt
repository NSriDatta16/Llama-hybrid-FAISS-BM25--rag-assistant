What is an intuitive explanation of Echo State Networks?

I am new to Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) and still learning the concepts. I understand at an abstract level that an Echo State Network(ESN) is able to (re)produce a sequence of inputs, i.e. a signal, even after the input has been removed. However, I found the Scholarpedia article too difficult to grasp and understand completely. Can someone please explain how the learning works mathematically in the simplest possible form.
