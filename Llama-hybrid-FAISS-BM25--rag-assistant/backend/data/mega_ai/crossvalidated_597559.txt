AIC takes model complexity into account by construction. You do not need to adjust for that any further. If you like adjusting for model complexity manually, you can compare likelihoods and adjust them . But then you end up with... AIC (or BIC, or some other IC)! So there is really no point in doing that by hand if you have AIC available. If the AIC of model 2 is lower than the AIC of model 1 (AIC2 (You may also consider model averaging, especially if the differences in AICs between the models are not too large.)
