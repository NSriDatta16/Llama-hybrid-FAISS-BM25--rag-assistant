Multi-class Decision Forest vs Multi-class Decision Jungle

guys. I have been learning about machine learning using Azure ML service from Microsoft and my team and I have seen that there are some multi-class decision algorithms, the Forest and Jungle are examples. We don't know what's the real difference between these ones (we had checked the documentation of them in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/multiclass-decision-forest and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/multiclass-decision-jungle ), because they look very similar. Could you help us with that? What's the difference between these algorithms? Thank you.
