If it were me, I would 'normalize' the strings as I 'pulled them in'; probably with a string.Replace(). Then you won't need to change your comparisons anywhere else. Edit : Mark, that's a tough one. Its really up to you, or you clients, as to what is a 'normalized' string. I've been in a similar situation where the customer demanded that strings like: I have 4 apples. I have four apples. were actually equal. You may need separate normalizers for different situations. Either way, I would still do the normalization upon retrieval of the original strings.
