Setting a Splashscreen background image in VB.Net at run time

I have a splash screen for my program that I want to have a background image that changes each time the program opens. One way I saw to do this is to load it from a ImageList, but that has an maximum image size of 256x256. The splash screen is 498 x 305, which means that I need to find something besides ImageList but hopefully with a similar ability to organize the images. I did try just putting them into resources, but wasn't able to get it to set the background without erroring, and I'd prefer not to have 30 images cluttering the place up.
