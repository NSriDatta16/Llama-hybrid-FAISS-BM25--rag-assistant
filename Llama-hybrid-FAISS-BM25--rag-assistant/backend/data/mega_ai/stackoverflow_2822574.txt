Visual C++ has pretty good C runtime memory debugging tools built in. See #define _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC , or read: The CRT Debug Heap and Memory Leak Detection Enabling . It can detect: Memory leaks Double deletes Writing just past the ends of allocated memory If you have a reproducible case, where the problem allocation always happens at the same time, you can use set it to break into the debugger on that allocation. There are also commercial tools such as BoundsChecker, HeapAgent, and Purify, and free tools like Fortify, and of course you can roll your own, but you can get a long way with the built-in VisualStudio one.
