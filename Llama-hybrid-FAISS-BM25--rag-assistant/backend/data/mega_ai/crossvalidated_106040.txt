Appropriate weighting for averages

What is the appropriate (or the advantages of disadvantages for each) measure for weighting mortality rates across countries: total population or total number of deaths? For example, if you have age-standardized cardiovascular disease mortality rates for 5 different-sized but otherwise comparable countries and want to find the mean, what would be the reasons for or appropriateness of weighting by population or number of deaths?
