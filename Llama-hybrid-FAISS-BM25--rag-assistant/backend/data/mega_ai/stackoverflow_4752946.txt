Neural network programming; converting Matlab to C++

We have a program written in matlab software. It contains a Hopfield net that saves a pattern after searching a large picture to find it. Is it possible to rewrite this code in a programming language like c++, for increasing efficiency? If it is possible, is it necessary to rewrite algorithms like the newhop learning algorithm again or are there already code examples to use?
