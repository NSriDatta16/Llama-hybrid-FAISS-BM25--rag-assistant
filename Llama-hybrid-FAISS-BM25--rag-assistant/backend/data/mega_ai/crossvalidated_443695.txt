Weighted Block Bootstrap

In this diagram (from ' An introduction to the Bootstrap ') the black circles represent the original time series while the white circles represent the sampled bootstrap realization. This bootstrap makes it less likely to select data points at the very beginning or end of the sequence. Depending on the size of the data set, this can lead to problems if the value for block length is too large. Is there some kind of weighted sampling of the blocks so that each data point is sampled with equal probability? Or is it common to simply prefer shorter block lengths? Note: I cannot use circular block bootstrap.
