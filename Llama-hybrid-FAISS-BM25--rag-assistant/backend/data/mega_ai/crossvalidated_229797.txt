As far as I can tell from your description, this question isn't at all specific to the details of your analysis (bootstrap confidence intervals, Firth correction) but is a general issue of interpreting the coefficients from logistic regression. Let's suppose that you're using the defaults, i.e. you have taken the coefficients as given by R which are by default on the logit or log-odds scale. If the 95% CI on the effect of birth weight is (-0.403, 1.103) that means that the effect of a one-unit increase in birth weight (let's say it's measured in kg for the moment) on the log-odds of mortality is in this range. You could also state this as a proportional, or multiplicative, change in the odds of mortality of exp(c(-0.403,1.103)) = c(0.668,3.013) - this means the odds could be anywhere between decreased by 1/3 to increased threefold by a 1-kg increase in birth weight. As the comments above point out, the fact that the 95% confidence intervals encompass zero implies that this is a non-significant result at the usual cutoff value of $p=0.05$. In most contexts, this would be considered a fairly large confidence interval (a decrease of 1/3 or a tripling of the odds is a large change in the outcome); however, the interpretation depends entirely on the size of your unit of birth weight. If, for example, the birth weight is measured in kg, but the entire range of birthweights in your sample is only $\pm 0.1 \textrm{kg}$, then you should think about the CI per 0.1 kg (i.e., divide the values by 10); this is one reason people sometimes prefer to scale continuous predictors by their standard deviation. If on the other hand 1 kg is a typical change of birth weight in your data set, then this result says you have little information about the effect of birth weight - this could be because you have a small data set, or an inefficient study design, or other covariates that are strongly correlated with birth weight, or ... The actual effect on the probability depends on the baseline probability (i.e., the values of all the other predictors and the intercept).
