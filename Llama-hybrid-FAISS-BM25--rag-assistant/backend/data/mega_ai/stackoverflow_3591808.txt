I was thinking of making an MD5 hash out of the user's data, but i'm not sure how unique the MD5 would be If you're going to store the entire hash, then it's going to be unique enough for you application. I did a little experiment a while back and found that even 32-bit fragment of an MD5 or SHA-1 hash will probably still be unique enough for a few thousand records.
