Will major config changes discourage users from deploying code?

I'm beginning development on a solution that will plug into an existing application. It will be made available for public use . I have the option of using a newer technology that promotes better architecture, flexibility, speed, etc... or sticking with existing technology that is tried and tested which the application already uses. The downside of going with the newer technology is that a major change to an essential config file needs to be made to support it. If the change goes wrong the app would be out of service. Uninstall is also an issue as future custom code by other developers may require the newer tech and there's no way this can be determined. How important is this issue in considering an approach? Will significant config changes put users off deploying code, or cause problems for them later? Edit: Intentionally not going into specifics about technologies here to avoid the question from being siderailed. Install/uninstall software can be provided but there is some complexity involved which may cause them to foul up on edge cases resulting in a dead app. (A backup of the original config would be a way to mitigate that.) Also see the issue about uninstall above where I essentially can't provide one.
