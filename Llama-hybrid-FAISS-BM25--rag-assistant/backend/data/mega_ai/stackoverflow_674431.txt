System Wide persistent storage?

My program starts a process and I need to make sure it is killed before I can run the program again. To do this, I'd like to store the start time of the Process in something like a mutex that I could later retrieve and check to see if any process has a matching name and start time. How could I do this? I don't really want to stick anything on the harddrive that will stick around after the user logs out. For reference I'm using C# and .NET
