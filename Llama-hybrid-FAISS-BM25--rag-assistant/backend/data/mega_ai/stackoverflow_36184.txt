Well, I figured it out myself, right after posting, which is the most embarassing way. :) It seems every member of a StackPanel will simply fill its minimum requested size. In the DockPanel, I had docked things in the wrong order. If the TextBox or ListBox is the only docked item without an alignment, or if they are the last added, they WILL fill the remaining space as wanted. I would love to see a more elegant method of handling this, but it will do.
