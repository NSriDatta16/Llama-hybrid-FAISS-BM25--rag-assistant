What is wrong with this MySQL insert statement?

I am a beginning php/mysql developer, and I have written this statement to insert a username and password into a database to make an account. For some reason I am getting an error though; what's wrong? mysql_query("INSERT INTO signup (Username, Password, Email) VALUES ($username, $password, $email)") or die ("cnnot run query");
