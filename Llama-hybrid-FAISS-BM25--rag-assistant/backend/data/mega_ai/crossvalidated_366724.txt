Averaging Histograms

I am currently running experiments which include measuring concentrations throughout an environment, producing a histogram as such: Which shows the percentage of positions which have oxygen concentrations between 0 and 10%, 10% and 20% etc. I am running the experiment multiple times, and would like to know what is the proper way of "averaging" results or if the idea of averaging just doesn't make sense. I can think of two options: 1) Taking the average value of each bin across all experiments (but then my percentages wouldn't add to 100%...) 2) Summing the values of each bin across all experiments, and calculating the percentage in terms of total samples across all bins across experiments. Is any of the two options sensible? Edits from comments: Sample sizes could be different between experiments
