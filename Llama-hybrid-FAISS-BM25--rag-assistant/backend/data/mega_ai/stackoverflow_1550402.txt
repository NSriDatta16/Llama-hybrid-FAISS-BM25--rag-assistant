How many users can a 200mb ASP.NET membership database hold?

I just purchased an unlimited shared hosting windows account on godaddy with 2 databases only to realise that they have a 200mb limit on SQL Server databases. My website uses the automatically generated ASP.NET 2.0 membership database. The nature of my website (free classifieds) requires the storage of a significant number of users. Since I'm using the standard ASP.NET membership database that (hopefully) many of you have used before... I was wondering just how many users a 200 mb database could hold?
