Another one that not many people are aware of is that you can drag from Interface Builder to your header file to create IBActions or IBOutlets. NOTE: Open the Assistant Editor with focus on the XIB inside IB. If you create your IBOutlets this way Xcode automatically adds the property, synthesizes it, sets it to nil in viewDidUnload and releases it in dealloc. You simply drag from the IB object to your header file the same way you would when creating connections between the view objects and their file owners (screenshot below).
