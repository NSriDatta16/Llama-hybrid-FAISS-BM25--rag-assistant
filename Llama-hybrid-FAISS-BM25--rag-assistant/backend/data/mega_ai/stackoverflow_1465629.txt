I had same decision few years ago for one of our applications, we wanted to make it looks embedded forms, first I used the Frames and I wrote a class to manage it. Later I found TLMDDisplayForm component from LMDTools , which making embedding forms inside it very easy task, it reduced the code used and we have more features. one of main goals that we changed from frames to Forms was missing some events of TForm like: OnCreate, OnShow, OnActive which we use for some tasks in our applications, beside missing some properties such as: ActiveControl and other things I don't remember. If you would like to go with Forms, I suggest you to use LMDTools which make the task easier for you, beside the basic version is free :-)
