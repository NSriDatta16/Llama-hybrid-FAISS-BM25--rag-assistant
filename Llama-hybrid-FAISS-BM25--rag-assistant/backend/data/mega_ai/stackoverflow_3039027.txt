touchesBegan and other touch events not getting detected in UINavigationController

In short, I want to detect a touch on the navigation controller titlebar, but having trouble actually catching any touches at all! Everything is done without IB, if that makes a difference. My app delegate's .m file contains: MyViewController *viewController = [[MyViewController alloc] init]; navigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:viewController]; [window addSubview:navigationController.view]; There are a few other subviews added to this window in a way that overlays navigationController leaving only the navigation bar visible. MyViewController is a subclass of UIViewController and its .m file contains: - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { for (UITouch *touch in touches) { NSLog(@"ended\n"); } } -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { for (UITouch *touch in touches) { NSLog(@"began\n"); } } I also tried putting these functions directly into app delegate's .m file, but the console remains blank. What am I doing wrong?
