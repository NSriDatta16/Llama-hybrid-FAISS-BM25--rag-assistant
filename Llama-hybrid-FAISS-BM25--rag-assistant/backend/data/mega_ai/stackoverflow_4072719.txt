Well, after some tweaking and lecture on preprocess function in the theming system, I found a solution to my problem. I share it with you and if you find a more elegante approach; let me know! What I did is this... 1) In the template.php file of the theme, I add two fonctions: function YOURTHEME_preprocess_views_view__MYVIEW(&$variables) { if ($variables['rows'] || $variables['empty']) { $GLOBALS['dont_show_static_text'] = TRUE; } } function YOURTHEME_preprocess_views_exposed_form__MYVIEW(&$variables) { if ($GLOBALS['dont_show_static_text']) { $variables['custom_flag1'] = TRUE; } } So, if my views is showing some results ($row) or a blank result ($empty), then I set a flag to be use in the template file.... 2) In my views-exposed-form--MYVIEW.tpl.php ... Some static text here ... And voil√†! My static text is showing up only on the initial load of the view and it shows on TOP of the filter (not under!). Hope this help someone else!
