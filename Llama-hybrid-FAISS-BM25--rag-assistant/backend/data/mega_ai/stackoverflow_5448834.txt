How to identify website visitor when cookies disabled and URL rewriting is not allowed?

In Java web application, Java servlet create unique jsessionid that passes as cookie to the client browser to keep track of the client's subsequent requests after the first one. But when cookies disabled and URL rewriting is not allowed due to security policy, my understanding is that Java servlet would create a new session object for every request from the same client. Is this correct? And does it mean a lot of wastage of server memory ( excessive memory allocation for each session object that is never going to be used again and excessive garbage collection)? One solution is to use in such scenario is to use client's IP address and user agent string to uniquely identify the user and store in database. Is this correct solution? Above scenario is fairly common in case of search engine bots which typically makes thousands of frequent requests when they visit the site. Any other thoughts on crafting proper solution for this problem for a Java based web application?
