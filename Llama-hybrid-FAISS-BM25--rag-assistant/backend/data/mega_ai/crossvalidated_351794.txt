3 outcomes: one ordinal regression or two logistic regressions?

Imagine, for example, I am fitting a model with the following data: Dependent variable: disease 0 = no disease (100 cases) 1 = mild disease (300 cases) 2 = advanced disease (100 cases) Explanatory variables: x1+x2+x3 Please correct me if I am wrong: the proportionals odds assumption maybe does not holds there. Anyway, I could do one ordinal regression or two logistic regressions (if I consider 0 = no disease, 1 = mild/advanced disease and 0 = no/mild disease, 1 = advanced disease). In a sense, you can put the cutoff somewhat arbitrarily: in this case, the advanced disease is "the more serious form" of the mild disease. Keep in mind that both approaches could be equally informative in the clinical sense of the term (and a logistic regression could be easier to understand). Which one is the overall best approach? One ordinal regression or two logistic regressions? (I use R)
