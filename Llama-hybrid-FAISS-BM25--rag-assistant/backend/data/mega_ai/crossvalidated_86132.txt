Is statistical significance calculated differently for a sub-set of responses than it would be for the total response set?

Please pardon my lack of terminology - not a stat person. Here's the background & 2 questions: If I have a survey sample set of 100 (within a total population of >10 million), then I believe that would give me a 9.8 confidence interval at 95% confidence level. That I understand. However, what I don't understand is how to figure out what the confidence interval/level (or in my layman's terms "statistical significance", correct?) would be of a specific answer within a specific question within that survey? To be more specific, 100 individuals answered the question "how many servers does your organization run?" and the 100 responses are broken down as follows: "1-10" - 23 responses "11-20" - 20 responses "21-30" - 16 responses "31-40" - 19 responses "41-50" - 13 responses "51+" - 9 responses Does the confidence level/interval change for EACH response option (ie "1-10" or "11-20") within that response set? And if so, do you figure it out the same way you would for the overall response total (100) - meaning, do you assume "23" is your sample set (rather than "100") for a population of >10 million? It just seems something is off here with my thinking. Help? And a follow-up question. If I needed to slice the survey data BASED on the responses to the above question, how many more responses would I need in order to get EACH response option (ie "1-10", "11-20") into something statistically significant given the total market population? Many thanks for your time.
