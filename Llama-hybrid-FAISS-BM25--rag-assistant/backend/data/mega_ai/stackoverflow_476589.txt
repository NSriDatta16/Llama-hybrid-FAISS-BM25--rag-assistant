How do I get from a type to the TryParse method?

My particular problem: I have a string which specifies an aribitrary type in a configuration class Config.numberType = "System.Foo"; where Foo is a type like Decimal or Double I use Type.GetType(Config.numberType) to return the corresponding type. How do I get from that type to being able to use, System.Foo.TryParse() ? Some further related queries TryParse() can be accessed from System.Foo.TryParse() as well as foo.TryParse() . Does this mean foo is some kind of class in C#? This seems weird to me that int , double etc are actually not just modifier keywords. How can you declare variables under these circumstances? - var is not universally usable it seems i.e. only in local scope etc.
