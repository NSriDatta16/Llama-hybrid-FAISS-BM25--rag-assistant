The salt is a site- or user-specific value. That means that in order to retrieve the passwords, an attacker must have both access to the database AND know the salt. In addition, the attacker could additionally generate a table once and then use it against multiple sites. However, with salts, attackers must generate one table per site or even once per user(making the attacks slower). Site-specific salts add very little to the security of a website. As said in comments, having a combination of site-specific and user-specific salts can significantly improve security over just a site-specific salt. A few years ago I asked here on stackoverflow a question about password storage which might be helpful to you. See Secure hash and salt for PHP passwords .
