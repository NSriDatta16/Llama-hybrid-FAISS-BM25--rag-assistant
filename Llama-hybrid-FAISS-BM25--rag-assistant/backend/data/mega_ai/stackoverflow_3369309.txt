uislider: knob as background, bar as foreground - like a sidewindow from a car?

if i want to have a custom slider, that looks quiet like a side-window from a car in its behaviour. so it has a graphical mask overlying. in the background the "window" may be dragged, so that the "glass" fills the whole mask - or in the other direction that the "glass" is not there anymore. is it possible as a modified slider or do i have to make a whole new element ?
