Object detection model using images which have single instance of class per image-can it detect multiple instances in a single image?

I tried to train Faster R-CNN to detect multiple instances of a single class (eg. pomegranate on a pomegranate tree) but the training data consisted of 200 images where each image had only one object labeled. The model is detecting an object but with very low probability. Is the model trying to find a single instance of the class but getting confused? model name: Faster RCNN inception v2 Why does the model detect objects more efficiently when zoomed in closer? Is there something wrong in the training process or something else?
