You cannot do that from Flex or, as far as I can tell, from any web application. A web app being able to go through the list of installed applications on client machine is bad from a privacy and security point of view. Maximum you can do is to read the user agent string from the HTTP headers (which can be easily modified and hence need not be accurate) to check what's the current browser being used to access your application. Even this, you can't do from Flex, you'll have to do it using some server script and send the information to the Flex app.
