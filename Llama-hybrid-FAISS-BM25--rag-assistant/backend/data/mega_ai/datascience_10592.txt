The entities W , U and V are shared by all steps of the RNN and these are the only parameters in the model described in the figure. Hence number of parameters to be learnt while training = $dim(W)+ dim(V)+ dim(U)$. Based on data in the question this = $ n^{2}+ kn + nm$. where, n - dimension of hidden layer k - dimension of output layer m - dimension of input layer
