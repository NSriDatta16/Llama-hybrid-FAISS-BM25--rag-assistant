You can pass paths to where the native libraries are located via the -Djava.library.path option if you are using JNI extensions, this may also work for your exec case. The other option is to launch the java app from a batch file and edit the PATH settings in the command interpreter "before" you launch the java app, the java app will inherit this PATH settings. NASA WorldWind uses native libraries and can be run as an Applet, here is a howto on setting this up with JNLPAppletLauncher . What this basically does is detect the OS, fetch appropriate native libraries, save them in a location in default jvm path and execute. Calling exec from a Java applet violates all sorts of sane security and sandboxing principles and I would really avoid it.
