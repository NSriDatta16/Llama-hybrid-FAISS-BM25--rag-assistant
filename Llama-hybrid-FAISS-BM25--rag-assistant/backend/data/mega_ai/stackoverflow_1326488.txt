"Pipelining" is something else; it means that the user agent sends additional requests on the same connection although the first one didn't complete yet (see http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#pipelining ). "Connection: close" doesn't seem to be relevant; that being said: is there a reason why you don't want the connection reused? With respect to your question: no, I don't think you can prevent clients from doing that. Did you try limiting the maximum number of open connections on your server?
