Is the variance of the mean of a set of independent random variables equal to the average of their respective variances?

I understand that, given a set of iid random variables, the variance of the sum is equal to the sum of the variance. Likewise, I know that the variance of the mean is equal to the variance over n. My question is: if the variances of the respective random variables are not the same, is the variance of the mean still an average of the variances?
