Note that the authors of Elements of Statistical Learning state that "Proximity plots for random forests often look very similar, irrespective of the data, which casts doubt on their utility. They tend to have a star shape, one arm per class, which is more pronounced the better the classification performance." (p 595) However, I think these authors don't mention the ways that random forests deal with missing data so much (even though they mention missing data with trees earlier in the book); perhaps the authors just did not highlight this aspect of RFs as much, which makes sense considering the book is enormous and has a lot of information on a lot of machine learning topics/techniques. However, I don't think that having the plots give similar shapes for any RF and data set means anything negative about RFs in general. For instance, linear regression basically always looks the same, but it's worthwhile to know what points lie close to the line and which seems to be outliers from the perspective of linear regression. So...their comment about the utility of proximity plots doesn't make sense to me.
