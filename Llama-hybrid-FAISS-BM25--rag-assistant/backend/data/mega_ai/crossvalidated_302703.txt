Error of weigted average of elements with errors

I have a set of data with errorbars ($x_i, \sigma_i$), and I need to compute a weigted average and the error. I used the formulas from https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Leo/Stats4_5.html For the weigted average : $$ \mu = \frac{\Sigma x_i \sigma_i^{-2}}{\Sigma \sigma_i^{-2}}$$ But for the error : $$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\Sigma \sigma_i^{-2}}}$$ (56) The problem is that the value of the mean error because is not taking in account the scattering of the points, which is bigger than errorbars. Is there a formula that takes in account both errorbars of individual points and scattering between them ?
