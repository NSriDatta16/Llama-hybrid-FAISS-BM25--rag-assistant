In order to pull the session data back from your database a key is needed. This is called the Session ID. The session ID needs to be stored somewhere. Either as part of the URL string that the client posts back or, more commonly, in a cookie on the client. When the request is posted, session reads the value from the cookie and knows which record to pull back from session storage. This happens automatically. The only reason to use session is if the data you want to keep is greater than 4KB (browser limitations); or if the time required to pull the data from your server is greater than reading it from session storage. If the amount of data you are storing is less than 4KB I would highly recommend you just set that in the cookie to begin with. I generally store things like the user id, user first name, and a couple other attributes. Bear in mind that it is trivial to inspect a cookies value, so this information should be encrypted prior to going to the client. Another thing is if the query time to pull the data you need from the original source is small, then elect to do that instead of placing it in session. That way you only get it when you actually need it instead of with every single page load.
