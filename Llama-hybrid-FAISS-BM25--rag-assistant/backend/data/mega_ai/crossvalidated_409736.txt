In a nested design, it is the combinations of the levels of the factors that is important. y ~ 1 + (1|A/B/C) expands to y ~ 1 + (1|A) + (1|A:B) + (1|A:B:C) So, you need to apply the rule of thumb to the levels of A , the levels of the interaction A:B and the levels of the interaction A:B:C . In the example you give, A has 4 levels, A:B has 12 levels and A:B:C has 72 levels. It is debatable whether 4 levels is sufficient, and at the end of the day, pragmatism is probably the best approach: Does the data support that random structure? That is, does the model converge and is it non-singular ? Are the random effects plausibly normally distributed ? Does the model fit adequately ?
