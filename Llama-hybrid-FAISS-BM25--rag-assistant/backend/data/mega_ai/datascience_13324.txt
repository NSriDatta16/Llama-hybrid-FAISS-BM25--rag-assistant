What are the 'hottest' future areas of Machine Learning and Data Science?

What would you guys identify as the most important areas of machine learning and data science in the future? What kind of business do you see companies focused on ML doing in the future? To give some background to the question, I'm asking this as someone hugely interested in ML at a conceptual level but with no real experience on it save for some online courses. My intention is to learn the necessary math, coding, etc. and as I'm very entrepreneurial person, eventually found my own ML company. I've found that the field is vast and thus I feel one of the biggest challenges is to select a specific area (I guess method would be a better word here) to focus on and build expertise.
