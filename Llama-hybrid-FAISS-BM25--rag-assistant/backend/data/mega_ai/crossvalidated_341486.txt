I can't reproduce your chi-square result. This is what I get in Stata: observed frequency expected frequency ---------------------------------- | which count | A B C ----------+----------------------- 0 | 5 0 5 | 1.467 5.600 2.933 | 1 | 1 25 9 | 5.133 19.600 10.267 | 2 | 9 30 10 | 7.187 27.440 14.373 | 3 | 3 15 8 | 3.813 14.560 7.627 | 4 | 4 13 9 | 3.813 14.560 7.627 | 5 | 4 13 5 | 3.227 12.320 6.453 | 6 | 1 6 8 | 2.200 8.400 4.400 | 7 | 2 4 6 | 1.760 6.720 3.520 | 8 | 0 10 1 | 1.613 6.160 3.227 | 9 | 4 5 2 | 1.613 6.160 3.227 | 10 | 0 5 3 | 1.173 4.480 2.347 ---------------------------------- 16 cells with expected frequency We can note: Strong rejection of lack of association. Plainly put, the groups really are different. Caveat: several small expected frequencies. Caveat: The chi-square test pays no attention to the ordering 0 ... 10 or what those values are. They are just 11 categories. The distributions do look different. I can't comment helpfully on the idea of focusing on 0 and 1. I am not a routine user of R and haven't looked at prop.test , but note that it is best to phrase questions in terms of statistical issues, not the software you happen to be using.
