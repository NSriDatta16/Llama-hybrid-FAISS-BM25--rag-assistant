I have used the classic old ADO.NET for many years, and you just get used to it. For a larger application, you can invest some time in creating a data layer once, then re-use it with many other business objects. A couple of other options: Strongly Typed datasets. You can create a strongly typed dataset that will allow you to drag and drop database objects and will generate a lot of the plumbing code for you. 2 linq To Sql designer, which also allows you to drag and drop objects into a designer, and generates a dbml file that you use to connect and manipulate your data. I have recently gotten onto the Linq bandwagon and it does simplify your life when treating data as objects. Good luck!
