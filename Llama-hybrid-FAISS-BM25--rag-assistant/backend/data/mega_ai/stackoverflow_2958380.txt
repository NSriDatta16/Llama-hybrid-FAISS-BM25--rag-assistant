[Usual disclaimer - I work for a COBOL vendor] It's an interesting question and it's always difficult to get a provable number. On the number of COBOL programmers estimates - the 2 - 3 million number may not be orders of magnitude in error. I think there have been estimates of 1 or 2 million in the past. And each one of those can generate a lot of code in a 20 year career. In India tens of thousands of new COBOL programmers are added to the pool every year (perhaps every month!). I think the automatically generated code is probably bigger than might be thought. For example PACBASE is a very popular application in the banking industry. A very large global bank I know of uses it extensively and they generate all their code into COBOL and estimate this generated code is 95% of their total code base with the other 5% being hand coded/maintained. I don't think this is uncommon. The maintenance and development of those systems is typically done at the model-level not the generated code as you say. There is a group of applications that were missing from the original question - COBOL isn't only a mainframe language. The early years of Micro Focus were almost entirely spent in the OEM marketplace - we used to have something like 200 different OEMs (lots of long-gone names like DEC, Stratus, Bull, ...). Every OEM had to have a COBOL compiler on their box alongside C and Assembler. A lot of big applications were built at that time and are still going strong - think about the largest HR ERP systems, the largest mobile phone billing systems etc. My point is that there is a lot of COBOL code that was never on an IBM mainframe and is often overlooked. And finally, the size of the code base may be larger in COBOL shops than the "average". That's not just because COBOL is verbose (or was - that's not been the case for a long time) but the systems are just bigger - they're in large organizations, doing a large number of disparate tasks. It's very common for sites to have 10's of millions of LoC.
