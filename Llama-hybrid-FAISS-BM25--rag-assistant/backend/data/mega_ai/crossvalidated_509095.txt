I would use a binomial generalised linear model, for which the data are perhaps more easily presented as something like +----------------------------+ | which adults total | |----------------------------| | Control 82 90 | | Control 80 95 | | Control 90 118 | | Control 102 110 | | Control 76 98 | | Treatment 26 82 | | Treatment 30 90 | | Treatment 11 76 | | Treatment 41 101 | | Treatment 12 99 | +----------------------------+ In Stata, that could be glm adults i.which, f(binomial total) on the understanding that which has integer values underneath its text labels. The implied link is logit, so this could also be described as logistic regression. The logit model converges on the sample proportions of survival of about 0.842 and 0.268 for control and treatment, with suitably overwhelming figures of merit. I am confident that any decent statistical software should support this standard model, although that is a definition of decent .
