It depends on your motivations. If you're going to sell yourself as an ASP.NET developer, you will need both. If this is just for your own pleasure, then go to MVC. My personal feeling is that webforms will be around for quite a few years more. So many people have time and energy invested in them. However, I think people will slowly (or maybe not so slowly!) migrate. Webforms was always just a way to get drag-and-drop VB4 morts to think about web development. It kindof worked but it does take away alot of control.
