Although this doesn't guarantee your code is 100% correct (hehe), yes, this can be due to a neural network phenomenon. If your initialization is poor (or even if it was good) and your learning rate is too high, then you might skip the optimal point you are looking for, and because of the high learning rate, you might never turn back to it. this figure (from here ) summarizes it very nicely: (the red circle at the bottom left is your starting point, the x axis is your parameter space and the y axis is the error.)
