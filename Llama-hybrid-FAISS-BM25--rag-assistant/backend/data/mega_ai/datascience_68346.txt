Online courses for Anomaly Detection

As the title say I have been looking for some online courses that would teach me about anomaly detection using Unsupervised Machine Learning. I want to focus only on Scikit-Learn and not go deeper into TensorFlow or other options. I have been looking at some Udemy courses but not really sure. Decided to write here since the community here has a lot of knowledge and might lead me into the right path. I am willing to pay for any course as long as it fulfills what I am looking for.
