Why is spectral analysis based on autocovariance function instead of in the original sequence?

I have some questions about the spectral analysis in time series. For a zero-mean and covariance stationary time series $\{X_t\}$ with autocovariance function $\gamma(h)=Cov(X_{t+h},X_t)$ . The $\textbf{spectral density}$ is defined to be the Discrete-time Fourier transform of $\gamma(h)$ $$f(\lambda)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{h=-\infty}^\infty \gamma(h)e^{-ih\lambda}, -\infty Then many studies or research are based on this spectral density formula. However, I am still confused about some conceptual problems. First question: The autocovariance function can not represent a unique time series. Why do we use Fourier transform in the autocovariance function instead of the original time series? Wouldn't it be more straightforward and convenient to analyze the original sequence? Second question: The original sequence can be transferred to the frequency domain by FFT. Then we do denoising, forecasting, or find seasonal cycles. Can these methods using in spectral density and eventually achieve the same effect as using FFT in the original sequence? If not, what can we do in spectral density?
