Your login doesn't work, but I see you are using jquery for your site. Here's a little z-index fix-all script for you: // Fix IE indexing bug if(navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE \d\.\d+/)) { var zIndexNumber = 1000; $('div').each(function(){ $(this).css('zIndex', zIndexNumber); zIndexNumber -= 10; }); } As you can see, it goes through each div and assigns a z-index do it. This makes you able to explicitly set a z-index to items so that you can be sure they will overlap in an expected way. Hope this helps.
