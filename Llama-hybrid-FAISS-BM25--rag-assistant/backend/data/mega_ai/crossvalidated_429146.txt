Why do CNNs work on regression problems such as finding bounding boxes in images?

My understanding is that each layer in a CNN computers specific features, depending on the type of filter that has been trained, like edges/nodes/patterns etc. I can understand how this can be used in classification problems, but how is this information used when predicting bounding boxes around images. I've come across multiple tutorials online, where the process of adding bounding box locations to the output layers, and loss function are discussed, but none explained why this approach works. Are there any resources that could help explain this?
