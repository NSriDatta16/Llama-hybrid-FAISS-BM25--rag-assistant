I was suggested a solution that complete the answer. It allows to organize completion output of autocompletion options. For linux readline there are function readline.set_completion_display_matches_hook http://docs.python.org/library/readline.html?highlight=readline#readline.set_completion_display_matches_hook So, for the example listed above this code def print_suggestions(self, substitution, matches, longest_match_length) : print "useless text to be displayed" print substitution print " ".join[match for match in matches] print longest_match_length readline.set_completion_display_matches_hook(print_suggestions) this will produse: > mk useless text to be displayed mk mkdir mktbl 5 > mk For windows readline there is an answer at stack overflow: How do I make IPython organize tab completion possibilities by class? Don't know how it works for mac.
