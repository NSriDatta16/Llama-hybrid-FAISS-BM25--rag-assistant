I don't see clearly behind the lines but it seems to me that there are too much data points. Since you want to show the regional homogeneity and not exactly stations, I'd suggest you firstly to group them spatially. For example, overlay by a "fishnet" and compute average measured value in every cell (at every time moment). If you place these average values in the cell centers this way you rasterize the data (or you can compute also mean latitude and longitude in every cell if you don't want overlaying lines). Or to average inside administrative units, whatever. Then for these new averaged "stations" you can calculate correlations and plot a map with smaller number of lines. This can also remove those random single high-correlation lines going through all area.
