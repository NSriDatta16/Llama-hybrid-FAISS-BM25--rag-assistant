Compare Two Logistic Regression Models

I have worked out two models to fit the data (blue) - the first (in green) is the baseline model with the intercept only. The second (red) is the model with the intercept and 2 parameters. Obviously, the second describes the data much better. However, I have got insignificant Likelihood Ratio test. As far as I can see, LH functions are indeed not very different for the given data points. What's going on here?
