Dynamic JNLP Generation and invocation from Excel

I have an application which is invoked via Java Webstart. Opening it via the Webstart link works without any issue. I also have an application based on Excel that generates files (via vba) which can then be opened by the program that starts via Webstart. What I would like to do is have a button that invokes the Webstart application and then opens a newly generated file. The files name (and contents) are time sensitive and so I can't use the same file name over and over. I've pretty much figured out how to use vba to invoke the application via Webstart but the problem is that for the Webstart app to be able to open a file it needs to be passed in as an argument in the jnlp descriptor -file C:\files\file_20100909_164834.csv How do you go about passing through the filename into the JNLP file when the filename will always be different? Should I be looking at dynamically generating a new jnlp file each time, or is there a way to parameterize the jnlp file and pass through the filename when invoking the JNLP?
