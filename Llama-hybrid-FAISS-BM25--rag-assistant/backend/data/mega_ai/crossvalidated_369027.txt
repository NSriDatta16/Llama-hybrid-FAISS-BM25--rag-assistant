Logistic regression can very well model 'curvilinear' relationships, just as linear regression can. You need to add extra terms, functions of x to allow the model to account for that. The most common way is to add a sequence of polynomial terms (i.e., $x^2$ , $x^3$ , $x^4$ , etc.). You can also use other nonlinear transformations of $x$ (e.g., $\log(x)$ ). A more sophisticated approach is to use spline functions. There is an example of using logistic regression this way in my answer here: How to use boxplots to find the point where values are more likely to come from different conditions?
