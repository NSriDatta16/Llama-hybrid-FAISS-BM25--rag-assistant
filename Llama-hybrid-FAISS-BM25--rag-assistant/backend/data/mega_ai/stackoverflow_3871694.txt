How to organize unit tests for a complex class?

I have a complex class (300+ lines), which I'm trying to test from different "points of view". I've already created three different unit tests. Every test is a complex class itself (100+ lines). The question is -- what is the best place to store them, in project directory tree? This is how I'm doing it now (Maven is used): pom.xml /src /main /java /com /Foo ComplexClass.java /test /java /com /Foo /ComplexClass FirstPointOfViewTest.java SecondPointOfViewTest.java ThirdPointOfViewTest.java Of course, the names are just placeholders, used in order to explain the problem/question. What do you think about this approach?
