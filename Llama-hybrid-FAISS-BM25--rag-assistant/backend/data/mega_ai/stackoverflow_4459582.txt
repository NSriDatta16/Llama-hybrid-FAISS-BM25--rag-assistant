How to deallocate objects in NSMutableArray?

i have this Mutable Array: NSMutableArray *points = [pgroute getPoints:self]; where [getPoint...] do this: { NSMutableArray *normPoints = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; [normPoints addObject:@""]; [...] return normPoints; } now, points is an array of objects, right? is correct to release *points array in this way? for (int i = 0; i or it is another correct way? Xcode compiler, with RUN_CLANG_STATIC_ANALYZER tell me there is an Incorrect decrement of the reference count of an object that is not owned at this point by the caller How can i resolve this? thanks, alberto.
