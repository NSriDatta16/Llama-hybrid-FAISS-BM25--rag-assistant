If it helps, this is sort of how I built my talking teddy bear, which is an AI driven twitter engine of sorts (but its a physical bear). The next step is of course, don't forget combinations of features being accelerators. There is a really interesting example on Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning gallery for this doing a clustering of similiar companies which provides a great starting point. Basically it does is feature hashes each companies wikipedia page into n-grams rolls up counts and fits them into various clusters. Works pretty darned well, I am using that strategy for identifing similiar companies for a financial application to diversify portfolios. Advise: Start simple, if its not accurate enough, do more. If its accurate enough for the ROI, then stop, ship and start the next thing.
