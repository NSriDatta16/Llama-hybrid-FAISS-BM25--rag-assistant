In ordinary kriging, the unknown $\mu$ is updated in each prediction for new location as the control data points is added with every and the newly simulated value. Because the $\mu$ is dependent of location $s$ , we don't need to fragment the predictor into the model plus residual $\mu + \delta(s)$ . The simulated value at $s_0$ will simply follow $\sum^n_{i=1}\lambda_iZ(s_i)\pm t\sigma_k(s_0)$ . Generally, the model could be a polynomial which depends on location. In that case of universal kriging, the predictor should be fragmented into the deterministic part (based on location) and the interpolated residual, so the simulated value at $s_0$ will be as follows : $\sum^{p+1}_{j=1}f_{j-1}(s_0)\beta_{j-1}+\sum^n_{i=1}\lambda_i(Z(s_i)-\sum^{p+1}_{j=1}f_{j-1}(s_i)\beta_{j-1})\pm t\sigma_k(s_0)$ In simple kriging, we regress the mean first only using the sample data, the mean will remain constant along the prediction for the entire domain. The simulated value at $s_0$ will follow $\mu+\sum^n_{i=1}\lambda_i(Z(s_i)-\mu)\pm t\sigma_k(s_0)$ .
