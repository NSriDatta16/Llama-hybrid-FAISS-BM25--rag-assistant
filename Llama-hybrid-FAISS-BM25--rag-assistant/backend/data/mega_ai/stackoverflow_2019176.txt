From the Lotus Notes Designer version 8 online help: When you view a list of agents in the Work pane, an icon may appear next to the name of a scheduled agent. The icons are: Check mark with a 6 next to it - the scheduled agent is enabled and runs only on IBM® Lotus® Domino(TM) 6 or later (or on Lotus Notes/Domino R5.08 or later). Check mark with a 5 next to it - the scheduled agent is disabled for Lotus Domino release 5.08 or later, but will be considered enabled on Lotus Notes Domino R5.07 or earlier which does not recognize this functionality. Check mark - the scheduled agent is enabled and runs on any version of IBM® Lotus® Notes®. A yellow X - the scheduled agent is disabled. So I'm thinking that, in the transition from Notes 7 to 8 (and that was a big one since it was basically a rewrite of Notes on top of Eclipse), extra flags were introduced that Notes 7 picks up as the R508+ icon but which is, in reality, a "disabled" flag in Notes 8. This would be similar to their description of R507 not recognising the R508+ flag and considering it enabled. If you really want to know, ask here where the actual developers hang out (they may well keep an eye on StackOverflow but I know that IBM software developers have to monitor the IBM-run forums from personal experience).
