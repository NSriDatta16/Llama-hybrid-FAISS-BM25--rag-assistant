Wordpress theme css file

According the Wordpress' doc, when we create theme, we need to create style.css file in the same place with other files like header.php, footer.php, however, to make a better organization of files, I put all css files in a sub folder. Then there comes the problem, when I go to the admin area, Appearance -> Editor, I can not see the sub folder so can not edit those css file in the sub folder. Please help, thanks.
