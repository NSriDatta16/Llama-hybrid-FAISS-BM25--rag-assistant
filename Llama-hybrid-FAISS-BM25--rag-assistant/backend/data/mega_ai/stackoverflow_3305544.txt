In the current implementation the public identifier is not used when resolving an external identifier. Your option is to use the exception as a catch and then string validate the public id (however, this solution is not elegant and is cludgy). Though, it would work.... Of course (this would also require that you know the public id or at least a portion of the string), so that you could use the getEntity(). I searched online for a reference that identifies this: http://bytes.com/topic/net/answers/172597-xmlresolver-parameter-entity-problem Hopefully, this helps.
