It might make sense to split it up if you expect to rename or rearrange your categories later: if you leave it as it is, you will have to do that rename/reorganize step (changing the category/sub-category/sub-sub-category/sub-sub-sub-category fields) for every row in this table that contains that (((sub)sub)sub)category. that results in a more complex query, and if you have very many rows in this keyword table, it might be a performance issue (=take a while for the database to do); on the other hand, queries (reading) will be as fast as possible. if you split it up, then updating (((sub)sub)sub)category will only to be done to less rows, but query (read) will take longer because it has to work with two (or more) tables. Weigh the cons and pros of both and then make a decision.m
