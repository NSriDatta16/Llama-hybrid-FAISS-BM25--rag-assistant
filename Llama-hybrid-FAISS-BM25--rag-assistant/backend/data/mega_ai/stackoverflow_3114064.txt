With some exceptions for OS4 every app (identified by it's BI) has it's own isolated storage on the phone. If you really have to change this (will also disable free updates for buyers of the "old version") you have to find an external migration way. A lot of apps offer some kind of "backup" (on a PC / MAC or something else). What we did for a customer was to establish a website which allows "short time data storage". So that the old app could upload the data - and the new one loads it down. Of course this means updating your old app first for the "export". But the idea "your app lives in it's own isolated world" also means that you have no access to the data of other apps. From the point of security this is imporant and good. For building "app suites" where the apps want to share data it's bad. But apples made enhancments for this in OS4 - which (I guess) won't help you in your case, since "sharing apps" must also be special designed.
