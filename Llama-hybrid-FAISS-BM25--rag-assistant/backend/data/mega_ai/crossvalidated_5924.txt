Principal Components Analysis of local data is a good point of departure. We have to take some care, though, to distinguish local (intrinsic) from global (extrinsic) dimension. In the example of points on a circle, the local dimension is 1, but overall the points within the circle lie in a 2D space. To apply PCA to this, the trick is to localize : select one data point and extract only those that are close to it. Apply PCA to this subset. The number of large eigenvalues will suggest the intrinsic dimension. Repeating this at other data points will indicate whether the data exhibit a constant intrinsic dimension throughout. If so, each of the PCA results provides a partial atlas of the manifold.
