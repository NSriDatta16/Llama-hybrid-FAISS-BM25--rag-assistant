It doesn't really matter how you organize a 3d array as long as you put things in the same way as you take them out. From your comment on another answer it seems that you are having problem with element order ( [currentLevel][x][y] = childArray[y][x]; ) It seems you mixed MAP_HEIGHT and MAP_WIDTH. It should be: masterLevel = new int[MAX_LEVELS][MAP_HEIGHT][MAP_WIDTH]; then you can use: master[currentLevel][x][y] = childArray[x][y];
