How does upsampling rare events affect the interpretation of logistic regression?

The answer to this question can be found here Does down-sampling change logistic regression coefficients? I have a dataset of 50k positives and nearly 1M negatives. Instead of taking a random sample to build a logistic regression I take all 50k positives and randomly sample 50k negatives. How should I interpret the logistic regression coefficients of the upsampled version since that sample is not actually representative of my original population? Here is a toy example where the sampling will generate two different regression coefficients beta = rnorm(5) X = matrix(rnorm(10000*5), nrow = 10000) y = X%*%beta + rnorm(10000) label = ifelse(y > 3, 1, 0) X.pos = X[label == 1,] X.neg = X[label == 0,][1:sum(label),] summary(glm(c(label[label == 1], label[label == 0][1:sum(label)]) ~ ., data = as.data.frame(rbind(X.pos, X.neg)), family = binomial())) Call: glm(formula = c(label[label == 1], label[label == 0][1:sum(label)]) ~ ., family = binomial(), data = as.data.frame(rbind(X.pos, X.neg))) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.10121 -0.22644 0.00143 0.33291 3.01340 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
