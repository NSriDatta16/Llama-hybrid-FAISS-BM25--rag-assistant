deep copy Linkedlist without destroying original list and extra storage space (using ANSI C)

this linkedlist is different than normal linkedlists is that besides the next pointer, it also has a other pointer that points to another node except itself in the linkedlist. so what's the best way to deep copy this linkedlist without destroying the original and no extra space? My approach was simply doing a O(n^2) loop , but should be some smarter way.
