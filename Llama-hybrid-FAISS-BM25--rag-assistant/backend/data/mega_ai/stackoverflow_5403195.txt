Video is less intensive, as the video player in flash is decoupled from the fps of the SWF itself. That is to say that you can run a video player at 30fps, while the SWF runs at 1fps. You can also take advantage of the gpu through the StageVideo api which means your cpu usage is greatly diminished. Thibault Imbert over at http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/stage_video.html has a good explanation of this.
