From what you are describing, there is an independent variable (month, you can extract this information from order date) and the response variable which is the probability of purchasing a product of a particular category. You can use a simple Bayesian (Naive) algorithm for fitting a model and making a prediction for a specified month. You can not do much more than this. But if you have available historical data for specific customer then you can build a recommendation system trying to make a profile for each customer and predict what is most probable to buy in a particular month.
