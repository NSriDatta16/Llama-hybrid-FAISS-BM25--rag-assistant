What elegant solution exists for this pattern? Multi-Level Searching

Assume that we have multiple arrays of integers. You can consider each array as a level. We try to find a sequence of elements, exactly one element from each array, and proceed to the next array with the same predicate. For example, we have v1, v2, v3 as the arrays: v1 | v2 | v3 ----------------- 1 | 4 | 16 2 | 5 | 81 3 | 16 | 100 4 | 64 | 121 I could say that the predicate is: next_element == previous_element^2 A valid sequence from the above example is: 2 -> 4 -> 16 Actually, in this example there isn't another valid sequence. I could write three loops to brute-force the mentioned example, but what if the number of arrays is variable , but with know order of course, how would you solve this problem? Hints, or references to design patters are very appreciated. I shall do it in C++, but I just need the idea. Thanks,
