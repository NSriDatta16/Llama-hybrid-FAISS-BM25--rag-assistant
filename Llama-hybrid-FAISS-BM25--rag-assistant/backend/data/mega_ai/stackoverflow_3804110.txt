You need to properly normalize the DB. IMHO - I'd not use a relationship in the positions table. Here is what I'd do Tables Employee Software EmployeeSoftware Position The "POSITIONS" table in your case, i assume, is your roles. Note the DB should be used as storage and very minimal business logic should be placed there. That being said, ...let me continue There will be a relationship between Employee and EmployeeSoftware (empid present as foreign key in EmployeeSoftware. The same for Software and EmployeeSoftware (softid present as foreign key in the EmployeeSoftware. The application first checks if a person is in a proper position (POSITIONS) table before inserting a record. For an additional DB check you can add a check contraint on the EmployeeSoftware to check the POSITIONS DB before...there then need to be a Relationship between Software and Positions.
