What are the assumptions of a mixed effects logistic regression model?

I have generated a mixed effects logistic regression in R using the lme4::glmer() function. I've tested for overdispersion (using blmeco::dispersion_glmer() ) and the estimates do not appear to be overdispersed, but what are the other assumptions that are made when using this type of model that I should test - does anyone know of a comprehensive list somewhere, especially in a format that I could cite in a scientific PhD thesis?
