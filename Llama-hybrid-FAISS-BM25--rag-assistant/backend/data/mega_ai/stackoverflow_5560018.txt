As robertc said, there are no css animations in Firefox yet, only transitions. If your animation is just a shaking box like you have in your css, you would achieve it easily chaining the transitions with a little bit of javascript... Your css: #yourdiv { -moz-transition: all 200ms ease; } Your Javascript: //onload body var element = document.getElementById("yourdiv"); element.style.MozTransform = "rotate(2deg)"; element.addEventListener("transitionend", function(){ var rotate = (element.style.MozTransform == "rotate(2deg)") ? "rotate(-2deg)" : "rotate(2deg)"; element.style.MozTransform = rotate; }, false); I haven't actually tested it in Firefox, but here's a working version for webkit: http://jsfiddle.net/J6SMb/
