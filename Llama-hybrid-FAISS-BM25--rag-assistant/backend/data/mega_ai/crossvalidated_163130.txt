In your case I would start with some feature engineering. As mentioned by @user777, start with creating a new variable that indicates whether or not a customer has kids. Then I would look into more details, maybe an indicator with the number of kids. If you have the age of the kids, look into creating age range buckets, or check if a polynomial of age has any relevance.
