Rails Paperclip 'class methods' and validations refactor?

I've been breaking the DRY principle a bit in a project built with Paperclip for media storage. I've added assets to certain models, such as AlbumPhotoFile, AlbumSoundFile and so on, using the following code : # Asset is a regular "foo", :path => "bar" validates_attachment_presence :pic, :message => "can't be blank" validates_attachment_content_type :pic, :content_type => ["foo", "bar"] end Scaling to some more requirements, I had to attach photos to other models, say CityPhotoFile. I want to keep the validations and has_attached_file fu the same as in other PhotoFile-type models. I have just copy-pasted the code from a PhotoFile model to the other, is there a better method for that ? There aren't any Paperclip-related errors, the storage and display works fine, I just wanted to know if this type of operation can be put in a module or something like that, for DRY's sake. Just bouncing off the code is really getting ugly. I can provide more details if I haven't made my intentions clear in this space :-). Thank you in advance !
