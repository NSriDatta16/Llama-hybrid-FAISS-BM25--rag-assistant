What is the largest public wearable accelerometer dataset?

I'm looking for public datasets of people wearing a device with an accelerometer (and potentially other sensors eg gyroscope or magnetometer). What are some of the largest available datasets like that? This has obvious applications to machine learning: a good dataset will help develop good models for activity recognition and event detection from sensor data, same as the effect ImageNet / COCO / YFCC100m datasets have had in the visual field. Sadly, I think the very large datasets in this field are all private. For my purposes, I don't care what people are doing; a totally random sample of activity is okay (but a broader sample is better than a specific sample). I also don't care where the device is (wrist, pocket etc) or whether it is a smartphone or some other device (watch, actigraph, IMU etc). Finally, I don't care if the data is labelled / annotated. I do however want the largest possible size: as many different people as possible, and as many total hours of recording as possible. What I've found so far... A few collections of datasets: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03502.pdf and http://mobilize.stanford.edu/data-sources/ Some specific datasets: UK Biobank has recordings from 100k people x 24 hours each. I believe these are actigraph (1-minute resolution) not raw accelerometer data (can anyone confirm?). It is also not open. NHANES 2003 7k people x 7 days each. Definitely actigraph, no raw accelerometer data. LTMM 71 people x 72 hours each PAMAP2 9 people x ~1 hour each MHEALTH 10 people x ~15 minutes each UCI-Smartphone
