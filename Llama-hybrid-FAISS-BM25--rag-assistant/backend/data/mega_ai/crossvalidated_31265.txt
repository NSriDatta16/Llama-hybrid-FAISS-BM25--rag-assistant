Do you really need the maximum likelihood estimate? Can you get away with the Bayesian estimator of the intensity of the Poisson process? For $k$ observed events in a period of length $T$, the likelihood over the intensity is gamma-distributed with shape $k$ and rate $T$. This is correct even if $k$ is one or zero (although you might want to introduce a gamma-distributed prior).
