How should non autocorrelated time series data be modelled?

I'm working on time series predictions for predicting the frequency of 911 calls in a town, based on previous data. But it would seem to me that this time series data isn't autocorrelated. The number of calls at time $t$ , $y_t$ , doesn't depend on the previous time points $y_{t-1}, ..., y_{t-k}$ , it seems to depend only on the current timestep, $X_t$ . Should this problem then be modelled as a time series problem, using models like ARIMA, or as a simple regression problem $\hat{y}_t = \hat{f}(X_t)$ ? Even if you think this data has some degree of autocorrelation, let me ask a more general question: if a time series dataset has low autocorrelation, what kind of models should I use for it?
