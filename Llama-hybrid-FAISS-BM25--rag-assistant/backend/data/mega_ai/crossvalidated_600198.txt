What does the $t|y(x, \mathbf{w})$ in ${\cal N}(t|y(x, \mathbf{w}), \beta^{-1}) $ mean?

I'm starting to work through Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" book, and have run into unfamiliar statistics notation. In Eq. 160, Bishop writes the PDF for a quantity $t$ as $$p(t|x, \mathbf{w}, \beta) = {\cal N}(t|y(x, \mathbf{w}), \beta^{-1}) \tag{1.60}$$ where $y(x, \mathbf{w})$ is some known function. Normally I'd expect this to be written as $$p(t|x, \mathbf{w}, \beta) \sim {\cal N}(y(x, \mathbf{w}), \beta^{-1}) .$$ How should I interpret the $t|y(x, \mathbf{w})$ bit? (Cross-posted from datascience.stackexchange.com; I figured it may be a better question for here.)
