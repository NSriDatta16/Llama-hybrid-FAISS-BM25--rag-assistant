If I understand your question, then you want to know how to model a categorical dependent variable with a continuous independent variable. In the case of a bivariate outcome, you use logistic regression . If you have more than two categories, you can consider multinomial regression . If your data is count data, then you would want to look at Poisson regression . These are all types of General Linear Model (GLM), and will give you confidence intervals and pvalues. Pretty much any statistical package should be able perform these for you. They are all very simple to do in R.
