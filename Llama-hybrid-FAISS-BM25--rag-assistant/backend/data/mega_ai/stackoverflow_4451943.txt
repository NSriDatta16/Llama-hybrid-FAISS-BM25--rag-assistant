Can't move top.links (topLinks) block in Magento

I'm trying my very best to edit the Magento design the way they want you to (using a local.xml rather than editing the page.xml) but this system is so horrible and convoluted, it's proving to be seriously tricky to do so. The problem I have now is that I can't seem to move the "top.links" block into another block in the header. At the moment in page.xml this block is within the header block. I've tried absolutely everything in my local.xml to get this to work, I've tried the following edits. Remove top.links from header, add inside "Hud" block. Note that the links should be inside the brown box (this is the HUD block). NOT removing the top.links block from header but adding to Hud block Created new Links template based on code of top.links, and referred to this in the HUD's block as follows. Below is hud.phtml Welcome getChildHtml('hudLinks') ?> getChildHtml('top.search') ?> This brings the most interesting results. I can see the template is found but nothing appears. I really am clueless with this. Am I doing something completely wrong here? For what it's worth, here is the code I'm using for hudLinks.phtml and the top.links template. getLinks(); ?> 0): ?> getName()): ?> id=" getName() ?>" > getIsFirst()||$_link->getIsLast()): ?> class=" getIsFirst()): ?>first getIsLast()): ?> last " getLiParams() ?>> getBeforeText() ?> getUrl() ?>" title=" getTitle() ?>" getAParams() ?>> getLabel() ?> getAfterText() ?>
