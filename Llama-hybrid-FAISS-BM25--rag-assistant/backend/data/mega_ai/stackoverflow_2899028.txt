In WPF using a ListView is there an elegant way to auto resize items?

I recently wrote, my first, WPF application that has a list of items that are polled from a web-serivce. The items are displayed/data-bound in a ListView via a GridView. A background thread periodically polls the web-serivce and updates the list. If, say, I had three items initially bound to the ListView that simply display a description and the three descriptions where something like: - ProjectA - ProjectB - ProjectC Later a new item is added with a description of 'AReallyReallyLongProjectName', I would end up with a list like: - ProjectA - ProjectB - ProjectC - AReallyR The GridViewColumn would not update it's width and would subsequently cut off any new items that extended the original width. I added this bit of code which forces the column to resize, but it just seems a little hacky. (Just seems weird to set a width just to set it back to nothing to force the resize) if(gridView != null) { foreach(var column in gridView.Columns) { if (double.IsNaN(column.Width) column.Width = column.ActualWidth; column.Width = double.NaN; } } Is there a better, more elegant solution, to accomplish this same thing?
