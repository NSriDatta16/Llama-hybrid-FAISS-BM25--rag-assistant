Difference between SEM AND ols+pca

Can someone explain me the difference between these approaches, if you want i can provide the results, but since they are quite extensive, i could attach on demand. I'm working with the Theory of Planned Behavior, lets say a1,a2,a3,a4 are for construct A s1,s2,s3,s4 are for construct S p1,p2,p3,p4 are for construct P Then my model has two regressions: Int ~A + S + P Beh ~ P + Int So far, so good... i can run this and perform some evaluations, but then i was wondering using pca to reduce my a1,a2,...s1....p4, and extract 3 factors. Lets call these, A_x, S_x and P_X Then I could run a sem Int ~A_x + S _x + P _x Beh ~ P _x + Int --> for some reason this model adjust better than the one before. Finally, i run 2 regressions (with low explanatory power 20%-40%) Int ~A_x + S _x + P _x Beh ~ P _x + Int Besides validation of TPB, I'm interested on extracting coefficients so that i can use them in a simulation (agent-based model) to recreate the behavior. Please if someone has been working with this issues or has faced similar questions, any pointer will be very very useful!
