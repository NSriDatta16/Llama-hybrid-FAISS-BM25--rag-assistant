c# LINQ Query: average value after group

Say I have a datatable with a number of columns. I want to group the date column and for each date, I want to work out the average value of the result column. I have the following code which is not working as expected: var results = from res in dt.AsEnumerable() group res by res.Field ("operation_time") into grp orderby grp.Key select new { date = grp.Key, sum = grp.Average(r => r.Field ("result")) }; Could somebody advise how I can do this?
