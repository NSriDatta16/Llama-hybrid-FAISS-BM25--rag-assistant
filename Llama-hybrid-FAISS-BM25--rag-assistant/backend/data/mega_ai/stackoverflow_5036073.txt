Yes, they can. Additionally, they can be seen as (this list is very incomplete): Burritos A way to do IO A way to organise libraries A somewhat organised heap of objects Monoidal objects in a category of endofunctors Lax functors from a terminal bicategory An (higher-order) algebraic structure consisting of bind and return (or join and return) satisfying the monad laws Out of these (including yours), I would claim that only the last three definitions tell us what a monad is : An algebraic structure. Everything else tells us what monads are used for, give a (bad to flawed) metaphor, say how a particular calculus expresses monads, or, like yours, elaborate what monads mean in a certain frame of reference (e.g. lambda calculus). Viewing them as reification of computation/effects sounds like a mental model that is not inherently broken, but I would still advise to leave it behind and look at monads as an algebraic structure, devoid of any particular reference to the calculus one uses to express them: For the simple reason that doing that eases reasoning about the frame of reference one is trying to tame with a monad (say, a parser) without getting one's thoughts tangled up in, say, lambda calculus.
