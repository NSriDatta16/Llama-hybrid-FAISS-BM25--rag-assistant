MVC encourages a separation of concerns so placement of behavior within the layers all about addressing the concern of the behavior. Since I am unfamiliar with your architecture I don't know what you mean by "service layer" but since sending emails has little to do with the models, views, or controllers of your website I would encourage you to move this functionality into an application layer where it belongs. If your service layer is, in fact, and application layer then I would put the code there.
