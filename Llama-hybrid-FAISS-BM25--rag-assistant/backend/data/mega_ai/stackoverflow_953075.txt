First of all, a disclaimer. I don't really advocate for the solution I present below. The only browser specific CSS I write is for IE (especially IE6), although I wish it wasn't the case. Now, the solution. You asked it to be elegant so I don't know how elegant is it but it's sure going to target Gecko platforms only. The trick is only working when JavaScript is enabled and makes use of Mozilla bindings ( XBL ), which are heavily used internally in Firefox and all other Gecko-based products. For a comparison, this is like the behavior CSS property in IE, but much more powerful. Three files are involved in my solution: ff.html: the file to style ff.xml: the file containg the Gecko bindings ff.css: Firefox specific styling ff.html body { -moz-binding: url(ff.xml#load-mozilla-css); } This should be red in FF ff.xml ff.css h1 { color: red; } Update: The above solution is not that good. It would be better if instead of appending a new LINK element it will add that "firefox" class on the BODY element. And it's possible, just by replacing the above JS with the following: this.className += " firefox"; The solution is inspired by Dean Edwards' moz-behaviors .
