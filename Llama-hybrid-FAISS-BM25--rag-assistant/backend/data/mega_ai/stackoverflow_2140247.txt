Java not compiling .class files under $CLASSPATH

I'm trying to figure out how organize source and class files working with packages. I found a very useful tutorial . But I still have some questions. As far as I understood it is a good practice to have an isomorphism between name of packages and name of the directories where elements of a package are stored. For example if I have a package named aaa.bbb.ccc which contains class ddd it is a good practice to have a class file called "ddd.class" and located in "$CLASSPATH/aaa/bbb/ccc/". Did I get it right? If it is the case, will Java compiler put *.class files into the correct directory automatically? I was not able to get this behavior. I set the $CLASSPATH variable to "/home/myname/java/classes" . I executed javac KeyEventDemo.java which contains package events; . I expected that javac will create a subdirectory events under /home/myname/java/classes and put the KeyEventDemo.class in this subdirectory. It did not happen. I tried to help to javac and created "events" subdirectory by myself. I used javac again but it does not want to put class files under "/home/myname/java/classes/events". What am I doing wrong?
