I think that in your case you can follow the delegation pattern and implement a wrapper around LineRecordReader that overrides necessary methods i.e. next() (or nextKeyValue() in new API) to set value to a concatenation of N lines, rather than one line. I have googled the exemplary implementation of ParagraphRecordReader that uses LineRecordReader to read input data line by line (and concatenate it) until encountering either EOF or a blank line. Then it returns pair, where value is a paragraph (instead of one line). Moreover, ParagraphInputFormat for this ParagraphRecordReader is as simple as standard TextInputFormat. You can find the necessary links to this implementation and a couple of words about that the following post: http://hadoop-mapreduce.blogspot.com/2011/03/little-more-complicated-recordreaders.html .
