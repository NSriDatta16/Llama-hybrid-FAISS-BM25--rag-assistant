Using Javascript to load other external Javascripts

I have a library of JS code to load from a folder. Instead of typing the lines one by one in the tag of the HTML document, is there a way of just link one Javascript file which organizes and automatically load other javascript files. I know the Dojotoolkit is using this technique where only one JS file is loaded onto the client's computer, and once the code has been requested in the browser, 20 other JS code each with tag are generated.
