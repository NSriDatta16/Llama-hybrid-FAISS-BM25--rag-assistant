Is it possible for a DCGAN to do regression? What are some examples of this?

I'm currently a student doing some machine learning projects, and I want to use generative adversarial networks to train some data to discern for example, how old someone is. The intended output is a regression continuous output in term of months. I see the DCGANs and GANs are targeting mainly classification problems. Can they be used to solve regression problems? Thank you.
