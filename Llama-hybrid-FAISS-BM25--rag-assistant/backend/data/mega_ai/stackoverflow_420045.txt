Unless you need to be experienced in that hardware I think it's overkill. I have run at least one server at home for the last 13 years. I build/upgrade my own PC's. I have supported my family (5 workstations and 5 laptops) for longer than that. The servers that I use are built from parts left over from upgrades. I currently have a 3 server configuration. I have my main server (AMD 3800 X2 w/4 gig) that I use for the family's file server and an IIS web server. It also is running Ubuntu in a VM. This box handles all of our backups. I have a 2nd box (AMD 2600 w/4 gig) that is used for Windows Media Center, and as a backup for my main server, it replicates the contents of my main server to it's local storage. My 3rd box (AMD 3200 w/4 gig) is my play box and is currently running Windows Server 2008. In 13 years (running 24x7) I have had two hardware failures that I relate to power (they occurred after a power outage), a network card and a motherboard. I have had one hard disk failure (it just started getting a lot of errors/retries, I didn't lose any data). After the motherboard failure I bought an inexpensive UPS. I then added a 2nd one when I added the 3rd server. My used left over hardware has been extremely reliable. The only issues that I have had with hardware compatibility is with Ubuntu on a Compaq. After that one episode I started only using generic hardware. I would recommend everyone have at least one server to centrally locate things that need to be backed up. All of my servers have gone on to relatives to use as a 2nd or 3rd PC as they have been retired. I ran one server for about 5 years, two servers for about 6 years and I have been running three for the last 2 years. My oldest server box the AMD 2600 served it's life for 3 years as my wife's PC and has been a server for 2 years. Update I never really thought about it before, but it dawned on me that the reason that I have had such reliable hardware is because the hardware I use has already had a couple years of testing. With the exception of a few hard drives all of my hardware has proven to be reliable before it makes it to being used as a server.
