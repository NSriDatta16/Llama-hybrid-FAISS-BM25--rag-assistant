Spectral clustering of graph

I am trying to cluster a graph using spectral clustering. However I am unaware of the number of classes that exist in the data. Would it be a good idea to apply PCA on the adjacency matrix of the graph to find the actual number of clusters in the data set? Are there any other options?
