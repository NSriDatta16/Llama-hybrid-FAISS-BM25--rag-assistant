You're fine to use a ROWID in an application to find a record you were looking at earlier in the same session. Usually this will be the quickest way to get to the record. However, what you should never do is then store this Rowid in the database - or anywhere else - as restores from backup and so on can change ROWIDs. If you're using Oracle, use the UROWID - Universal ROWID - as this will stop using Physical ROWIDs and start using Logical ROWIDs on tables where the ROWID might change during a session, for example on an index organized table.
