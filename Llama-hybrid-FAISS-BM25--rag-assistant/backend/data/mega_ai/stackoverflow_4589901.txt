You should be using a class on all inputs you want styled rather than a general selector on tag name. If you cannot control this, you could try to set the input back to the default css properties which are listed here although this is not a nice solution and will probably not actually result in the default appearance of the input box. CSS3 has the not pseudo class which could be used to select all the other inputs although this is not supported by all browsers. JS abstraction frameworks such as jQuery often allow you to use "not" selector syntax cross-browser although this is much less elegant than a pure html css solution.
