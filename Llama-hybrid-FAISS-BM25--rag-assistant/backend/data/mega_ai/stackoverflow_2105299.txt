If your client and back end support multiple result sets you could also do somthing like (assuming its MSSQL) Create Proc usp_GetPeopleAndPets AS BEGIN SELECT PersonId, Name, Surname FROM dbo.Person p; SELECT pp.PersonID, p.PetId, p.Name, p.Breed FROM dbo.PersonPet pp INNER JOIN dbo.Pet p ON pp.PetId = p.PetId Order BY pp.PersonId END The data retrieval time would be roughly equivalent since its one trip to the DB. Some clients support relationships between results which allow you to do something like Person.GetPets() or Pet.GetPerson() The main advantage to this approach is that if you're working with people you don't have to worry about the "filter[ing] all person duplicate[s]"
