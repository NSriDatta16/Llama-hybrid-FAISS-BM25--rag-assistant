Identifying an object name by appending a generic name with a changeable value. Is this possible?

Say I have 5 UIImageViews, named image1 image2 image3 image4 and image5. And I have 5 buttons, which have their tag values set to the corresponding images that overlay them, so 1 - 5. If button 1 is pressed, I get the tag value like so NSNumber buttonNumber = [sender tag]; I then want to perform some methods on the corresponding image (image1). But I want to use the same method for all of the buttons. So my question is, having retrieved the tag, how can I identify the corresponding image (with the same number after its name). The solution I have so far, which is a bit long winded, is to use a switch: UIImageView *image; switch (buttonTag) { case 1: image = imageOverButton1; break; case 2: image = imageOverButton2; break; default: break; // etc } But this doesn't seem to be very elegant. If it were a string I could of course use stringWithFormat:@"imageOverButton%i", buttonTag So is there an equivalent operation for objects? I know I could also set the button's background image to the image I want and extract the imageData from the sender but I'd rather do it the above way for various reasons. I suppose I could also add the UIImageViews to an array and extract the relevant object by using the tag. Thanks! :D Michael
