For specific info on how locks are maintained, you can see chapter 8 of Microsoft SQL Server 2005: The Storage Engine (I'm not affiliated, this is just the first internals info I came across). If you have a books24x7 account, it's on there. It shows on a >16gb memory machine there are 2^25 (33554432) slots in the lock hash table, with an upper limit of 2^31 slots. For a given application you may very well find total throughput to be higher using only fine grained locks. As you can probably guess, it all depends on how the overhead of lock management compares to potential excessive locking.
