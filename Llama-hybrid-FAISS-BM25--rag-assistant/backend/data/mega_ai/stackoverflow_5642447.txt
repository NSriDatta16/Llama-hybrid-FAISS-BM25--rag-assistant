Creating / wrapping DocumentFragment in MooTools JavaScript library

How to do equivalent of the following pure JavaScript fragment with MooTools x = document.createDocumentFragment(); x.[fill with nodes]; document.[somewhere].appendChild(x); In particular as described in DOM 2 Core after attaching fragment to DOM the original variable x becomes empty DocumentFragment : If it [the node to add] is a DocumentFragment object, the entire contents of the document fragment are moved into the child list of this node Edit (2011-04-13 06:30 UTC) : What I'd like to get is something that behaves both as DocumentFragment from DOM 2 Core, but has all nice methods of Elements from MooTools Core.
