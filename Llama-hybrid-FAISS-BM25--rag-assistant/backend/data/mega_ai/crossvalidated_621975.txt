If you run a statistical analysis on synthetic data, you will get out what you put in. That is, the results of the analysis will reflect the assumptions that went into your generative model. This can be very useful for testing an analysis method; for example, you could test the sensitivity of the method to model misspecification. However, you will not learn anything about the real world because there is nothing of the real world in your data. In science there is no substitute for actually going out and gathering observations. By the way, there is no need to use an AI program like GPT to generate synthetic data, nor is there any particular advantage in doing so. People have been doing it for years (e.g., SynPUF). For most purposes, using an opaque model like an LLM is actually a disadvantage because you don't know what assumptions are built into it, nor what the "correct" answer is for a model run on the simulated data. In simulation studies you want to be able to compare your model's results to the theoretical values that you know based on how you set up the simulation.
