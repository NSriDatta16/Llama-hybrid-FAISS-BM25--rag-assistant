This is the kind of stuff I use rsync for. Do whatever you like on the main server and then periodically (or on demand) rsync push to the static server. Rsync is faster (and more featureful) than anything you can produce with a quick hack. Just because I'm paranoid I do hourly rsync's of all my customer sites to 2 backup servers, one of which is in my garage. I just timed an "rsync -a" against a 1.7GB customer site (which didn't have any changes) and it took 9.92 seconds wall-clock-time, including the 3 network handshakes for rsyncing 3 different directories. Had anything changed, presto-bango, it's done, complete with timestamps, owner/group, etc. It's amazing how blas√© you can become about server failure when you get true, multi-machine, no-humans-involved backup working. I sleep real good.
