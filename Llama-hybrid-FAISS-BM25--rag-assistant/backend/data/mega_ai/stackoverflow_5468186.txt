First in first out c++ algorithm

Ive been asked to write a code to calculate average waiting time and average turn around time of Cpu algorithms. FIFO, SJF, RR and priority based scheduling. Im supposed to read from a text file which looks something like this... except its a lot longers.. around 2100 processes. Process Arrival Burst Priority p1 31 9 41 p2 35 21 36 p3 6 55 61 p4 42 50 13 p5 36 85 58 Ive managed to read from the file into a 2D array.. But i have no clue how im supposed to use the array to do those calculations.. I m not thorough with the whole pointers thing. So.. is there anyway to do these calculations without use of pointers? This is the code ive written so far.. int main() { string text[15][4]; string f_comp[15][4]; ifstream stream1("D:\\College\\OS\\OSassignment_sol\\idiot.txt"); if(!stream1) { cout >text[i][j]; } } } //Checking if the stream has been assigned into the array correctly. for(int i=0; i >z; }
