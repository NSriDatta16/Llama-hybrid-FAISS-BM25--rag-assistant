What kind of classifier should I be using?

I have a script that scans text files and searches for keywords related to cryptography. And I'm scanning source code files. A lot of the times, I get back some evidence of cryptography like "AES_encrypt", but sometimes it can be a false positive, e.g. the keyword "crypt" in the string "cryptic words". To get rid of false positives, I designed an app that allows a human expert to go in and flag each hit as positive or false-positive. I want to gather this data and train a supervised classifier that learns from the human's expertise and gives a probability that a certain future hit is a positive. My training data looks something like this: keyword | keyword_group | is_source_file | P/FP "aes_encrypt" | "aes" | True | P "aes_encrypt" | "aes" | True | P "aes_encrypt" | "aes" | False | P "aes_encrypt" | "aes" | True | P "aes_encrypt" | "aes" | True | FP "aes_encrypt" | "aes" | False | FP "decrypt_aes" | "aes" | True | P "decrypt_aes" | "aes" | True | P "decrypt_aes" | "aes" | True | P "decrypt_aes" | "aes" | True | FP "decrypt_aes" | "aes" | False | P "decrypt_aes" | "aes" | False | FP "decrypt_aes" | "aes" | False | FP "rsa_key" | "rsa" | True | P "rsa_key" | "rsa" | True | P "rsa_key" | "rsa" | True | P ... Keywords are organized in groups. For example, "aes_encrypt" and "aes_decrypt" are both under "aes" group. is_source_file indicates whether this hit was found in a source code file like a ".cpp" or a ".py" file as opposed to other file extensions like a ".txt". I want to give the classifier a keyword and its group and whether it was found in a source file, and I want back a probability that it is a positive. What kind of classifier does this job?
