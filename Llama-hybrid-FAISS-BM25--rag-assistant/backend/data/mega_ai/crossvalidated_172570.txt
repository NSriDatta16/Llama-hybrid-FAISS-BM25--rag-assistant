I think the good reasons to use RBF kernel are that they work well in practice and they are relatively easy to calibrate, as opposed to other kernels. The polynomial kernel has three parameter (offset, scaling, degree). The RBF kernel has one parameter and there are good heuristics to find it. See, per example : SVM rbf kernel - heuristic method for estimating gamma Linear separability in the feature space may not be the reason. Indeed, it is easy, with a Gaussian kernel, to enforce separability and a perfect accuracy on the train set (setting $\gamma$ to a large value). However, these model have a very bad generalization. Edit. This short video shows the influence of the increase of the bandwith parameter on the decision boundary.
