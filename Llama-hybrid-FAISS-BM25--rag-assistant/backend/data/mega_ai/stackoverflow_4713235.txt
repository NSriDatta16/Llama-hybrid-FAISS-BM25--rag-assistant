In your example your new entry to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES would have to look like '{project}.snippets.EnforceLoginMiddleware.EnforceLoginMiddleware' (replace with the package name for your project). Make sure, that your snippets folder also has an __init__.py file! P.S.: that's probably because there is no such thing as a "snippet" when it comes to official components in Django. They usually are simple Python code fragments and have to be treated as such. Djangosnippets is just a site where you can post and share django code (also called snippets).
