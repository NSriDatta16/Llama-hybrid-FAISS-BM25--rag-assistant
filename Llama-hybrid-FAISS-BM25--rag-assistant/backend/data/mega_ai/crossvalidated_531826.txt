Reference: who introduced the tilde "~" notation to mean "has probability distribution..."?

[ Note: although this question has an accepted answer, the investigation is not finished yet. I encourage you to post your findings. ] Who first introduced the notation " $X \sim Q$ ", meaning that $Q$ is the probability distribution for $X$ , and its related meanings? Classical texts such as Jeffreys's Theory of Probability (3rd ed. 1961, 2nd ed. 1948 ) and Fisher's Statistical Methods for Research Workers (13th repr. ed. 1963) and Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference (1956) do not seem to use it (in Jeffreys " $\sim$ " denotes the logical not ). I checked also the references given in this informative answer , but did not find anything relevant there. (This notation is by no means universal in recent times or today, see eg Mosteller & Tukey's Data Analysis and Regression (1977) or Jaynes's Probability Theory (2003). In fact it does not make much sense when probability is seen as an extension of formal logic (eg Keynes , Johnson , Jeffreys, PÃ³lya , Hailperin , Jaynes), defined over propositions rather than random variables.) Edit (2021-06-24) : The earliest reference I found so far is a paper by Khatri written in 1965 and published 1967 , where the notation is introduced on p. 1854. The earliest textbook reference found so far is by Srivastava & Khatri, 1979 , p. 41. John Aldrich also kindly replied to my inquiry, saying that he never investigated the origin of this notation.
