Good and tricky questions! First of all, I am strongly against your point that machine learning is only used for classifying and prediction purposes . You might wonder why I disagree with your opinion: there is a general categorization towards ML: supervised ML and unsupervised ML. It seems that you mistake supervised ML as ML itself, while unsupervised ML whose target is to discover patterns and features from the dataset is neglected. Yes, PCA and K-Means won't help you foresee the output of the dataset, but you still manage to learn more about the dataset using them. If you ask for the definition of ML, I would say ML is a data-based and data-triggered kind of AI, and AI is the computational simulation of human actions and intelligence. Therefore, since PCA is a dimensionality reduction method conducted on the dataset, and K-Means is a clustering method, in other words, they reflect humans' desire to understand the data in easier way, their existence to some degree simulate people's manner to simplify the data and extract valuable information from the dataset. So again, PCA and K-Means is absolutely within the domain of ML. You did make a point that PCA came into being before AI/ML did, but what you missed is that our theory also grows. The succeeding theory always has to satisfy the previous definition, while the predesessing category can be included by a larger domain. For example, does it make sense that I tell that root number two does not belong to irrational number set because it was found before irrational number was defined?
