Is an Index Organized Table appropriate here?

I recently was reading about Oracle Index Organized Tables (IOTs) but am not sure I quite understand WHEN to use them. So I have a small table: create table categories ( id VARCHAR2(36), group VARCHAR2(100), category VARCHAR2(100 ) create unique index (group, category, id) COMPRESS 2; The id column is a foreign key from another table entries and my common query is: select e.id, e.time, e.title from entries e, categories c where e.id=c.id AND e.group=? AND c.category=? ORDER by e.time The entries table is indexed properly. Both of these tables have millions (16M currently) of rows and currently this query really stinks (note: I have it wrapped in a pagination query also so I only get back the first 20, but for simplicity I omitted that). Since I am basically indexing the entire table, does it make sense to create this table as an IOT? EDIT by popular demand: create table entries ( id VARCHAR2(36), time TIMESTAMP, group VARCHAR2(100), title VARCHAR2(500), .... ) create index (group, time) compress 1; My real question I dont think depends on this though. Basically if you have a table with few columns (3 in this example) and you are planning on putting a composite index on all three rows is there any reason not to use an IOT?
