Does the order of the columns in an CSV file affect the performance of my neural network?

It's a classification problem. I have a big dataset ( CSV file) of flights, where each flight is depicted as a set of variables ( airport_of_departure, airport_of_arrival, date_of_departure, etc ). Each flight is also characterized by a variable px_no that is associated with the number of passengers. My neural network aims to predict this variable of the flights, for which this particular variable is unknown. Do you think that the order of the variables ( airport_of_departure, airport_of_arrival, etc ) in my training set affects the outcome? For example, faster/slower learning, better/worse score.
