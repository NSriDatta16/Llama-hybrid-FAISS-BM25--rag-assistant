Lag based numerical features or ID categorical variable?

I have to develop a Machine Learning regression model to predict customerâ€™s delay in paying invoices. In addition to the invoice related variables, of course a very important variable is the customer. One possibility is to use directly the customer as categorical predictor variable, an alternative solution is to use some customer related Lag Based Features, such as the number of invoices previously paid by the customer and the average delay on them. Of course I can try both the methods and compare the accuracy (ID categorical variable vs lag based numerical features), but what are the implications, pros and cons of the 2 alternative approaches? I did a Google search and I was impressed that I could not find any resources on this topic.
