Generating text from language model

I have a trained LSTM language model and want to use it to generate text. The standard approach for this seems to be: Apply softmax function Take a weighted random choice to determine next word This is working reasonably well for me, but it would be nice to play around with other options. Are there any good alternatives to this?
