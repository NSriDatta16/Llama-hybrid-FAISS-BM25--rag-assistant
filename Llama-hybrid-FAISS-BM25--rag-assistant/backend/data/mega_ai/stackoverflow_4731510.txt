Best practices and examples on how to organize object oriented javascript?

I am a newbie to JavaScript and programming in general. I've started creating my first web app and I would like to rewrite it using an object oriented approach. I've read some articles and book chapters on object oriented JS about how to simulate namespaces, the module pattern and so, but I am having a hard time thinking about how to organize my code inside objects, hope you can help me with this or point me in the right direction to some examples or best practices. I was thinking to organize it sort of like jQuery with a namespace (called app maybe) and all my app functions inside it, for example app.func1, app.func2, however I have other functions which are used inside those which are like utilities and I would like them to have another name, maybe something like app.util.func... Also my code creates custom objects inside my app, but I don't know where is the right place to put them and their constructors inside my namespace. Any suggestions, ideas, best practices, templates, or examples on how to organize object oriented javascript? Examples on creating simple library like code would be great. Thanks in advance!
