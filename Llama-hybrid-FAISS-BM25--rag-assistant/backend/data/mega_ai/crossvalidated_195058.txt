Your first line is incorrect. In a logistic regression, Y is not linear in the parameters. Indeed, that's one reason why we need logistic regression. The logit of y is linear in the parameters. The parameters output from a logistic regression lack an intuitive explanation, unless your intuition about equations with exponentials in both numerator and denominator are a whole lot better than mine. The odds ratio does what you think the parameter does. That is, the OR measures how the odds of Y change per unit increase in each X.
