What loss function should one use when using an RNN to to predict a time series of binary values which are not necessarily independent?

I'm trying to use an RNN to predict a time series { $y_t$ }, where $y_t \in {0,1} \forall 1 \leq t \leq T$ given an input time series { $x_t$ }. The elements of the target sequence are not necessarily independent. Which distributions would be a good model of this output? Ultimately, I want to use this distribution over the target time series to derive a loss for the input-output sequence pair. I know of binary cross entropy with logits but this makes the assumption of independence between the elements of the target sequence.
