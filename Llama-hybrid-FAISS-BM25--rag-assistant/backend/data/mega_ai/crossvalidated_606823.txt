Determining statistical significance on exponential variables and timeseries

I am attempting to determine statistical significance of various customer programs for farmers use of sustainable products. Farm sales of sustainable products follows roughly an exponential curve, where many people purchase little but a few purchase a lot. The customer programs tend to target the larger purchasing customers regardless of what type of crop or sustainable products they purchase. The programs run on year long intervals. I am probably making this problem a lot harder than it needs to be, but I am thinking: 1). The problem is fundamentally being done on a time series, thus needs to be regression or needs the creation of an equivalent sample set during year 0 then tested against the following year. I could use a K-NN approach to make a similar sample during year 0 then test against it for difference of sustainable products based on enrollment the following year? Not sure what test given the distribution (2). 2). The distribution being looked at is exponential, thus standard statistical tests are no good by itself and standard non-parametric solutions don't seem right either. I am guessing the best solution would be to change the problem into a gaussian question by looking at the problem more as a regression problem and looking for an increased slope (or exponent) in this situation? I am guessing a K-NN sampling would still be needed, given the potential variance of high purchasing customers? Any insight would be greatly appreciated!
