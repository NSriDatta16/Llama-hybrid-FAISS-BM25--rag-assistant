I'm with Oli here. If you want to make a Wolfram Alpha style system, go to school and get a compsci degree, even better if you study up to PhD level. Then partner up with similarly well educated experts from other fields such as mathematics and natural language processing. Please do not misconstrue my response as being condescending, that is far from my intention, and the above is my honest advice if you want to make something similar to WA. I would advise you to learn a programming language that encourages good practises. I picked up Ruby because of the Ruby on Rails framework. Beforehand, I was a PHP hacker making horrible procedural scripts with no object orientation, no separation of concerns, no knowledge of design patterns, no knowledge of TDD/BDD, etc. Ruby encourages best practises, but Rails practically enforces them.
