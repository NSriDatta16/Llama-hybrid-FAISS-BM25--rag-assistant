What is allowed in Restricted XPaths (constraints)?

I need to apply constraints in a large XML file, like this: I need each bookAuthor's ID to refer to a valid author. I am finding the "restricted XPath" very clumsy to work with, but maybe overlooking something. Am I right to define the constraint this way: It works, but my file is actually more nested, so it gets really messy. Plus I have to write a new constraint for "library/book/CoAuthor". Is there nothing more elegant I can do? Can't I abbreviate the selector? Can I restrict the application of the constraint ("bookauthor[@nameAlias]")? Thanks in advance for your help.
