Running Model on both GPUs and CPUs

I have access to a hpc node, of 3 GPU and maximum of 38 CPU. I have a transformer model which I run of a single GPU at the moment, I want to utilize all the GPUs and CPUs. I have seen couple of tutorial on Dataparrallel and DistributedDataParallel. They only mentioned how to use multiple GPUs. My questions are: Do I use Dataparallel or DistributedDataParallel How do I adapt my code run on the GPUs and CPUs simultaneously. Perhaps if I can get a tutorial link. How to do I get the device ids.
