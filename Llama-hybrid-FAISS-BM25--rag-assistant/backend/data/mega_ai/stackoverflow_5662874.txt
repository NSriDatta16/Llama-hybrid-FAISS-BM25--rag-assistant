Unreasonable error calling function in C - Program to sort an array

I wrote a program that receive from user a series of numbers ( The user must enter numbers ascending (it is ok 4ex. 1,2,2,3,7,8,...,0) and end with a '0' of course, if not, appropriate error message will appear, and program will shut off. We can be sure the user will keep the Y array will be (if everything went ok with X array) a sorted array of X but without duplicates. 'm' will be number of organs in Y exclude '0' of course. Function SIFT must only organize the Y array for being printed from main(). Example: If user will store in X: 1,1,2,3,5,5,5,6 On screen will be: m = 5 Y = 1,2,3,5,6 My tryout: #include #include void SIFT(int x_arr[ ], int y_arr[]); int main () { int x[20] = {0} , y[20] = {0}; int m=0,temp=0,curr=0,i=0,j=0; printf("Please enter your numbers now:\n\n"); /*enter numbers one by one. if x[i+1] value = curr) { x[i] = temp; curr = temp; i++; } else { printf("The numbers are not at the right order !\n\nProgram will now terminate...\n\n"); } } SIFT(x,y); for (i=0 ; y[i]=='0' ; i++) /*strlen(y) without ('0')'s includes*/ m++; /*Prints m , y's organs*/ printf("\n\nm = %d",m); printf("Y = "); while (y[j]!='0') { printf ("%d ,",y[j]); j++; } void SIFT(int x_arr[ ], int y_arr[]) { int i=0,j=0; while (x_arr[i] != '0') { if (x_arr[i] == x_arr[i+1]) /*if current val. equals next val. -> jump dbl at x_arr*/ { y_arr[j] = x_arr[i]; i+=2; j++; } else { y_arr[j]=x_arr[i]; i++; j++; } } } return 0; } The error I'm getting from the gcc is: gcc -g -ansi -pedantic -Wall 2.c -o 2 2.c: In function ‘main’: 2.c:43: warning: ISO C forbids nested functions 2.c:43: warning: ISO C90 forbids mixed declarations and code /tmp/ccyZNfkF.o: In function `main': /home/student/Desktop/2/2.c:29: undefined reference to `SIFT' collect2: ld returned 1 exit status make: *** [2] Error 1 And another question: I would like to convert this code to the MIPS Assembly code, is there a short and fast way to do so ? Thanks all you guys !!
