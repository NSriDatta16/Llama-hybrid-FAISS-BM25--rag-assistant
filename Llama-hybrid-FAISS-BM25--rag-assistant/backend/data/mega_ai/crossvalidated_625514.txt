How can I calculate the probability that a slot machine is cheating or malfunctioning?

Imagine a slot machine that generates random numbers between $1$ and $100$ . Each number has the same probability of being selected as the others. When $1$ billion attempts are made on this slot machine, we expect that each number must have been chosen an average of $10$ million times. But when we run this machine, we see that number $100$ is selected $30$ million times. How can I calculate the probability that the machine is cheating or malfunctioning? For example, if The probability that the number $100$ will be chosen $30$ million times is $10^{-15}$ , can we say that probability of the machine cheating or malfunctioning is $1 - 10^{-15}$ ?
