I've used jQuery in the past when a client and their designer insisted in having customised scroll-bars. It's quite easy to stick a div on the side of a box and make it draggable between limits (and interpret the position to set the scroll offset). But you also have to consider what happens if they want to scroll using the mousewheel, or middle-click. They're not blockers but you'll have to write listeners to update the scroll-bar position too. Whether or not you should do it is a completely different question. You should certainly not just rely on your custom JS. Make the JS disable the scrollbar and paint all your controls using JS. If you don't do this, people with JS disabled/blocked won't be able to use your site.
