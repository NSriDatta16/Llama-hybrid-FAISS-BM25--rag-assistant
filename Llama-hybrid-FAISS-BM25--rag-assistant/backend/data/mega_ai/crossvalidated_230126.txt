The main difference between the Bayesian and frequentist schools of statistics arises due to a difference in interpretation of probability. A Bayesian probability is a statement about personal belief that an event will (or has) occurred. A frequentist probability is a statement about the proportion of similar events that occur in the limit as the number of those events increases. For me, to "think like a Bayesian" means to update your personal belief as new information arises and to "check [or worry] like a frequentist" means to be concerned with performance of statistical procedures aggregated across the times those procedures are used, e.g. what is the coverage of credible intervals, what is the Type I/II error rates, etc.
