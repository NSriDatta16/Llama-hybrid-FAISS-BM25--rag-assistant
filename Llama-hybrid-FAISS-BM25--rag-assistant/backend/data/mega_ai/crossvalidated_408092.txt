Best approach for time series

What approach would be best for time series that tracked user generate some events (activitie is file creation - from 0 files per day - 18 files per day ). I determined that number of events per day follow negative binomial distribution and I used pseudo random generator to generate / simulate user behavior, but I don t know how to determine time of events(creation). Final goal is simulation of this user so if there is 4 events (user created 4 files that day) when in simulation that will be scheduled durring 24 h. Do I need to filter data in a way to have one data set 1 event/day, second dataset with 2 events/day and so on .. or some other approach.
