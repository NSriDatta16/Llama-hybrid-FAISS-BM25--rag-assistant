Number of Samples per-Tree in a Random Forest

How many samples does each tree of a random forest use to train in sci-kit learn the implementation of Random Forest Regression? And, how does the number of samples change when the bootstrap option is on compared to when it’s off? In “Random Forest” by Breiman, I believe he mentions that each tree is trained on 1/3 of the data. Is that the case in the implementation of scikit learn as well? sklearn ref: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html github source: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/a24c8b46/sklearn/ensemble/forest.py#L1019
