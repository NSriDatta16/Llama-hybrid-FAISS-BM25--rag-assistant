Check out this link which discusses it. Basically, it would make the most sense for it to be private , as it should only be called by the JVM (garbage collector). But in order to allow a subclass to call the parent finalize() method as part of its finalize() , it has to be protected . ( Edit - And just a general caution - use of the finalize() method is generally discouraged as there's no way of ensuring that it will ever be called. Although that doesn't mean that you'll never have occasion to use it - it's just rare.)
