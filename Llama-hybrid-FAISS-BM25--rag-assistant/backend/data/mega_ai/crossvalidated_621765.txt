Methods to approximate Area under Precision-Recall Curve

average_precision_score from sklearn uses formula: ap = sum( (recall[k+1] - recall[k]) * precision[k+1] ) But trapezoidal rule implies: ap = sum( (recall[k+1] - recall[k]) * (precision[k+1] - precision[k]) / 2 ) This is typical Precision-Recall curve: We can see, that sklearn average_precision_score would over-estimate AUPRC, and trapezoidal rule is more exact. However, one argument against trapezoidal rule is "This implementation is not interpolated and is different from computing the area under the precision-recall curve with the trapezoidal rule, which uses linear interpolation and can be too optimistic" https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score.html#sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score So why not use trapezoidal rule? Is it optimistic or pessimistic?
