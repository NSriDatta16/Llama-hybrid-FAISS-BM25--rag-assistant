How to solve or start solving DB2 problem?

When I try to pre-compile my DB2 Cobol application that contains embedded SQL statements, I get this error in my SYSTERM file: ********************************* TOP OF DATA ********************************** DSNH527I W DSNHOPTS THE PRECOMPILER OR DB2 COPROCESSOR ATTEMPTED TO USE THE DSNH004I S DSNHLEXC PROCEDURE DIVISION COULD NOT BE FOUND DSNH053I W DSNHMAIN NO SQL STATEMENTS WERE FOUND SOURCE STATISTICS SOURCE LINES READ: 205 NUMBER OF SYMBOLS: 10 SYMBOL TABLE BYTES EXCLUDING ATTRIBUTES: 1640 THERE WERE 3 MESSAGES FOR THIS PROGRAM. THERE WERE 0 MESSAGES SUPPRESSED BY THE FLAG OPTION. 188712 BYTES OF STORAGE WERE USED BY THE PRECOMPILER. RETURN CODE IS 12 ******************************** BOTTOM OF DATA ******************************** I think the error is that it can't find the Procedure Division section, but it is in the code here: *---------------------------------------------------------------* * P R O C E D U R E D I V I S I O N * *---------------------------------------------------------------* PROCEDURE DIVISION USING LK-TRANS-INPUT. 000-MAIN.
