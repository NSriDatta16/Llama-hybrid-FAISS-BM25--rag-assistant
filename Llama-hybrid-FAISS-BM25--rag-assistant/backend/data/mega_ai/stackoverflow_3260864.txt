In regard to sources for information on replication, start with my Jet Replication Wiki . But I would never recommend Jet replication for your scenario. The only environment where I currently recommend it (and I've been doing replicated apps since 1997 and still have several in production use) is for supporting laptop users who have to work with live data in the field disconnected from any network, and return to the home office and synch direct with the mother ship. The easiest solutions with an Access application would be hosting the app on Windows Terminal Server/Citrix and the users would run it over a Remote Desktop Connection, or using Sharepoint. The Terminal Server/Citrix solution has no accomodation for disconnected users, but Sharepoint can accomodate offline usage and synch changes when connected. Access 2010 and Sharepoint 2010 provide a host of new features, including better schema design, the equivalent of triggers and greatly improved peformance for large Sharepoint lists, so it's a no-brainer to me that if you choose Sharepoint you'd want to use A2010 and Sharepoint 2010. While it's possible to do what you want with Jet Replication, it requires a lot of setup on the server and client ends, and is relatively fragile (not in terms of data integrity if you're using indirect replication (as you should), but in terms of network reliability) -- there are too many moving parts and too many failure points. Windows Terminal Server/Citrix is by far the simplest, with the fewest moving parts and completely centralized administration, and works very well for a relatively small investment. Sharepoint is more complicated than WTS/Citrix, but is less complex and more centralized than a Jet Replication solution. If it were me, I'd probably go with WTS/Citrix if there was no need for disconnected usage, but I'd be salivating over trying out A2010/Sharepoint 2010. If there was a need for disconnected usage, then I'd definitely go the Sharepoint route.
