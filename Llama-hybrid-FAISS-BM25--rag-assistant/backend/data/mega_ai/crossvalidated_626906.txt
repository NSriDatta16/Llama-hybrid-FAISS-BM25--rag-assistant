Granger causality does not imply a pair of integrated time series are cointegrated: an example

If a pair of integrated time series $\{X_t\}$ and $\{Y_t\}$ are cointegrated, at least one of them must Granger-cause the other. Is the converse also true? I guess not, but I am struggling to come up with a counterexample. Could you help me?
