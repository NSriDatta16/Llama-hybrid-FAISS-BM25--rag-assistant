For youtube I think the distribution depends on the distribution of video length. Most videos are about 8 to 10 minutes (this is the average span of the people attention). One might watch 0, 1, 2, or any other number of videos. A Poison distribution might be a good candidate to model the number of visits to a website or the number of videos watched per day. If the distribution of the time of a single video would be $P_V(t)$ then the distribution of total time would be something like $$P_{Total}(t)=\sum_{i}^{} P_p(N=i)P_{Vi}(t)$$ where $i$ is the number of visits, $P_p(N=i)$ is the Poisson distribution and $P_{Vi}$ is distribution of total time of $i$ videos which can be obtained by performing convolution on $P_v$. If $P_v(t)$ is approximately Gaussian then the distribution would be a mixture of Gaussians. Something that looks like the following picture. (I only guessed the distribution, not to scale) For facebook there might be something similar to a video length. For example the time required to look at one page.
