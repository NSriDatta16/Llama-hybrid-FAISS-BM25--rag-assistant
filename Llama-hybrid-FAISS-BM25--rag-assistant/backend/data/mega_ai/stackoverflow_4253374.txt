Question with capture packets from PPP interface

I am using libpcap to capture data from PPP interface, and add filter as follow: char filter_exp[] = "ip"; But when i sniff the packets in callback function, I found that the format of ip packet is not correct, the header size is not 20 byte. And when I capture packets from eth0, everything is normal. So who can tell me how to get the correct ip packets from PPP interface by libpcap, thanks!
