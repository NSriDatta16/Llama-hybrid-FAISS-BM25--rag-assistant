Edit: now works in IE! insertSiblingNodesAfter uses the parentNode of the sibling, which happens to be a tbody in IE It's hard to know what quirks are in store when you try to manipulate the DOM cross-browser. I'd recommend that you use an existing library that has been fully tested across all major browsers, and accounts for quirks. Personally I use MochiKit, you can dive into DOM manipulation here: http://mochikit.com/doc/html/MochiKit/DOM.html Your final function might look something like this: function addEmployee(employeeName, employeeJob) { var trs = getElementsByTagAndClassName("tr", null, "employeetable"); insertSiblingNodesAfter(trs[trs.length-1], TR({}, TD({}, employeeName), TD({}, employeeJob)); alert("code executed!"); }
