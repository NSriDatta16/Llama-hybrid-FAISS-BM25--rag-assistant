You are certainly not incompetent. Images do not have states, so a style is not the answer. The only styles you can create for images are for one fixed state, so you could add the 60% opacity, but not much else. Your options are: Create EnterImage and LeaveImage storyboards that are played with ControlStoryboardAction behaviours (on MouseEnter and MouseLeave events). Create a custom behaviour and attach that to the images. Place the image in another control that has states (maybe a button) Place the image in a user control with an image property Create a custom control The simplest is option 1, but it requires attaching several properties to each image so more drags and clicks to author them. If you let us know which option you prefer I may be able to post an example.
