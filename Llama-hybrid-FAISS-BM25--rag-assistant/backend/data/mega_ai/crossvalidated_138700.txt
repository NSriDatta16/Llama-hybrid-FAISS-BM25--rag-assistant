ARIMA Specification from Correlogram

How should I determine the data generating process from the correlogram below? This is non-seasonally adjusted monthly data that has been 1st differenced. I am trying to conduct univariate time series analysis for a homework assignment and was instructed to use the Box-Jenkins methodology. I tried to specify the model by first including AR and MA terms for each spike in the correlogram. I dropped the AR/MA terms that were not significant and continued until I ended up including AR(12) and MA(13) but my inverted roots were .99. I know this is undesirable. How should I go about specifying my univariate model from this correlogram? 1st Differenced ] Seasonally Differenced and 1st Differenced
