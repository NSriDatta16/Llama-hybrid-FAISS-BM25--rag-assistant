Are there any useful datasets available on the web for data mining?

Does anyone know any good resource where example (real) data can be downloaded for experimenting statistics and machine learning techniques such as decision trees etc? Currently I am studying machine learning techniques and it would be very helpful to me to have real data for evaluating the accuracy of various tools. If anyone knows of any good resource (perhaps as csv, xls files or any other format) I would be very thankful for a suggestion.
