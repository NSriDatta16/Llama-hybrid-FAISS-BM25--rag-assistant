Multi-dimensional arrays in Linq

I have an XML file similar to the following: This is paragraph 1 Paragraph 1 alternative text This is paragraph 2 Paragraph 2 alternative text And I'm reading this into my program using LINQ. I am still learning LINQ. I'd like to have a 2-d array mapping of paragraphs and choices, ie Paragraph[0][0] = "This is paragraph 1" and Paragraph[1][1] = "Paragraph 2 alternative text". The problem is I am unsure how to nest these arrays within LINQ. At the minute I have: var paragraphsQuery = from paragraphsNode in xDoc.Elements("novel").Elements("paragraphs") from choiceNodes in paragraphsNode.Elements("paragraph").Elements("choice") select choiceNodes.Value; ...but this gives me one array of all the choices combined (I have lost the paragraph segregations). It seems somehow I need to do more from statements within the select? Could anyone offer me any advice? Thank you.
