I asked myself the same question, and here is the answer, quoted from the Chromium wiki : Q: Why this over LocalStorage? A: LocalStorage is inherently racy or a parallelism disaster , depending on whether or not you're willing to implement the "storage mutex" described in the spec. Chromium has decided not to implement it. WebKit itself is single thread/process (i.e. no parallelism period) Source : http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/indexeddb Web SQL can be useful if you want to copy the structure of your database locally for offline use. But Web SQL will not be implemented in firefox : http://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=168bf22f976f5a68fe5770d19&id=6c2d73c957#standards Mozilla, Microsoft and Oracle are working on the "IndexedDB" alternative : http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/ Work in progress in firefox : https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Projects/IndexedDB Storage demos : A good article from PPK about html5 storage : http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/06/html5_storage_t.html Ian Hickson early 2008 session storage demo : http://www.whatwg.org/demos/2008-sept/wizard/step1.html
