ASP.NET MVC image upload store location (db vs filesystem)

I am writing web application using ASP.NET MVC + NHibernate + Postres stack. I wonder if images uploaded should be stored in database as binary blobs or on filesystem (and reference only in db). One advantage of db storage I can think of is easy backup/recovery of all data without reverting to filesystem copy tools. On the other hand I suspect that filesystem access may be faster (but is it especially when dealing with many concurrent requests?) What are your suggestions?
