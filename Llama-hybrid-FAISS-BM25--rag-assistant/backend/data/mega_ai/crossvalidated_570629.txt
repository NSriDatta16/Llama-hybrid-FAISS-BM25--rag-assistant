Yes, we can use binary response variables. In GPBoost we set likelihood="binary" . MERF in theory can also handle it, as based on the MERF's author's PhD thesis here binary outcomes are within the scope of the methodology but I see no such option in the MERF package itself. I would suggest looking at bambi (in Python/PyMC3) or rstanarm (in R/Stan) too, you can define splines for your main fixed effects so they have non-linear influence in the response but also have a full MCMC approach in fitting the model and check the relevant diagnostics. ( statsmodels often provides sub-optimal fitting results when dealing with mixed models.)
