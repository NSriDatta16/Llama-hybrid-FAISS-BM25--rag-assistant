image classification R

I have JPG images like below and each one is less than 200 KB. My webcam and the watch are in a fixed position. I want to analyze images and tell the exact time. I have huge number of images and training my algorithm wont be a problem. Any suggestions about packages that i can use? I am thinking about getting pixel color density values for each pixel and then building a neural network or a support vector machine. But i felt that there might be a better package or an algorithm to do the same.
