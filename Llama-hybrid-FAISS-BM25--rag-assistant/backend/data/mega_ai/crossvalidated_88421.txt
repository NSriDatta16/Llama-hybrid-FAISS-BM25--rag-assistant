Metropolis Algorithm

I am currently doing my statistics thesis on modelling football data which requires quite a great knowledge of Bayesian Theory especially MCMC methods. However I have some minor problems regarding the Metropolis algorithm: Any distribution can be attributed to the proposal density function? Also, the initial values given to the parameters (i.e. the first step of the Metropolis algorithm) are random or there must be some thinking behind the choice of values? Thank you
