Mean and variance and special distribution of events

A hospital Accident and Emergency (A&E) department receives an average of 6 ambulances an hour. It can process patients in 30 minutes, but if it receives more than five patients in 30 minutes, a state of emergency will be declared, and the A&E department will shut. Each ambulance will arrive with either 1, 2, or 3 patients, with relative probabilities of 0.7, 0.2 and 0.1 respectively. i. Calculate the dispersion index of the arrival of the patients and comment on the nature of their arrival. ii. Calculate the mean and variance of the number of patients arriving over one hour. This is my attempt so far but I’m not sure now if I’ve done it right.
