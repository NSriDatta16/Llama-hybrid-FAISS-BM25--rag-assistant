For machine learning, I think Machine Learning: The Art and Science of Algorithms that Make Sense of Data by Peter Flach can be a good resource to start with. It gives a general introduction to machine learning with intuitive examples, and is suitable for beginners. I like this book particularly because of the last chapter, which deals with machine learning experiments. While learning about machine learning, getting to know different models is not enough, and one should be able to compare different machine learning algorithms. I think this book has made it easier to understand how to compare those algorithms. Lecture slides can be found here .
