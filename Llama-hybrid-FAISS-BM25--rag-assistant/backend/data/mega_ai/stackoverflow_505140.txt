Refresh A Image Src

k... Strager was able to help me a bit. However, it's still not working quite right. Need someone that knows both MVC and jQuery please... I have a page that has a image that when clicked on will launch a dialog box that gives the ability to upload a file. Once the dialog closes the image is supposed to refresh with what was uploaded/stored in the database... All works great the first time. However if I try uploading a 2nd image; the 1st image still displays. It also doesn't seem like my controller method is being called the 2nd time... Below is my code... I've also eliminated that the page is being cached. Again, the controller method is not being called the 2nd time around... Controller [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Get)] public ActionResult GetImage(Guid parentId) { var la = Helper.Service.GetAttachmentByEntity(parentId, MembershipProvider.SecurityTicket).ToList(); la.OrderByDescending(x => x.CreatedDate); return File(la[0].Data, la[0].ContentType); } View $(function() { var iphcObject = $('# '); iphcObject.children().find('#imageUploadDialog').bind('onClose', function() { iphcObject.children().find('#image').attr('src', ' '); }); }); ; height: ; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"> " />
