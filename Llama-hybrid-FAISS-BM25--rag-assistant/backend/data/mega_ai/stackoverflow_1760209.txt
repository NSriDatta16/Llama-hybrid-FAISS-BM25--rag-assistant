jQuery Disable/Enable status of Droppable/Draggable

I tired to explain this yesterday, but I don't think people understood it. I posted up the code and example at http://www.whatevercorp.com/problem/ I haven't worked with jQuery in a while, but have search everywhere for a disable('enable')/disable example or a way to change droppable status on the fly. Basically I have 2 questions: How can I change or limit the .drop class to only accept 1 item in the div If you look at the example (whatevercorp.com/problem/) you will see that you can drop 2 items within a div and it gets funky. I just want to limit this as it's a gallery of photos. How can I keep track of all the droppble items within the table. I want users to be able to move them around once they drop them in the boxes, but also keep track of each move. I looked into serialize, but need some pointers. Hopefully that clears it up and I can get this tool up and running. Thanks for your help in advance!
