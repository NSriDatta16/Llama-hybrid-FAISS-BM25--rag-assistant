RMSE tells us how far the model residuals are from zero on average, i.e. the average distance between the observed values and the predicate values. However, Willmott et. al. suggested that RMSE might be misleading to assess the model performance since RMSE is a function of the average error and the distribution of squared errors. Chai recommended to use both RMSE and mean absolute error (MAE). It is better to report both metrics. By the way, $R^2$ is misleading as well since it increases for higher number of predictors. I would recommend to use adjusted $R^2$ . This metric is kinda gold standard goodness of fit test. To handle multicollinearity, compute the nonparametric Spearman's rank-order correlation and drop the variable close to 1. It will solve the problem. For the outliers, it is not a good practice to delete outliers because they may have valuable insights. Find the influential outliers and fit the model with and without them to see their impact on the model. Also, don't forget to check all four properties of linear model assumptions. Attached articles will give u more explanations. Reference: http://www.jstor.org/stable/24869236 https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/7/1247/2014/
