Linq2SQL using Update StoredProcedure

We use queries generated by Linq for data retrieval but for INSERT and UPDATE we do not allow generated SQL, but restrict to the use of stored procedures. I connected the Update and the Insert behaviour in the DBML to the stored procedures. The procedures are called, the data gets inserted/updated = all if fine, except in the case of optimistic concurrency . If a record was changed between retrieval and update, the update should fail. When Linq generates the Update statement itself, it throws a ChangeConflictException as expected, but using the stored procedure no Exception is thrown. Thanks a lot for any help on this!
