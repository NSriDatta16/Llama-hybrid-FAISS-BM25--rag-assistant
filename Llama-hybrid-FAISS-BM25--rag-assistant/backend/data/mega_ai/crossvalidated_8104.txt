Why is a $p(\sigma^2)\sim\text{IG(0.001, 0.001)}$ prior on variance considered weak?

Background One of the most commonly used weak prior on variance is the inverse-gamma with parameters $\alpha =0.001, \beta=0.001$ (Gelman 2006) . However, this distribution has a 90%CI of approximately $[3\times10^{19},\infty]$. library(pscl) sapply(c(0.05, 0.95), function(x) qigamma(x, 0.001, 0.001)) [1] 3.362941e+19 Inf From this, I interpret that the $IG(0.001, 0.001)$ gives a low probability that variance will be very high, and the very low probability that variance will be less than 1 $P(\sigma pigamma(1, 0.001, 0.001) [1] 0.006312353 Question Am I missing something or is this actually an informative prior? update to clarify, the reason that I was considering this 'informative' is because it claims very strongly that the variance is enormous and well beyond the scale of almost any variance ever measured. follow-up would a meta-analysis of a large number of variance estimates provide a more reasonable prior?
