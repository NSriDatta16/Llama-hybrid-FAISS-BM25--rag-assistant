I don't believe you can do this OOTB in Lucene currently - searching for this functionality yields this open issue: Jira Lucene Feature Request The functionality is present OOTB with Solr however - which provides a faceting feature. A query such as the following: http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=ipod&rows=0&facet=true&facet.limit=-1&facet.field=cat&facet.field=inStock would return the following result: 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 More information on faceting can be found on the Solr website: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SimpleFacetParameters EDIT: If you definitely don't want to go down the SOLR aproach to faceting you may be able to leverage the functionality in this patch described for Lucene: http://sujitpal.blogspot.com/2007/01/faceted-searching-with-lucene.html which provides an implementation of the faceting feature on top of Lucene 2.0 via a patch.
