I recently came across a note of a scipy implementation of the k-means algorithm in scipy.cluster.vq.py Notes ----- This could be faster when number of codebooks is small, but it becomes a real memory hog when codebook is large. It requires N by M by O storage where N=number of obs, M = number of features, and O = number of codes.
