Multiple imputation in SPSS: merge datasets?

I have two sets of data, measured from the same persons. The variables in the two sets are very different. There are some extreme values (occurring at random) in both sets I would like to handle using multiple imputation. I would like to do this using SPSS, which I believe uses some kind of Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for the imputation. Now, the problem I have is this: should I do the imputation for the two sets separately or should I merge them into one big dataset and then do the multiple imputation for the merged dataset?
