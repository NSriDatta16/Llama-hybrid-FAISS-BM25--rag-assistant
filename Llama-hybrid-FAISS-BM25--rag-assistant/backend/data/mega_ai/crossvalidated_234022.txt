Preventing leakage when train/test splitting time series?

Let's say I have a feature set X that is of size m x 2, where m are samples, and the two features are timepoint and panel . timepoint is a variable which ranges from 1 to 100, and represents the time at which the sample was taken, and panel is a categorical variable that is a unique identifier for each time series. My outcome variable y is of shape m x 1 and is a continuous variable. I want to train a regression model. In other words, a small excerpt with timepoints 1-3 might look like: y timepoint panel 1.5 1 1 5.4 2 1 6.7 3 1 3.3 1 2 3.4 2 2 4 3 2 How do I properly split this data into train/test, without resulting in leakage between the two sets? Train/test split on X , ignoring the grouping variable (i.e. randomly take 33% of the rows in X as my test)? Split based on the grouping variable (i.e. randomly take 33% of the groups in panel )? My hunch is that #2 is the proper way to do this. Suggestions?
