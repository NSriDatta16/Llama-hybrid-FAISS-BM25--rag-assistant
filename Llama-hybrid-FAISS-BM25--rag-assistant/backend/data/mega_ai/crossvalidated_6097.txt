Predicting a semi-deterministic process

Say I have a process that gives me 3 outputs: $O^1$, $O^2$ and $O^3$. The outputs are generated from a semi-deterministic process, i.e. there is a deterministic component in the outputs, along with a random component. In particular, having $n$ measurements over time, the outputs $O_j \quad j=1,2,...,n$ are -at least in part- dependent on the previous outputs. So $O_j = f(O_{j-1}, O_{j-2}, O_{j-3}) + \epsilon$ (I'm not interested in going farther away than 2 or 3 measurements, $\epsilon$ is the random component). So now I have a set of ~150 consecutive measurements, how can I predict what are the likely outputs in the future? I can easily calculate the distribution of values following a certain output, for instance I could say that if $O^1_j$ is between 50 and 60 I have a certain probability of $O^1_{j+1}$ of being between 30 and 40, by looking at the measurements that I took in the past. I did construct some pdf for the distribution of these probabilities, but now I'm a bit stuck, especially because there is probably an interaction between the three outputs (so for instance, updating my previous statement $O^1_j = f(O^1_{j-l}, O^2_{j-l}, O^3_{j-l}) + \epsilon \quad\quad l=1,2,3$) I've been reading about Bayesian predictors and I tought they could be applied here, but I don't know enough about the topic to determine if this is a good choice or if there is something easier/more appropriate. I will appreciate any suggestion!
