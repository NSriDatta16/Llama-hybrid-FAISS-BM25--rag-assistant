Expectation of the absolute value of the product of correlated jointly gaussians?

I am reading the Performer paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14794 . To understand their ReLU kernel used to approximate softmax attention, I need to evaluate $\mathbb{E}[ReLU(x^T w) \cdot ReLU(y^T w)]$ where $w \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ . I was able to reduce the problem to the more general one of computing $\mathbb{E}[|X \cdot Y|]$ where $X,Y$ are correlated jointly Gaussians. However, now I am stuck. Is there an approach of computing this expression or bound it from above reasonably without numerical simulation? Cauchy-Schwarz seems to loose for the upper bound.
