Regarding your question on the equivalence, fitting a univariate local linear trend model using a Kalman filter is equivalent to fitting a cubic spline; see Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods , Section 3.11 for instance. I think you are right in pointing that the Kalman filter and smoother are sometimes neglected when they could be put to good use. In particular, I find that the Kalman smoother is much more convenient with irregularly spaced and/or missing data.
