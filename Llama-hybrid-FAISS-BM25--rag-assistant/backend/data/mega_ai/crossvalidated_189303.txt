Mathematical foundation of using MCMC in global optimization

MCMC is commonly used to compute the integral in the form of $$\text{Problem A.}~~\int F(x)\pi(x) $$ where $\pi$ is hidden. In the literature, it is explained why MCMC can handle problem A by construcing an Metroplis Hasting sampling. Then, people also claim that MCMC, in part., the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm, can be used to calculate function minima. $$\text{Problem B.}~~\min F(x)$$ The Metropolis-Hasting algorithm itself is not hard to follow. My question is, what is the reason why the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm can handle problem B? Is there any mathematical guarantee? A precise, mathematical explanation would be appreciated.
