In effect, it seems to me this is an assortment of assumed covariance structures. In other words, this is a type of Bayesian prior modelling. This gains in robustness over an ordinary MLR procedure because the number of parameters ($\downarrow$df) is reduced, and introduces inaccuracy because of augmented omitted variable bias , OVB. Because of the OVB, the slope is flattened, $|\hat\beta| My personal experience is that the superior to the Bayesian approach is to use better modelling; transform parameters, use other norms, and/or use nonlinear methods. That is, once the physics of the problem and the methods are properly explored and co-ordinated, the F statistics, coefficient of determination, etc. improve rather than degrade.
