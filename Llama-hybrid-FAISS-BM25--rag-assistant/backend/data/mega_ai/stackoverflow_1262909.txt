Because I've read either the documentation, or articles, or a book on a subject, the things I learn on a topic are organized. The result is that, if I can't bring something up from memory, I can probably find it quickly through IntelliSense or the Object Browser. Worse come to worst, I can pick up the book again; something these youngsters are not being taught to do. John Saunders Age 51
