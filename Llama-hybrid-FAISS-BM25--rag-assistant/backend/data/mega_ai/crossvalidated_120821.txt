Test(s) For Comparing qPCR results / ΔΔCт values

To be clear, I'm talking about real-time polmerase chain reaction (qPCR) , not Principle Component Regression. Though from a company selling qPCR reagents, here is a good walk-through of the procedure. This is something I've seen lots of arguments over, and generally believe biologist should ask for statistical help more often. Often reliance is given to a computer program like RealTime StatMiner , which in addition to putting the stats on the back-end, could easily be misused by a user. To quote Livak and Schmittgen (because I can't get it better): The endpoint of real-time PCR analysis is the threshold cycle or Cт. The Cт is determined from a log–linear plot of the PCT signal versus the cycle number. Thus, Cт is an exponential and not a linear term. A commonly used method for reporting qPCR results is the ΔΔCт method, the "normalized" cycle point the concentration of a target cross a threshold. The threshold is normally set visually against the data set. The value is normalized by adjusting for the concentration of an abundant known house keeping gene , like GAPDH , and the ΔCт values of naive/vehicle group. If I understand correctly, taking: $$ 2^{-ΔΔCт} $$ will give one a liner form representing the factor change in the gene expression. Data sets from such results can often be zero weighted, and transformed further depending on the results. It would seem most appropriate to apply statistical tests to the liner form, but it's been so heavily modified from the actual read out (normalized and hopefully linearized), I am not certain that is appropriate. Regression models often would be difficult because different dilutions of your target may be impossible, undetectable, and unknown. Are the standard ANOVA considerations (follows a normal curve, equal population, and possibly different population averages) sufficient for deciding if an ANOVA is appropriate for the liner form? Often I find when comparing between drug effects over virus strains or animals the liner form is not normally distributed. Would be most appropriate to apply a transformation (log, arc-sine, or what ever seems applicable) to the linear form, or would an earlier point be more appropriate? For some reason my gut twists every time I take $2^{-ΔΔCт}$ and just use them in an ANOVA/MANOVA.
