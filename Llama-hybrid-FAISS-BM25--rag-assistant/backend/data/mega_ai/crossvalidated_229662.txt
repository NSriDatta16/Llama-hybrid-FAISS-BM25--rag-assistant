Extracting information correctly from text

I am stuck with interpreting the information given in the following exercise: Due to a recent increase in the price of tomatoes a pub landlord is looking to reduce the quantity of tomatoes he buys, but wants to minimize the risk of running out of it on any one day. Data collected over the last 20 days has shown that on average 8 customers order tomatoes and that the average number of orders per day is 25. The standard deviation of the data collected was 1.2. Calculate the probability that the landlord will run out of tomatoes if he buys enough for 10 portions per day. My first interpretation : I would model this using the random variable $X = $ number of tomatoes ordered. $X$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. Then from the data I have an estimate $\bar X = 8$ for $\mu$ and $S = 1.2$ for $\sigma$, and I know that $$ \frac{\bar X - \mu}{S/\sqrt{20}} \backsim t_{19} $$ But I am not sure this helps me to find the required probability $P(X \ge 10)$ and also I haven't used the information that $25$ meals are ordered per day on average. My second interpretation : Let $\pi$ be the proportion of meals with tomatoes ordered per day. Then the data gives us an estimate $p = 8/25 = 0.32$ and we know that $$ \frac{p - \pi}{\sqrt{\frac{\pi(1 - \pi)}{20}}} \backsim N(0,1) $$ but again I don't think this is what I should look for as it would not be useful in calculating the required probability. My third interpretation : Let $Z$ be the number of meals with tomatoes ordered per day. Then $Z \backsim \text{Bin}(20, 0.32)$ from which we can compute the probability $P(Z \ge 10)$ as required. However, here I don't think the random variable accurately reflects the given information, in particular treating the number of observations as repeated attempts sounds weird, and again I haven't used given information (namely the sample standard deviation). I am quite confused and not sure how to progress -- all these interpretations seem to be not entirely correct. Any hint would be very useful, thanks a lot for your help !!
