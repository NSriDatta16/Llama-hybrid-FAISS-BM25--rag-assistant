So which is it, ldpi or mdpi? ldpi , at least for the HTC Tattoo, using DensityMetrics and its densityDpi field. Is this a mistake? At minimum, it is unclear. But why haven't we been given the same for the small, medium, and large screen size categories? DPI is for density. Density has nothing to do with size. Ergo, there cannot be DPI ranges for size. Table 1 shows size buckets in inches compared to labels ( small , normal , large ).
