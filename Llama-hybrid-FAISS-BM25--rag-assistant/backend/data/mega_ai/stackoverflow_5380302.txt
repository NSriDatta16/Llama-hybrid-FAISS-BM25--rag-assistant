Best database building practice for members list

I want to make a members database for my association. We are a national organization that is composed by smaller local entities. I was wondering which practice would be better to organize my database in the mean of speed and overhead: Create one large table with all the members with a "local association" field for filtering. Create many tables, one for each group. (btw I'm working on joomla, if this could change something) EDIT: I'll make clearer the structure of the association. One member can be part of only one small local association at time. All member are part of the national association. For every member (and so every associations) the data fields are the same. Comment me if it's still not clear :)
