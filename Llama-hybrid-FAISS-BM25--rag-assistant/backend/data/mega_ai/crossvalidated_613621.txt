Drawing random numbers with quadrature

In a comment on this question, the user 'probabilityislogic' says "No, not MCMC this thing! Quadrature this thing! only 2 parameters - quadrature is the "gold standard" for small dimensional posteriors, both for time and accuracy". However I haven't been able to anything describing how to draw random variables using quadrature. How does one do it?
