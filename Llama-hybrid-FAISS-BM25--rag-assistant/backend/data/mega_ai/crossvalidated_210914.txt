How to calculate odds ratio per unit decrease of continuous variable

I have a logistic regression model obtained in R comparing association between two index diagnoses (0 or 1) with Age (continuous) + Sex (Factor) + Renal.Fn (continuous). My variable of interest is Renal.Fn . model Currently to obtain Odds Ratio: exp(coef(model))[4] # Renal.Fn 0.9884664 exp(confint(model))[[4]] # Renal.Fn 0.9848022 0.9920815 My interpretation: Per unit increase in renal function the odds of diagnosis of interest reduces. I wish to demonstrate the opposite. For example: Per unit decrease in renal function, the odds of diagnosis increases. Question: Is it correct to take 1 / exp(coef) to derive the odds per unit decrease? Is it subsequently correct to take 1/exp(coef) ^10 to derive odds per ten unit decrease?
