How do I make my neural network better at predicting sine waves?

Here, have a look: You can see exactly where the training data ends. Training data goes from $-1$ to $1$. I used Keras and a 1-100-100-2 dense network with tanh activation. I calculate the result from two values, p and q as p / q. This way I can achive any size of number using only smaller than 1 values. Please note I am still a beginner in this field, so go easy on me.
