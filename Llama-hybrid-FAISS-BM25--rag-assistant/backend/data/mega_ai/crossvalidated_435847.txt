Are confidence intervals only for a specific population parameter, like the mean? What about the whole population range, e.g. for outlier detection?

As someone with quite a weak understanding of statistics, I'd like to know: Is it possible to calculate confidence intervals for a population range in general from a sample? What I have learned so far is that I can calculate confidence intervals for an estimated population mean from a sample (where the mean and standard deviation is unknown) by using the t-distribution or normal distribution depending on my sample size using formulas like (where $S$ is the estimated population standard deviation of the sample, Bessel-corrected, and $n$ is the sample size): $$\bar{X} \pm t^*\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}$$ And I'd use the 'regular' normal distribution if somehow the population standard deviation was known: $$\bar{X} \pm z\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$ But this is all just for the population mean . What if I wanted to obtain a confidence interval whether a particular data point is part of the population or an outlier? For example, let's say I'm examining the length of dog tails, and I'm not interested in getting an accurate range for the average dog tail length, but rather if a specific tail length can be a dog's measurement or not. So I basically want a range or confidence interval that would be much larger, and then, when I have a measurement that lies outside this range (e.g. my dog tail range would be 5cm $\pm$ 4cm, but I get a measurement of 14cm; yes, the numbers are unrealistic), I can say something like "with 95% accuracy, this measurement is not from a dog". And this would then be different from the confidence interval for the mean of the dog tail length, which could be something like 5cm $\pm$ 1cm, i.e. much more precise, of course. Naively, I would believe that I can just use the sample mean (estimated population mean) and estimated population standard deviation for that like this: $$\bar{X} \pm z \cdot S$$ Would this be a correct procedure or completely wrong? Is it even possible to calculate a confidence interval for the whole population range (for outlier detection, for example) or is this confidence interval method just not suitable for that? If so, how would one define or calculate a range for the whole population?
