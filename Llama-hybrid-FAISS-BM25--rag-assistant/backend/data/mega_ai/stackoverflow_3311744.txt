jQuery: array of elements to raw html?

Let's say I have an array like this: var content = [ $(' ... '), $(' ... ') ]; I need to get the markup of the concatenated elements. So I need to convert content " into a raw string: " ... ... ". How can this easily be done? Seems like there should already be something in the framework to do this. Somehow maybe convert content into a document fragment and call .html() on the document fragment to get the markup?
