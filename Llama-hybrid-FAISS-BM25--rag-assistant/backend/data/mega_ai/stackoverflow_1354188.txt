Similar to @Jimmy Chandra's idea, but use a single link column. So, you might have these columns: ID | SortAfterID | OtherColumn1 | OtherColumn2 Now, let's say you have five records with IDs 1 through 5, and you want record 5 to be sorted between 2 and 3. Your table would look something like this: ID | SortAfterID | OtherColumn1 | OtherColumn2 1 | NULL | ... | ... 2 | 1 | ... | ... 3 | 5 | ... | ... 4 | 3 | ... | ... 5 | 2 | ... | ... I would set a constraint so that SortAfterID references ID. If you now wanted to insert a new record (ID = 6) that goes between 1 and 2, you would: Insert a new record with ID = 6 and SortAfterID = 1. Update record with ID = 2 so that SortAfterID = 6. I think this should be pretty low maintenance, and it's guaranteed to work no matter how many times you cram. The floating point number idea by @richardtallent should work as well, but as he mentioned, you could run into a limit. EDIT I just noticed the paragraph at the end of @richardtallent answer that mentions this same idea, but since I typed this all out, I figure I'll keep it here since it provides a little extra detail.
