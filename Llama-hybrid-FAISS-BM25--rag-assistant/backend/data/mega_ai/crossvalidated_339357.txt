Bayesian Interval Estimates for Multinomial Probabilities

Can anyone point me to a reference for calculating Bayesian interval estimates for multinomial probabilities? I am familiar with conventional methods (i.e.: Quesenberry and Hurst (1964), Goodman (1965), Bailey (1980), Fitzpatrick and Scott (1987), and Glaz and Sison (1999)). I have found methods to calculate intervals for differences between proportions (Piegorsch and Richwine (2001)). However, after reading for about two weeks, I cannot find a reference for Bayesian intervals for individual proportions. Thank you very much for assistance.
