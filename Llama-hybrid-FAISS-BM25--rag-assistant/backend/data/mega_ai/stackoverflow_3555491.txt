pass var to function() js with jquery

Just looking for the best practise way of doing this. I have a table listing information and in the last column is a button with "Edit/View". When the user clicks on the button a div area appears with more information which can be edited Code below with some fragments of jstl //Click on Edit/View on table $('.viewCustomer').click(function() { ....... }); ${customerBean.comName} ${customerBean.comCode} So my question would be: (1) how do i pass a variable to function $('.viewCustomer').click(function() (2) is this the best way of going about to do this. Is there a more efficient/secure/cleaner of doing this? Cheers Alexis
