How does having different scales on features make an elliptical contour plot?

I have been taking Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, and in the lesson on feature scaling's effect on gradient descent, I just can't understand how because of the different scales on the features cause an elliptical contour plot of the cost function. I made the inference from the contour plot that the cost function increases and decreases very rapidly with an increase of decrease in theta 1, and it increases or decreases very slowly with an increase or decrease in theta 2. (X1=Sq feet of the house. X2=Number of bedrooms.) But I still cant understand how having different ranges fuels that. Please help
