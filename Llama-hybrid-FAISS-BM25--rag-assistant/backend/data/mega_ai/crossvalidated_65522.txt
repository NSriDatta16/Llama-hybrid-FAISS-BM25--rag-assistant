+1 to @Greg Snow. In keeping with his non-parametric use ranks strategy, you could use ordinal logistic regression . This will allow you to fit a model with multiple factors and interactions between them. The relevant SAS documentation is here . There is a tutorial on how to do this in SAS at UCLA's excellent stats help website here , and another tutorial from Indiana University here .
