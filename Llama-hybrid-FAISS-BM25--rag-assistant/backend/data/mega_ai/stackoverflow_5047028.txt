Connect StackPanels and Border with a line

I have my own control which derives from StackPanel. This control contains two other controls, first Border (with TextBlock inside) and StackPanel (able to containes other StackPanels). Now, when I new StackPanel is added to the internal StackPanel I would like to draw a Line which could connect Border with a new added StackPanel. I guess this can be handle in code, so when I need StackPanel is added I could determine his and Border locations, and base on this I could draw a line. So my question is: can you see any other ways to achieve the same result? how can keep the link between Border and StackPanel when one of the items it is dragging the layout ? Thank you for your help BR Jarek
