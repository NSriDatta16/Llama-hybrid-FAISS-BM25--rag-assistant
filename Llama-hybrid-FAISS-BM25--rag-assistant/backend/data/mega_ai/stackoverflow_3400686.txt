XSLT comparing/sorting using a param passed from PHP

I'm having an issue doing conditional tests and sorts using params passed into the xsl file from PHP. I can do a match based on testing a string value, and can sort using an explicit name, but cannot get the variables to work in doing either. Here is the XSL and a fragment of the relevant XML. Washington DC Guided Day Tour Tours &amp; Sightseeing Full-day Tours City Tour Tours &amp; Sightseeing Bus &amp; Minivan Tours City Coach Tour Category : , ID: Description: $ Per person rate Select Tour Commences: Duration: This is my first real experience with XSLT and I can't get params to work how I am used to variables working, even after having read multiple well done answers on this site. I know the params are being passed and that they have the value I want as I replaced another variable reference. I need help on referencing the params in the correct way. Any help is appreciated, thanks. UPDATE: @Alejandro: I didn't include those as they're being changed dynamically and don't really have a default. (defaults to rank sorting anyways that's how the XML is formatted) (this is a string value) this is how I'm passing them with PHP: $processor->setParameter('', 'sortBy', 'v:'.$_GET['sort']); $processor->setParameter('', 'catGroup', 'Day Trips &amp; Excursions');
