The function numberAt() returns a number. It does this by extracting a string from the paragraph, and converting that string to a number. The function's parameters start , and length specify what part of the paragraph should be extracted. So numberAt(11,4) would extract a 4-digit string, starting with the 12'th character in the paragraph. Assuming that this string contains only digits, it will be converted to a 4-digit number, and returned. The - 1 is part of an arithmetic expression: numberAt(8,2) - 1 . The result will be one less than whatever number is returned by numberAt(8,2) .
