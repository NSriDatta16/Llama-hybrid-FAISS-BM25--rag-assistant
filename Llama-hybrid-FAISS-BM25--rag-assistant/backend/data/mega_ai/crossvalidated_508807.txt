Two ideas Idea 1: Geometry of Linear Regression Consider the angle between $\theta_1= $ , $\theta_2= $ and the angle between $\theta_3= $ where z is the projection of y into affine space span by x1,x2 the projection z should be "at most" y itself and "at least" parallels to x2. Since the angle between line and plane is by definition the minimum angle between line and arbitrage other line from plane Idea 2: Least Square Regression implemented by Successive Orthogonalization (The Elements of Statistical Learning, 2nd edition, page 54) Let's say in step 1 you orthogonalize x2. Depending on the orthogonalized x1 in step 2, you have R2 range from 0.4 and 1.0
