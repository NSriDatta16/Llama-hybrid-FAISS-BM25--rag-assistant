To model the global effects of co-variates such as exposure to advertising on joining/not-joining membership plans logistic regression is a useful approach. Modeling duration between exposures and joining/not-joining will require other more complicated forms of regression. After accounting for global effects, a tool from spatial statistics-- Moran's $I$ -- could be used for testing whether network effects are significant. The calculation of $I$ (which can be done using existing software such as the R package spdep ) relies on introducing a weight matrix $W$ with entries $w_{ij}$, representing the distance between two individuals. Obviously, in spatial statistics, distance retains its geographical interpretation; however, there is no reason $W$ could not be used with the host of distance measures used in social network analysis. For example, weights could be based on the Jaccard distance e.g. $w_{ij} = 1 - \frac{|N_i \cap N_j|}{|N_i \cup N_j|}$, where $N_i$ is the set of neighbors of individual $i$ and $|\cdot|$ represents the cardinality of a given set. To test for statistical significance of the observed $I$ from data that is not normally distributed (as would be expected from residuals from a logistic regression), one could use the bootstrap, sampling individuals and their neighbors at random with replacement, recalculating the weight matrix and then recalculating $I$. After repeating this procedure $B$ times the bootstrap $p$-value is the number of bootstrap $I$'s more extreme than the observed $I$ divided by $B$. Thus, roughly speaking, the procedure would involve first performing logistic regression, calculating a weight matrix based on a social dissimilarity measure between individuals, calculating $I$ with $W$ and the residuals from the regression, and then bootstrapping the data to test whether $I$ is significant.
