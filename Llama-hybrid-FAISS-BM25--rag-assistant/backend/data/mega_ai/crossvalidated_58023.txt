How to simulate a hidden Markov chain?

I want to simulate data from a 3-state hidden Markov chain with a known matrix of transition probabilities. Each state corresponds to a bivariate data with known marginals that the dependence between them is modeled by a copula. What is the best algorithm? Is there any function in R for such work?
