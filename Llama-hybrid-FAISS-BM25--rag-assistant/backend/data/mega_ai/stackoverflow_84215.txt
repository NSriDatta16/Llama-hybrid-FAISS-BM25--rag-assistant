I have now got the Mappoint control working but in a slightly different way. The control does appear on the list of controls the test container can use. I have tried reregistering it and unregistering it but still it doesn't appear on the list of controls when I try a "Insert ActiveX Control". However if I use "Add/Remove Toolbox Items" I can add it to the toolbox and then drag it into my app where it works fine. I'm not sure why this method works but it does and I can get on with my coding. Many thanks for all your help with this.
