If I understand your question... you are trying to execute a query without the page refreshing and have it populate a list. I would suggest looking into AJAX . Its a method of executing server-side scripts via javascript w/o the page refreshing. If you're using jQuery take a good look at the built-in AJAX api. Ajax is nicely pared with a markup language such as XML or JSON . Here is an (untested) example ajax call using jquery and php: ajax call $.ajax({ url: 'script.php', type: 'POST', timeout: 5000, data: "message=ajax", error: function() { alert("Request Failed"); }, success: function(response) { //Dynamically populate select list here. //example alerts Message: ajax alert(response); } }); script.php Message: " . $_POST['message']; } ?> Using an ajax call like this you will be able to execute a query in say, script.php, and return the results. I would suggest using JSON to organize the query results, it makes parsing the response object a lot easier.
