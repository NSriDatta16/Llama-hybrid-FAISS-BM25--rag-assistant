I don't really know mysql, only sqlserver, however, when using field names like "id" and table names like "system" i'd be sure to square bracket all of the table and columns names like so. Might be worth a shot? SELECT [system].[systemName], [organization].[officeSymbol] FROM [system] LEFT OUTER JOIN [organization] ON [system].[idOrganization] = [organization].[id]
