I'm afraid what do you want is not possible. A quick " evidence ": This would work just fine, but using its Graph API interpretation: This won't work! I don't think you should bother searching for a " workaround/hack " or trying to inspect and debug the photo page on facebook, because EVEN if you did find a way to use their like functionality externally I'm pretty sure that would get you into legal issues with Facebook! Now what I would do is, monitoring when the user " likes " a photo on your website and have a pop-up or a DIV under the LIKE button to encourage him to go the photo page in Facebook to support it (like it) there too! This can be done by using the edge.create event: FB.Event.subscribe('edge.create', function(response) { // Encourage the user to support your cause in Facebook too! $("div_with_a_link_to_the_photo_page_on_facebook").show(); // or using a dialog or whatever effect you like $("#facebook_support").dialog(); }); P.S: I'm using jQuery here Also to actually like facebook "objects" externally you need an application and something like my answer here , but I think you don't want to do that.
