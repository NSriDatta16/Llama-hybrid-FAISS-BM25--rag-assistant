App store homepage image

I uploaded an app to my country's app store, and it reached first place in top free in just 2 days! Well, I am not bragging, since nobody here cares anyway :p BUT! I think my app deserves to have a picture on the home page (the large image that previews applications in a 600x300 pixel rectangle [the size is approximate :P] ) Where can I include my design in the next update, so apple could see it and consider posting it? what is the size? (is my question even clear? :p)
