There is no "real distribution" of your data. There are models of the distribution of your data, and some are more useful than others. There are several ways to compare distributions. Fit distributional models to data using maximum likelihood. Compare the models based on their information criterion scores (e.g., AIC, BIC, DIC, WAIC). Fit distribution models to data using Bayesian methods. Once you have recovered the Bayesian posterior distribution, choose a series of test statistics, which are not parameters or sufficient statistics in the distribution model . Compute the posterior probability that the test statistic is at least as extreme as what is found in the data. The distribution model with the fewest "significant" Bayesian p-values is the best model. Of course, there is also the possibility of including all of the distribution models within some super Bayesian estimation model, which includes parameters dictating the relative weights of each of these models. That would be the best thing to do, but is often completely unfeasible.
