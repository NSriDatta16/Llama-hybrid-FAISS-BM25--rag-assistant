IF you are involved in a ERP implementation, getting the business processes right upfront can save you a lot of trouble down the road. Organisations know surprisingly little about their inner workings and it's the ERP developers that get the beating when their software doesn't fit to the company. If you can soften that clash of cultures by doing a bit of proper analysis before the development phase, then you are doing the right thing. BPMN is really one of the easiest and most simple methods there is for the job. Making up your own way of describing Business processes is just reinventing the wheel. Check out some of the free tools on the market; BizAgi for instance. Good luck.
