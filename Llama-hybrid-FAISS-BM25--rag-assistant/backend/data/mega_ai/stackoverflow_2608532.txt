You're right, you can't, and it has to do with the way the override functionality was created. PHP (unlike say, ruby) offers you no native way to override classes. Magento works around this by (for overridable classes) never using the new keyword new ClassName to create a class Instead they use a static factoryish method $object = Mage::getModel('/adminhtml/sales_order_view_tabs'); What get model does is look at the string /adminhtml/sales_order_view_tabs , and then reference the config files to see which class it should instantiate . Because parent classes are never instantiated, they can never be overridden.
