Such attitude has no scientific value, because none of its properties can be proven. Prediction can be anything, it may, or it may not correspond with the real values in the future. Even if you can show quality of the prediction on the training data, you can not prove its properties after the intervention, unless you have reliable knowledge from outside the data (which will be strong assumption, as you described in your description). This is the reason why you will not find such approach in causal inference papers. However, little companies seem to expect real causal inference. No one can tell if the result of this "predicted causal effect" will be close or not to actual causal effect of intervention. It depends on the quality of the prediction and hope, that no other intervention happened at the same time (structural parameters did not change). It may be ok, and company may be on quite accurate track, or not. Also, this approach seems to be somehow connected to ITS (Interrupted Time Series Designs). There is a lot of extensions of the simple ITS model, and maybe some of them are accurate to your setting. Take a look at McDowall et al. (2019). McDowall, David, Richard McCleary, and Bradley J. Bartos. Interrupted time series analysis . Oxford University Press, 2019.
