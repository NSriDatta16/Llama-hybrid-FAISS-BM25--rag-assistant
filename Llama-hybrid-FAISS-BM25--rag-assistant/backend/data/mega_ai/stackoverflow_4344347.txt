Linq allows you to simplify your code which is always good, as it makes code less fragile and easier to maintain - as long as your intent (as the developer) is clear. In my experience projects are only light on Linq usage if the development team don't understand the technology fully, or feel that it doesn't fit into their naive views on proper 'OO' architectures and patterns.
