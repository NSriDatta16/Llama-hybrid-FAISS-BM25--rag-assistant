I would create the HTML on server side, and use JavaScript to make some little refinements to the HTML. You cannot create an HTML page that is valid for all the browser, and detecting it from server side is not 100% sure; you cannot trust the user agent ID as many browsers make possible for the user to select a different one, and the only way to create HTML specific for a family of browser is to verify if the property being used is implemented. What I report is valid in general; in specific case, it could not be valid.
