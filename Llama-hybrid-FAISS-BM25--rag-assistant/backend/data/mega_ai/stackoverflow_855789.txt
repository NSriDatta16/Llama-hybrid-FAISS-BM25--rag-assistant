Given that any two people are as likely to disagree as agree on the amount of white space and indenting that makes the code readable, I'd suggest that whitespace is a poor choice of a contextual delimiter. I would make the language flexible with respect to whitespace rather than have the amount and placement of whitespace infer code organization.
