Google's own Closure Templates (Soy) strips whitespace at the end of the line by default, and the template designer explicitly inserts a space using {sp} . This probably isn't a good enough reason to switch away from PHP, but I just wanted to bring it to your attention. In addition, realize that HTML 4 allows you to exclude some tags, as recommended by the Page Speed documentation on minifying HTML (http://code.google.com/p/page-speed/wiki/MinifyHtml). You can exclude , , , etc. For a complete list of elements for which you can omit the end tag, search for " - O " in the HTML 4 DTD (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/dtd.html). You can even omit the , , , and tags entirely, as both start and end tags are optional (" O O " in the DTD). You can also omit the quotes around attributes (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.2.2) such as id , class (with a single class name), and type that have simple content (i.e., matches /^[-A-Za-z0-9._:]+$/ ). For attributes that have a single possible value, you can exclude the value (e.g., say simply checked rather than checked=checked ). Some people may find these tips repulsive because we've been conditioned for so many years to prepare for the upcoming world of simple LALR parsers for XHTML. Thus, tools like Dave Raggett's HTML Tidy generate HTML with proper closing tags and quotes around attribute values. But let's face it, all the browsers already have parsers that understand HTML 4, any new browser will use the HTML 5 parser rather than XHTML, and we should get comfortable writing HTML that is optimized for size. That being said, besides a couple large companies like Google and Facebook, my guess is that page size is a negligible component of latency, so if you're optimizing your own site it's probably because of your own obsessive tendencies rather than performance.
