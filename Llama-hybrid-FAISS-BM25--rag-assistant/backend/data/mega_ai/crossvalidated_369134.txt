Random Forest "out of bag" RMSE

Normally, I used a test set to calculate the RMSE of my RandomForest model. But currently I am using the whole data set in the Random Forest. I want to validate (RMSE) my model with the "out of bag error" (so an out of bag error, calculated as RMSE). Is that possible? I am looking specific for the RMSE, since I evaluate my other models with this metric. If I run (R, package: RandomForest): Rf_model it returns the Mean of squared residuals. But how can I get the RMSE?
