I am by no means an expert in this field but as far as I know you cannot estimate a population average model with R's lme4 package. If I am right then "population average models" use a "generalized estimating equation" (GEE) approach, see, e.g., To GEE or Not to GEE: Comparing Population Average and Mixed Models for Estimating the Associations Between Neighborhood Risk Factors and Health . You might want to search for R packages that can fit generalized estimating equations (GEE), for example the package geepack or gee .
