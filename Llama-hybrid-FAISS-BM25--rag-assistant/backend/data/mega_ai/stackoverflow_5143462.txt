I've never heard of anyone embedding PHP into an application and exposing internal methods to scripts in that way. Lua is designed for this use case as was Tcl, and JavaScript has traction there as well. I'd recommend dropping PHP as the effort required is probably not worth it. Python would be a good language to try next.
