I thought I did at the time but then just read and cached the results and then removed from cache instead. I'm searching for different result sequences (strings) that come about when sending a command. The next command sent can't assume that there are no longer any chars in the receive buffer since the protocol "standard" specifies that a response may end with a CR or LF or CRLF or LFCR or nothing. This protocol is implemented differently by different organizations since it is so loosely defined.
