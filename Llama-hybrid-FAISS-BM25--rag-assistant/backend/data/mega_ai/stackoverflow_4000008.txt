Using void pointers as template and function parameters in C#

Being a bit of a C++ fanatic, i am in desperate need of using void pointers in C#. The task at hand requires me to not know the type of a certain variable at compile time. So, i thought about preparing a structure with all the info needed to identify the type at runtime. Now, the idea would work in C++, however, C# isn't quite as C++.:wq In particular, i need to define a: private List >> mappings; The first problem starts here. .Net isn't letting me define eh KeyValuePair as . The error i get is: Error 3 The type 'void*' may not be used as a type argument. The error message is quite straightforward, however, having the possibility of doing this will save me a couple of days of work. The second problem is in the same neighborhood. I need to define this function: public unsafe void addMapping(string name, string internal_name, void* storage) again, not allowed, in this case: Error 2 The type 'void*' may not be used as a type argument Is there some way around these issues? Thanks for the help!
