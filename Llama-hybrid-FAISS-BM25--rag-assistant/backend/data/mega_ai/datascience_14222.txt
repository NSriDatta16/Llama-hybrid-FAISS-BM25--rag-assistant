Extract 2 pieces of information from a string - what to use?

First of all, I am a complete newbie in regard to data science and I am not asking for the complete solution but some guidance as to what I should read up to achieve my task (what algorithms, techniques etc are used to tackle similar problems). I have different lists of strings which contain one or two useful pieces of information I would like to extract. In the following is an example I need to extract the bold and italic part from each line. This is just an example though, eventually I will need to end up with a process I can apply to different lists with different context. Here's a small sample from a list of 500: 50" Sony KDL 50W756CSAEP Smart LED Full HD 55" Samsung UE55JU6400 Smart LED HD LG 55LF652V 55" SMART 3D FULL HD HITACHI 55HGW69 55'' LED ULTRA SMART WIFI TV 65" SAMSUNG UE65KS7500 4K LED Smart In my full list I have already manually extracted the brand and model . So what I need now is a way to automate the process for a new list containing more brands and models. I thought I could go about this heuristically but since I am not just doing this for this type of data it won't work well. So can someone give me some suggestions on a good way to go about it? Thanks!
