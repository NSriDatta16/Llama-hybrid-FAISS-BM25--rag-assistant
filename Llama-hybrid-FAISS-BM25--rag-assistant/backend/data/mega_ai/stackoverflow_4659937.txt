DIV wtih overflow:auto causes the div to become larger than its actual size

Im creating a website with paragraph content in it. What I have here is the which is my container div and the actual content that is 100% of the height of mainContent, but only 50% of the width. I want there to be 15px padding around the actual content inside of the aboutLeft. My problem is that when I use overflow:auto to for the scrollbars I am extending my content 30px outside of the #mainContent div and I have no clue why its doing this. Any suggestions to change this would be great. Thanks, meepz https://i.stack.imgur.com/JLICh.jpg #outerDiv #mainContent{ position:relative; height:560px; margin:0; padding:0; background-color:#fff; border-style: solid; border-width:1px; } #mainContent #aboutLeft{ padding:15px; position:absolute; width:55%; height:560px; left:0; top:0; overflow:auto }
