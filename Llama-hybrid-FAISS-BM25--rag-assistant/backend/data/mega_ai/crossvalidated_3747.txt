Rob Hyndman recently posed a question about detecting outliers in multivariate data . The answers may provide a couple of possible approaches (and otherwise, you may want to put the question of finding 2-d outliers in a separate question). And you can average your remaining GPS data component by component - add all the first components up and divide by the number of points, that will give you the first component of the average. Same with the second components. This averaging can be weighted by HDOP. Sum up the products of the first component, multiplied with the corresponding HDOP score, and divide the sum by the sum of the HDOP scores. Same with the second components. I'll take the liberty of removing the "normal-distribution" tag...
