What are the priors in Bayesian Neural Network?

So I have knowledge of Bayesian statistics/econometrics, but I only recently found out about Bayesian Neural Networks. I was wondering what the priors are in a Bayesian Neural Network? And is it possible to give an importance weight to different input features? Or have the ability to shrink features with a prior? Basically, I am trying to see if Neural Networks can be used in a setting where the number of observations is not very large by performing feature selection. However, instead of feature selection I thought about including all features and give prior weights to the features based on the outcomes of the feature selection step. Is this possible?
