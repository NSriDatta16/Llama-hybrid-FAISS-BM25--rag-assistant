Most of web-based font embedding technologies died a painful death. For example, Microsoft's take on it was, guess what, IE-only, so other browsers couldn't render it. Naturally, web designers didn't want to go this way. The new CSS standard has support for font embedding, IIRC. So far, no browser supports it. If you want just headings done in your specific font, I would suggest pre-rendering them, using sIFR, or SVG (I use dynamically rendered SVG, but often my headings are 2Mb in size). If you want the whole text done with your font, well, tough luck - there is no easy way of doing this at the moment. Though if you take into account that the majority of users still use IE =sigh= then you could try going with Microsoft's WEFT and see if it works for you. Bear in mind, though, that lots of fonts intended for print don't have the same quality of hinting that something like Georgia would have. Good luck!
