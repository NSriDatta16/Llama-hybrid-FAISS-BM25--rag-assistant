Visual Basic 6.0 form designer - cannot drag to move objects

I am a newbie for Visual Basic 6 project. I downloaded some tutorials for testing; however, I am not able to drag, move, or edit the UI form designer objects in those projects. Does anybody know there is an object lock function in VB6? If there is, how can I unlock it?
