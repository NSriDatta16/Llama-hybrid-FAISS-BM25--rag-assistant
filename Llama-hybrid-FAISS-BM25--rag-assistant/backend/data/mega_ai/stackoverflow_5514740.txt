Is there any point to unset($this) in destructor?

I came across one class and what cought my attention right away was this: public function __destruct() { unset($this); } My first thought was that this is just plain stupidity, it fact it looked so idiotic that I thought that either there really is a good reason to do this or the author is just clueless Any thoughts? Any reasons to do this?
