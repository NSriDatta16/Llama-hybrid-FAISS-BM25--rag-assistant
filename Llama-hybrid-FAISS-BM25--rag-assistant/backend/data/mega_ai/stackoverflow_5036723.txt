IIS7 shortcut redirects to original location

I'm using git to test out a dojo widget I'm developing. I am developing this with someone on a *nix machine and I'm running into issues with how everything is put together. dojo is organized by a folder convention and git wants everything to be inside a single folder. The other coder on *nix is using symlinks to place the files where they need to be within the dojo folder structure but creating shortcuts to these files on windows, which i see as being the windows equivalent, causes IIS to redirect to the shortcut origin location breaking all of the relative paths within the file. Is there a more proper way to do this since coping pasting the files where they need to be from the git repository is a PITA. Is there a better way to do this.
