Could you please explain more with specific examples about your following statement? The dataset has around 100 features and all are unknown (in terms of what actually they represent). Basically they are just numbers. I'm not sure how can you do Feature Engineering without good understanding of your Data Set and the given attributes!! Tabular data is described in terms of observations or instances (rows) that are made up of variables or attributes (columns). An attribute could be a feature. "The idea of a feature, separate from an attribute, makes more sense in the context of a problem. A feature is an attribute that is useful or meaningful to your problem. It is an important part of an observation for learning about the structure of the problem that is being modeled. ... ... ... In computer vision, an image is an observation, but a feature could be a line in the image. In natural language processing, a document or a tweet could be an observation, and a phrase or word count could be a feature. In speech recognition, an utterance could be an observation, but a feature might be a single word or phoneme.
