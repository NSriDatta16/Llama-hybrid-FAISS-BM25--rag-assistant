Mixed effects in Random forest (in R)

Is it possible to include mixed effects into a random forest model in R? I know about the lmer (from lme4 ) and randomForest (from randomForest) functions but it would be nice if I could combine the two in some way, if that makes sense. I'm afraid that if I don't include random effects in my random forest model, it will be incorrect.
