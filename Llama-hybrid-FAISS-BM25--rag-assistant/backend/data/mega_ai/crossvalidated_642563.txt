How to analyze uncorrelated data?

Sometimes we encounter data that is uncorrelated. Specifically, from the correlation matrix we observe that the target variable shows low or no correlation with any of the features. To provide context, I am working on a predictive maintenance project. I am asking in relation to tabular data containing continuous or categorical variables. My question is concerned with such type of data for general applications, not specifically PdM. How to implement machine learning or deep learning on such type of data? Do we need to perform any specific types of pre-processing? Are there algorithms that are suitable for such problems?
