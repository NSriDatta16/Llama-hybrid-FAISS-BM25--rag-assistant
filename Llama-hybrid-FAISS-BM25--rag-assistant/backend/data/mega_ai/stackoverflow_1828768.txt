Cakephp Shopping Cart

I was wondering which php based carts will be the easiest to integrate with cakephp. I've heard about bakesale but I have no info on it whether is up to par with magento, cubecart or other carts out there. It's been a while since they have updated info on bakesale (August 2008). So if anyone has any info how reliable and secure bakesale is or is it better to use other php carts any info wil be appreciated.
