Man, that is a loaded question. You could write an entire book answering this question (some have). In all honesty though, a great place I started was looking up 'checklists'. One that I use for reference is located here: http://office.microsoft.com/download/afile.aspx?AssetID=AM102552101033 It has helped immensely for not just requirements gathering, but also for infrastructure requirements, storage, etc. I agree with maxam . Users barely (if ever) know what they need in regards to MOSS. They may know what they need to solve their business problem, just not how to do it in SharePoint. That's where you will come in.
