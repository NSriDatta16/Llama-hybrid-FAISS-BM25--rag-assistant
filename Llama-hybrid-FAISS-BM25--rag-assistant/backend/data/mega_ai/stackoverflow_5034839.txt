Emacs: pop-up bottom window for temporary buffers

I would like to have a pop-up bottom window for temporary buffers like compilation , Completions , etc. It should split-vertically the whole frame even if root window was split horizontally. For example: Before M-x compile: +------+------+ | | | | | | | | | +------+------+ After: +------+------+ | | | +------+------+ | | +------+------+ I'm absolutely satisfied with ecb-compilation-window , but I don't want to use ECB and CEDET. Actually I see two ways make described behavior but both have their drawbacks. Use split-root.el module. Drawback: it uses delete-other-windows function and then rebuilds previous windows tree after root window is split as required. It invalidates all references to existed earlier windows in your code(or code of any module). Set window-min-height variable to its minimal possible value(1) and call split-window-vertically during emacs startup minimizing window height after it's created. Then use this window for temporary buffers setting its height as required. Drawbacks: Small annoying window with annoying modeline on the bottom of the frame, doesn't work with emacs --daemon. Are there more elegant ways to do that without drawbacks ?
