Calculate the number of times to divide by two

Greetings. I have a java method that I consider expensive, and I'm trying to replace some calls to it with a mathematical expression. Problem is, I suck at math. I mean really suck. The following should explain the pattern that I'm trying to exploit. f(x) -> y f(x*2) -> f(x)+1 That is, whenever I double the value for x, the value for y will be 1 greater than for x/2. Here are some example output: f(5) -> 6 f(10) -> 7 f(20) -> 8 f(40) -> 9 f(80) -> 10 f(160) -> 11 f(320) -> 12 My current approach is brute force. I'm looping over the X and test how many times I can halve it before I reach 5, and finally I add 6. This works and is faster than the call to the original method. But I was looking for a more "elegant" or potentially cheaper solution. Accepted answer goes to the one who manages to help me without pointing out how stupid I am :) (the title probably sucks, because I don't know what I'm looking for)
