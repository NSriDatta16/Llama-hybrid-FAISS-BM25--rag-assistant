The other answers already cover what Code Coverage is. The think I'd like to stress is that you need to be careful not to treat high coverage as implicitly meaning you've tested all scenarios. It doesn't necessarily say how well you've tested the code or the quality of your tests, just that you've hit a certain percentage of code as part of the tests running. High Code Coverage does not necessarily mean High Test Quality, but High Test Quality does mean High Code Coverage In practice, I usually aim for 90-95% code coverage which is often achievable. The last few % are often too expensive to be worth trying to hit.
