The confidence interval (CI) you have calculated is your measure of precision in estimating the population parameter. A wide CI would indicate low precision, and a narrow CI would indicate high precision. Interpretation of precision would depend on the nature of the scale or whatever measure you are using. The 95% CI you have calculated from your sample data is one in an infinite sequence of potential confidence intervals. The 95% CI will differ each time a replication of your study is performed. Most likely the interval will capture the population parameter you want to estimate (where the point estimate is our best estimate of this parameter), but sometimes by chance the 95% CI will not contain the population parameter. However, in the long run, 95% of the CIs you calculate will contain the population parameter you are trying to estimate. This is why it is important to envision your study as just one observation among many, which at a later time can be meta-analysed to provide an estimate of the true population parameter. The 95% CI is also a prediction interval. That is, on average, a 95% CI has about an 83% chance of capturing the mean of a near replication of your study. See Cumming, G., & Maillardet, R. (2006).
