Your "of course incorrect" comments are...incorrect. With 10 cupcakes, you subset to the 8 which are not sent for refrosting. By definition of independence, the chance these are thrown out is $0.1$, so that $0.8$ cupcakes are expected to be thrown out. However this $0.8$ is the NUMBER of cupcakes thrown out (out of 8), whereas you're interested in the probability of a given non-refrosted cupcake being thrown out, which is $0.8/8=0.1$. Also you are declaring that 1 cupcake out of 8 was thrown out. This is wrong because $C$ is independent of $B$, which means that there's a $0.1$ chance a cupcake gets thrown out, regardless of whether or not it is re-frosted. In other words, out of the 10 cupcakes, you can't just say that 1 cupcake gets thrown out AND that cupcake was not refrosted.
