I do belive that the RAD Tools doesnt give u a flexible hand on the code. However if any specific RAD tool is saving 60-70 percent of the development time, worth investing time in it. Now-a-days Skilled developers are at the peak demand. This leads to increase in the attrition ratios. Dependable developers are resigning just for 5/10 % of raise in payscales. This impacts the Development Companies a lot. The one, who has done the most of the development, suddenly leaves. This hits the project completion schedule severely. RAD Tools makes the organization less dependent on the Skilled Developers. Most importantly, most of the Customers are least bothered about WHAT technology you are using for development. They are happy if their Functional Requirements are met. All said and done, RAD tools will have an increasing demand in the present scenario, where attrition is high. Most of the projects get dragged out of the schedule just because of this dependence. The readers might differ.
