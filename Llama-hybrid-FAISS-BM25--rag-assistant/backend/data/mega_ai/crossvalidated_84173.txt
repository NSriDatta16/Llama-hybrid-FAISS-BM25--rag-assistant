Discrete Time Markov Chain - Inventory

Let $D_n$ be the demand for an item at a store on day $n$. Suppose that $D_n$ is a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with probability mass function: $p_k = P(D_n = k)$ Suppose the store follows the following inventory management policy. If inventory at the end of the $n$th day (i.e., after satisfying the demands during the day) is above $s$ the store does nothing. If it is less than $s$, then the store orders enough amount to bring inventory at the beginning of the next day up to $S$. Assume the inventory delivery is instantaneous. Let $X_n$ be the amount of inventory in the store at the beginning of the $n$th day. Model $X_n$ as a DTMC. Not sure how to deal with the probability mass function. I guess it would mean its equal but not sure how to put that in any other way rather than $p_k$. Nor do I understand how to deal with S.
