Best way to visualize predictions from a linear model

Let's say I'm doing some predictive analytics and am trying to predict US GDP per month using a two or three month lag. After every month, I generate new predictions and am able to compare my prediction to the actual gap. What would be the best way to represent this via plot. Line chart? In all the research I've done, there doesn't seem to be a 'standard' way to visually represent time series predictions compared to the actual values over time.
