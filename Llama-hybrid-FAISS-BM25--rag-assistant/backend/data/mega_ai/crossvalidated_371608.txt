What does "middle of the data" really mean?

I have some noisy time series data for different climate variables and I want to know overall if they are increasing or decreasing with time. From this Water Resources Statistics Guide , the LOWESS smoothing method will help to so and the values obtained from a LOWESS smooth represent the "middle or center of the data." So.. are the values obtained from LOWESS smoothing essentially an average? When I do my write up is it correct to say something like "from the LOWESS smoothing, the average temperature increases over time." And what about regression in general? Linear regression fits a line to the "middle" of your data.. but can that also be thought of as an average?
