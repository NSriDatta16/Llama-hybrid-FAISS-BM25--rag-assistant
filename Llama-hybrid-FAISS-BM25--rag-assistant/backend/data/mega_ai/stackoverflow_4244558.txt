Depending on the language used, you may not be able to use a single file. This is the case in Java for instance. Using one file per class is the proper way to do it, because it gives you a common point between your file organisation and your class design, which is helpful for managing the source code. Dont forget to use a parent class is there is common source code between the classes.
