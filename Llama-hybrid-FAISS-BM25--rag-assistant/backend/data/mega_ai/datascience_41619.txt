Convolutional neural networks for non-image applications?

If I remember correctly, Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have first been developed for image classification purposes (see work from LeCun et al.). The convolution process that "slides" over the input image is helpful indeed to detect some features. Question: do you have examples of successful application of CNN for non-image data?
