As others have said, there may not be an easy / great solution. An (albeit hacky) solution might be to shell out to the 'tracert' system call. Ex: tracert google.com This call will return a list of all routers in between your PC and google.com (or whatever external site.) You can then iterate through the results, taking the first node that isn't a private IP address range. (I.e., not 192.168. . , etc.) Granted, this is by no means an elegant solution. However, it might give you the info you need. As a test, you can simply run the above from a command line and see if it's helpful.
