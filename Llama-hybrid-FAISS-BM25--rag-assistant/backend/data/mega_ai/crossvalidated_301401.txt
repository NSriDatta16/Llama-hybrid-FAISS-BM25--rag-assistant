Improper distribution $1/\tau ^2$ ~ $\infty$

Gelman et al. pg.52 (Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd Ed) state that We return to the problem of estimating the mean $\theta$ of a normal model with known variance $\sigma^2$, with a $N(\mu_0,\tau_0^2)$ priot distribution on $\theta$. If the prior precision, $1/\tau_0^2$, is small relative to the data precision, $n/\sigma^2$ , then the posterior distribution is approximately as if $\tau_0^2=\infty$: $$p(\theta|y)\approx N(\theta|\bar{y},\sigma^2/n).$$ I am not sure I follow this. Here's the reason why. Assume a $Likelihood$, ~$N(\theta, 5)$ $Prior$, ~ $N(4, 8)$ $Prior Precision$, $1/\tau_0 ^2$ = $1/8$ = $0.125$ $Data Precision$, $n/\tau ^2$ = $1/5$ = $0.2$ ( for a single data point) $Posterior Precision$, $1/\tau_{post} ^2$ = $1/\tau_{0} ^2$ + $1/\sigma ^2$ = $1/5$ + $1/8$= $0.3125$ How is this ($1/\tau_{post} ^2$) ~ $\infty$ ? I get some reasonable finite value ? Will be interested in your thoughts on this topic.
