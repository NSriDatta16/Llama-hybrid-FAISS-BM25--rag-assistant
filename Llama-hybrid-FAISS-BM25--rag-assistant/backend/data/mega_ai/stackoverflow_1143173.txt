First of all, the plot.svm function assumes that the data varies across two dimensions. The data you have used in your example is only one-dimensional and so the decision boundary would have to be plotted on a line, which isn't supported. Secondly, the function seems to need a data frame as input and you are working with vectors. This should work... library(e1071) day = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6) weather = c(1,0,0,0,0,0,0) happy = factor(c(T,F,F,F,F,F,F)) d = data.frame(day=day, weather=weather, happy=happy) model = svm(happy ~ day + weather, data = d) plot(model, d)
