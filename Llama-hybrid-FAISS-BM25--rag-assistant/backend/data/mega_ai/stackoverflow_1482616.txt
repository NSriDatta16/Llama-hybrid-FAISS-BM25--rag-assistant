urllib (simple but a bit rough) and urllib2 (powerful but a bit more complicated) are the recommended standard library modules for grabbing data from a URL (either to memory or to disk). For simple-enough needs, x=urllib.urlopen(theurl) will give you an object that lets you access the response headers (e.g. to find out the image's content-type) and data (as x.read() ); urllib2 works similarly but lets you control proxying, user agent, coockies, https, authentication, etc, etc, much more than simple urllib does.
