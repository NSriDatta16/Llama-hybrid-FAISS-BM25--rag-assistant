Develop web project using ASP.NET MVC ver 1

Does anyone have an experience with developing a big web app using ASP.NET MVC ver 1? If yes: What troubles can be expected? What are the biggest risks? What are the main points the attention should be paid for? Is there any alternative for ASP.NET MVC right now? And how reasonable this can be? Thanks in advance
