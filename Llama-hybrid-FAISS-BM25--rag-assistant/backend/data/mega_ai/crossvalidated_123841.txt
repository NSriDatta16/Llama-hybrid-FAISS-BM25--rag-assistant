Formatting Time-series data for Cross-correlation

In an experiment we measured 100 response times for each subject. The data has the following format: ID Trial ResponseTime ResponseTime(Z) 1 1 1000 ... 1 2 1200 1 3 1100 . . . . . . . . . 2 1 700 2 2 900 2 3 800 In SPSS I would like to compute the cross-correlation between participants' performance for the (z-transformed) time series: Trial (x) 1 2 3 ID1 (y1) 1000 1200 1100 ID2 (y2) 700 900 800 Upon visual inspection the time-series appear similar but lagged. I wish to use the SPSS cross-correlations command, but need to reformat the data prior to input to allow comparisons across trials between subjects. How should I reformat the data? Solutions in SPSS, R, or MATLAB are welcome.
