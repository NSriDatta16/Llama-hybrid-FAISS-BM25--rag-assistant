Compile swf at runtime via C#?

I'd like to know if it's possible to compile an .swf file at runtime via C# (would be called via a Flex Application). I've read some articles about using fsch.exe, but nothing that gave any concrete examples. I'm fairly certain this is possible, so a secondary question is whether it's feasible on a medium scale. I'd like to allow users to configure an swf, and then compile those settings directly into the swf for delivery rather than relying on external data storage for holding configuration details. Thanks in advance for any assistance you can offer - Bill
