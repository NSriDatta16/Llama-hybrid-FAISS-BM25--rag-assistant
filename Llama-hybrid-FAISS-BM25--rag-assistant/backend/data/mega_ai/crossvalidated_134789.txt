Interpretation of ivreg() diagnostics in R

I'm trying to wrap my head around interpreting the diagnostics of the ivreg() command in R, from the {AER} package. Running the example code provided in the help page: ## data data("CigarettesSW", package = "AER") CigarettesSW$rprice You get the following output: Call: ivreg(formula = log(packs) ~ log(rprice) + log(rincome) | log(rincome) + tdiff + I(tax/cpi), data = CigarettesSW, subset = year == "1995") Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.6006931 -0.0862222 -0.0009999 0.1164699 0.3734227 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 9.8950 0.9288 10.654 I'm interested in the interpretation of the diagnostic tests. Does this mean the instruments are weak or no? What does the Wu-Hausman mean, given that it is significant on 10% level? Sargan not being significant means what?
