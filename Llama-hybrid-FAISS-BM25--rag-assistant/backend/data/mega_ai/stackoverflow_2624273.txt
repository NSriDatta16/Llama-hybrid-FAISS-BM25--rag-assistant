why develop in windows/desktop application?

Just wondering what your comments are regarding the current trend as everything is moving to the web or even the cloud. The significance of an OS or desktop application is getting less attention than web application. So to those folks out there who still develop windows applications, such as WPF. Why still do it? Why not move to web programming? Silverlight instead for example...
