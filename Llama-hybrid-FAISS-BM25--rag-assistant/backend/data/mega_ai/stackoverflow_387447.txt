The "You're Doing It Wrong!!" feeling

NB - This question is not a stab at RoR or at Redmine's plugin system I have been working on a custom plugin for Redmine , a project manager platform built with Ruby on Rails (RoR). Now I am not really a RoR or for that matter, a Ruby guy. I have managed to write the plugin and everything works, despite being a mess behind the scenes. The "You're Doing It Wrong!!" feeling is coming from the fact that I know RoR is a highly-regarded framework, so there must be simple, better, elegant, [insert best-practice term here], ways of doing what I have done. I am not too concerned with making this code as perfect as possible, for the sole reason that this is only used internally, and really, people only care that it "works" (I am the only one who will look at the code). What words of wisdom can be passed on to suppress the "You're Doing It Wrong!!" feeling? I am pretty sure if this feeling is present, then it is probably true that the task at hand is being done wrong.
