Android ListView is not behaving properly

I am working on a custom ListView for purchasing items in a store front. You can scroll the list and read product descriptions as well as see product images. For items the user already owns I've pragmatically changed the color of the title (of the product on the list) to a different color so the user can easily identify, "I already own that". The error I am seeing appears when I scroll to the bottom of the list, and then back to the top. After the UI has been built the titles all color properly, after a complete scroll and return to the top however, the currently owned products are still red and the item under it on the list turns to the "owned" status as well. This will continue happening each time you scroll down the list and back up until the whole list turns into the owned state. I am not editing my List of products, and this happens on all adapters in my project. Each is unique in the way it populates the product list. Is there some way I can persist a list of items and tell the View that once its built no more UI changes need be scheduled? Thanks, Robert
