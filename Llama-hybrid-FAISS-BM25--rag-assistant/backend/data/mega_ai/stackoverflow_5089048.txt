The XML fragment given by the OP looks well-formed. Neither the apostrophe nor the i-circumflex needs escaping. The most likely problem is that the XML is encoded using iso-8859-1, but lacks an XML declaration, so the parser think it is in UTF-8 encoding. The solution then is to add the XML declaration , which tells the parser how to decode the characters. (For a document containing only ASCII characters, iso-8859-1 and utf-8 are indistinguishable, so this problem only surfaces when you use characters outside the ASCII range). A word of advice: if you had given the error message generated by the parser, you wouldn't have got so many incorrect answers.
