Using log transformations and lagged features are two separate techniques that could be combined together. In linear models, when regressors ${x_1, x_2..x_n}$ have multicollinearity one possible affect is estimators having high variance. When using log-transformations the fitted model can learn non-linear interactions between regressions and target( $y$ ). When a model has the ability to learn non-linear interactions its possible the multicollinearity affect on estimators variance decreases. In time series data there are good reasons to believe that both regressors and target are highly correlated(linearly) with their corresponding lagged values - $Abs(corr(x^1_i,x^1_{i-1}))..., Abs(corr(y_1, y_{i-1}))$ are high. If including lagged values as regressors: $y_t = \gamma * y_{t-1} +\alpha_1*x^1_t + .. + \beta_1 * x^1_{t-1}+..$ Its common that post fit analysis will reveal $y_{t-1}$ to explain most of the variance. One method 'de-correlating' lagged features is modeling the differences, I.E: $z_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$ $w^1_t = x^1_t - x^1_{t-1}$ ... $z_t = \theta_1 * w^1_t + \theta_2*w^2_t + ..$ If lagged regressors $(w^1, w^2, ...)$ show multicollinearity, it might makes sense to include non linear relationships using the log-transformed model(on the lagged regressors). Hope this helps
