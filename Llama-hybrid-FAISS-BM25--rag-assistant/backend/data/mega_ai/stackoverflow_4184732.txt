If I understand your data, blank lines are not a reliable indicator, because they can appear before a keyword's text begins, after the text, or not at all. If that's the case, I don't think it will help to read the text in "paragraph mode" (by setting $/ to an empty string). Similarly, the blank lines do not help -- at least not in a simple way -- to identify the start and end of the keyword sections or the "blocks". You are going to have to parse the text in a more fine-grained way, but you haven't given us enough information to provide a detailed answer. Here's an example that simply stores the non-blank lines by keyword: use strict; use warnings; my (%data, $keyword); while (my $line = ){ next unless $line =~ /\S/; chomp $line; if ($line =~ /^Keyword/){ $keyword = $line; } else { push @{$data{$keyword}}, $line; } } __DATA__ Keyword1 data1 a Keyword2 data2 a data2 b data2 c Keyword3 data3 a data3 b Keyword4 data4 a data4 b
