The answer, I found, lies in downloading the 187MB IDE installer from springsource.org, which has respective downloads for Eclipse 3.5, 3.6, 32 bit, 64 bit, Windows, Mac and Linux. Like scala IDE, Spring IDE is hardcoded to certain Eclipse Platform micro release. Even though my Eclipse has the same release and down to the same release date and time, the micro-release identification was different from the one required/specified by the spring updates. Therefore, even though SpringSource documents two ways of getting Spring IDE, one by providing an update url for your current Eclipse download SpringSource's own Eclipse IDE as a whole kabootle. Method 1 is workable if you already had a previous Spring IDE installed. Thousands apologies to SpringSource for my road rage.
