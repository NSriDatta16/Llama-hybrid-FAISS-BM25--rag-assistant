Seeing that you already addressed the Flash issue the next issue I see is that you don't seem to be putting the player view anywhere. You either need to put the view somewhere in your hierarchy or set myPlayer.fullscreen = TRUE; Without knowing more about your views I can't give you advice on embedding it but check out this bit of sample code from Apple to see how they do it: http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/mediaplayer/reference/MPMoviePlayerController_Class/MPMoviePlayerController/MPMoviePlayerController.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006953-CH3-DontLinkElementID_1
