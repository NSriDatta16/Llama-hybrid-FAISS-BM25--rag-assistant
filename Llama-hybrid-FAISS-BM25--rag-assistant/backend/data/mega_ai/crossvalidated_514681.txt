"The parameter sharing used in recurrent networks relies on the assumption that the same parameters can be used for different time-steps". I think this is valid because the RNN is taught to be timestep agnostic in a sense that it conditions on the context $h_{t - 1}$ and on the input $x_t$ , so in this case it doesn't depend on the $t$ itself. I think by stationarity they mean that if the context is same and the input is same, the output will be same regardless of the t (so in a sense it's different than fitting a linear regression which is directly dependent on $t$ ).
