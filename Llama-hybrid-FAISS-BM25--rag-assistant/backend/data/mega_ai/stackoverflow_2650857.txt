If you're modifying or returning the string, use std::string . If not, accept your parameter as a const char* unless you absolutely need the std::string member functions. This makes your function usable not only with std::string::c_str() but also string literals. Why make your caller pay the price of constructing a std::string with heap storage just to pass in a literal?
