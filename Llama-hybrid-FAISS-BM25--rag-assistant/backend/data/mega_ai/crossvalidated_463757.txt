Random Forest Notation Confusion

I've been trying to mathematically understand the random forest algorithm but I've been confused with the notation. In these slides (page 17), it is stated: Let $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, ..., x_d)$ be a microarray of a glioma cancer sample in its initial stages. Then each feature $x_i$ is a random variable with some distribution. For fixed $i$ , let $X_i$ be a model random variable whose probability distribution is the same as the $x_i$ numbers in the microarray. Then the model random vector $\mathbf{X} = (X_1, ..., X_d)$ has a joint distribution which is the same as our microarray samples $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, ..., x_d)$ . Traditionally lower case $x$ 's are referred to in probability and statistics as realizations (or observations) and bigger case $X$ 's are referred to as random variables. My question regarding this paragraph is what is meant here by model random vector and why is $\mathbf{x}$ referred to as a random vector rather than the sample observations? In page 19, it is stated that: Assume training set of microarrays: $$D = \{(\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), ..., (\mathbf{x}_n, y_n)\}$$ drawn randomly from a (possibly unknown) probability distribution $(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) \sim (\mathbf{X}, Y)$ . Here the training set is given by $D = \{(\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), ..., (\mathbf{x}_1, y_1)\}$ and in another paper (page 4) the training sample is given by $\mathcal{D}_n = ((\mathbf{X}_1 , Y_1 ), ... , (\mathbf{X}_n , Y_n))$ , what is the difference between the two? is $D$ an observed sample while $\mathcal{D}_n$ is an unobserved sample? And finally is $\mathbf{x}$ and $D$ the same (an $n \times m$ matrix)? Sorry for the primitive questions and thanks is advance.
