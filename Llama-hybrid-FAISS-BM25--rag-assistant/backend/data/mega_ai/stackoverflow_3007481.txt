If you take a DOM approach, you can traverse the two trees simultaneously while comparing nodes (node type, text, attributes) as you go. A recursive solution will be the most elegant - just short-circuit further comparison once a pair of nodes are not "equal" or once you detect a leaf in one tree when it's a branch in another, etc.
