Multivariate/interaction prediction from glmm

Previously I have asked how to calculate the predicted response for groups (split by two categorical variables) given a single continuous fixed effect, in a glmm. Now I would like to take it one step further; to estimate a predicted response when there are two continuous variables ($X_1$ and $X_2$). Continuing from my previous question, assume the model: mod = MCMCglmm(Life ~ X1*X2*Sex*Group, random = ~ Pop:Year, rcov = ~units, family = "gaussian", start = list(QUASI = FALSE), data = DF1) where sex has two levels ($M$ and $F$) and group has two levels ($LO$ and $LL$). How do I then predict the lifespan (Y) for each group under two continuous variables? For example, how could I predict the lifespan for males from group LO, when I have known values of $X_1$ and $X_2$. Note: The plan is to a) examine the difference between the groups at given values of $X_1$ and $X_2$ and b) plot surfaces (contour plots) for each group across a spectrum of $X_1$ and $X_2$ values - tips on implementation in R would be useful too.
