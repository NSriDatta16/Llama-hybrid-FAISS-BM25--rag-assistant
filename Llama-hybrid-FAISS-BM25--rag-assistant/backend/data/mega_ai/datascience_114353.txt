Average number of records by ID

I have a dataframe with IDs and booking refs, looking like the simplified example below. ID BookingRef 001 2019/32323 002 2011/23232 002 2017/7u4922 In the above example, 001 has one booking and 002 has two bookings in total so the average number of bookings for customers is 1.5. How could I calculate this for millions of records using python and pandas?
