Scripting YSlow and/or PageSpeed

As I'm starting to do some front end engineering at work, I would like to properly quantify the speedup achieved. I would like to be able to use an average value of, say, 50 page load times measured by YSlow or Google Page Speed. Obviously, I don't want to hit reload 50 times and write down the value. Is there a FF plugin for that or will I have to write a Firebug extension myself? Or maybe there is a non-FF, command-line tool that does what I'm planning?
