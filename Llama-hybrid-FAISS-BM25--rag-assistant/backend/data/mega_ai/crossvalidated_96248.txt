Treatment Effect Bounds

My supervisor and I have run a randomized experiment in a developing country. Due to administrative problems there we unfortunately have the problem of non-response. This non-response is also not random because of a flaw in the experiment that introduced self selection. Hence we cannot hope to credibly sell a missing at random or similar assumption. What was suggested to us by a colleague is to set-identify the average treatment effect instead. In particular, two papers were pointed out: Manski, 1990 , "Nonparametric Bounds on Treatment Effects" and Lee, 2009 , "Estimating Sharp Bounds on Treatment Effects". Since I am not familiar with this literature, I hope to get some guidance. I cannot quite understand the difference between the widths of these bounds, i.e. when will they be informative? I would be happy to have a hint or explanation as concerns the mathematical statistics behind these widths. As far as I see it, I should use the bounds by Lee (2009) but I'm not sure if I can a bound on the average treatment effect for all individuals in the study or for a sub-group.
