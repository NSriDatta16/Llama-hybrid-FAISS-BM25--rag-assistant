Things inside tags are items contained inside the text block, which can be a whole lot of spans and other text fragments. If you need to bind the text in the text block, you need to bind to the Text property, as you've done in your question. It is a DependencyProperty that supports this binding. The items inside the text block does not support direct binding, nor does it support directly putting binding objects in there. However, you may put in another control with a DependencyProperty that is a binding though.
