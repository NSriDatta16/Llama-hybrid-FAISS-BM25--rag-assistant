It is very difficult to talk about averages here. One example comes to mind, though: A basic Wordpress 2.8 installation I had to install on a 12MB memory_limit package just about ran, but it would scratch the limit and crash in more complex tasks like the rights management plugin. Any advanced plugins wouldn't work at all. Upgrading to 32MB helped.
