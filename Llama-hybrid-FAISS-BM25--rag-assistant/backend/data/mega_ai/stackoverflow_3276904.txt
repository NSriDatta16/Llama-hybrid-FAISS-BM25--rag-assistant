MySQL: conduct a basic search

I have a names table in my database and I would wish to conduct a fuzzy search on it for example my database contains: Name ID John Smith 1 Edward Smith 2 Gabriel Gray 3 Paul Roberts 4 At the moment when I search the database via python I can only do exact match searching. But I would like to be able to do fuzzy searching where by I can search for the name "smith" and bring back John Smith and Edward Smith.
