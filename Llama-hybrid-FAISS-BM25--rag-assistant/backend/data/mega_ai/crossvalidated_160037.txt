support vector machine question on coefficients

I am a beginner at SVM and I am currently reading Introduction to Statistical Learning. Our aim is to maximize the margin of the of hyperplane boundary subject to certain conditions. My question is, why is one of the restrictions $\sum \beta_i^2 = 1$? Or did I misunderstand the statement?
