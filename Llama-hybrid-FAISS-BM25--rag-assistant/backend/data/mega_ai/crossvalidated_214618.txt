Estimating a variable from its cosine corrupted by additive Gaussian noise

I observe $y_i=\cos(\theta)+z_i$, $i=1,\ldots,n$, where each $z_i\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ is an i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian random variable. I am interested in estimating $\theta\in[0,\pi]$ with minimum mean square error (MSE). By the general scalar case of CRLB I know that $$\tag{1}\mathbb{E}[(\theta-\hat{\theta})^2]\geq\frac{\sigma^2\sin^2\theta}{n}.$$ I am wondering if an estimator exists that comes close to the CRLB in (1). Specifically, I am looking for an estimator whose MSE goes to zero when $\theta\rightarrow0$ or $\theta\rightarrow\pi$. Any ideas? Update : Unfortunately (1) is incorrect: the $\sin\theta$ should be moved to denominator and squared. Thus, an estimator with MSE going to zero when $\theta\rightarrow0$ or $\theta\rightarrow\pi$ does not exist. I also forgot to square the $\sin\theta$ term in the analysis of the natural estimator below. When corrected, the asymptotic MSE in (2) of this estimator matches the CRLB in (1). See the answer below. What I tried The "natural" estimator would just average $y_i$'s and take the inverse cosine (we must also truncate the average so that it's in $[-1,1]$ to use inverse cosine). Its MSE is: $$\mathbb{E}[(\theta-\hat{\theta})^2]=\mathbb{E}\left[\left(\theta-\cos^{-1}\left(\cos\theta+\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nz_i\right)\right)^2\right]$$ The noise term $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nz_i$ gets small as $n$ increases, so the Taylor series expansion of $\cos^{-1}(\theta+x)$ around $x=0$ yields: $$\tag{2}\mathbb{E}[(\theta-\hat{\theta})^2]\approx \frac{\sigma^2}{n\sin\theta},$$ where the approximation is from dropping of the lower-order terms in the Taylor series. While we can also use the Taylor series expansion to show that this estimator is unbiased, MSE in (2), unlike (1), has $\sin\theta$ in the denominator, which means the error gets worse when $\theta\rightarrow0$ or $\theta\rightarrow\pi$. This seems to be an inherent problem with this estimator (and not from approximation in (2)), as evident from a numerical experiment: In the figure 'numerical' plots the MSE from the numerical experiment for $n=1000$ and $\sigma^2=1$, while 'approx $\cos^{-1}$(average)' and 'CRLB' plot (2) and (1) corresponding to these values of $n$ and $\sigma^2$. I think that the truncation of the average to $[-1,1]$ is to blame, but I'm not sure how to fix this. For reference, here is the MATLAB code used to generate the "numerical" curve above: theta_array=linspace(0,pi,20); for ii=1:20 theta=theta_array(ii); z=randn(1000,1000); average=cos(theta)+mean(n); average(average>1)=1; average(average
