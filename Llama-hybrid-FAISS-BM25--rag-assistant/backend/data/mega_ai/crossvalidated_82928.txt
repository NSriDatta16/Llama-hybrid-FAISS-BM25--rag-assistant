Optimisation is the root of all evil in statistics. Any time you make choices about your model$^1$ by optimising some suitable criterion evaluated on a finite sample of data you run the risk of over-fitting the criterion, i.e. reducing the statistic beyond the point where improvements in generalisation performance are obtained and the reduction is instead gained by exploiting the peculiarities of the sample of data, e.g. noise). The reason the Bayesian method works better is that you don't optimise anything, but instead marginalise (integrate) over all possible choices. The problem then lies in the choice of prior beliefs regarding the model, so one problem has gone away, but another one appears in its place. $^1$ This includes maximising the evidence (marginal likelihood) in a Bayesian setting. For an example of this, see the results for Gaussian Process classifiers in my paper, where optimising the marginal likelihood makes the model worse if you have too many hyper-parameters (note selection according to marginal likelihood will tend to favour models with lots of hyper-parameters as a result of this form of over-fitting).
