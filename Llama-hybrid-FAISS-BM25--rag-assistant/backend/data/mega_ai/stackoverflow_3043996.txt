Protobufs are good, but require you to pre-define your data structures, if I recall. Thrift is similar to protobufs, but has some decent code generation features. Apple's binary property list format sounds close to what you need. It's similar to JSON in behavior, but is more compact and supports a few extra types, including datetime and unencoded binary. There are a couple ruby implementations on github. Your best bet may be BERT . BERT is based on Erlang's binary term serialization format. It's compact, includes datatime serialization and is implemented in a dozen or so languages, including ruby.
