I agree with @Hoap. Your features might be low for the amount of training observations you have. Instead of excluding columns, see if you're missing more features. Feature Engineering, rather than Feature Selection. However, if you are looking for Feature Selection, then Azure ML has a Feature Selection Module with the option to specify how many features you'd like to keep. Some simple verifications to do before you jump into modeling: Visualize your dataset for any non-linear relationships. You could also perform a simple correlation analysis to check for multi-collinearity. I also think that normalizing all of your data between 0 to 1 for consistent comparable values between features would be helpful. Hopefully one of these will show some unexpected pattern in your data. I apologize if you've already performed these checks. Just wanted to put them out there. Looks like you pretty much used every regression model in the Azure ML library.
