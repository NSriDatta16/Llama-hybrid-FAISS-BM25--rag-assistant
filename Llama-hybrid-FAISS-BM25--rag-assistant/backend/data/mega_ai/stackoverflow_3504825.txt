I would prefer using Unique Constraint on the column and then explicitly checking on for its existance. Handling an exception will result into Identity increment if present, Secondly exception can be avoided by checking for existence before insertion which other wise is more expensive operation. IF EXISTS (SELECT TOP(1) ColName FROM MyTable WHERE ColName=@myParameter) If using Unique constraint you can also apply Unique Nonclustured index resulting into fast retrieval alongwith.
