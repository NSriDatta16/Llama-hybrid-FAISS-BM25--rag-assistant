Magento: Add (and retrieve) custom database field for CMS pages

I want to assign custom parameters to CMS pages in Magento (i.e. 'about', 'customer service', etc), so they can be grouped. The end goal is to use the parameters for each page to show (or hide) them in a nav menu. Writing a quick method in the page/html block to retrieve the pages (active only) for the menu was easy, but I can't figure out how to group them so that 'testimonials', 'history', and 'contact' are associated with 'about', and 'return policy', 'shipping', and 'contact' are associated with 'customer service'. Any help to point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
