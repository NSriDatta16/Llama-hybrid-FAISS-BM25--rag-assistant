May not be a good idea: Warnings: 1) Disconnect: What if you are coding and your connection gets lost, you may get a corrupted file or loose some work. Disconnects occur much more often that power loss in your home/office, and you can safeguard by using a small UPC - that will give a minute to save your work. 2) SCM: Use git, mercurial, svn or what have you, to speed up deployment. Increases ability to share code, backup and roll backs. 3) Auto completion will not work very well over network connection, because ( at least in NetBeans) it scans your project to figure out what you want to auto-complete. It takes a few seconds even on a local machine. Solution: If after all of the above you still want to do it, you can trick your editor by mounting remote storage as a local drive. You didn't specify your OS but on Mac and Linux - you can easily do it - take a look at Fuse. http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ Khmm apperatnly there was an attempt to port Fuse to Windows: http://fuse4win.4host.ru/ Hope that helps Update There are also a few commercial products - one was recommended by macworld I think ( they are both for Mac and Windows) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDrive http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExpanDrive
