xxd is the command line tool to manage embedded resources, but specifically for images you can take a page from the web playbook and do base64 as well in your header files. There is an article on Cocoanetics about Embedded Binary Resources about these tactics. You could also roll your own build scripting to automate this with Bash or Rake or something like that too of course like @dwineman is talking about, but all that diffing/scratch file stuff will probably just end up as a fragile build system riddled with bugs you don't have time to fix because you need to build the actual product. Keep it simple with this one, don't over-engineer anything. I like #defines just as much as the next guy, but everything in moderation.
