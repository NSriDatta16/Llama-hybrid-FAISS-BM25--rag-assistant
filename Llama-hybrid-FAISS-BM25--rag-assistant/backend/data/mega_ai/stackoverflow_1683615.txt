A pointer refers to a memory location, when you store a pointer in a file, it is meaningless, it refers to something that is ephemeral. So either it does not matter in this application because the data referenced is discared, or you have not stated the format correctly. Normally in such a case you would apply 'serialization', so that the data pointed to were also stored, in the file in such a way that the original data and what it pointed to could be reconstructed ('deserialized') at a later time. There is no fundamental difference between file storage in C and C# - that is independent of the language, however there may be differences in structure packing, so just storing the structure was always a bad idea (structure packing can vary even between C compilers). Also of course you need to realise that a char type in C# is 16-bit, not 8. You need to let the existing storage format be the specification and then implement it in C# using serialisation to avoid problems with the differences in structure implementation.
