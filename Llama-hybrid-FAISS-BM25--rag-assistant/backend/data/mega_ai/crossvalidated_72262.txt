How to average variables having given standard deviations

I'm a physicist who has some issues in data treatment, so sorry if I get the maths wrong. I have some diffractograms, which are displayed as counts vs. angle. The points have standard deviations estimated from a poisson statistic on the bins (an external program does that). Getting the average of different spectra is straightforward by averaging corresponding counts. But how do I get the correct standard deviation for the averaged counts? When I apply this method Is it possible to find the combined standard deviation? the errors actually get larger compared to single data points. This appears counterintuitive, because I would expect the errors to get smaller when I take into account more datapoints? Where is my fault?
