You have many choices for bootstrap confidence intervals. All bootstrap confidence intervals are approximate and do not always do well in small samples (usually 80 is not considered small). also if you read Hall and Wilson's paper you will find that testing hypotheses assuming the bootstrap distribution under the null hypothesis works better than inverting confidence intervals. It is an issue about how to center the pivotal quantity in the test statistics. Schenker in 1985 showed that bootstrap methods such as Efron's percentile method and even the BC method severely under cover the true parameter for certain chi square populations when the sample size is not very large. Chernick and LaBudde in 2010 American Journal of Mathematical and Management Science showed that in small samples there can even be problems with BCa and bootstrap t for highly skewed distributions such as the lognormal. So based on the literature including my own research I suggest doing the hypothesis test with the centering approach recommended by Hall and Wilson and base your conclusions on that p-value. You can find detailed coverage of this in my recent book "An Introduction to the Bootstrap with Applications to R" published by Wiley in 2011.
