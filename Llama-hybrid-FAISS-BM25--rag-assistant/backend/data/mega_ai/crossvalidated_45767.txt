Since the statistic is bimodal, taking the average of the values for all categories of a product is meaningless. I don't think this is necessarily true. For instance, breast cancer risk is highly stratified into high vs low risk based on genetic markers. When you don't know what your genetic code is, it still makes sense to report the average. Creating cuts of the variable has the associated problem with the arbitrary choice of cutoffs. This will cause some bias in the estimation of modes as coming from mixture normal distributions. An alternate approach is that of the EM algorithm where you can simultaneously estimate the "high" versus "low" group assignment in the mixture distribution and calculate CIs for the mean and it's standard error for each group. The details of doing so in R are in this document .
