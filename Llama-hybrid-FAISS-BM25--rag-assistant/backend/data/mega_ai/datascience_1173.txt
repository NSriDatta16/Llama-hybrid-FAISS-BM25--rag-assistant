Versatile data structure for combined statistics

Not sure if this is Math, Stats or Data Science, but I figured I would post it here to get the site used. As a programmer, when you have a system/component implemented, you might want to allow some performance monitoring. For example to query how often a function call was used, how long it took and so on. So typically you care about count, means/percentile, max/min and similiar statistics. This could be measurements since startup, but also a rolling average or window. I wonder if there is a good data structure which can be updated efficiently concurrently which can be used as the source for most of those queries. For example having a ringbuffer of rollup-metrics (count, sum, min, max) over increasing periods of time and a background aggregate process triggered regularly. The focus here (for me) is on in-memory data structures with limited memory consumption. (For other things I would use a RRD type of library).
