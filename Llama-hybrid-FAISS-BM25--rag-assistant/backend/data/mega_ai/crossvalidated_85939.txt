How to interpret a correlation chart?

I'm learning PCA using R. I use Factorminer package. For learning purpose I used following code library('FactoMineR') data(decathlon) res.pca1 = PCA(decathlon[, 1:10], scale.unit = TRUE, ncp = 4,graph = TRUE) It is generating a correlation chart. By looking this it is clear that first & second Principal Component are explaining 52.73% variability in the data. But I'm not sure how to interpret the variables correlation by seeing this plot. Can you expert please help me to understand how to interpret this correlation chart?
