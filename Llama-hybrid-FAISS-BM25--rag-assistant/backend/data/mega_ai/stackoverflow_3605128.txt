I did a benchmarking test with a 51000+ unique words list to satisfy your (and mine, to be honest) curiosity. Although not by much, using isset() is indeed faster than comparing strings, with an average of 0.0144901275634765625 seconds for the first method vs 0.0164241790771484375 seconds for the second method, out of 5 tries. Hope this helps.
