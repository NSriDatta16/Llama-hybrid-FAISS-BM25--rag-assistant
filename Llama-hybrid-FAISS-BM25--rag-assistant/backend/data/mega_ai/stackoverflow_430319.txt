Have you considered use memcached or APC for the session data? These would almost certainly be much faster than any RDBMS solution. Another suggestion if you are set on using MySQL: instead of the MEMORY storage engine, just enable plenty of memory to the various cache buffers. That way the data will be durable, transparently backed by disk storage, but available quickly when it's in use.
