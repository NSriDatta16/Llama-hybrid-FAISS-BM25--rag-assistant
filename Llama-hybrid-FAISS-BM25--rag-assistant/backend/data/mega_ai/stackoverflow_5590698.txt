As I understand from the doc, the child modules must specify their parent project. This makes them unsuitable for reusing as dependencies. Specifying a parent project does not make a module unsuitable as a dependency. Most of the modules have a parent pom, which defines common dependencies/plugins and other things. Refer to spring dependencies, for instance. Is it possible to declare a module that do not specify it's parent? Each module is an individual maven project. As such it does not need a parent. Typically, in a hierarchical organization of modules, each module is in a folderand the parent pom is in the parent folder of the modules. The parent pom typically builds all the modules. | --- module 1 | --- pom.xml | --- module 2 | --- pom.xml | pom.xml In the absence of parent pom, you would need to build each module individually. Refer to this SO discussion as well.
