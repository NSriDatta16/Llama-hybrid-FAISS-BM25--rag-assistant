your compiler already takes care of the allocation, and the copying. If you define push like so: push(T item) The compiler will copy the item for you and you can stuff it into your internal storage. Also, int and int[] are two distinct types. If you wanted to specifically make a stack that could accept an T[] you could make an overload of push: push(T[] items) I'm assuming you want this functionality so that you can push these as individual items onto the stack, not because you want a heterogeneous container. In this push you could iterate over each item in the array and store it into your internal storage.
