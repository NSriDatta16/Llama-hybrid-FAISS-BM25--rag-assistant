How is cross-validation used for logistic regression?

I have a fundamental question about cross-validation in logistic regression. I would really appreciate some help since something is still unclear to me. My situation is the following: I split my data set into training, validation and test set. When using for example rpart for classification trees on a training set, it automatically splits it into k-folds (basically creating a validation set) and suggests an optimal complexity parameter. I can then run the suggested tree on my test set. However, if I run a logistic regression. Let's say I run a stepwise regression model (although I know stepwise regression model have to be used with caution). How can I use cross-validation to improve my model? Since, by using different folds, I will get models with different numbers of features. How can I choose one to eventually run it on my test set? Thank you very much in advance!
