Your services-config.xml in Flex propably points to http://localhost/.../amfphp/gateway.php You'll need to change the endpoint in that XML file and recompile the application. You could also create your ChannelSet at runtime. In that case you don't need the services-config.xml anymore. Take a look at http://raghuonflex.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/endpointatruntime/ for some inspiration...
