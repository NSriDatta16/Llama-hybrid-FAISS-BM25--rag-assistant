On the issue of automatic time series fitting using R

we have to fit about 2000 or odd time series every month, they have very idiosyncratic behavior in particular, some are arma/arima, some are ewma, some are arch/garch with or without seasonality and/or trend (only thing in common is the time series aspect). one can in theory build ensemble model with aic or bic criterion to choose the best fit model but is the community aware of any library which attempts to solve this problem? Google made me aware of the below one by Rob J Hyndman link but are they any other alternatives?
