Get Path of Uploaded File using Python

Is it possible to get the full path of the file on the user's computer being uploaded to my site? Using os.path.abspath(fileitem.filename) simply gets me the address of where my script is executing from on my shared hosting server. FYI: fileitem = form['file'] and form = cgi.FieldStorage()
