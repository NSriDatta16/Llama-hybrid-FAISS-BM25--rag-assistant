How do I analyze a three factor ANOVA without replication in R?

This summer, I conducted a growth chamber experiment testing the effects of the projected climate change conditions on the growth and survival of newly germinated seedlings of Acadian forest tree species. I built 6 growth chambers, each with a unique combination of treatments: Chamber 1: baseline Fredericton temp, 900 ppm CO2 Chamber 2: baseline Fredericton temp +3˚C, 900 ppm CO2 Chamber 3: baseline Fredericton temp +6˚C, 900 ppm CO2 Chamber 4: baseline Fredericton temp, ambient CO2 Chamber 5: baseline Fredericton temp +3˚C, ambient CO2 Chamber 6: baseline Fredericton temp +6˚C, ambient CO2 Each chamber has both drought and “normal” soil moisture regimes (one per side of each chamber), so temperature, CO2 and soil moisture are fully crossed (basically 12 unique treatments because each chamber is split into 2 soil moisture regimes). Within each of the 12 treatments, I have 135 balsam fir seedlings (i'll just talk about one species for the sake of simplicity) divided into three 45-cell trays. This means I technically have only 1 replicate for each of the 12 unique treatments for every measurement type (e.g., total height growth). For example, for the drought soil moisture regime in chamber 1, I would have to average the total seedling height growth of all 135 balsam fir seedlings and that would be my replicate in order to avoid pseudoreplication since they're all nested in chamber 1. This leads me to my question: how do I analyze a three factor ANOVA without replication in R? The three explanatory variables are CO2, temp and soil moisture and one of the response variables is, for example, total height growth. My current model looks like this: > model anova(model) Analysis of Variance Table Response: height Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) temp 2 107797 53899 58.6180 As you can see the Df for Residuals is pretty high because I'm basically saying that every seedling is a replicate (pseudoreplication). If I follow the proper replication rules, the average seedling height per chamber is the true replicate since seedlings are nested in chambers. Then the code looks like this: > data2 data2 temp moist co2 height 1 0 baseline 900 ppm 91.86207 2 +3 baseline 900 ppm 112.93103 3 +6 baseline 900 ppm 118.59770 4 0 drought 900 ppm 106.69318 5 +3 drought 900 ppm 124.37500 6 +6 drought 900 ppm 123.62069 7 0 baseline 400 ppm 95.81818 8 +3 baseline 400 ppm 93.89773 9 +6 baseline 400 ppm 118.22093 10 0 drought 400 ppm 76.04598 11 +3 drought 400 ppm 104.53488 12 +6 drought 400 ppm 107.63855 > model2 anova(model2) Analysis of Variance Table Response: height Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) temp 2 1237.47 618.73 co2 1 559.29 559.29 moist 1 11.18 11.18 temp:co2 2 63.51 31.75 temp:moist 2 124.55 62.27 co2:moist 1 216.88 216.88 temp:co2:moist 2 143.51 71.76 Residuals 0 0.00 Warning message: In anova.lm(model2) : ANOVA F-tests on an essentially perfect fit are unreliable The summary lacks p values and F values because the Df for Residuals is 0 when each treatment has only one replicate. I read that Hurlbert (2004) had a change of heart from his original paper that he wrote in 1984 about some situations where pseudoreplication may not apply--growth chambers being one of them. He said: "Results from such an experiment could be analyzed with an ANOVA that uses the interaction mean square as an estimate of the true error mean square". This sounds promising, but I haven't been able to translate that into an R code or find an example online. Is there anyone out there who has experienced this situation? Thanks!
