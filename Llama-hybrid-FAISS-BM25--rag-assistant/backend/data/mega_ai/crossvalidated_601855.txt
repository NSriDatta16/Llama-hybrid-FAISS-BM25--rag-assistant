Correlation by group and test for significant

My data has the following form: name val1 val2 0 a 1 2 1 a 2 5 2 a 3 7 3 b 4 11 4 b 5 13 5 b 6 17 6 b 7 19 7 c 8 23 8 c 9 29 9 c 10 31 I want to calculate the correlation between val1 and val2 by group, then average them. My question is: what is the formula for a test of this correlation by group? Hypothesis: average correlation = 0
