Interesting question. A bunch of work on explaining ada boost via a few different tactics has been done since then. I did a quick literature search and this somewhat odd paper appears to be the most recent one on the subject and also reviews a bunch of the intercedent work by Leo Breiman and others: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.1108.pdf I have no idea if their results are valid but they claim to have failed to prove Breiman's conjecture but to have proved a weakened version of it claiming adaboost is measure preserving but not necessarily ergodic. They also present some empirical evidence that adaboost does in fact sometimes overfit. I think that suggests adaboost may be related to a random forest but not entirely (or not always) equivalent in the way Breiman conjectured?
