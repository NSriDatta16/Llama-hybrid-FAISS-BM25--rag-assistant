How many observations are needed to make an RMSE meaningful

I have a relatively short monthly time series (7 years). I'm wondering if I estimate an OLS model with 6 years of data and do pseudo-out of sample forecasting with the remaining year, would the RMSE will be of any use or is thats just not enough data?
