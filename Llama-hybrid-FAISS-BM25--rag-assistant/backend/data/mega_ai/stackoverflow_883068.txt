Currently, X-Forwarded-For appears to be unset in requests made by URLFetch. You can verify this for yourself by going to http://shell.appspot.com/ and doing a URLFetch for a site that echoes HTTP requests - for example, http://www.showhttprequest.com/ . App Engine sets the User Agent string to "AppEngine-Google; (+ http://code.google.com/appengine )", but doesn't set X-Forwarded-For at all.
