How to improve model by Bayesian Statistics/Inference?

I am puzzled about model improvement in implementing Bayesian statistics/inference. Normally, we will use a fixed model in bayesian statistics, e.g. normal distribution with parameter mean and sd. with more extra or new data, we will update the mean and sd but we keep using normal distribution. If the Bayesian inference from posterior distribution is not consistent with observed data because wrong hypothesis model is chosen, how to solve it? There are infinitely many possible models, how to find the most suitable model given data? More Information From Bayesian Data Analysis (Andrew Gelman), it states that if the actual underlying model is not normal distribution but we assume a wrong model, using bayesian statistics will not lead us to the any useful data analysis result. The book mentions about model expansion and model improvement (other than updating pre-assumed model's parameters) which can sovle the above situation. (Bayesian Data Analysis 3rd Edition Chapter 7.5-7.6) But I do not understand what the book means. Can anyone explain or elaborate more about the model expansion and model improvement mentioned in the book?
