The size of the huge Collection discourages me from just iterating across the entire thing and returning all unique values I am afraid in order to find all used categories, you will have to look at each item once, so you can hardly avoid iterating (unless you keep track of the used categories while building your collection). Try if Mark Byers solution is fast enough for you and only worry about its performance if it isn't.
