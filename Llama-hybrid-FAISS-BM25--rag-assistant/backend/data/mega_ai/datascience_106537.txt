Average of metrics using 10-fold

I'm working with 10 k-fold cross validation and I'm wanting to average the metrics, but I'm not getting it with sklearn. This is the way I am doing it and the metrics are being printed by fold. from sklearn.model_selection import KFold from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, f1_score, recall_score from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_fscore_support as score k = 10 kf = KFold(n_splits=k, random_state=None) model = clf for train_index , test_index in kf.split(x_train): x_train , x_test = X.iloc[train_index,:],X.iloc[test_index,:] y_train , y_test = Y[train_index] , Y[test_index] model.fit(x_train,y_train) pred_values = model.predict(x_test) precision, recall, fscore, support = score(pred_values, y_test) print('precision: {}'.format(precision)) print('recall: {}'.format(recall)) print('fscore: {}'.format(fscore)) print('support: {}'.format(support))
