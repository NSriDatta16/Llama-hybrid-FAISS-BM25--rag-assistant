Microsoft Word is a Big Program. Running several copies of it would quickly make the average consumer level machine keel over. To avoid this, Word makes sure that only one instance ever runs, taking care of all documents. A so-called single-instance app. So if you start Word like you do and Word is already running then the 2nd copy you start only asks the 1st instance to open the document. And immediately exits. Making your code bomb. This also stops you from doing what you are trying to do, you cannot tell when the user closes the 2nd document, only when she closes all documents. One imperfect workaround would be to try to open the .doc file periodically. It is locked as long as Word has it opened.
