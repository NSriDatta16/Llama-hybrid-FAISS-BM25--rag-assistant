Apple's documentation is out of date currently. Set up everything like they say (which it seems you've done), then go to Build->Build and Archive. Then go to Window->Organizer. You should see your app under ARCHIVED APPLICATIONS (it's okay if an icon image doesn't show up). Click on it in the sidebar, click share, select your ad-hoc provisioning profile/certificate from the dropdown, then hit email or save to disk. Name it appname.ipa. Users can drag the ipa along with the provisioning profile into itunes and sync.
