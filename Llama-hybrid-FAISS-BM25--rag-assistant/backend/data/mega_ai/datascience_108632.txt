I'm not sure what you mean by "coefficients". A random forest classifier is made up of decision trees. Each decision tree has split points where it selects a feature and value to split at. In a random forest, feature importance can be estimated by the impurity which is computed as the (normalized) total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature. That is an additional step beyond the splitting step.
