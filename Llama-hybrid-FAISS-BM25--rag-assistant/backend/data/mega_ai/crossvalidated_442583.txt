Can you do logistic regression in R on a full dataset rather than the training data (i.e. 80%) of the dataset?

Using a logistic regression model to predict something in my dataset but was just wondering do I need to split the full dataset into training data (i.e. 80%) and test data (i.e. 20%) to make a model or can it be done with the use of the full dataset? I have created a model using glm with the full dataset at present but just wondering if this is one way to do logistic regression.
