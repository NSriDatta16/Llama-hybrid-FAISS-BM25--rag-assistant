Actually, I was thinking of posting a similar question, though coming from a different angle. Firstly, your data $R_d$ and $P_d$ form a time series with potential interactions and you might end up using a vector autoregreesion methon (as in https://www.otexts.org/fpp/9/2 ) In that case, you have to analyse all the auto-correlations and so on. Additionally, with a high dimensional $P_d$ you will get time series in a very high dimensional space. So far I have no experience in the time-series regime, but this seems not very feasible. Hence, one could also use a regression task that is fed with your data. You still might so enrich you data $P_d$ with additional features. An advantage might be to use a nonlinear model, since they might find some structure in the data you don't see directly. For example a neural network can be used as is pointed out in here or in here You can also use a random forest as is pointed out here Note that here an optimization is performed to obtain the best parameters for moving averages that contain the data from previous events/time-steps
