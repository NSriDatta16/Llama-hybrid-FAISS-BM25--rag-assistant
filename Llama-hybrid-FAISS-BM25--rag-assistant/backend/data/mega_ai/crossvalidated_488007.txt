Why does transfer learning work?

I'd like to know if there is a theoretical/math proof of why transfer learning actually works. I understand the intuition that transfer learning helps because a given neural network has already learned a good representation that can be used as a "starting point" to a new task(please correct me If I'm wrong), but is there a formal theoretical proof of it? Any help is appreciated.
