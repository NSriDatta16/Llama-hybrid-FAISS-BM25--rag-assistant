Not comparable to log4j, but something you could use to begin with: Reusable Logging in VBScript - LogToFile.vbs Anywhere you'd like to log a message within the script you'd simply add LogToFile "Your Message" to log the relevant information. With this script you can log the date and time you began the script, the date and time of any particular events, and generate unique filenames if you want to schedule script run times. It's also simple to turn off logging without editing the entire logging section out. If you want to write to the event log, you could do it using a WshShell object . It provides the LogEvent method for logging events to the Application event log. The LogEvent method enables you to write to the event log from within your scripts. LogEvent has two required parameters. The first parameter of the LogEvent method is an integer that specifies the type of event you would like your script to log. Set objShell = WScript.CreateObject("Wscript.Shell") objShell.LogEvent 0,"Test Success Event" objShell.LogEvent 1,"Test Error Event" objShell.LogEvent 2,"Test Warning Event" objShell.LogEvent 4, "Test Information Event" objShell.LogEvent 8, "Test Success Audit Event" objShell.LogEvent 16, "Test Failure Audit Event" See here on the Microsoft TechNet site.
