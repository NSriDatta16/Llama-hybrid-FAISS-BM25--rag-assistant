Keep widget on top in Qt

I'm creating an application which has a "floating" widget which can be dragged around inside the application window. But it starts up, or tends to go behind other widgets sometimes. Is there any way to make sure that the widget in my application stays on top of all other widgets whenever it is made visible? Thanks.
