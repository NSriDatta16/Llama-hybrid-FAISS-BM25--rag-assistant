For scenarios like this i would make use of the registry pattern . This is a pretty good explanation . The registry pattern acts like a storage for objects. A code example is on it's way. Edit: In your example (new Mail($session, $database)), i think you should do this even if you use the registry pattern. This makes every thing less coupled and easier to understand and change parts independently. As I have not done so much PHP in the last couple of years, i don't know if there is any IOC-framework available, but that would help you instantiating your classes.
