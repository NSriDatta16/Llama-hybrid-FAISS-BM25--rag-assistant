Fast Updating of QPixmap from byte array

I'm working on a vision application and I need to have a "Live View" from the camera displayed on the screen using a QPixmap object. We will be updating the screen at 30frames/second on a continuous basis. My problem is that this application has to run on some 3-5 year old computers that, by todays standards, are slow. So what I would like to do is to be able to directly write to the display byte array inside of QPixmap. After going through the program code, almost option for changing the contents of a Pixmap results in a new QPixmap being created. This is the overhead I'm trying to get ride of. Additionally, I would like to prevent all the new/deletes from occurring just to keep memory fragmentation under control. Any suggestions?
