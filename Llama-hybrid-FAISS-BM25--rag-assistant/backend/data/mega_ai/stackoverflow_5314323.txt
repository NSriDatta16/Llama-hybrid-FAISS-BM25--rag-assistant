Generate a random number with max, min and mean(average) in Java

I need to generate random numbers with following properties. Min should be 200 Max should be 20000 Average(mean) is 500. Optional: 75th percentile to be 5000 Definitely it is not uniform distribution, nor gaussian. I need to give some left skewness.
