Just a couple of pointers, it would be easy to overwhelm you as you are just starting with this tech stack. First step, use SQLServer 2008 Express, it has better ability to deal with image data (images can be saved directly to the filesystem, but they are still in a table). Apart from that, you can design your screen with the GUI, and then hook the bits up one by one to your retreived data. Create a new Windows Forms app, or a WPF one, and start from there (i'm assuming that you know about the toolbox window and just dragging components on to the designer and setting their properties in the Properties window).
