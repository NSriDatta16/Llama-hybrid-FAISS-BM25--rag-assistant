I want to better organize my website files, but I can access the .php files using the folder hierarchy. How can I override that?

For example, to access a page in my search folder, I have to write: mywebsite.tld/search/searchJob.php I don't want users to have to write down folder structure and whatnot. What can I do to change this? OR, is there a better way to organize my files? Because I'm only two pages in and I decided to move some files and got lost in the hierarchy (that's why I moved them like in the picture).
