To me, the best illustrations of the differences are one-off events, where the concept of repeated sampling does not make sense. For example, the first time that humans fly to Mars, we might ask, "What is the probability that they will reach the planet?" It seems absurd to reframe the question by asking, "If we repeatedly flew to Mars for the first time, what proportion of missions would succeed?" I'm just an applied statistician, so some theorist may find fault in my example; or find a reason why Bayesian analysis would not work either. Still, the example speaks to me.
