1.) At the moment I am using sqlite as database. Is it possible, that I can access the sqlite file on the harddisk of my user to read/save data? (on User dir its possible but access an USB stick ?) The basic principal of Silverlight is centralised data over services. You can have local data, but that is not as useful generally compared to a central storage. You then have no worries about full trust as it will run in any Silverlight browser. You can use SQLLite on your server, however the best free database option we have found is SQL Service Express 2008 R2. You can access USB, but it requires both OOB, Full Trust and a custom COM automation object installed on the client (so Windows only). Basically forget local USB storage and support downloads instead, if local copies are needed. 2.) Is there anything concerning MVVM silverlight can not handle? Bindings in Silverlight 4 are now very similar to those in WFP. Accessing parent elements from templates is a little more difficult, but most simple bindings are the same. 3.) Does SEO work well with Silverlight 4? First ensure that you provide a sitemap for the searchengines. That should map to all content pages. Provide a parallel ASP.Net website to publish your content for the search engines to read. This is now quite easy with RIA services as an ASP.Net website can consume a RIA service just like any other WCF service. Make good use of headers, meta tags, titles, human-readable urls to include relevant keywords.
