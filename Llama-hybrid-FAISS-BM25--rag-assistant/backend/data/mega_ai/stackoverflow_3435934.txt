I used Netbeans too, in my laptop (i5 with 4 Gb). Average memory usage: 1.7 Gb (!) for any project of any size. This was completely unacceptable, but I could live with it: I had more than 2Gb free for other things... (using Win 7 Pro x64). But what really bothered me was the CPU usage (javaw: 60-70%), because the laptop got very hot!! Then, I switched to eclipse. Same thing (or a little worse with CPU usage). Then I upgraded my JVM (1.6.0.xx, the last I tested: 1.0.6.0.21) with the same results. Of course, I checked for no other JVM's installed, etc. etc. I noted that the CPU usage gets high whenever netbeans or eclipse were in focus. If they were minimized or out of focus, CPU usage went down to 10-20%. Finally I gave up and bought phpEd from nuSphere. I did prefer to spend almost $300 bucks on this software than to fry my laptop's CPU. I don't think you have to upgrade your PC. You should better upgrade your editor, IMO. I usually run jDownloader, a great download manager written in Java and I've never had these problems with it. BTW, my video card is nVidia with the latest drivers available from dell. What's yours?
