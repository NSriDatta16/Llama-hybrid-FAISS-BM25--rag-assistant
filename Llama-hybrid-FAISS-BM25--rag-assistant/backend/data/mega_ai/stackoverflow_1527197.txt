The short answer is that it's just not going to work. For multitouch you have to have the hardware to support it (capacitive tocuhscreen). There's simply no way to make a resistive touchscreen (what's on your WinMo device) "see" two touches. Instead it just provides the average of all touches. I have seen a hack that assumes you don't touch both points at one time and that one point (upper left usually) never moves. You can then figure out where the second point is by backing out from the average. It sort-of worked for things like "zoom out" and "zoom in" type gestures, but that's about it. Even if you have a capacitive touchscreen, unless the OS knows how to handle the mouse being at two positions at any given time, or the touchpanel driver explicitly provides the app with that info, you're still out of luck.
