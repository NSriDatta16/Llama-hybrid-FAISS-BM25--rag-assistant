I need to make an exact time-line for future changes. So you want Microsoft, Apple, Mozilla, Opera and Google to tell you exactly when they’ll be done adding features to their browsers? Just e-mail them, I’m sure they’ll get right on that :) Naw, interesting question. I don’t think any browser manufacturers commit to implementing specific features particularly far into the future. In the case of HTML5, the spec itself says that the spec won’t be done until there are two agreeing implementations, so it’s very much a matter of “wait until an implementation ships”. In the case of WebKit and Firefox, they‘re open-source projects, which I imagine makes it more difficult to commit to far-future dates. Then again, I seem to remember Microsoft being a bit late with Vista, so it’s probably difficult to commit to dates for closed-source projects as well. If you could edit your question with the exact date when your social video sharing site will be finished, that’d be a good start. A quick Google turns up: Internet Explorer Microsoft have got IE 9 in beta. This page claims to be some sort of roadmap: http://microsoft-journal.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!A33F7112F6C1D499!878.entry There’s also their Internet Explorer Blog Firefox Mozilla announced their plans for 3.6 here: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Namoroka Couldn’t find a similar document for 4 (which was originally announced as 3.7), but robertc pointed to this document which details the HTML5 (and CSS3) features added in Firefox 4: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Firefox_4_for_developers WebKit (Safari and Chrome) “Apple doesn’t comment on future products” — http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/FAQ But the WebKit team do have a blog, Surfin’ Safari Opera Folks were apparently clamouring for a roadmap last year: http://dev.opera.com/forums/topic/294965
