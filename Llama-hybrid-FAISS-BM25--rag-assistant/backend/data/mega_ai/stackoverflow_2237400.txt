Using chunked encoding in a POST request to an asmx web service on IIS 6 generates a 404

I'm using a CXF client to communicate with a .net web service running on IIS 6. This request (anonymised): POST /EngineWebService_v1/EngineWebService_v1.asmx HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8 SOAPAction: "http://.../Report" Accept: */* User-Agent: Apache CXF 2.2.5 Cache-Control: no-cache Pragma: no-cache Host: uat9.gtios.net Connection: keep-alive Transfer-Encoding: chunked followed by 7 chunks of 4089 bytes and one of 369 bytes, generates the following output after the first chunk has been sent: HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found Content-Length: 103 Date: Wed, 10 Feb 2010 13:00:08 GMT Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/html Anyone know how to get IIS to accept chunked input for a POST? Thanks
