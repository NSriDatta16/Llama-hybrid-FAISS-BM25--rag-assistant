What's the best way to transfer data with a remote application across the internet?

I'm making a relatively simple program which will also be running on a few friends computers and they need to share some information. They will need to exchange ips in case they are changed via dhcp and maybe a few other things in the future, but right now that's it (this will likely be used to update the program if I ever change it too I figure). If there's a better way, without having a middleman server, to keep them from losing the ip that would be helpful too, but worst case I can just call them up and ask since this would so rarely happen, if ever. Our isps renew every 30 days I believe, and they often keep the same one anyways, so I doubt that'll ever be an issue, but if so it's so rare it'd be a minor inconvenience. I haven't done much network programming/scripting before so I'm not sure where to approach this from. I've used urllib/urllib2, and mechanize, but I'm guessing those, while they could work, are not an elegant solution. I was thinking the pcs would just communicate via a specified port and just listen through there, but I don't know what module would handle such a thing. Thanks friends.
