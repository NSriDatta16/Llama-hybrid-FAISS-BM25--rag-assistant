I'm currently working on some really small projects in this area and I "mostly" use RDF there, although for parsing purposes I use a simple URI-registry in order to avoid cycles in the data structure itself. Although, I have to say that I'm still in the conceptual stage of these projects. In the end I rely mostly on 3rd-party storage backends like Jena, rdflib et al.
