For a concise mathematical comparison you must use some kind of metric (as pointed by Scratch's post). You might compare just the best clustering found for each method, but clearly you spend a lot of time finding good parameters, the method is not too good and this aspect would be lost by just looking at best results. Hierarchical clustering techniques (like Single/average linkage) allow for easy visualization without parameter tuning. For k-means you could visualize without bothering too much about choosing the number of clusters k using Graphgrams (see the WEKA graphgram package - best obtained by the package manager or here ! For DBScan you have two parameters, you could go for OPTICS that allows to visualize the result. You would get 3 different kinds of plots, which makes interpretation not trivial (in particular, compared to a single number given by a metric), but the information you get, once you understand the plots is a lot more than even several metrics can provide.
