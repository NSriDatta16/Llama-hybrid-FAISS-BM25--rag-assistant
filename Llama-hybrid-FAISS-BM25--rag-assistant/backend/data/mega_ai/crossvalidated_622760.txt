Correct interpretation of a logistic regression coefficient

I have a simple confusion regarding the interpretation of logistic regression. Suppose married people are more likely to be employed compared to single people. In here, unemployment = 0, employment = 1. Similarly, married = 1 ,and single =0. Assuming odd ratio = 2. Can we say "Married people have 2 times higher odd of being employed compared to single PWDs." ? (here , I have use "odd" only instead of "odds" generally, which I have seen in many literature) So, do I have to use "odds" instead of "odd", it is okay if I used "odd" only?
