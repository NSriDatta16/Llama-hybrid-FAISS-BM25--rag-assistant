ANCOVA or mixed-effect binary logistic regression

I am struggling to choose the right model. In the data, 30 people answered 10 questions with either "Yes" or "No". The participants are seperated in two groups (Sizes: 13 and 17 per group). Also, there is a continious variable age. Some answers are missing. The question is, if there is a significant difference between the groups in their answers after controlling for age. My first thought was to create a mixed-effect binary logistic regression model with random intercepts for participant and question: glmer(answer ~ 1 + age + group + (1|ID) + (1|question), data=data, family=binomial) I would then look at the p-value for the group variable. Would this work? It might be too complex for a bachelor thesis in a non-statistical field. I am not sure how I would report the result besides the p-value then and if I should add random slopes in the model as well. My other idea is to simply run an ANCOVA with the overall rate of "Yes" answers (so someone answering "Yes" half of the time would get a y value of 0.5) as the dependant variable and age as the covariate. The target value's distribution would be heavily skewed though and not normally distributed since a lot of people answered "Yes". Is this problematic for doing ANCOVA? Thanks, Fiona
