Magento: Display products from childcategories if parent category is empty

I have the following categories Car parts (0) Tires (0) Rims (5) Now in the product listing obviously the car parts en tires listing returns 0 products. But for the user this is ankward. Is it possible to show child items if a category is empty? Kind regards
