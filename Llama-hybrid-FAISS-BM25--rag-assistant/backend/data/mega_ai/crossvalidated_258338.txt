You might want to closely look at Forecasting weekly demand: based on ACF and PACF, is ARIMA appropriate? for some hints as to how to automate time series modelling. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery thus you might try your hand at imitating AUTOBOX (which I have helped to develop) if you have time/patience available. No one model form works for all time series as you have painfully found out. The data is the boss and the best or even reasonable model form is individually derived from the data via an iterative process yielding a white noise error term with all model coefficients statistically significant. This is not obtainable directly by closed form procedures. To facilitate quick'n easy your software selection should have macro options bypassing steps. When buying a suit or getting a pair of glasses no one suit/glass prescription fits all.The suit has to be customized /fit to your physical measurements/data and your prescription to your eyes/data.
