Performing a linear regression with Perceptron

I was wondering about the link between the linear regression and the perceptron! Perceptrons were used as binary classifiers i.e to classify binary labels ( 0 or 1 ). My question is How can you perform a linear regression with perceptron and what is the link? I think the point is hidden in the activation function which we are applying to the perceptron! I would be appreciated if you can help me with the beginner's perspective on Neural Networks.
