Can a videoview play a video stored on internal storage?

I'm trying to provide my users with the ability to use either external or internal storage. I'm displaying both images and videos (of a scientific nature). When storing the media on the SD card, all is fine. But when I store the media internally, only the images will display. No matter what I try I get various errors when trying to load and display the media stored under the applicationcontext.getFilesDir(). Is there a trick to setting a videoview's content to such a file? Can a ContentResolver help me? On a related note, is it considered bad form to assume that external storage exists? Thanks in advance, Sid Below is one version that fails with "Cannot play video. Sorry, this video cannot be played". But I have many other modes of failure. I can copy the internal video to temp storage (external) and play it, so this copy to internal does indeed create a valid movie. It only fails when I try to play it directly from the internal storage. videoFile = new File(this.getFilesDir() + File.separator + "test.mp4"); InputStream data = res.openRawResource(R.raw.moviegood); try { OutputStream myOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(videoFile); byte[] buffer = new byte[8192]; int length; while ( (length = data.read(buffer)) > 0 ) { myOutputStream.write(buffer); } //Close the streams myOutputStream.flush(); myOutputStream.close(); data.close(); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } vview.setKeepScreenOn(true); vview.setVideoPath(videoFile.getAbsolutePath()); vview.start();
