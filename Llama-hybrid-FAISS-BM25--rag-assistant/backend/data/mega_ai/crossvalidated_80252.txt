First of all, you need a programming language for predictive modeling. I like the caret package for R a lot, but the scikits-learn project for python is also excellent if you are a python person. Your data has 2 components: geography and time. Geography is easier, so lets start there. Most linear models are going to fail to find hotspots, particularly if those hotspots are defined by the interaction of 2 variables (latitude and longitude). Lets pretend your data are constant, and hotspots don't change over time. Many non-linear model will serve you well, in particular decision-tree based models (such as a single decision tree, a random forests, or a boosted forest). Decision trees are able to identify regional hotspots. Time is a little trickier. Think about which components of time primarily effect demand for your product. Hour-of-day? Day-of-week? Month-of-year? Holidays? Create dummy variables to capture each of these effects, and include them in your model. If you would like some example R code for any of the above, I'd be happy to provide it.
