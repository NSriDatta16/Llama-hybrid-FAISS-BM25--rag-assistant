I would not use Gaussian mixture models, as they require the constituent distributions to all be normal. You have counts, so GMM is inappropriate by definition. Latent Dirichlet allocation (full disclosure: I don't really know topic modeling) requires your data to be multinomial , but you can have counts in that caseâ€”they would be counts of occurrences of different categories of a variable. Another possibility is that your counts are counts of different variables, as in having several Poisson variables. This is a bit of an ontological question for how you are thinking about your data. Consider a simple example where I go to the grocery store because I want some fruit. I will purchase a certain number of apples, oranges, peaches and bananas. Each of those could be considered a separate Poisson variable. When I get home I put all of them in a fruit bowl. Later, when I feel like snacking, I might reach into the bowl without looking and grab two pieces of fruit (e.g., an apple and a peach). That can be considered a draw from a multinomial distribution. In both cases, I have counts of categories, but we think of them differently. In the first case, the fruits I will buy are known before I get to the grocery store, but the number purchased in each category can vary. In the second case, I don't know which fruits I will pick but I know I'm grabbing two from the possible types. If your data are like the fruit bowl example, LDA may be appropriate for you. On the other hand, if they are like the grocery store example, you could try Poisson finite mixture modeling. That is, you can use mixture modeling with distributions other than Gaussian / normal. GMM's are the most common by far; other distributions (such as Poisson) are more exotic. I don't know how widely implemented they are in software. If you use R, Googling led to the discovery of ?PoisMixClus in the HTSCluster package and the rebmix package (note I've never used either, or done Poisson mixture modeling). It may be possible to find implementations for other software as well. Adding some specifics: I would say LDA is at least as much a Bayesian technique as GMM. I suspect the most important differentiation between LDA and GMM is the type of data they assume you have. You cannot compare them, because they are for different kinds of data. (Nor would I really want to compare LDA and Poisson MM, as they conceptualize the counts differently.) I would not dichotomize your data into zero / non-zero.
