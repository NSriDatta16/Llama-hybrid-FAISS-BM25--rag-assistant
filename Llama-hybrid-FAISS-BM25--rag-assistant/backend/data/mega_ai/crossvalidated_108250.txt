A radial basis function w/ SVM is very close to a nearest-neighbors approach. It doesn't seem appropriate here. One thing I'd not is that a convex relation of your graph is $e^x$. Given that, doing some sort of linear regression on the logarithm of temperature will probably give reasonable results. But of course, it doesn't exactly represent what you want. To really fit your model, you want to fit a mixture of a bernoulli model condition on temperature, times a linear model on temperature. The idea being that the linear model kicks in only if the bernoulli model does. The bernoulli model is a latent variable, so you can fit it with EM, where you take expectation of the bernoulli, and maximize the linear regression.
