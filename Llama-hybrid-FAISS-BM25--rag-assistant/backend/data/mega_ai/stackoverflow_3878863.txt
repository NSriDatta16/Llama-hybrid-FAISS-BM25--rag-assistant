The walk function doesn't collect return values like mapcar, it just applies. You'll need to save the output yourself somewhere, perhaps appending to a global list or stack. (let (files) (cl-fad:walk-directory "/tmp/" #'(lambda (x) (push (namestring x) files))) files) Note that namestring converts from path objects to just a filename.
