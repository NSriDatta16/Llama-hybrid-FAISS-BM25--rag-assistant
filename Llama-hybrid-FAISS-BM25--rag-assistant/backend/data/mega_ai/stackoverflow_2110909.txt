SXAPI API Initialization error

I thought it is related To Meta but it is a programming question any way. I was trying to practice Stackoverflow Api as a test case, I have tried using SXAPI (stack Overflow Version 4). When I try to run simple program to fetch some user info, like protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { User user = StackExchangeApi.User.GetUserWithId(175216, StackExchangeApi.StackExchangeSite.StackOverflow); Response.Write(user.Name + " has asked " + user.Questions.Count + " questions"); user.Clear(); } I initially got this error Call SXAPI.Initialize(...) before using SXAPI Line 155: { Line 156: if (UserAgent == null || !SXAPI.Initialized) Line 157: throw new NotInitializedException(); Line 158: Line 159: TimeSpan diff; got it fixed using this peice of code: SXAPI.Initialize("SoApiTest", new Uri("http://localhost:6832/Default.aspx")); I cannot fingd this information any where as, why do we need to initialize the API, Is it the same case with all API's. Why addding a reference (.dll) is not enough like other applications ?
