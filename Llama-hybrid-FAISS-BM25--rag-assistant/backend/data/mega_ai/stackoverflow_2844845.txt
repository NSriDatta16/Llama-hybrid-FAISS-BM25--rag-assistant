QWebFrame::evaluateJavaScript vs. script-tag in HTML

I want to develop an application that uses QtWebKit and JQuery. What I need to know is, is there any difference between reading JQuery from a file and evaluateJavaScript it, or embedding it as a script tag within the "page" that is displayed within the widget? EDIT: It seems that I have this figured out at least partially. evaluateJavaScript will apparently work reliably; but if I do baseurl = QUrl.fromLocalFile( QDir.current().absoluteFilePath("doesntexist.html")); view.setHtml( u""" """, baseurl); The file is never even read from disk (checked with inotify). this also affects baseurl being initialized with either QUrl("file:/") QUrl("."); QUrl(); or QUrl("file://") And I have also tried to change the script src parameter to absolute paths on the hard drive, and to a relative path with and without "./" in front. How do I do it right (aside from the Qt Resource System) to get the script tag to work with local js files? Is this just poorly documented, or am I missing something?
