Actually, I think that what you're looking for is a CLOB field. Quoting Using Advanced Data Types : BLOB and CLOB and NCLOB Data Types The JDBC driver implements all the methods of the java.sql.Blob , java.sql.Clob , and java.sql.NClob interfaces. Note: CLOB values can be used with SQL Server 2005 large-value data types. Specifically, CLOB types can be used with the varchar(max) and nvarchar(max) data types, BLOB types can be used with varbinary(max) and image data types, and NCLOB types can be used with ntext and nvarchar(max) . In other words, use a VARCHAR(MAX) or a NVARCHAR(MAX) if you need unicode support. About their maximum length: The maximum storage size for VARCHAR(MAX) is 2^31-1 bytes (2,147,483,647 bytes or 2GB - 1 bytes). The storage size is the actual length of data entered + 2 bytes. The data entered can be 0 characters in length. Since each character in a VARCHAR data type uses one byte, the maximum length for a VARCHAR(MAX) data type is 2,147,483,645. The maximum storage size for NVARCHAR(MAX) is also 2^31-1 bytes (2,147,483,647 bytes or 2GB - 1 bytes). The storage size, in bytes, is two times the number of characters entered + 2 bytes. The data entered can be 0 characters in length. Since each Unicode character in an NVARCHAR data type uses two bytes, the maximum length for an NVARCHAR(MAX) data type is 1,073,741,822. That should be enough for your HTML. EDIT: On the Hibernate side, your annotated entity looks fine. On the database side, it should be ok. However, could you try to use VARCHAR(MAX) instead of TEXT (and remove this doubt about TEXT). CREATE TABLE dbo.IndustrySectorTearSheetBlob ( ... htmlBlob varchar(max) NULL ... ) By the way, what Hibernate dialect are you using? And what JDBC driver are you using?
