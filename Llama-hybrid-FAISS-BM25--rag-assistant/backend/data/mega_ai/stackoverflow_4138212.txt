Any UIView supports having a gesture recognizer added to it with the -addGestureRecognizer: method. That might not be the best approach here, though: if you'd like to replicate the Maps behavior, you can use an MKPinAnnotationView with its draggable property set to YES , then update your overlay's boundaries to fit the annotation's position when the drag ends (i.e. when the map view calls its -mapView:annotationView:didChangeDragState:fromOldState: delegate method). Note that whatever annotation class you're using needs to implement a -setCoordinate: method, as defined in the MKAnnotation protocol, for pin dragging to work.
