Curl connection options

I'd like to know how to check out the speed of a file being uploaded in real time using the curl library in C++. This is what I have written: curl_easy_getinfo(curl,CURLINFO_SPEED_UPLOAD,&c); But the manual says that it shows average speed, but even this doesn't seem to work with me, because I can only see a 0. There is one more thing: How to set an upload limit that works, because if I write this: curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE, 100); I get an error 502 message.
