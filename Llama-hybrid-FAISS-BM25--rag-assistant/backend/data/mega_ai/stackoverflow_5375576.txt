I think a subquery is exactly the appropriate way to do this, regardless of your RDBMS. Why would it be inelegant? For the second query, just join the users table like this: SELECT x.ucount, u.cdate, COUNT(*) FROM ( SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS ucount FROM objects_users GROUP BY user_id ) AS x LEFT JOIN users AS u ON x.user_id = u.id GROUP BY u.cdate, x.ucount ORDER BY u.cdate, x.ucount
