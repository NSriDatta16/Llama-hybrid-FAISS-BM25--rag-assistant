How to give CIFAR-10 as an input to MLP

I am a noob in machine learning and trying to build a classifier using keras by following this tutorial machine learning mastery tutorial I want to build a classifier based on MLP like in classification of MNIST using MLP for CIFAR-10 data set.Like in MNIST data set the 28*28 images to a 784 vector is given as a input to the neural network. Like wise how should I frame the data in CIFAR-10 should it be changed in the 36*36 pixels rgb values to an array? or what type of array should I make to give as a input to the MLP network?
