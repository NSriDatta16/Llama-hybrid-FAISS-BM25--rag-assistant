My guess is that the characteristic equation you are departing from is different from mine (based on discussion in Hamilton, Time Series Analysis). Let me proceed in a couple of steps to see whether we agree. Consider the equation $$ \lambda^2-\phi_1\lambda-\phi_2=0 $$ If $z$ is a root of the "standard" characteristic equation $1-\phi_1 z-\phi_2 z^2=0$ and setting $z^{-1}=\lambda$ , the display obtains from rewriting the standard one as follows: \begin{eqnarray*} 1-\phi_1 z-\phi_2 z^2&=&0\\ \Rightarrow z^{-2}-\phi_1 z^{-1}-\phi_2 &=&0\\ \Rightarrow \lambda^2-\phi_1\lambda -\phi_2 &=&0 \end{eqnarray*} Hence, an alternative condition for stability of an $AR(2)$ is that all roots of the first display are inside the unit circle, $|z|>1 \Leftrightarrow |\lambda|=|z^{-1}| . We use this representation to derive the stationarity triangle of an $AR(2)$ process, that is that an $AR(2)$ is stable if the following three conditions are met: $\phi_2 $\phi_2 $\phi_2>-1$ Recall that you can write the roots of the first display (if real) as $$ \lambda_{1,2}=\frac{\phi_1\pm\sqrt{\phi_1^2+4\phi_2}}{2} $$ to find the first two conditions. Then, the $AR(2)$ is stationary iff $|\lambda| , hence (if the $\lambda_i$ are real): \begin{eqnarray*} -1 The larger of the two $\lambda_i$ is bounded by $\phi_1+\sqrt{\phi_1^2+4\phi_2} , or: \begin{eqnarray*} \phi_1+\sqrt{\phi_1^2+4\phi_2}& Analogously, we find that $\phi_2 . If $\lambda_i$ is complex, then $\phi_1^2 and so $$\lambda_{1,2} = \phi_1/2\pm i\sqrt{-(\phi_1^2+4\phi_2)}/2.$$ The squared modulus of a complex number is the square of the real plus the square of the imaginary part. Hence, $$ \lambda^2 = (\phi_1/2)^2 + \left(\sqrt{-(\phi_1^2+4\phi_2)}/2\right)^2 = \phi_1^2/4-(\phi_1^2+4\phi_2)/4 = -\phi_2. $$ This is stable if $|\lambda| , hence if $-\phi_2 or $\phi_2>-1$ , as was to be shown. (The restriction $\phi_2 resulting from $\phi_2^2 is redundant in view of $\phi_2 and $\phi_2 .) Plotting the stationarity triangle, also indicating the line that separates complex from real roots, we get Produced in R using phi1 1-phi[1]),cex=.7) text(-1.75,.5,expression(phi[2]>1+phi[1]),cex=.7)
