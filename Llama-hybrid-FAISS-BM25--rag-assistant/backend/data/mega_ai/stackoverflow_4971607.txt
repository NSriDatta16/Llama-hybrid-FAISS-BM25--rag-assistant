Recording transition of code between two files using Mercurial

I organized code incorrectly in a game I'm developing, and intend to move the state update code from GameView class into the Level class. I would like to record this cut-and-paste in some way. I use Mercurial for versioning. Is this possible with Mercurial? Does any other VCS provide this feature? Reading a bit more and watching Linus' talk about git at Google, as well as reviewing answers and comments, I understand that this is a feature of git's blame command and works by doing heuristics. I could get this functionality by using hg-git , exporting the Mercurial changesets, and then just using the git blame -M -C command. Is there an easier way that does not involve git? If it is not, I'll accept an existing answer that mentions git and describes using its functionality best.
