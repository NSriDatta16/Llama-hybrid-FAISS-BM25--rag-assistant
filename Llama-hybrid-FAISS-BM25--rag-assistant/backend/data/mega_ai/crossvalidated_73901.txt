How to interpret the results of a t-test?

I recently performed an experiment observing ants. For five days I measured the amount of food they ate, 25 ants in the fruits group and 25 ants in the vegetables group. Each ant was kept isolated in its own container. My hypothesis was that the ant (3 mg in body weight) would be able to eat 20 times more food than what it weighed; I came to that assumption by relating it to the amount of weight they can lift. The average for the fruits was 357 mg and the average for the vegetables was 358 mg. Keep in mind that I didn't take into account all the weight lost from the food by loss of water evaporating; I just assumed it was all eaten by the ants. For my results I get a t-value of -0.0981 ; df=223 ; standard error of difference=0.015 ; p-value of 0.9220. So since this is my first experiment dealing with t-test. I don't know how to interpret and present the results. Can someone please explain what they mean?
