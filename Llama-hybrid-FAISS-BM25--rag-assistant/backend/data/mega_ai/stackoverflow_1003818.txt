If you are using the GCC toolchain, gcov is going to get you source, functional, and branch coverage statistics. gcov works fine for MinGW and Cygwin. This will allow you to get coverage statistics as well as emitting instrumented source code that allows you to visualize unexecuted code. However, if you really want to hit it out of the park with pretty reports, using gcov in conjunction with lcov is the way to go. lcov will give you bar reports scoped to files and directories, functional coverage statistics, and color coded source file browsing to show coverage (green means executed, red means not...). lcov is easy on Linux, but may require some perl hacking on Cygwin. I personally have had some problems executing the scripts (lcov is implemented in perl) on Windows. I've gotten a hacked up version to work, but be forewarned. Another approach is doing the gcov emit on windows, and doing the lcov post processing on Linux, where it will surely work out of the box.
