Logistic Regression outperforms MLPClassifier

I am new in ML and I am trying to train classifier. I have a tiny dataset, just 90 examples, I divided it 70/30 train/test set and started to train. As I know MLP must outperform Logistic Regression, but I have an opposite situation in my case, firstly I thought that I give bad hyperparameters, so I tried to use GridSearchCV for finding best hyperparameters, but after it, again Logistic Regression was better, I am wondering maybe is it because of the small number of dataset or I missed something?
