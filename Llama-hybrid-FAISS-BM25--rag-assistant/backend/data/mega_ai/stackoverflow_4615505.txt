Neural network output layer for multiple pattern recognition

Assume that I have a method or other neural network to do pattern detection on an image correctly. How should I design a neural network where there are multiple patterns in an image? Say that in an image, there are X patterns to be detected, what would be the best approach? AFAIK output layer neurons values should be [-1,1]. How would I know if there are X amount of patterns recognised? Does this mean that I have to set a hardcoded limit on how many patterns it can recognise (since number of output neuron is fixed)?
