This sort of operation is often called "partition". Although there isn't a built-in partition function, I found this article: Partition in Python . Given that definition, you can do this: import random def partition(l, pred): yes, no = [], [] for e in l: if pred(e): yes.append(e) else: no.append(e) return yes, no lines = open("file.txt").readlines() lines1, lines2 = partition(lines, lambda x: random.random() Note that this won't necessarily exactly split the file in two, but it will on average.
