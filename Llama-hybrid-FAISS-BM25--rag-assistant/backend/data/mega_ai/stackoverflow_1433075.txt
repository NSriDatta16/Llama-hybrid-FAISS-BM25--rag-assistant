RageZ's answer was just about what I was going to post, but to be a little more specific, the last line of your php file should look like this: window.top.window.stopUpload( , ' '); The javascript will error without quotes around that second argument and I'm assuming $new_file_name is what you want to pass in. To be safe, you probably even want to escape the file name (I think in this case addslashes will work).
