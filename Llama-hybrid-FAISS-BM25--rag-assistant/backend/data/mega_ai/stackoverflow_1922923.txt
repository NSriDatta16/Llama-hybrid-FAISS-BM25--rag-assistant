WPF windows organization techniques

Im developing some wpf app. Basically i have two types of windows: search windows and insert/edit windows. When i developed win forms apps, i used a trick, called MdiParent. In that way i had ability to put my caled search type windows in a "stack". In orher words if i called 5 different search windows from meniu, they apeared in a component like tab control, one after other.By clicking on that tabs, i could see search results of clicked tab window. The trick as i said was MdiParent technique, like: private ProductDiscount frmProductDiscount = null; private void ProductDiscountToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { if ((frmProductDiscount == null) || (!frmProductDiscount.Visible)) { frmProductDiscount = new ProductDiscount(); frmProductDiscount.MdiParent = this; frmProductDiscount.Show(); } else { frmProductDiscount.Activate(); } } So does anyone can me suggest a good way to implement such a window organization technique in WPF and put some links or examples..?That would be a big help for me.
