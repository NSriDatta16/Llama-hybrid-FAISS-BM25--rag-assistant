Why the RNN has input shape error?

My x_train shape is (798,3) and y_train input shape is (798, 1). I am creating a RNN like this def create_rnn_model(): model = Sequential() model.add(SimpleRNN(20,return_sequences=False,stateful=stateful,activation='relu',batch_input_shape=(1,3,1))) model.add(Activation('relu')) adam = optimizers.Adam(lr=0.001) model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer=adam, metrics=[root_mean_squared_error]) return model But this returns the error ValueError: Error when checking input: expected simple_rnn_1_input to have 3 dimensions, but got array with shape (798, 3) My batch size =1 and my timestep is 3 and dat_dim=1 .Then where am I doing it wrong? Any help is appreciated. EDIT I changed my x_train to shape (798,3,1) and y_train shape to (798,) and ran the model but it threw an error ValueError: Error when checking target: expected activation_1 to have shape (20,) but got array with shape (1,) But I can run the model with 1 unit. How do I specify the model to run with 20 units instead of one.
