HTML\PHP : Flash Player detection technique

when we place flash files in our websites, it OFF-COURSE requires flash player on client machines, and prompts to install flash player... is there some php code using which i can check weather there is flash player on the client machine and if not then instead of placing\embedding a flash file i place an images over there... cuz in my specific case flash is not that much important... it is just for cosmetics, an animation... which i can replace by a gif or a simple jpeg doesnot matter... but can i do it
