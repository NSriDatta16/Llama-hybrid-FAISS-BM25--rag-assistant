I am working in a similar project, I will follow the next approach: Get a lot of classified images, images with few people, images with crowded spaces. For example, 'The ZÃ³calo' in Mexico, City could afford more or less 250 000 people. Extract features from these images, maybe with methods like either HOG or SIFT. HOG for example, is widely used to extract features in projects aimed to detecting pedestrians. Visit http://hogprocessing.altervista.org/ With the data obtained in the above step, is possible run some machine learning algorithm: SVM or NN. It will be necessary train this algorithm, and thereafter when you have a new image, then is possible use the NN or SVM trained in order to get a prediction. I guess you can follow a similar path.
