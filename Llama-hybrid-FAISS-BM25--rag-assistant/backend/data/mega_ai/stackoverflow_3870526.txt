Although I'm not 100% I got you right, try this piece of code. var url = "/organizations/" + organization + "/media/galleries/" + gallery + "/update_photo_index" $.getJSON(url, function(data) { // the outer is an array, so just loop as usual for (var i = 0; i Remember that in JSON "[ ... ]" describes an array whereas "{ ... }" describes an object. With an array you can just loop as with every other javascript array. If you got an object, it's like any other javascript object whose fields are accessible either with object.field or object['field']. So using JSON in javascript is nearly a no-brainer. Hope that helps.
