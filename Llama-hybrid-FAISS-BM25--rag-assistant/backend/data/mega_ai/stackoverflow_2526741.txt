An event for when xVal validation fails?

I have a registration form leveraging xVal to handle all validation on the form. It works really well, with one exception: the user doesn't get feedback because another element on the page (a tip telling the user that their username will be their email address) draws on top of the span element xVal spits out when it notices a problem. If I had a way to detect when xVal has a problem with the email field, I could just toggle the visibility of that tooltip and be on my way, but I'm not sure how to do so. I know that xVal uses jquery.validate.js under the hood; is there an event or something I could tie into to do this?
