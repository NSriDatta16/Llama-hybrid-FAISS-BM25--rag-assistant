As a complement to what was proposed here: Another option is to do like it is done for getty daemon. Please see /etc/inittab and appropriate inittab(5) man page. It seems it is most system-wide mean ;-). It could look like file fragment below. Obvious advantage this mean is pretty standard and it allows to control your daemon through run levels. # Run gettys in standard runlevels 1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty1 2:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty2 3:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty3 4:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty4 5:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty5 6:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty6
