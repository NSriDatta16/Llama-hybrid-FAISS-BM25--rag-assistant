Oracle Application Server; What role in an organization typically supports the middle tier?

In medium to large organizations what team or group typically support middle tier components like Oracle Application Servers? (Unix Team, DBA Team, Or Application Development/Support Team) In a client server application design the delineation of ownership between the server and the client is very clear. In the client server case the Unix Administrators manage the servers and the development support team manage and support the clients. (and the DBA's support/manage the database) Recently at our shop the lines have become blurred; the introduction of an Oracle application Server (OAS) has popped up; OAS seems to require a very unique set of skills but also show some similarity to the client server skills. (part Unix Admin, Part Dba, Part Application Developer/Client Support) What have others done when confronted with this kind of challenge......?? Does a completely new team form that exclusively supports the Middle Tier?? Our It Group has 3 Unix Admins; 3 Application Support staff; 3 Dba's to give the perspective of the size of the teams....
