SQL Databases Quota Website Hosting

Id a 10gb Total SQL Databases Quota enough for a site that only has comments, not any pictures or videos? say each post was (in LONGTEXT, under mysql) about a paragraph - would this be enough for say a few million or hundread million posts? how may about? Really appreshate the help - I found a good host site " http://www.ixwebhosting.com/index.php/v2/pages.hostingPlans ", but it only has the 10gb.
