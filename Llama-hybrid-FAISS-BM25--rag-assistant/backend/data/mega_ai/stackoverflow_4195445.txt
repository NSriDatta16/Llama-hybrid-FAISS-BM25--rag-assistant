Flex DataGrid column width: one column to rule them all?

I have a Flex 4, mx:DataGrid with the following (pertinent) properties set: width="100%" horizontalScrollPolicy="off" I have the minWidth set on all of the DataGridColumns and the width set on one of them. If I simply maximize/minimize the display (in browser or stand-alone flash player) of the application, the columns scale up and down nicely. But if you grab the edge of the application and drag it to make it bigger, only one column grows really big. When you drag the size down again, the one column remains big, but all of the other columns get squished way down. Is this a bug in the Flex DataGrid, or am I just missing a key property (or properties on the datagrid columns) to set, to make all columns grow and shrink when you drag-enlarge the app?
