Flatten Ragged LinkedHashMap

I have a LinkedHashMap where CommonEnum represents a type of byte[] that I want to keep track of. LinkedHashMap map = new LinkedHashMap (); What is the most efficient way in Java to flatten this into a continuous byte[] with the same ordering (thats why the HashMap is Linked).
