As described in Bayesian Data Analysis book by Gelman et al. and related blog entry on the eight schools example , treating everything as independent may not be the best idea. More reasonable, and accurate, apprach would consider the fact that you are comparing the same titles on different sites, so they should have something in common. The usual Bayesian way to go would be to define some kind of hierarchical model, for example something like $$ \begin{align} \alpha \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_\alpha) \qquad \beta_i &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\beta, \sigma^2_\beta) \qquad \gamma_j \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\gamma, \sigma^2_\gamma) \\ p_{ij} &= \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(\alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_j) \\ \mathsf{clicks}_{~ij} &\sim \mathcal{Bin}(p_{ij},\; n_{ij}) \end{align} $$ where $n_{ij}$ are the number of impressions (if I understand your data correctly), with some additional hyperpriors on $\sigma^2_\alpha, \sigma^2_\beta, \sigma^2_\gamma, \mu_\alpha, \mu_\beta$. As you can notice, this is a variation of Bayesian logistic regression model with "random effects" for each site $\beta_i$ and for each title $\gamma_j$. This lets you model the impact of individual sites and titles on views. Moreover, you can make use of all the data you have. Additionally, you can include some other explanatory variables in your model as well (in the regression part), what makes it very flexible. Unfortunatelly, to estimate such model you won't have a simple closed-form solution like in the case of beta-binomial model and you would need to use MCMC, but this can be easily and quite efficiently done in software like Stan (it is not that hard to learn and has great documentation).
