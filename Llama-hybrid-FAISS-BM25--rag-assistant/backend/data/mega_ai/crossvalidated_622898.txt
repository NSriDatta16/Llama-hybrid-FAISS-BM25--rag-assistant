This depends on the implementation. pracma::sample_entropy suggests the time complexity is $O(N^3)$ with a for loop + vector-matrix Kronecker product. This code for sample entropy shows the time complexity is $O(N^2)$ . When you look at this paper , the authors briefly talk about how to implement sample entropy. In particular, they mention: Comparisons were then made against each m-length vector within the time series. This part requires $O(N^2)$ to compute.
