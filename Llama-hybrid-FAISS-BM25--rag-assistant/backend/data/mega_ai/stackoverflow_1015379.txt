How to design database for multiple domains?

How to design database and organize data if I have two or more domains and one database? All sites for e-commerce purpose and one good can be for sale on each site. So I have only two ideas: I need to create one more field (site_id) in almost every table and duplicate data. I need to create one table with site_id information for all other fields from other tables. Both of ideas have a huge minuses. Any ideas? Thanks.
