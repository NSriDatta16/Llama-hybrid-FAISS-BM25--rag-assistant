Confidence/prediction intervals for total least squares regression

I am learning the ropes of total least squares regression and I found this thread How to perform orthogonal regression (total least squares) via PCA? where the answer by @amoeba, together with some R code, is just spectacular. However, unlike a vanilla linear regression, I am unsure about how to calculate the confidence interval of my prediction. Can anyone help and, if possible, provide some R code?
