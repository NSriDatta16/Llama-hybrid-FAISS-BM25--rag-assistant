Editing email templates

this is probably really easy, but here goes: My changes to the magento email templates don't show in the emails. What am I doing wrong? Do I need to reinstall magento to get the updates? Am I simply editing the wrong files? Thanks... UPDATE: So now: I have a fresh magento install I haven't touched the Transactional Emails admin I don't have locale set to 'en_US' (but since 1.4 that shouldn't be a problem right? Anyway, I tried setting the locale but it didn't help) I ERASED the entire app/locale/en_US/template/email/ catalog With this setup I completed an order and I still get the default email. The only thing I can think of is I'm coming at this from the wrong direction, but I can't for the life of me figure it out.
