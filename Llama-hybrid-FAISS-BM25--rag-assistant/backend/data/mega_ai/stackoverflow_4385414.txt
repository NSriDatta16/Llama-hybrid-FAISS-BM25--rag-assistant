Magento Error Call to a member function setCollection() on a non-object

I have a problem with my Magento. When I login and view my orders page, the following error is shown: Fatal error: Call to a member function setCollection() on a non-object in C:\wamp\www\danfemall\app\code\core\Mage\Sales\Block\Order\History.php on line 58 When I remove the setCollection function from the code, it runs well but I wonder what the setCollection function does and is it wise to remove that function from the code. Please someone help me out.
