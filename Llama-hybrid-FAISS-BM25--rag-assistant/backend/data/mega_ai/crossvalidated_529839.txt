MCMC with using MAP as starting value

let $X$ be a random variable from my target distribution $\pi(x)$ , which I know up to a normalizing constant, and I want to calculate $Ef(X)$ for some know function $f$ . The dimensions of $X$ are around 30, and I wanted to use MCMC to draw samples from $\pi(x)$ . At first, I started with a random starting point with an acceptance rate somewhere between 0.2 and 0.3. Then, I calculate my object of interests $$\hat{E}f(X) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^Nf(x_i), $$ where $N$ is the number of draws after burn-in. Then, the issue was that the sample standard deviation of $\hat{E}f(X)$ is too large. I want to reduce that. To do reduce my sample standard deviation, I thought that maybe starting at MAP solves the problem. So What I did is as follows. I first find MAP $$x^* = \arg\max_x \log \pi(x).$$ Then, I use transition matrix $q(x'|x_t) = q(x'|x^*)$ where $q(x|y)$ is the normal pdf of $x$ with mean $y$ . Then draw a samples using MCMC while keeping acceptance rate around 0.25 and 0.3. By doing this, I get a significantly smaller sample standard deviation. My guess is that this is because I am only looking around MAP. I am not sure if I can do this and claim that I have a reasonable approximation to my object of interests, especially when dimensions are around 30 and the target $\pi(x)$ may have multi modals.
