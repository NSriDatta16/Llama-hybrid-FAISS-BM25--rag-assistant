Which statistical model is being used in the Pfizer study design for vaccine efficacy?

I know there's a similar question here: How to calculate 95% CI of vaccine with 90% efficacy? but it doesn't have an answer, at the moment. Also, my question is different: the other question asks how to compute VE, using functions from a R package. I want to know why vaccine efficacy is defined as illustrated at the bottom of this page : $$ \text{VE} = 1 - \text{IRR}$$ where $$ \text{IRR} = \frac{\text{illness rate in vaccine group}}{\text{illness rate in placebo group}}$$ and which is the statistical model behind it. My attempts: I thought the researches would fit a logistic regression model a single binary predictor $X$ , identifying subjects who got the vaccine ( $X=1$ ) or not ( $X=0$ ): $p(Y|X) = \frac{1}{1+\exp{-(\beta_0 +\beta_1 X)}}$ However, this is clearly not the case, because for the Moderna vaccine we know that there were 5 cases in the vaccine arm, and 90 in the placebo arm, which corresponds to a $\text{VE}$ of $94.\bar{4}\%$ . These data alone are enough to determine $\text{VE}$ , but surely they're not enough to fit a LR model, and thus to determine $\beta_1$ . Also, by looking at page 111-113 of the Pfizer document, it looks like a different (Bayesian?) analysis is performed. Again, the point estimate seems to be $ \text{VE} = 1 - \text{IRR}$ , but the power of a test is mentioned, and two tables 7 and 8 are presented which show probability of success and failure. Can you show me how to obtain the results in such tables?
