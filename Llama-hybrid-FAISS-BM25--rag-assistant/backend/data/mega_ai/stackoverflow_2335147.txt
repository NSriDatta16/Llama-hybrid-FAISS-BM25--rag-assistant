As with much of Ada, I think the best answer here is really to consult the LRM . The section on managing task priorities is actually very readable, for a language standard definition anyway. Note that you can also set the priority of a task at runtime without use of a pragma. This makes use of the package Ada.Dynamic_Priorities . This is what I typically do these days, unless for some weird reason the desired priority is known at compile time, and I don't mind hard-coding it. I highly suggest that advanced users such as yourself poke through the LRM to see what all the language provides you. Pay particular attention to the annexes (the sections starting with a letter), as that is where most of the good stuff is documented. In your case, you will probably be particularly interested in the Real-Time annex (Annex D).
