If you have a feature vector of size $p$ and use PCA selecting $p$ components, you will end up with a feature vector that has the same size as the original vector ( $p$ variables), and that, globally, provide the same amount of information as the original vector. But individually, the variables would be different. From a start, your new $p$ variables after PCA would be uncorrelated with each other, while it is likely that your original variables have some sort of correlation.
