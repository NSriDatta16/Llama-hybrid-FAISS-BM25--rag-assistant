Sorry, but I think what you are asking is impossible (from a computational point of view). The system this data comes from could be doing, say, SELECT Y1, Y2 FROM my_secret_data WHERE Col1 = x AND Col2 = Y and Col3 = Z; Where my_secret_data contains values that are not computationally derived. So unless you had the underlying table, you could never find an algorithm that solves it (unless you had every possible combination of inputs and outputs - which would then mean reconstructing the entire table) Outside computation, all I think you can do is look for patterns, and try to find out what the input / output values represent, and see where that takes you. Edit: All is not lost in certain situations; things would be different if the inputs, outputs and any functions the algorithm uses were continuous(given the inputs are alphanumeric this does not look the case here) If they were, you could (probably) find an algorithm via interpolating (perhaps a neural network), but under these circumstances, given the values, I think you would need a lot more sample data.
