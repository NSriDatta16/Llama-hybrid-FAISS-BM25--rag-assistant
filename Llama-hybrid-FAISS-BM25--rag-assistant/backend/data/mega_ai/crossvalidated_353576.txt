I don't know what language you are working with, but in R and Python sklearn you have a feature called 'Feature importance' that ranks the variables in you random forest models by importance. This also works for time series data Have might want to have look at that: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html and http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html (another possibility would be to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) but this is way more complicated and you loose the interpretability of your variables so I would stick to feature selection).
