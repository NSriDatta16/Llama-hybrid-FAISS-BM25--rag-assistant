How to label smart meter/plug data (time series)?

I would like to label smart plug data recorded in different household appliances so that I can train a machine to recognize for example when the oven is turned on. I am new to this topic and I am looking for tools/approaches that help me get started. The data would be time stamps and power consumption values. **Edit because the question was too broad The data would be in .csv format and I would use samples of the data where I KNOW what the appliance is doing, so that I can label it correctly. For example a washing machine on a delicate cycle or on a regular cycle.
