It's considered bad practice to depend on return values when using events. Rather, you should use a user-defined EventArgs to get back results. public class ConstraintEventArgs : EventArgs { public bool IsValid { get; set; } } It's also important to implement some mechanism in which multiple event listeners won't override each other's values. Most of the time (with a boolean flag), we will allow (or encourage) users to only explicitly turn it on (never off). For example, with CancelEventArgs it's never a good idea to set it to false explicitly; Users should always set it to true or do nothing. The same idea should apply here with IsValid .
