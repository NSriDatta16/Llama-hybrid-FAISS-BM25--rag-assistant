"When I started programming, we didn't have any of these sissy 'icons' and 'Windows.' All we had were zeros and ones -- and sometimes we didn't even have ones. I wrote an entire database program using only zeros." "You had zeros? We had to use the letter 'O'." -Dilbert (Scott Adams) http://www.mscha.net/tmp/dt19920908.gif
