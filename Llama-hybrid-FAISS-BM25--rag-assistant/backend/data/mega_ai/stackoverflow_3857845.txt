I've had a very similar issue (in Domino 6.0.4) and it was due to a bug. It's been a while so I don't remember where I found that it reported as a but (probably on notes.net), but I spent many many hours trying to figure out a workaround. In my situation, the only fix was to reboot the server. Have your admin check the logs for any error messages around the time the agent fires. You could also add some print statements to the agent, which get written to the log, just to confirm the agent is running. If your issue is the same as mine, the symptoms will be: the agent runs fine but there's an error in the log related to sending messages. Any other agents that send mail will also be affected. It works fine for weeks, even months, then suddenly stops working. and unfortunately, the only fix I've ever found is to reboot when it happens.
