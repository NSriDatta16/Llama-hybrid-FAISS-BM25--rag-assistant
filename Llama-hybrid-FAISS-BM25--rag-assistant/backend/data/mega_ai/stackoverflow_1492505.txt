Screw the designer and learn HTML and CSS to understand what's going on. I mainly program in WinForms, so I'm used to just dragging things around. Why can't I do this here. Because the markup engine follows different rules. It's not like you have a screen of pixels and you have a complete control over each. What you absolutely need to learn is the difference between Block-level elements and Inline elements and the Box model . Before you understand at least that, it will be difficult to accomplish anything.
