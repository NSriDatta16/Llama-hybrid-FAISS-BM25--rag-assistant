Yeah unless you just want to learn all of the details of the things that go into making a game, you definitely want to go with a game engine and just focus on building your game logic rather than the details of graphics, audio, resource management, etc. Personally I like to recommend the Torque Game Builder (aka Torque 2D) from GarageGames . But you can probably find some free game engines out there that will suit your needs as well.
