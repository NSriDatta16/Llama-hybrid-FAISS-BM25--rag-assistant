Although it binds your hands a bit visually, you might want to take a look at jQuery UI's Sortable and Dragable plugins. A demo is here . If you follow their documentation and examples, modeling this becomes trivial. As for writing it out to a file, you may not need to do that (assuming you're talking about doing this on the server). As long as the list of values is not huge, you can use JSON.stringify to serialize your array/object and write it out persistently to a cookie. Since you are writing out to a database, you may be specifically targeting Gears/Webkit/iOS browsers, in which case you may want to look into window.localStorage (it will eventually have full support in other browsers, but for now I think it can only safely be used in recent webkit browsers, including iPhone and iPad.)
