What analysis to choose when I have one continuous and one nominal predictor and my dependent variable is binary?

So in my data, I have a continuous variable (say from 0.1 to 1) and a nominal variable indicating the condition (3 conditions, no drug, drug and baseline) and a binary dependent variable (0 or 1). So I know that if I want to know how my continuous variable affects my binary variable I would do a logistic regression. But what if I now also want to know how this effect is influenced by the administration of the drug (the condition)?
