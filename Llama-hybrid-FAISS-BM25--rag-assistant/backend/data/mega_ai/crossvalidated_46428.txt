For "Was this page helpful" data, should I take response rate into account?

To help me focus on which pages on a site to improve, I'm looking at user feedback to the question "Was this page helpful?" (Answers are "Yes" or "No".) The response rate (responses divided by unique pageviews) varies across different pages. And in fact the pages with low response rate also tend to have a higher ratio of negative ratings. This suggests to me that many users who don't find a page helpful just leave without rating it. (I have looked at other factors that could have affected response rate but the correlations are very weak.) I understand that it's problematic to generalize the result for pages that have a low response rate. But I'm reluctant to exclude these pages, since it seems that they may be the ones most in need of attention. In view of this, is it reasonable to ignore response rate per page and simply look at the positive to negative ratings ratio? Or is there a way I could account for response rate and still include these pages?
