You don't have the artifact installed in the local repository and maven cannot find it in the repositories it knows about either. The name for javaee.javaee-api looks formal enough but mvnrepository.com does not know anything about it. If it is a jar which you have locally (why would it be called javaee though?), you need to install it in the local mvn repository using the mvn install command (the exact command used for installing is usually provided with that error you've been seeing).
