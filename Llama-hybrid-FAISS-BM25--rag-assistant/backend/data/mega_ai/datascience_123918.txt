Can we show only results of some epochs in tqdm?

I am training a NN and use tqdm for showing the results. However, the bad thing is that it shows the results for every epoch. This is too many as I want to train NN for atleast 500 epochs. Is there any way that I show the results for e.g. only each 10 steps i.e. "if epoch //10 ==0"? If its possible, what code and where to add it? for epoch in range(1, epochs + 1): ### =====TRAINING===== model.train() train_loss = 0 with tqdm(train_dataloader, unit="batch") as train_epoch_pbar: for data, labels in train_epoch_pbar: train_epoch_pbar.set_description(f"Epoch {epoch}") if torch.cuda.is_available(): data, labels = data.cuda(), labels.cuda() . . . print( f"======= Epoch: {epoch} Average Training loss: {avg_epoch_loss:.4f} =======" ) train_loss_list.append(avg_epoch_loss)
