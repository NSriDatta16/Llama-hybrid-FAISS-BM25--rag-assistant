How do you find a peak rate in time series?

I have a series of timestamps, and I would like to know what's the maximum hourly rate of the event that these timestamps represent. You can generalize this to any units. I'm looking for a window (interval) of a certain size that contains most of these values. The obvious approach is to divide the set by this interval and then pick the one with most values. This is however imprecise, especially if the peak is near the limits of interval. Is there some better solution?
