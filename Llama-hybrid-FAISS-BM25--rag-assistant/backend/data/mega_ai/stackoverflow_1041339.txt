Removing the cursor will probably speed this up a lot. By using a derived table, you can get the counts and averages with one query and join that back to the other tables to get the remaining columns. Like this.... SELECT a.NAME_LAST, a.NAME_FIRST, ca.status, Scores.AverageScore, Scores.CountScore FROM application a Inner Join committee_applications ca On a.application_id = ca.application_id Left Join ( SELECT application_id, AVG(score) As AverageScore, Count(*) As CountScore FROM reviews Group By application_id ) As Scores On a.application_id = Scores.application_id
