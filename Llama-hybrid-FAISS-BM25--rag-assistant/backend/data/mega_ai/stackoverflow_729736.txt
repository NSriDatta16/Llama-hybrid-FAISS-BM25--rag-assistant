Another great way to do this is to use DBUnit but first you have to transform your XML data using an XSL Stylesheet into something that: a. Matches your Database Schema b. Something that DBUnit can understand Also make sure you use a C++ programmed XSL transformer to do the transformation as it will allow you to work with larger sets of data than a Java-based one without increasing the size of the stack for Java (also it's faster). If you need an example of how to use DBUnit checkout Matt Raibles Appfuse Project .
