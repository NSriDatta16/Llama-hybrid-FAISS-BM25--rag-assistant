Yes Makes no sense as the driver can combine these matrices for you (it knows they are uniforms, so will not change during the draw call). Yes only if you are CPU bound The first thing you need to know is where exactly is your bottleneck. GPU is not an answer, because it's a complex system. The actual problem might be among these: Shader processing (vertex/fragment/geometry) Fill rate Draw calls number GPU VMEM (that's where interleaving and smaller textures help) System bus (streaming some data every frame?) You need to perform a series of test to see the problem. For example, draw everything to a bigger FBO to see if it's a fill rate problem (or increase MSAA amount). Or draw everything twice to check the draw call overload issues.
