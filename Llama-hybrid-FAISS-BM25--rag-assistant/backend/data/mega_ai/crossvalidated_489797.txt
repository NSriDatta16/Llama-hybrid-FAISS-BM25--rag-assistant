RFE, feature selection for Churn/Credit Risk modelling

I am currently working on a redemption model for a financial company, using time series data and Logistic Regression . Currently we have a few features that are time dependant (I know, logistic is not the best for that). The current feature selection method we are going for is a wrapper RFECV that uses an algorithm called "GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis" which is a tree method. The question I have is about which algorithm to use within the RFE , I know that there are many alternatives such as Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Cox PH, others . So far, I haven't seen a clear answer about when to use which, but in my mind using trees, for example, wouldn't be the best option since I am fitting the data using Logistic Regression, which is a "1 layer" algorithm, whereas trees uses many layers and the importance of features could vary depending on which layer you are, so it doesn't sound right to me (I could be really wrong). I think that a good solution could be going for a Survival Analysis approach and use, maybe, CoxPH regression or other survival method since these account for time-dependent variables and they are also a "1 layer" models. What do you think?
