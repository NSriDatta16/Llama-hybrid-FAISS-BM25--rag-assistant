Question about autocorrelation of time series

I have a time series $S(t)$ for $t\in I $ where $I=[0,t_\text{max}]$ is an interval. The time series is very regular, $S(t) = \sin(t)$ , although my following question is independent of the explicit analytic form (if any) of the series. I want to select two sub-intervals of $I$ of same length, for example $I_0 = [t_0,t_1]$ and $I_1 = [t_1,2t_1-t_0]$ for some $t_0>0,t_1>t_0$ . Now, I consider the two following series $$ S_0 (t) = S(t) \,,\quad \text{for}\,\,t \in I_0\\ S_1 (t) = S(t_1-t_0+t) \,,\quad \text{for}\,\,t \in I_0 $$ and I am interested in computing the correlation between $S_0 (t)$ and $S_1 (t)$ $$ \text{corr}\left(S_0 (t),S_1 (t)\right)\,,\qquad (\text{Eq}.1) $$ Is this quantity somewhere defined in statistics? Does it have any statistical property?
