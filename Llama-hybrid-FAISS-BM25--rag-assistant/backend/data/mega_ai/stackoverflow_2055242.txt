While there isn't a built-in syntax to do this, I'd suggest you take a look at the list of supported logical operators and then carefully study De Morgan's laws . Sufficient knowledge in these two fields will allow you to write any logical statement in if–else if syntax. EDIT: To completely answer your question (although this has been done already in other answers), you could write a neither–nor statement like this: if (!A && !B) { DoStuff(); }
