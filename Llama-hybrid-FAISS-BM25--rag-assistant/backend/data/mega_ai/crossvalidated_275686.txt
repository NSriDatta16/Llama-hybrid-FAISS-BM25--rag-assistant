It rather depends on how you are using language. Under Pearson and Neyman decision theory, it is not evidence for the null, but you are to behave as if the null is true. The difficulty comes from modus tollens. Bayesian methods are a form of inductive reasoning and, as such, are a form of incomplete reasoning. Null hypothesis methods are a probabilistic form of modus tollens and as such are part of deductive reasoning and therefore is a complete form of reasoning. Modus tollens has the form "if A is true then B is true, and B is not true; therefore A is not true." In this form, it would be if the null is true then the data will appear in a particular manner, they do not appear in that manner, therefore (to some degree of confidence) the null is not true (or at least is "falsified." The problem is that you want "If A then B and B." From this, you wish to infer A, but that is not valid. "If A then B," does not exclude "if not A then B" from also being a valid statement. Consider the statement "if it is a bear, then it can swim. It is a fish (not a bear)." The statements say nothing about the ability of non-bears to swim. Probability and statistics are a branch of rhetoric and not a branch of mathematics. It is a heavy user of math but is not part of math. It exists for a variety of reasons, persuasion, decision making or inference. It extends rhetoric into a disciplined discussion of evidence.
