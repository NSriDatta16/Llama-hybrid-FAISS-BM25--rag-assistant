Using AJAX with Drag/Drop jQuery plugin

Based off of this Drag/Drop example If I want to increment the the value (vote) in one of my database tables after the Draggable is Dropped to its container, would I just use $.ajax() within this block below? drop: function( event, ui ) { $( this ) .addClass( "ui-state-highlight" ) .find( "p" ) .html( "Dropped!" ); } or would that method not work with this particular plugin?
