The values you get from FactoMineR are not loadings: they are coordinates. Loadings are coordinates divided by the square root of eigenvalues. I don't know if you can directly get loadings from FactoMineR. However, you can retrieve eigenvalues (in your example, through pr$eig ), so you can calculate loadings from coordinates. Example with your data, for the first dimension of the PCA: library(FactoMineR) pr $var$ coord[,"Dim.1"] / sqrt( pr$eig["comp 1","eigenvalue"]) res THN GRH SRD THML GLI GRMA 0.5597064 0.5289944 -0.4187044 -0.2361008 0.3308003 0.2576972 -- which is in line with your results from prcomp, so there is no inconsistency between the two libraries (at least in this respect): myPr Edit: After digging a bit, it is in fact possible to directly get loadings from the factoMineR package without resorting to the above code (I leave it as it is though, to illustrate the underlying calculations). In the data from the original question, you can find the loadings in pr$svd$V .
