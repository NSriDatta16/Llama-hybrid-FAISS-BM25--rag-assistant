The brokerage measure introduced by Gould and Fernandez (referenced in the sna documentation) is a constrained version of betweenness centrality. Betweenness centrality counts shortest paths between all nodes. Gould-Fernandez brokerage only counts paths between nodes assigned to different groups/classes, for different combinations of group membership among triads (giving rise to the gatekeeper, coordinator, etc roles) and only (if memory serves) two-step paths. Hence they are correlated, but not perfectly so. My experience is that the correlation can be fairly high, despite the apparent conceptual distinction. See: www.jstor.org/stable/270949
