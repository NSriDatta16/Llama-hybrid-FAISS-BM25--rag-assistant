Agresti-Coull Interval question

Can someone please help me understanding why add 2 successes and failures in Agresti-Coull interval instead of 3 or 4 or any arbitrary number? I did my own analysis here and found out that when for example, add 3 successes, the coverage is even better than adding 2, does this introduce any additional bias or problem? I did notice the curvation changed to something similar to no correction, why is that? If so, can someone help pointing out some references I can read more about? Many thanks for your help!
