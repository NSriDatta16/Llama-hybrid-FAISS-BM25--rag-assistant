Usually language models are not evaluated using an accuracy metric. That is for two reasons. One is that the accuracy will often be quite low due to the large variety of possible next words to choose from. Second, most language model applications don't require you to make a hard prediction about which word will come next. Instead they expect a probability distribution over the possible next words. A better way of picking the best parameter setting is to choose the one that gives the best average log probability for the next word.
