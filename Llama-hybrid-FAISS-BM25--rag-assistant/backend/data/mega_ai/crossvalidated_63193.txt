I found a lot of interpretations about confidence interval and credible set are wrong. For example, confidence interval cannot be expressed in this format $P(\theta\in CI)$. If you look closely on the 'distributions' in the inference of frequentist and Bayesian, you will see Frequentist works on Sampling Distribution on the data while Bayesian works on (posterior) distribution of the parameter. They are defined on totally different Sample Space and Sigma Algebra. So yes you can say 'If you repeat the experiment a lot of times, approximately 95% of the 95% CIs will cover the true parameter'. Although in Bayesian you get to say 'the true value of the statistic lies in a 95% credible interval with probability 95%', however, this 95% probability (in Bayesian) itself is only an estimate. (Remember it is based on the condition distribution given this specific data, not the sampling distribution). This estimator should come with a random error due to random sample. Bayesian try to avoid the type I error issue. Bayesian always say it does not make sense to talk about type I error in Bayesian. This is not entirely true. Statisticians always want to measure the possibility or error that 'Your data suggests you to make a decision but the population suggests otherwise'. This is something Bayesian cannot answer (details omitted here). Unfortunately, this may be the most important thing statistician should answer. Statisticians do not just suggest a decision. Statisticians should also be able to address how much the decision can possibly go wrong. I have to invent the following table and terms to explain the concept. Hope this can help explain the difference of Confidence Interval and Credible Set. Please note that the posterior distribution is $P(\theta_0|Data_n)$, where $\theta_0$ is defined from the prior $P(\theta_0)$. In frequentist the sampling distribution is $P(Data_n; \theta)$. The sampling distribution of $\hat{\theta}$ is $P(\hat{\theta}_n; \theta)$. The subscript $n$ is the sample size. Please do not use the notation $P(Data_n | \theta)$ to present the sampling distribution in frequentist. You can talk about random data in $P(Data_n; \theta)$ and $P(\hat{\theta}_n; \theta)$ but you cannot talk about random data in $P(\theta_0|Data_n)$. The '???????' explains why we are not able to evaluate type I error (or anything similar) in Bayesian. Please also note that credible sets can be used to approximate confidence intervals under some circumstances. However this is only mathematical approximation. The interpretation should go with frequentist. The Bayesian interpretation in this case does not work anymore. Thylacoleo 's notation in $P(x|\theta)$ is not frequentist. This is still Bayesian. This notation causes a fundamental problem in measure theory when talking about frequentist. I agree with the conclusion made by Dikran Marsupial . If you are the FDA reviewer, you always want to know the possibility that you approve a drug application but the drug is actually not efficacious. This is the answer that Bayesian cannot provide, at least in classic/typical Bayesian.
