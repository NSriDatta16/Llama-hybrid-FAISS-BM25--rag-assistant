You could use any probabilistic time series model in combination with arithmetic coding . You'd have to quantize the data, though. Idea: the more likely an "event" is to occur, the more bits for that event are reserved. E.g if $p(x_t = 1| x_{1:t-1}) = 0.5$ with $x_{1:t-1}$ being the history of events seen so far, then coding that event will cost you 1 bit, while all others have to use more bits.
