Random Forest in Pose Estimation

I am having problem in understanding the number of feature input to the Random forest mentioned in the paper below. Shotton, Jamie, et al. "Efficient human pose estimation from single depth images." Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on 35.12 (2013): 2821-2840. It says, feature parameters $\phi = (\delta_1, \delta_2)$ feature response: $f(u|\phi) = z(u + \delta_{1}/z(u)) - z(u + \delta_{2}/z(u))$ Does it mean there are total 5 input features (5 dimension) for the training and testing of Random Forest: $\delta_{1}x, \delta_{1}y, \delta_{2}x, \delta_{2}y, f$?
