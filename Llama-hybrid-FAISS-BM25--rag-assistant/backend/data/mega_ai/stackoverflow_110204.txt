If you can, you really want to find someone who knows how to use it, and pick their brains. That's because there are a lot of important principles (eg 3rd normal form) which will are a lot easier to learn through discussion rather than from books. If you want to teach yourself, you should learn the syntax for doing basic selects, joins, updates, deletes, and group by queries. You should also learn the "Swiss army knife" of selects, the CASE statement. Too many people don't. Many of the tutorials recommended in this thread will do that. Then you need to try to solve SQL problems. I'm sure that Joe Celko's SQL Puzzles and Answers is a good source of them, though it may be a little advanced. This will let you actually write SQL. But you still need to learn how to organize a database. Which for most purposes means that you really need to learn what 3rd normal form looks like. You don't have to be able to give a formal definition of it, just recognize it when you see it, and know how to adjust something to be in that format. Lots of references will explain it, but you won't know if you're reading them correctly. This is where it really, really helps to have access to someone who can look at a table layout and tell you, "That's right" vs "That's wrong, here's what needs to be changed." Failing all else, you could post a question here with a proposed layout. But a back and forth discussion with a live person would still be preferable IMO.
