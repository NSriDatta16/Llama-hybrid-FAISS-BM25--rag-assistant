Hate to say it but, matrices are handy: http://wonderfl.net/c/mwdp papervision rubiks http://wonderfl.net/images/capture/9/9d/9dd4/9dd41cd57b2f042f38bf450a41da77ab45348892.jpg Code is nicely commented too. Another thing that comes to mind, if matrix are overkill is grouping/reparenting DisplayObject3D instances on the fly. Say you have something as basic as this: var cubes:DisplayObject3D = new DisplayObject3D(); cubes.name = 'cubes'; for(var i:int = 0 ; i Those groups would only help for a few situations, but not all, the thing to keep in mind is you can name and group DO3D's Say you click and drag one tiny cube: figure out if it's position on the current active face(collection of 3X3 boxes). based on that you know what group of 3 it belongs, therefore, what group of 3X3X1 cubes to rotate as a group based on the current mouse position minus the previous one, you know what direction to rotate towards.
