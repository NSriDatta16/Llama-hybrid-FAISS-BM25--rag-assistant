At a high level, you're generating html from JavaScript, so any html which would work standalone will work when generated from JavaScript too. Some possibilities, with varying flexibility: Pre-formatted text, insert newline "\n" characters: line one line two Inserting break tags: line one line two Or my favourite, use paragraph tags: line one line two I like this because you can refer to each line in code as a single DOM element. Set this css to keep the lines side-by-side: div.code-listing p { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
