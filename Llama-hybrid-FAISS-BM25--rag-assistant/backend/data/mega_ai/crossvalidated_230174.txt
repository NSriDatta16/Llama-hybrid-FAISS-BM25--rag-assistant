" I know that you could compare the two time series by taking Pearson correlation and such" -- this is incorrect. Pearson Correlation assumes observations are independent, but time series data is by nature not independent. You would actually need to use a cross-correlation. Reference: https://web.archive.org/web/20160302024823/https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/74 Also, you shouldn't use the typical variance (if you really must calculate a variance); I suggest using something like Mean Absolute Deviance (MAD). You can then create a histogram to summarise the distribution of similarity/dissimilarity.
