Some possibilities are offered by the Wikipedia article on the Binomial distribution, under the section on Normal approximation , which currently includes the following comment (emphasis mine): Another commonly used rule is that both values $np$ and $n(1-p)$ must be greater than 5. However, the specific number varies from source to source , and depends on how good an approximation one wants. Now there, this is associated with ensuring that the normal approximation $x\sim N(\mu,\sigma)$ falls within the legal bounds for a binomial variable, $x\in[0,n]$. To spell this out, if we parameterize the desired coverage probability in terms of a z-score $z>0$, then we have $$ \mu \pm z\sigma \in [0,n] \implies z\sigma \leq \min[\,\mu \,,\, n - \mu \,] \implies z^2 \leq \min\left[\,\tfrac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2} \,,\, \tfrac{(n - \mu)^2}{\sigma^2}\,\right] $$ Using the Binomial moments $\mu=np$ and $\sigma^2=np(1-p)$, the above constraints require $$\min\!\big[\,p\,,1-p\,\big]n \geq z^2$$ So for this approach $z^2=5$ would correspond to a coverage probability of $$\Phi[\sqrt{5}\,]-\Phi[-\sqrt{5}\,]\approx 97.5\%$$ where $\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF . So to the extent this coverage probability is "pretty" and 5 is a nice round number ... that could give some justification perhaps? I do not have much experience with probability texts, so cannot say how common "5" is, vs. other "specific numbers" to use the phrasing of Wikipedia. My feeling is there is nothing really special about 5, and Wikipedia suggests 9 is common also (corresponding to a "pretty" $z$ of 3).
