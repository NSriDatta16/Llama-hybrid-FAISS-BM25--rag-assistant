I suggest as alternative bootstrap based methods, which can be parametric and not, and works with very few assumptions and very few data (only 5-7 samples suffice); it works on non gaussian distributions and for many measures (eg., mean, etc). One can "rebuild" a distribution by bootstraping the mean, if it makes sense in the given context. The Davison 1 is good for introducting the bootstrap in general. Many papers were published on the volatility smile analysed throught bootstrap based methods [0]. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=bootstrap+volatility+smile Davison, A.C. and Hinkley, D.V., 1997.
