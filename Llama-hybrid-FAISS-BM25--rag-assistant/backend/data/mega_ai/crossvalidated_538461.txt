Averaging the data is going to lose information and statistical power, so it is not a good idea. A linear mixed effects model with random intercepts for mice ID should take account of the repeated measures within mice. Then you can use all the data. You mentioned a GLMM approach, but from what I can see a generalised model is not indicated. However, if it is a GLMM that you are fitting then you could choose a GEE instead, but if not, then a linear mixed model and a GEE should produce the same results. Is it different from the traditional time factor for repeated measure study? It is very similar. There are different ways to handle time in a repeated measures longitudinal model: it can be numeric or categorical. If numeric then it can be centred. In your case, if there is a temporal aspect to Round , then it can be handled in the same ways. So a model such as: measurement ~ Group + Round + covariates + (1|mice_id) would be a good place to start. If you code Round as numeric (eg 0,1,2,3) then the model will estimate a linear trend. If you code it as categorical then the model will produce 3 seperate estimates - all being a contrast with whichever level of Round you set as the reference (0 would make most sense in my opinion). If there is no temporal aspect to Round then you might consider not including it in the model at all - or just treating it as a potential confounder. If there is a temporal aspect, and you want the response to the treatment to differ over Rounds, then you might consider the interaction Group:Round If you decide fit random slopes for Round (with Round as numeric) then you might consider centering Round which will improve interpretation.
