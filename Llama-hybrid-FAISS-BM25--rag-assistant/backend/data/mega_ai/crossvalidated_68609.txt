Bayes' theorem is a basic result about the manipulation about conditional probabilities. For some events $A$ and $B$, the theorem reads as: $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$ The theorem is taken as a starting point for Bayesian inference, with $A$ taking the role of parameters, and $B$ taking the role of data.
