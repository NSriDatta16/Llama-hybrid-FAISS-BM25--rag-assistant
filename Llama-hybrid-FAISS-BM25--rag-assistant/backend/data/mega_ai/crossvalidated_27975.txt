Whether the proposal should depend on the temperature is problem-specific. If you mean can the proposal depend on the temperature, then the answer is yes. The only important things is that within each temperature, the chain is a convergent Markov chain. Note that it's not only within-chain proposals that can be temperature-dependent. The proposals to move from a point in one temperature to a point in a new temperature can depend on the two temperature's concerned and here I'd argue it's even more likely that a temperature(s) dependent proposal would be necessary.
