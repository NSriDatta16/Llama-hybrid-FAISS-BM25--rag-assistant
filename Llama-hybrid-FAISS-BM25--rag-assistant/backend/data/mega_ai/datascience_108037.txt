My understanding is you want to classify protein sequences. For example, the sequence HWLQMRDSMNTYNNMVNRCFATCIRSFQEKKVNAEEMDCTKRCVTKFVGYSQRVALRFAE belongs to a dog. You might be overthinking the problem. It might be useful to start building. One option is to start with a simple model that works. The code would be something like: from tensorflow.keras.layers import * from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential model = Sequential() model.add(Embedding(input_dim=max_features, output_dim=10, input_length=maxlen) model.add(LSTM(units=20)) model.add(Dense(units=46)) model.add(Activation('softmax')) From there make the model more complex and see it helps better capture the signals in the data and still make meaningful interperations.
