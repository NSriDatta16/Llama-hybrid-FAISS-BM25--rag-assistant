Something more than multi-label classification?

My training data has millions of rows with diagnosis and medicines prescribed for them by multiple doctors. An example row:- Doctor name: John ; Diagnosis: diabetes, hypertension; Medications: ABC, XYZ, KLP, FG-2 ; Note: We are not aware which medicine is used to treat which diagnosis. I need to be able to predict the medicines the doctor will prescribe given the diagnosis and doctor name. Which machine learning modelling can be used here? I feel it's a bit more complex that multi-label classification.
