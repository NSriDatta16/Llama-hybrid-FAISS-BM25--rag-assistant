Lock before reading a global string?

I have class than spins off a backgroundworker to do some processor intensive stuff. The background worker reads a few strings that are declared globally for the whole class... do I need to lock around those strings? The backgroundworker never write the strings, they simply represent some directory locations that are set in the constructor of the class and are hardly ever written to by the class after the constructor (and never written to by the backgroundworker). So it's possible the background worker could read the string as it is also being written to by the main class object, though pretty unlikely. But wouldn't both those operations (the read by the background worker and the write by the main class) be atomic for a string literal anyway? Thanks, -Robert Edit: I don't care about the string being out of date or anything (that wouldn't be a big problem in my app), I'm more worried about getting the "object is in use elsewhere" exception.
