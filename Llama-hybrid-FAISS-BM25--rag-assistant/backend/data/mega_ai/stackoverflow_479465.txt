Can I reformat HTML in Visual Studio without removing blank lines?

The HTML formatting in Visual Studio works great -- especially considering you can pick a selection and just format that. You can just select a tag or block, right click and do 'Format Selection'. You can also reformat the whole document. However I like to use a lot of whitespace in my documents to keep things organized and the reformat HTML compresses (deletes!) this whitespace. Are there any plugins, or external tools for formatting HTML that might make it possible to leave vertical space untouched? Edit: Bonus points: If anybody has 2010 installed can they check if it already has this feature? If it DOESN'T have this feature I'd like to submit a feature request. Fortunately the new editor is much more extensible, but I don't know if that extends to customization of something like this.
