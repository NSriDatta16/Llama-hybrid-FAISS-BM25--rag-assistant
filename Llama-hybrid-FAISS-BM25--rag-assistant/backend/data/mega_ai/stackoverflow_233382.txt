Overriding Controls property of a panel in C#

I have to override Add method of "Controls" property of myControl that is extended from a Panel control of windows. For that i extended ControlCollection class into MyControlCollection where i overriden its Add method. Now i declared a Controls property of MyControlCollection type to hide panel's Controls property. When i am accessing this.Controls.Add(control), it refers to overriden Add method. But if i drags and drops a control on myControl the behaviour is of base type's Add method. Can any body suggest the cause and remedy for this problem? Thanks in advance.
