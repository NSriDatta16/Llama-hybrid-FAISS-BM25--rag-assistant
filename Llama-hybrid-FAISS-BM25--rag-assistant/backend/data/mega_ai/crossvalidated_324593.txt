PCA gives principal vectors pointing in the best directions to project your data onto, in terms of variance or squared error. It ignores the sign. A principal vector pointing in the opposite direction is also a valid solution to PCA but will give you principal components with the opposite sign. If you want, you can manually invert the sign for a specific principal component for all your data.
