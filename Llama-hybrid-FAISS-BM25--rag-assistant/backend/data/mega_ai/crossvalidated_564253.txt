Can someone help me interpret the results of my principal component analysis?

I have three variables: LAPOP05_10, LAPOP1_10, and LAPOP1_20. I have run a principal component analysis (PCA), and have obtained the following results: Importance of components: PC1 PC2 PC3 Standard deviation 1.649 0.51274 0.13824 Proportion of Variance 0.906 0.08763 0.00637 Cumulative Proportion 0.906 0.99363 1.00000 PC1 will explain about 91% of the variance in the data, and PCA2 will explain about 9%. Here is my loading plot: I am new to PCA, and am not understanding how to interpret these results. Is this saying that the LAPOP05_10 explains the majority of the PC1 data? Any help would be much appreciated!
