revious work The paper built upon several previous strands of work. In the symbolic logic side, it built on the previous work by Carnap, Whitehead, and Russell. This was contributed by Walter Pitts, who had a strong proficiency with symbolic logic. Pitts provided mathematical and logical rigor to McCulloch’s vague ideas on psychons (atoms of psychological events) and circular causality. In the neuroscience side, it built on previous work by the mathematical biology research group centered around Nicolas Rashevsky, of which McCulloch was a member. The paper was published in the Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics, which was founded by Rashevsky in 1939. During the late 1930s, Rashevsky's research group was producing papers that had difficulty publishing in other journals at the time, so Rashevsky decided to found a new journal exclusively devoted to mathematical biophysics. Also in the Rashevsky's group was Alston Scott Householder, who in 1941 published an abstract model of the steady-state activity of biological neural networks. The model, in modern language, is an artificial neural network with ReLU activation function. In a series of papers, Householder calculated the stable states of very simple networks: a chain, a circle, and a bouquet. Walter Pitts' first two papers formulated a mathematical theory of learning and conditioning. The next three were mathematical developments of Householder’s model. In 1938, at age 15, Pitts ran away from home in Detroit and arrived in the University of Chicago. Later, he walked into Rudolf Carnap's office with Carnap's book filled with corrections and suggested improvements. He started studying under Carnap and attending classes during 1938--1943. He wrote several early papers on neuronal network modelling and regularly attended Rashevsky's seminars in theoretical biology. The seminar attendants included Gerhard von Bonin and Householder. In 1940, von Bonin introduced Lettvin to McCulloch. In 1942, both Lettvin and Pitts had moved in with McCulloch's home. McCulloch had been interested in circular causality from studies with causalgia after amputation, epileptic activity of surgically isolated brain, and Lorente de Nò's research showing recurrent neural networks are needed to explain vestibular nystagmus. He had difficulty with treating circular causality until Pitts demonstrated how it can be treated by the appropriate mathematical tools of modular arithmetics and symbolic logic. Both authors' affiliation in the article was given as "University of Illinois, College of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry at the Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, U.S.A." Subsequent work It was a foundational result in automata theory. John von Neumann cited it as a significant result. This work led to work on neural networks and their link to finite automata. Kleene introduced the term "regular" for "regular language" in a 1951 technical report, where Kleene proved that regular languages are all that could be generated by neural networks, among other results. The term "regular" was meant to be suggestive of "regularly occurring events" that the neural net automaton must process and respond to. Marvin Minsky was influenced by McCulloch, built an early example of neural network SNARC (1951), and did a PhD thesis on neural networks (1954). McCulloch was the chair to the ten Macy conferences (1946--1953) on "Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems". This was a key event in the beginning of cybernetics, and what later became known as cognitive science. Pitts also attended the conferences. In the 1943 paper, they described how memories can be formed by a neural network with loops in it, or alterable synapses, which are operating over time, and implements logical universals -- "there exists" and "for all". This was generalized for spatial objects, such as geometric figures, in their 1947 paper How we know universals. Norbert Wiener found this a sig
