How to Build a Model with Correlation / Statistical Dependency for Bayesian A / B Testing

I use the Beta Binomial model for A/B testing. I wonder if there a way to build a model in PyMC which models correlation between the conversion rate of group A with B. Are there some classic ways to build the prior in such manner?
