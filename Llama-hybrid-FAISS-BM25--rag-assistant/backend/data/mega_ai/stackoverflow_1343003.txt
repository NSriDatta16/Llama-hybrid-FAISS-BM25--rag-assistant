Try installing a later build of ReSharper from the Nightly Builds site . I recently installed build 1277, and it's very stable and great. Also, try deleting the ReSharper cache from the root of your solution (folder starting with _ReSharper.* ), and if you have any 3 rd party plugins, such as Agent Smith , try disabling them (in ReSharper â†’ Plugins).
