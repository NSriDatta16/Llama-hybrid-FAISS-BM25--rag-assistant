You can do this via logistic regression. First we must put your data in a convenient form, in R: yourdata Then building a logistic regression model, with an interaction term that represents the difference in odds ratio between the two tables: mod0 summary(mod0) Call: glm(formula = Outcome ~ Test * Period, family = binomial, data = dat, weights = w) Deviance Residuals: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4.715 -5.356 5.187 -3.796 4.753 -4.424 5.234 -5.406 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.4759 0.3919 -3.766 0.000166 *** Testtest2 1.6225 0.5017 3.234 0.001219 ** Periodbefore 2.0557 0.5148 3.993 6.51e-05 *** Testtest2:Periodbefore -2.5278 0.7040 -3.591 0.000330 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 211.38 on 7 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 191.02 on 4 degrees of freedom AIC: 199.02 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 5 EDIT There might be other approaches. You have two contingency tables, if you lay one over the other (using Test as the layer variable) you get a three-way contingency table, that could be a search term. There are specific hypothesis tests for that situation, but probably an approach like above using generalized linear models is preferred today.
