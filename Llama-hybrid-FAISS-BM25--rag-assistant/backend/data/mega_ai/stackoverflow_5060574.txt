I'm sure that knowing prolog would be a great help here, but I don't think I'm qualified to answer that. However I may be able to help you work out how likely your current solution is to work: The 9 pieces can be placed in 9! = 362880 permutations (position only) They can each be rotated 4 ways -> 4^9 = 262114 However you will have 4 solutions which are just rotations of each other, so /=4. Giving an average of 23,781,703,680 possible arrangements to try before you find a solution :(
