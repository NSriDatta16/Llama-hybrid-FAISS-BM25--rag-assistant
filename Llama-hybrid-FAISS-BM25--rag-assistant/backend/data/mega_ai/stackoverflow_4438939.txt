You can use Doctrine 2 or another ORM for using relationships in Lithium with a relational database, but since Lithium is very much Mongo/Couch DB slanted in its approach, the question you have is less about Lithium and more about the NoSql approach that it is encouraging. BTW I think relationships are not yet officially supported in Lithium, but NoSql have their own methods for mostly not needing them - or not needing them as much by nesting data in JSON like syntax. But I think this is one feature that looks like it will be coming in 1.0, expect a blog post on it fairly soon.
