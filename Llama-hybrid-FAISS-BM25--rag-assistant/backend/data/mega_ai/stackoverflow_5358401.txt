After browsing the code a bit, it would seem that this email is send from app/code/core/Mage/Wishlist/controllers/IndexController.php So you need to overwrite this controller. I have never done such a thing, but it is doable. There is a topic here and if you google 'magento override controller' you'll also find a lot off info. After that you must re-implement (meaning copy and edit) the method sendAction() . In it is a call $emailModel->sendTransactional(); I also think you should leave the sender address to that of the store, because setting it to another address might mark the message as spam. But if you want to do it just change the second parameter of this call to an array with keys 'name' and 'email' and the desired values. But I strongly advise to set the Reply-To header too. That is possible because this model uses a Zend_Mail object to do the dirty work and treats this object as a singleton. Meaning that if you create it as first and configure it, the next mail will be sent with this configuration. In code, change foreach($emails as $email) { $emailModel->sendTransactional( Mage::getStoreConfig('wishlist/email/email_template'), //snip to foreach($emails as $email) { $mail = $emailModel->getMail(); $mail->setReplyTo($customer->getEmail()); $emailModel->sendTransactional( Mage::getStoreConfig('wishlist/email/email_template'), //snip Success
