"Recursive ConvNets for Dummies" Library

I've look at the questions on here regarding the different python libraries around for deep learning and neural nets. They include: Keras Caffe Lasagne PyLearn2 Deepy Theano Torch My understanding is that Keras and Lasagne require the user to have varying degrees of interaction with Theano. I'm looking for the one that would be the easiest to start testing an algorithm I have already developed an apply deep learning on it in a packaged way. I am not looking to extend, modify or tweak anything. I certainly won't be doing any research in the field with it. The only advanced feature I would need would be GPU support. In short, what would be the best "dummy" library to test recursive convolutional neural nets?
