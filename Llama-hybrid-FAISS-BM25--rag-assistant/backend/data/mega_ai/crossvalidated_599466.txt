Effect of measurement error on posterior probability

If the predictor $X$ in a simple linear regression $Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X + \epsilon$ is measured with error, the OLS estimator for the predictor's coefficient will be biased towards zero . What is the corresponding effect on the posterior of $\beta_1$ in a Bayesian setup? Is there (only?) an analog effect on the MAP being biased towards zero, or is the "width" of the posterior also affected?
