Android data storage - File vs SQLite

I am developing an application that periodically sends information to an external server. I make a local copy of the data being sent, for backup purposes. What is the best option to store the data in terms of saving battery life ? Each data submission is a serialized object (the class has 5 fields, including a date, numbers and strings) of about 5K-10K. Any other idea?
