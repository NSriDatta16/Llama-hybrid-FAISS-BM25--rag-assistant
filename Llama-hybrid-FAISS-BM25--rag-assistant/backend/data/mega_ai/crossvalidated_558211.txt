I'm sorry to say this but this seems to be a case of non-identifiability. You can't identify the ATE between Smoking and Lung Cancer there. There is an unmeasured confounder for Smoking and Lung Cancer, which is Genetics, and that's it. You can't adjust for it. There is indeed no node in the network between Smoking and Lung Cancer, which could help you with the front-door criterion, or between Genetics and Smoking or Genetics and Lung Cancer, which could help you with the back-door criterion. You could adjust by a descendent of the unmeasured confounder (Attention Disorder) to "partially" adjust for it, but you wouldn't remove all the bias. For a crash course on good and bad controls, I recommend you A Crash Course in Good and Bad Controls by Carlos Cinelli.
