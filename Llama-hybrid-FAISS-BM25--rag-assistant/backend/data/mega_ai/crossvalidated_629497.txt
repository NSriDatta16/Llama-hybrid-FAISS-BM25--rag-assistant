Specifying parameters for SARIMAX model with significant ACF / PACF at tails

I have hourly data that has a period of 1 day or 24 hours / time steps and I hope to do short term forecasting for a few days in advance. The ACF of the raw time series was periodic (see last figure) like from this question , so I took a difference between the series and a shifted series by 24 timesteps. The differenced series has an ACF and PACF below. My confusion is that both ACF and PACF shows decreasing / low significance until hour 20ish after which the magnitude of the significance increases. I'm wondering how to correctly specify the parameters (or range of parameters for a search) for a SARIMA model or is there further processing I should try? Should I consider including lags up to 23 hours for both MA and AR components or will that overfit? Edit: The ACF of the raw target
