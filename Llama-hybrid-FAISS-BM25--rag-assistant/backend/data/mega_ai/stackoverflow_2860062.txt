Presumably you're showing some text in a TextView . You can display text either from a string resource (defined in XML and referred to as R.string.* , as you mention) or from a String at runtime. You can't change the XML resources at runtime; you use them for fixed values like labels or other UI text. So there's no way to "push" a value to XML. But you can happily do something like this at runtime, dynamically updating your UI: int userAge = calculateUsersAge(); TextView age = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.age_field); age.setText(userAge +" years old"); Or better, ensuring there are no hardcoded values in the code: age.setText(getString(R.string.years_old, userAge)); Where years_old is the text "%d years old" in your res/values/strings.xml and "%d Jahre alt" in your res/values-de/strings.xml , and so on.
