Probably the best approach is to list the classes at compile time. There is a fragile runtime approach. Take you Class ( MyClass.class of this.getClass() ). Call getProtectionDomain . Call getCodeSource . Call getLocation . Call openConnection . (Alternatively open a resource.) Cast to JarURLConnection . Call getJarFile . Call entries . Iterate through checking getName . I really do not recommend this approach.
