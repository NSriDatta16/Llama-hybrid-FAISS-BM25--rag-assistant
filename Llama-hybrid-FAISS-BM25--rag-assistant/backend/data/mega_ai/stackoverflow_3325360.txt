When to use Sql Management Objects (SMO)

I'm working on a project that leverages database metadata. To date I've just queried the database catalog views (e.g. sys.tables) but I know this will be "easier" with SMO if I'm willing to add the dependency. What are the advantages to SMO over metadata queries? Any "gotchas" (e.g. needing to have additional SQL libraries on my local machine just for the luxury of SMO).
