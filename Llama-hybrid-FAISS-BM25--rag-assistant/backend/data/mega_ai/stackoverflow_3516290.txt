Any pitfalls of converting MySQL TEXT field to MEDIUMTEXT?

I understand the size/storage constraints of MySQL TEXT and MEDIUMTEXT fields, but I just wanted to make absolutely sure (before I sign off on a change) that I'm not looking at any adverse effects from converting a field with existing data from TEXT to MEDIUMTEXT. My concerns are mainly performance, integrity, and disk storage. Thanks
