Numpy matrix to array

I am using numpy. I have a matrix with 1 column and N rows and I want to get an array from with N elements. For example, if i have M = matrix([[1], [2], [3], [4]]) , I want to get A = array([1,2,3,4]) . To achieve it, I use A = np.array(M.T)[0] . Does anyone know a more elegant way to get the same result? Thanks!
