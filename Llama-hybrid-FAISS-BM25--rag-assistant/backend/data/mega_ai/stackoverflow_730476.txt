Following mkoryak's suggestion I have now modified the code to assemble the rows in an array and then append them all in one go: $.each(rows, function(index, row) { storage.push(row); row.sortKey = null; }); $table.children('tbody').append(storage); This seems to have improved performance with about 25% - sorting 1500 rows now takes ~3s as opposed to ~4s previously.
