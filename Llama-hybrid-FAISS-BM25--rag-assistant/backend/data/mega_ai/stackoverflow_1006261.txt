First step would be writing meaningfull tests. If you'll be writing tests only meant to reach full coverage, you'll be counter-productive; it will probably mean you'll focus on unit's implementation details instead of it's expectations. BTW, I'd use nose as unittest framework ( http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/0.11.1/ ); it's plugin system is very good and leaves coverage option to you (--with-coverage for Ned's coverage, --with-figleaf for Titus one; support for coverage3 should be coming), and you can write plugisn for your own build system, too.
