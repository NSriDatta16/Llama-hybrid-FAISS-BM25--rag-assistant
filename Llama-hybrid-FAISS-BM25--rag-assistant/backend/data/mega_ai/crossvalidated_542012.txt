With 1% positives, you have unbalanced classes. You do not have a small-sample problem as some have pointed out. Instead, you have a rare-event scenario (aka class imbalance). Logistic regression optimized with vanilla MLE will be dominated by the major class (99%). In such a case, alternatives to vanilla logistic regression include: Rare events logistic regression ( Zelig::relogit in R implementing King, Leng 2001) which uses weighting and bias correction to address the imbalance. Firth regression which uses a penalized MLE instead. ( brglm and the newer brglm2 may be faster implementations.) Note that the lasso penalty reduces the model dimensionality and may help with MLE convergence. However, it does not address the biases driven by the class imbalance.
