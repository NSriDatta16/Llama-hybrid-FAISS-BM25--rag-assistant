Linear Regression with repeated measurements of replicate samples?

This is a simple question but I has bugged me for some time. Can someone please share a link, or describe, how I can perform a linear regression from repeated measures of replicate samples over a range. The picture represents the average of each of these replicates. I would prefer to use Matlab if you have any ideas that would fit with the problem. Thanks
