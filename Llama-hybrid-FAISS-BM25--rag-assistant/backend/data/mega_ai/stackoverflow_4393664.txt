Expanding wildcards in a csv string to generate a collection of csv strings?

I'd like create a collection of strings (using C# and possibly LINQ) from a single csv string where each value is a plus or minus sign followed by a character. For example: "+A,+E,+B,-B,+C,+D" The string could also contain a wild card representing two of any character; one with a plus sign and then one with a negative sign. If a string does contain a wild card I'd like substitute out the wild card and generate a list of strings without wild cards. For example say I had: "+A,-A,*" The strings I'd want to generate would be: +A,-A,+A,-A +A,-A,+B,-B +A,-A,+C,-C +A,-A,... +A,-A,+Z,-Z And likewise for multiple wildcards. The string "*,*" would produce: +A,-A,+A,-A +A,-A,+B,-B +A,-A,+C,-C +A,-A,... +A,-A,+Z,-Z +B,-B,+A,-A +B,-B,+B,-B +B,-B,+C,-C +B,-B,... +B,-B,+Z,-Z +C,-C,... My gut tells me there must be a simple elegant solution, but it's eluding me today. Any ideas? This seems a like a perfect algorithm to take advantage of LINQ with? Thanks your help!
