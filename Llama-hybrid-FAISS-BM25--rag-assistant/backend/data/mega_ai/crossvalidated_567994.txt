Finally, I've decided to use a Monte-Carlo approach to solve that problem. This is, using the mean and the uncertainty values in $y$ , generate $M$ experiments of the form $\tilde{y}^i = [\tilde{y}_1, ..., \tilde{y}_N]$ . Then, compute the max and argmax for each experiment $\tilde{y}^i$ , and finally report the average and standard deviation of the $N$ max and argmax values.
