SQL database (Firebird): problem with a foreign key

My SQL database (Firebird) has a table named tTransaction . It contains two columns, senderFK and receiverFK . There are three other tables, tBufferStock , tFacility and tOutsideLocation . A sender or a receiver can be either a buffer stock, our own facility or a location outside. My problem is that I don't know how to let senderFK or receiverFK reference the right table. I've thought of a new table between sender and the three possible senders with an ID, a number between 1 and 3 for the table and the referenced ID within this table, but actually that doesn't solve the problem. Any ideas? Norbert
