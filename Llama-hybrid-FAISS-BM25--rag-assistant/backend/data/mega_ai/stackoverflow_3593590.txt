You can use the preg_match_all function. The syntax would be like this: //Filter our the email addresses and store it in $emails preg_match($regexp,$text,$emails); //Print out the array of emails print_r($emails); where: $regexp is a regular expression for an email $text is the paragraph of text $emails is the output array of email addresses A regular expression can vary depending on how loose or tight you want it to be. Try crafting your own, so that it follows your standards, but if you're having trouble, you can just Google Email Regular Expressions. P.S. I hope you're not planning to use this to spam somehow.
