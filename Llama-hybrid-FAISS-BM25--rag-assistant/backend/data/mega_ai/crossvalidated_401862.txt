I have a guess based upon many, many time series analyses. It appears to me that a first differencing operator is in play as the 1 period out prediction (model) is the same as the value 1 period ago . Perhaps your auto.arima isn't so auto .. and is introducing self-cancelling structure along with an unwarranted d>0 . Examine the so-called best model and report it . If you post your actual simulated series I will submit it to another "expert" and I will report the results back to you.
