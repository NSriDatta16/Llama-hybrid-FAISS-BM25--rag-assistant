They're alive until they're garbage collected -- so if you leave your application running for the next hundred years, and the properties remain within the scope of your applications usage, the values will persist indefinitely. However, if you're planning on long term storage, a database would probably be a smarter idea, as your values will be removed, for instance, if the object persisting the values is removed/deconstructed, application is stopped, errors out, or computer reset, etc. Keep in mind, a database can be anything that persists your values, whether it's a flat file, hierarchical, or relational database.
