SPSS only let me compare individual groups to the Control group. Actually SPSS Logistic Regression has about 6 built-in types of contrasts. One of them (Indicator) compares each group to a control group, which you can specify using the group's number. I.e., among groups numbered 1 through 4 and labeled as North, South, East, and West, "indicator(3)" will set East as the control group. Another type (Deviation) shows how each group's logit deviates from the (unweighted) average group's logit. It's useful to go into either the general Help files or the Command Syntax Reference, also found in Help, to find the definitions for each type. Personally, I find that Deviation and Indicator are all I ever seem to need. Maybe that makes me a minor-leaguer :-)
