VAR models with de-trend time series vs VECM

I am working in a VAR model for an economic research. I have been reading about this but there is something i still don't get. Based in the books I have read: if I have 2 time series, both are stationary in level, I can use VAR if I have 2 time series with trend but they are co integrated I can use VECM with this series. if I have 2 time series with trend but they are not co integrated, then I must use VAR with differences This is based in: Loría, E. (2007). Econometría con aplicaciones. Editorial Pearson Prentice Hall. México. Gujarati, D. N. D. N. (1992). Econometría. McGraw-Hill,. You can also see that in this book: here This was so far what i knew, before i start to use some software to fit my model. Every book i have been reading about VAR never tell nothing about the inclusion of a "trend" or when to include it, and then i found this . This site tells me that de-trend a series is not longer necessary, you can fit a VAR with no stationary time series inside the model, using the "trend" argument you can find in some software. my questions are: How to use the trend inside a VAR model? Using a VAR with trend, when i have co integration, is better than a VECM?
