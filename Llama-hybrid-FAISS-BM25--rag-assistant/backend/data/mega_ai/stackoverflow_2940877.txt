How can I organize many results in a selectbox using php?

I have a select box that is part of a form. It is currently querying the addresses table and displaying the addresses into the select box. I plan on having up to 100 addresses. I'm looking for a solution where I can show all the states if the user clicks on the select box. Then if the user hovers over a state it will show all the addresses for that specific state. Then if the user clicks on an address, it will show that as the picked option in the select box. This is like a dropdown menu within a select box. Does anyone know where I can find a solution as this?
