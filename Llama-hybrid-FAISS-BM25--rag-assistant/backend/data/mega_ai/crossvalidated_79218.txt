Importance sampling is a method to evaluate an integral of the form $$E[h(X)] = \int h(x)f(x) dx$$ when this cannot be directly computed. Instead of sampling from the density $f$ as in classical Monte Carlo integration, importance sampling (IS) samples from an arbitrary density $g$ which must be a valid pdf: $$E[h(X)] = \int h(x)\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}g(x) dx$$ Based on samples $X_1,...,X_n$ generated from $g$ (and not from $f$ ), the expectation under $g$ converges in probability to $$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{f(X_j)}{g(X_j)}h(X_j) \rightarrow E[h(X)]$$ as in classical Monte Carlo integration. IS has the advantage that it puts very little restrictions on the blanket function $g$ . Usual choices for $g$ are standard distributions that are either easy to simulate or which are efficient in the approximation of the integral. Directly sampling from $f$ as in Monte Carlo integration is normally not efficient hence IS sampling requires fewer samples to achieve the desired result.
