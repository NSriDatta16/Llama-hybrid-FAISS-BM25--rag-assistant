Variable substitution in a for-loop using {$var}

I'm very new to bash scripting and I'm trying to practice by making this little script that simply asks for a range of numbers. I would enter ex. 5..20 and it should print the range, however - it just echo's back whatever I enter ("5..20" in this example) and does not expand the variable. Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong? Script: echo -n "Enter range of number to display using 0..10 format: " read range function func_printrage { for n in {$range}; do echo $n done } func_printrange
