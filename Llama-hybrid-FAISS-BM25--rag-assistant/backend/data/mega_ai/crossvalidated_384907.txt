Five (not mutually exclusive) possibilities come to mind: The Slutsky http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Slutsky.html Effect ... Unnecesaary differencing can INJECT variability. Consider the variance of a random process that is differenced OR unnecessarily filtered http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Slutzky-YuleEffect.html Variance changes can be determinstic i.e. variance changes at particular points in time remediable by GLS ...see http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html One time Pulses or anomalies that are untreated. Changes in an intervention effect that has not been accounted for. Changes in the underlying ARIMA (stochastic) model/paramaters over time . In general take a look at http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/18844/when-and-why-to-take-the-log-of-a-distribution-of-numbers In terms of removing variability I would form an ARMAX model that included possible level shifts , local time trends, pulses and seasonal pulses while identifying the need for a power transform or weighted regression structure . The idea here is to transform when the error variance from a useful model is categorized as heterogenous. Finally you might want to peruse Variance inhomogeneity in time series when forecasting suggesting that there may be different variability for different months.
