The approach I took was to not allow the OS to restart your activity after the layout configuration change. To accomplish this, add this line within activities that you want to prevent from restarting in your manifest file: Optionally, you can handle the configuration change in code in case there are some layout changes you want to make manually, such as reloading a new view from XML. This is done by overwriting the onConfigurationChanged() method in your Activity class: @Override public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) { //Handle config changes here, paying attention to //the newConfig.orientation value super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig); } Edit: Added "|keyboard" to the list of config changes
