Removing good data from an analysis is scientifically suspect in my humble opinion, and naive matching methods are inefficient. It may be very easy to adjust for patient characteristics using ordinary regression models, paying attention to linearity assumptions etc. Of course it is a good idea to look at overlap in covariate distributions across treatment groups to see where assumptions of no interaction between treatment and characteristics might be on shaky ground and untestable.
