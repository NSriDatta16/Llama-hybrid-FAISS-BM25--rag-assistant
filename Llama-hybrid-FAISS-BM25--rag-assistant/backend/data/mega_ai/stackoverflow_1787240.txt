How to emulate the look of an off-white sheet of paper on a computer screen

Thanks for the comments below. In hindsight, I should have been more detailed. I hope the edited version is clearer. At a high-level, I want to emulate the look of paper as a screen background. This is because I find white (#FFFFF) to be too bright. I looked at a few hardcover books I own and noticed that none of them are bright white. The Kindle screen background is also not bright white. Hence I would like to find out what is the best way to emulate the look of off-white paper on the screen. I don't want the background to be too "showy" and draw attention (I've seen swatches which emulate handmade paper with some colored thread within, I don't want that): it should just be there. Is a single RGB value enough, do I need a repeated swatch? If RGB is enough, which ones work best? Are there websites/blogs where this has been discussed? A seamless repeatable swatch which I can use as a background image is also OK. I played around with some color wheels to discover an RGB value and this is the best I could do: rgb(252, 245, 216) == #FCF5D8, but I think I can do better. You see what that color looks by pasting the RGB value here: http://www.colorschemer.com/online.html
