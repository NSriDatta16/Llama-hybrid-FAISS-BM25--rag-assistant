How to compute R-sq for RLM?

I want to predict sales with lm and machine learning so I did this: library("caret") set.seed(1) in_train My problem is that after taking out the zeros from the initial dataset my R-sq gets really low (around 0.25) which means that my model is not good enough although my RMSE ratio is pretty good (approx. 0.99). If I leave them in the R-sq is around 0.85 but the plot looks awful. I went through some discussions and some people suggest to do my model with rlm: library(MASS) total_fit But it neither provides R-sq nor p values. Does anyone have a suggestion how to improve this model and how to estimate if the model performs better with lm or rlm? Thank you in advance!
