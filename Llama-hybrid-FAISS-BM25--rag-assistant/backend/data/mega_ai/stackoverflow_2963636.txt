This is untested and I'm quite new at JSP/Servlets, but it seems the Request object has a "getParameterNames" function that will return you the names of all parameters in the request. If you enumerate through those you should be able to access the values with "getParameter". http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html#getParameterNames()
