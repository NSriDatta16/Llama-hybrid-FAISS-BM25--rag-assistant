Chi sq = inf (Firth's logistic regression)

I want coefficients for ‘Isolate’, ‘Temperature’ and ‘Isolate*Temperature’. I want to use these coefficients to plot probabilities of death (for each isolate) as a function of temperature (25-50C). What would be the best way to analyze this data? I've read that Firth's logistic regression is probably best but if the model has "blown up" then I'm not sure how to proceed. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Here is my output from firth's logistic regression analysis: Can anyone explain why the chi square values are equal to infinity for the intercept and temp?
