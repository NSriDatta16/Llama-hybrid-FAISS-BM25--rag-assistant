I believe Oracle has provided auditing features since 8i, however the tables used to capture the data are rather complex and there is a significant performance impact when this is turned on. In Oracle 8i you could only enable this for an entire database and not a table at a time, however 9i introduced Fine Grained Auditing which provides far more flexibility. This has been expanded upon in 10/11g. For more information see http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/database-security/fine-grained-auditing/index.html . Also in 11g Oracle introduced the Audit Vault, which provides secure storage for audit information, even DBA's cannot change this data (according to Oracle's documentation, I haven't used this feature yet).
