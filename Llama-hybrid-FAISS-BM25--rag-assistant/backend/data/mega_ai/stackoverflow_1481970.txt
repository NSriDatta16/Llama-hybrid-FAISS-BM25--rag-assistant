When you have char or int or long or anything like that, then memory is set aside to hold the value, so, a char is 1 byte of memory for storage. The address of that byte is what the pointer points to. This is helpful when you have a string, or a contiguous row of char, as you can then point to the start of that string, and pass it to another function, so that function can use the actual values in the string. So, you signify the pointer by using the asterisk.
