Beginner question on statistical comparison between unbalanced groups and a variable dependent on group size

I am trying to compare the success rate of males vs females in my competition dataset. I have several competitions outcomes, including the rank of each participant. Overall participants in all competitions are 70% Males and 30% Females. Let's say I see Males rank on average higher - It's not a fair comparison since there are more Males in my data. What's the correct way to compare in such case?
