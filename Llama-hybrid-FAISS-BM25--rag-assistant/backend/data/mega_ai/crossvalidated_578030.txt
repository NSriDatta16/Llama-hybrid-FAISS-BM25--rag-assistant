Interpreting standard error for dummy variables in linear regression models

Is there any way to interpret the standard error of dummy variables created to represent a categorical variable in a linear regresion model? I saw a great mathematical explanation here , but I am still having trouble with the "real-life" interpretation, if any. As an example, let's say that this is the result of a case study: > summary(results)$coefficients Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 31.35750 2.32037 13.514 1.55e-14 *** sexwoman -0.53100 1.77624 -0.299 0.7670 Representing the average sallary of employees of a company (in thousands) based on their sex. How would we interpret this standard error?
