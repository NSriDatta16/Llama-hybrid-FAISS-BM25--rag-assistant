You might be interested in ForeCA: Forecastable Component Analysis (disclaimer: I am the author). As the name suggests it is a dimension reduction / blind source separation (BSS) technique to find most forecastable signals from many multivariate - more or less stationary - time series. For your particular case of 20,000 time series it might not be the fastest thing to do (the solution involves multivariate power spectra and iterative, analytic updating of the best weightvector; furthermore I guess it might run into the $p \gg n$ problem.) There is also an R package ForeCA available at CRAN (again: I am the author) which implements basic functionality; right now it supports the functionality to estimate forecastability measure $\Omega(x_t)$ for univariate time series and it has some good wrapper functions for multivariate spectra (again 20,000 time series is probably too much to handle at once). But maybe you can try to use the MASE measure proposed by Rob to make a coarse grid separation of the 20,000 in several sub-groups and then apply ForeCA to each separately.
