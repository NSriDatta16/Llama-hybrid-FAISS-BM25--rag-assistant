I do research in computer vision and machine learning, when people ask me about machine learning, I like to mention how the 1 million Netflix challenge/prize is a great example of machine learning (stating the problem and input output), and the 3 million ongoing health prize challenge. The Kinect uses random forests (very popular machine learning approach) and it's really simple to explain. The website Kaggle.com hosts machine learning competitions, I WISH there was such website when I was a kid. Maybe you want to show it to him. I would use some drawings to introduce concepts of classification and over fitting.
