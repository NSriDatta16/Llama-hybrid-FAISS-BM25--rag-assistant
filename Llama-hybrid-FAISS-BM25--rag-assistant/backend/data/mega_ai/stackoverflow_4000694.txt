What is the correct way to add a utility module to a CPAN distribution?

I would like to factor out some of the stuff in Crypt::SSLeay 's Makefile.PL into a couple of separate classes. These classes would only be used by Makefile.PL . As such, I do want them not to be indexed by the PAUSE indexer not to be installed as part of the module. Should I just put them in inc the way Module::Install does? What else should I pay attention to?
