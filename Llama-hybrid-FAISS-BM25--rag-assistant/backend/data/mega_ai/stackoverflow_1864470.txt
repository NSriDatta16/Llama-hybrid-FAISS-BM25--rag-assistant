Replace strings using regular expressions and backreferences in Clojure

I'm trying to convert from HTML to Latex, and want to change this: baz into: baz\footnote{www.foo.com/bar} I'd like to generate a Clojure function to take a chunk of text, and replace as many matches as exist in a given paragraph. I've tried (.replaceAll " baz " " (.*) " "\2\\footnote{\1}") but that returns: "^Bfootnote{^A}" I've also looked at clojure.contrib.str-utils2 , which has a replace function that uses regular expressions, but it doesn't seem to handle backreferences. Am I missing something? Going about this the wrong way? Any help is appreciated.
