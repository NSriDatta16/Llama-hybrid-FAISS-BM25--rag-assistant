What you could do is provide a static WSDL which you can tweak and modify to your liking, before making it available. In that case, the static WSDL is supplied "as is", instead of querying the actual running service to create the WSDL "on the fly". This can also be a performance boost. In order to do this, you need to specify the name and location of the WSDL file like this: Now, whenever a request for the WSDL or Metadata comes in, this static WSDL will be provided instead. This also allows you to create a single WSDL which contains all necessary information, including the XML schema for the data being passed around. No more importing or referencing external WSDL or XSD fragments. Marc
