I use ReliableSite.net for a handful of low traffic web sites. Their cheapest shared hosting plan offers unlimited hosted domains, unlimited virtual directories, and a very reasonable amount of bandwidth and storage. Regardless of who you choose, one feature you want to look for is DotNetPanel as the control panel, which ReliableSite does. DotNetPanel offers an experience very close to using the IIS manager itself and exposes nearly all of the options. It also gives you much better control over the file system structure. One thing to be aware of with ReliableSite, and any shared hosting site I presume, is that if your site gets a spike of traffic it could go offline way too easily. Some java bot was continuously crawling one of my sites and spiked the CPU usage over the preset limit. That being said, ReliableSite upped the CPU limit for me once I explained what was happening.
