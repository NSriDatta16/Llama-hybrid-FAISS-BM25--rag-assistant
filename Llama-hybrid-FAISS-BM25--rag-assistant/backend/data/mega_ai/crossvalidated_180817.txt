Calculating number of trials until success?

Consider the following problems: On average, a button can be pressed 20 times before it fails to operate. What is the probability that it is pressed 35 times before it fails (36 times total)? Suppose we wire three buttons together...now what is the probability we would be able to perform 36 total presses? I was thinking geometric distribution was the solution. $(1-\frac{1}{20})^{35}*\frac{19}{20}=0.1578$ . I don't know if geometric distribution is even the correct method or if I used the right numbers, as this seems like a high probability considering the button typically fails at $20$ . What is the proper way to solve these problems?
