Highest Performance Database Storage Mechanism

I need ideas to implement a (really) high performance in-memory Database/Storage Mechanism. In the range of storing 20,000+ objects, with each object updated every 5 or so seconds. I would like a FOSS solution . What is my best option? What are your experiences? I am working primarily in Java, but I need the datastore to have good performance so the datastore solution need not be java centric. I also need like to be able to Query these objects and I need to be able to restore all of the objects on program startup.
