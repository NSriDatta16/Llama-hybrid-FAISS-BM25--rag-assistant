How to match numbers in an array in PHP

I am working on the routing or uri's in my PHP app. Currently I have an array with a regex => url map like this... 'modules/users/friends/page-$1', 'users/friends/' => 'modules/users/friends/', 'users/online' => 'modules/users/online/' , 'users/online/page-(\d+)' => 'modules/users/online/page-$1', 'users/create' => 'modules/users/create', 'users/settings' => 'modules/users/settings', 'users/logout(\d+)' => 'modules/users/logout', 'users/login' => 'modules/users/login', 'users/home' => 'modules/users/home', //forums 'forums/' => 'modules/forums/index', 'forums/viewthread/(\d+)' => 'modules/forums/viewthread/$1', 'forums/viewforum/(\d+)' => 'modules/forums/viewforum/$1', 'forums/viewthread/(\d+)/page-(\d+)' => 'modules/forums/viewthread/$1/page-$2', 'forums/viewforum/(\d+)/page-(\d+)' => 'modules/forums/viewforum/$1/page-$2' //blog routes coming soon //mail message routes coming soon //various other routes coming soon ); ?> I can then cycle through my $uri_routes map array and match a uri with preg_match() like this... $rRoute) { if(preg_match("#^{$rUri}$#Ui",$uri)) { $uri = preg_replace("#^{$rUri}$#Ui",$rRoute,$uri); break; } } $uri = explode('/',$uri); $return['module'] = $uri['1']; $return['method'] = $uri['2']; $return['urifragments'] = $uri['3']; $return['urifragments2'] = $uri['4']; return $return; } I am open to an suggestion to improve this in any way. Right now I am stuck as there is 4 possible array key/values returned. If array key 3 or key 4 contains the word "page-" followed by a number, I would like to assign it to a $page variable. But if key 3 or key 4 contains just a number with no "page-" word, then I can assume it is a user ID, blog ID, forum ID, etc and assign it to an $id variable. If you know a good approach to this, please help. UPDATE to simplify things, in addition to having "page-" in front of page numbers, I could have "id-" in front of id numbers
