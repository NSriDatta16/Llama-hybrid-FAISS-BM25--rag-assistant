I have a similar problem, when I update 2-5 files, ether web.config, ether other files, and asp.net needs to recreate the running files, then some times did not find some classes/function that exist on dll files, and my system is not working - throw errors like yours. My solution to that is that I place the app_offline.htm on the root, make my updates, then rename/remove the app_offline.htm and my system works fine. I am sure that have something to do with the cached compiled files, but I did not have deaply search whats exactly cause that. [what is the most elegant workaround to get all the assemblies in the bin to reload] Now what is the most elegant workaround on this is to call the HttpRuntime.UnloadAppDomain and actually make your application to stop and starts again. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpruntime.unloadappdomain(VS.80).aspx I do not know if this solve your issue, you need to make tests. probably on Global.asax make something like that void Application_Error(object sender, EventArgs e) { Exception ex = Server.GetLastError().GetBaseException(); ...if ex is your error, and you get more than 2 ... { HttpRuntime.UnloadAppDomain(); } }
