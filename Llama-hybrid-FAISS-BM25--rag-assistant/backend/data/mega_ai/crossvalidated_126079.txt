Choice based conjoint with SPSS

Is it possible to run a Choice Based Conjoint analysis (preferably with also no-choice option) with SPSS? Do I need a particular package for that? if not possible with SPSS is it possible with Stata? If not possible would it be the same running a Multinomial Logistic regression? How could I get the info I get with conjoint (importance of attributes, simulation of preference etc) with MNL? Thanks in advance, Fabio
