Bayesian estimation of multivariate Gaussian from noisy observations with known error variances

I have a dataset $\mathbf{D} = \{ (\tau_i, \Gamma_i) : 1 \le i \le n \}$ of observations $\tau_i = X_i + \epsilon_i$ from a $p$-dimensional Gaussian $X_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ contaminated by additive noise $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Gamma_i)$ where the $\Gamma_i$ are diagonal and observed. This gives a likelihood function of $$ \begin{aligned} L(\mu,\Sigma) &= \prod_i \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \mathcal{N}(x_i | \tau_i, \Gamma_i)\, \mathcal{N}(x_i | \mu, \Sigma) \,dx_i \\ &= \prod_i \mathcal{N}(\tau_i | \mu, \Sigma+\Gamma_i). \end{aligned} $$ Normally I would use a Normal-inverse-Wishart prior to get a Multivariate Student's t predictive distribution, but it's not clear how to do that with this likelihood. Is it at least possible to get a "sensible" approximation to the predictive distribution of $X$? Is there there some other prior I should consider?
