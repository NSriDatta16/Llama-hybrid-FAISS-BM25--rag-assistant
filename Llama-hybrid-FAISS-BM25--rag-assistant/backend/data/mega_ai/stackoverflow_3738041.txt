Try typing in the ' this ' keyword and then searching for your control name in the class behind. However you can not just say agentName.Text. You must either assign it a value or extract the value out into a variable. If it is truly named 'agentName' then you should be able to resolve and build the following: //Assign the textbox a value this.agentName.Text = "John"; //Get value out of textbox value string MyName = this.AgentName.Text; In addition taks a look to the following line which you state is in the markup behind the page: // Getting the value from XML Agentname.Text = root.SelectSingleNode("name").ChildNodes[0].Value; Ok, you can not place this code in the markup of the page without identifying that it is server code with some 'script' tags identifying it is C# server side code like displayed below: // Getting the value from XML Agentname.Text = root.SelectSingleNode("name").ChildNodes[0].Value; Honestly though you really wouldn't even want to place this code in the markup. It should probably be in the Page_Load() event or in another appropriate event after you have populated the XML source that you are trying to extract data from into the Agentname textbox.
