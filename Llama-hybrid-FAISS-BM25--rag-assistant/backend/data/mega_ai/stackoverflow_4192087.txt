Is jCaptcha thread safe?

I'm using JCaptcha in a project and needed a behavior that was not directly available. so I looked into the source code to see if I can extend it to obtain what I want and found that the store implementation I use ( MapCaptchaStore ) uses a HashMap as the store... with no synchronization. I know JCaptcha does not work in a clustered environment, it is not my case, but how about multiple clients at the same time? Is the store implementation synchronized externally or should I roll my own and make sure it is properly synchronized? TIA!
