How to connect images to magento when importing by xml file

I have imported 100 products in Magento without an image via xml file. (I didn't have the pictures) Now I also have images and want to import them to Magento, so in the XML file I have placed the images in the map /a/l/ and also on my server I have placed them in the map /a/l/. (/a/l/ is also the map where the images are stored when adding them manually in magento. I have copied this line from some other products.) When importing the xml file by running the profile in popup I get the message "Image does not exist" So I can't get the image import working. Does anyone have a solution?
