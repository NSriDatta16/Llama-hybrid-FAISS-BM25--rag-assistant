It looks like a Bayesian posterior for the parameters of some model, possibly a regression, which is proportional to the likelihood times the prior for the parameters. The prior for $\beta$ appears to depend on a scale parameter, $\tau$ - at least that's what I'd guess, though there are other possibilities. $\beta$ may well be a vector of parameters. That the LHS is proportional to the RHS follows from Bayes' theorem. Here's an outline of a way to get from LHS to RHS: Consider: $P(CD) = P(C|D)P(D)$ ... (1) (we will use this more than once) Hence $P(C|D) \propto P(CD)$ ... (2) So from (2) $P(\beta, \sigma^2|y) \propto P(y, \beta, \sigma^2)$. Applying (1) to the RHS: $P(y, \beta, \sigma^2) = P(y| \beta, \sigma^2) P(\beta, \sigma^2)$ Applying (1) to the last term: $P(y, \beta, \sigma^2) = P(y| \beta, \sigma^2) P(\beta| \sigma^2) P(\sigma^2)$ So $P(\beta, \sigma^2|y) \propto P(y| \beta, \sigma^2) P(\beta| \sigma^2) P(\sigma^2)$. Now condition everything on both sides on $\tau$, then drop the conditioning on it from anything that's independent of $\tau$: $P(\beta, \sigma^2|y,\tau) \propto P(y| \beta, \sigma^2,\tau) P(\beta| \sigma^2,\tau) P(\sigma^2|\tau)$ $P(\beta, \sigma^2|y,\tau) \propto P(y| \beta, \sigma^2) P(\beta| \sigma^2,\tau) P(\sigma^2)$. Now ... presumably because the prior for $\beta$ independent of $\sigma^2$, drop the conditioning on it: $P(\beta, \sigma^2|y,\tau) \propto P(y| \beta, \sigma^2) P(\beta| \tau) P(\sigma^2)$.
