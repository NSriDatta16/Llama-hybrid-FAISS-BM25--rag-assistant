Would like to know some Machine Learning applications for Civil Engineering

I've thought about some, like predicting Concrete's strength by it's composition, but would like some ideas on the theme. One other thing I was thinking was traffic, how would I use machine learning to predict something related to streets and roads... Maybe something related to hydraulics on a building. I'm really beginning on machine learning so I'm not so good at knowing how can I use it. Although it's amazing. Thank's a lot guys.
