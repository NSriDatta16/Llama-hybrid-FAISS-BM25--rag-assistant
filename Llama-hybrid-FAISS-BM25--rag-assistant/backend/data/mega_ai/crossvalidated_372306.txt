Let's look at the problem in 1D $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} g(f(x) + y) = g'(x + y) f'(x)$ Whereas $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} g(f(x) y) = g'(f(x)y) f'(x)y$ As you see, the differential of this function does not only depend on value of $f(x)y$ , it also depends on $y$ multiplicatively. Combined with the fact that in RNNs this rule is used many times this makes problems with exploding/vanishing gradient even worse if $y$ is not very close to 1.
