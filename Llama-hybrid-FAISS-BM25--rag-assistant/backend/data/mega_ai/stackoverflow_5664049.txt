Site like cplusplus.com for C++11

One simple question: does anybody know a site like cplusplus.com (that has functions and headers nicely organized, includes examples(that is very important to me)) and that it is up to date(C++11). I ask because I'm unable to find any site like that. Also I can't understand the c++ standard PDF, when it comes to reading out the member functions and stuff like that. Also googling for specific stuff is often useless (If you don't believe me try to find some atomic header examples).
