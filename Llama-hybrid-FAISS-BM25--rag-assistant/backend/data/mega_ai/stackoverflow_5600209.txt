Is it possible to use the same Entity Framework model for both SQL Express & SQL CE 4.0?

I'm currently working on a SOA project where at some locations it would make sense for the service to use a lightweight database (SQL CE 4.0) while at other locations a more robust database is desirable (SQL Express right now, but possibly scaling up to larger editions). Even though the model and table structure is identical for both SQL Express and SQL CE, I can't figure out how to get Entity Framework to use the same EDMX to work with both databases. The conceptual model is identical for both, and the only difference in the storage model is the provider name that is used to access to the database. Am I missing something, or do I need to keep two basically identical models around, one for each database. I'm using .NET 4.0, Entity Framework and VS 2010 SP1
