You can access the OperatingSystemMXBean by calling ManagementFactory.getOperatingSystemMXBean() and it will give you: String getName() Returns the operating system name. This method is equivalent to System.getProperty("os.name"). String getArch() Returns the operating system architecture. This method is equivalent to System.getProperty("os.arch"). String getVersion() Returns the operating system version. This method is equivalent to System.getProperty("os.version"). int getAvailableProcessors() Returns the number of processors available to the Java virtual machine. This method is equivalent to the Runtime.availableProcessors() method. double getSystemLoadAverage() Returns the system load average for the last minute. The system load average is the sum of the number of runnable entities queued to the available processors and the number of runnable entities running on the available processors averaged over a period of time. The way in which the load average is calculated is operating system specific but is typically a damped time-dependent average. If the load average is not available, a negative value is returned. See this page for some more details on available options. In addition most containers have more available options regarding the container.
