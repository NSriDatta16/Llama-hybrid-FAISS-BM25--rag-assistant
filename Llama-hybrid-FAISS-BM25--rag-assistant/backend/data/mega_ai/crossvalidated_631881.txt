Selecting variables using lasso algorithm

I have a question concerning a large dataset with 94 observation and 15000 variables. For data mining models (boosting, trees, neural networks...) this number of variables are too much and I have to select a subset of them. Is lasso (or adaptive lasso) a possibility? If not, what is the right way for selecting variables in a short time?
