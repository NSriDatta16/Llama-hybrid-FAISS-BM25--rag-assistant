MDP concerning two states systems

A system can take only two states 1 and 2. We wish to compare two decisions D1 and D2 causing transitions between these two states. Each of these decisions entails given costs (in â‚¬) in the following table: In the long term what is the best decision? Here is my work: I deduced the following transition matrices: T1 = [0.22 0.78; 0.78 0.22] T2 = [0.78 0.22 ;0.22 0.78] Since T1 and T2 are ergodic, they admit respectively unique fixed points Q1o [1/2 1/2; 1/2 1/2] and Q2o [1/2 1/2; 1/2 1/2]. Can we deduce that D2 is more expensive knowing that both systems have the same chance of having status 1 or 2 and that the respective sums of costs are 25 and 27? Thanks!
