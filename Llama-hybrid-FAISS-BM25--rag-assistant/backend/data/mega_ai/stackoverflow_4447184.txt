WPF Toolkit Datagrid Sorting

Our client has wants to sort the values in a WPF datagrid. One of the columns is a time span column. However, it's in string format. Here are sample data. -1 Week - Reorganize Staff -2 Month - Design Website -5 Years - Negotiate Merger I've managed to turn the string data into a numeric value corresponding to the dates. I've also put that column in the datagrid. Now the client wants to sort the column with the string span. How should I go about this?
