Take a look at Jester, it is a well known data set of jokes which uses continuous ratings in the range of -10.0 to +10.0. A lot of papers have used this dataset for matrix factorization techniques with no ill effects. There is no such positive-ratings-only constraint on a mathematical or technical level. But the reason we typically see majorly positive rating matrices, has likely something to do with websites/services not wanting their products to have negative ratings: even a one-star somehow appears better than a negative rating, it's how liking something less compares to hating something. It may also have to do with how users perceive averages: if you use negative and positive ratings, some products could on average have 0 stars, which actually means neutral on that rating scale. But if you're used to the 5-star rating scales used on other websites, neutral is 3 stars and 0 stars would mean "really bad".
