To overload something--method or property--you need for it to accept a different set of parameters. Since properties in VB.NET can accept parameters, I guess you can overload them; but they have to be different. So you could do this: Public Overloads Readonly Property Average() As Double Public Overloads Readonly Property Average(ByVal startIndex As Integer) As Double But not this: Public Overloads Readonly Property Average() As Double Public Overloads Readonly Property Average() As Decimal
