How do I write logistic regression for a categorical predictor?

I've read so many previous posts but still feel confused. I've run a logistic regression based on one categorical predictor with two levels. I know with continuous predictors, I can calculate the probability of an event $(Y)$ as $P(Y)=exp(b0+b1x)/1+exp(b0+b1x)$ . However, I'm really confused on how to calculate $P(Y)$ for categorical predictors based on the output pasted below for dummy data. Does anyone know what equation to use? Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 2.4893 0.2721 3.874 0.00645 ** s21to60.L 0.5286 0.1638 2.921 0.00854 **
