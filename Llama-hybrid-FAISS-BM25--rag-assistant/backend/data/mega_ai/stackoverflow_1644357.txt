Starting a new Site - Should I "Use a Template" or "Write from Scratch"

I have been thinking of starting a site of my own for long time. I am good at all concepts of C#/ASP.NET and all DB stuff. I have created and can create a site from scratch for myself. But the effort/time involved in creating a site from scratch is little discouraging, where next thing (and more important thing) I need to worry about is the content on the site. I have seen many sites and blogs (few links below). I need to know, what is the general approach while creating a similar site? Are there any general tips i need to be aware of before starting one? http://naspinski.net http://codeclimber.net.nz
