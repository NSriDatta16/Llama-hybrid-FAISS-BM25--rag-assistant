That's expected behaviour. Spring does not take your existing object (how would it get it?) - it creates a new one and fills it with data. You can use the @ModelAttribute annotated-method to specify a method which will load the existing object from storage (db?) by its ID (submitted). @ModelAttribute annotated methods are executed before the chosen @RequestMapping annotated handler method. They effectively pre-populate the implicit model with specific attributes, often loaded from a database. Such an attribute can then already be accessed through @ModelAttribute annotated handler method parameters in the chosen handler method, potentially with binding and validation applied to it. See 15.3.2.8 of the MVC docs
