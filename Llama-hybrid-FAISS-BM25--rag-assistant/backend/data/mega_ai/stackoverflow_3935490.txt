SQL string match numbers, varying length

I am looking up which exchange services which telephone numbers, from a table of fragmentary numbers that show which exchange services them. So my table contains, for example: id |exchcode |exchname |easting|northin|leadin | ----------------------------------------------------------------- 12122 |SNL/UC |SANDAL |43430 |41306 |1924240 | 12123 |SNL/UC |SANDAL |43430 |41306 |1924241 | 881 |SNL/UD |SANDAL |43430 |41306 |1924249 | 2456 |BD/BCC/1 |BRADFORD CABLE |41627 |43262 |192421 | 4313 |NEY/UB |NORMANTON |43847 |42289 |192422 | 12124 |SNL/UC |SANDAL |43430 |41306 |192425 | 9949 |OBE/UB |HORBURY OSSETT |42857 |41971 |192428 | 9987 |OBE/UB |WAKEFIELD |42857 |41971 |1924 | (sorry, formatting a bit rubbish) leadin is the leading part of the phone number I have to match (stored as a VARCHAR, not a number) And I am supplied with a phone number 1924283777 (not real) how do I query to get the best match from the above table (It should pick exchange id 9949), or do I deal with it in code after I've done the query (php) tl;dr: variable length for values of leadin column, want best match with a number longer than leadin.
