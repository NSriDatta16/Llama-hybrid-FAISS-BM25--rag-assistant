Paired tests leverage the correlation between your variables (typically before and after) to improve power. The more strongly, and positively, your data are correlated, the more of the variability that exists between the units (e.g., patients), and which gets ignored by the test (although if that variability would have otherwise supported the alternative hypothesis, this looses power, see comments below). If the data were uncorrelated, there shouldn't be any long run gain, and if the data were negatively correlated, taking that fact into account (which is the correct thing to do) shows that there is actually less information in your data than might naively appear. Let's look at your data: a
