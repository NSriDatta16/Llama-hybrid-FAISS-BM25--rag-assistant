CKEditor instance in a jQuery dialog

I am using jQuery to open a dialog window with a textarea transformed into an instance of CKEditor. I'm using the jQuery adapter provided by the CKEditor team but when the dialog window opens up I cannot interact with the editor (it's created but "null" is written in the content space and I can't click on anything or modify the content). This bug report seems to say that by using a patch provided the issue is fixed but it doesn't seem to be working for me... Here's my code (maybe I did something wrong programmatically): HTML: My includes (Everything is included correctly but maybe it's an including order issue?): Javascript: $('#ad_content').ckeditor(); /* snip */ $('#ad_div').dialog( { modal: true, resizable: false, draggable: false, position: ['center','center'], width: 600, height: 500, hide: 'slide', show: 'slide', closeOnEscape: true, autoOpen: false }); $('.analyse_cell').click(function(){ $('#ad_div').dialog('open'); }); Edit: After some further testing I noticed that pressing on the toolbar buttons gave me this error: Error: this.document.getWindow().$ is undefined Source File: includes/ckeditor/ckeditor.js Line: 82
