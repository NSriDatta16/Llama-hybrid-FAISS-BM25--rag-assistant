Range of Values for Random Forest Mean Decrease in Accuracy

When calculating variable importance using the unscaled (Scale= FALSE) permutation variable importance, what is the range of values you can get? Is it expressed as a percent (e.g. a value of 0.1 represents a 0.1% decrease in accuracy) or as a proportion (e.g. a value of 0.1 represents a 10% decrease in accuracy).From a bit of playing around with it I can't get the values to be higher that 1, so I believe it is the latter option but couldn't find confirmation anywhere. I am using the randomForest package in R.
