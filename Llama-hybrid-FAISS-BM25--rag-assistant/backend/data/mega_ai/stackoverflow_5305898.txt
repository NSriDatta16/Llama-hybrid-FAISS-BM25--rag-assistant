While I agree that the appropriate way to interact with the XML is by addressing it through its namespace, when you are intentionally trying to translate or convert content from XML of one namespace to another (for example, FXG to MXML) sometimes you have to get down and dirty and hack the XML as a string. This is by no means the most elegant and if there is a more correct way of doing this I am open to it. Unfortunately, from what I've read, it looks like you can't remove the default or last namespace from an XML object. http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/XML.html#removeNamespace%28%29
