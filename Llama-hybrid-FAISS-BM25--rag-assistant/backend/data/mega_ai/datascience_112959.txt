does "unravelling" lstm units still mean one unit

I have seen images of lst and rnn units online, where they "unravel" the unit. Is this only one, singular, unit? If you have multiple units in a cell (layer), are both the cell state and hidden state carried through to the next unit? (or are they recycled in each unit) By h t and h t-1 , I assume that all memories are stored in an array? (or is it 1 vector) I read in an article that the length of cell state and hidden state is equal to the amount of units in a cell (layer). If this is true, do each units output multiple predictions on the same thing or different things? Image #2 (response to an answer)
