I have looked hard at Heroku and may use them in the future. The biggest benefits I see are... They take away the time cost of system administration. You can instantly increase processing power and storage if needed. I decided not to go with Heroku for now because I need full text search and I want to use Sphinx, not WebSolr. Also, if you look at their description of the WebSolr service , you'll find that it's kind of expensive for something that's "in beta." And at this time they only index up to 10,000 documents. That rules it out for my app. You could put your app on Heroku and other pieces -- database, search -- elsewhere, but that defeats the purpose. If you do that, you are back to being a sysadmin and if you need more power/memory/storage you'll have to handle it. Heroku could be great if everything your app needs is on Heroku. Then the potential simplification and time savings could be huge. If I had a different kind of app with different requirements I would try it.
