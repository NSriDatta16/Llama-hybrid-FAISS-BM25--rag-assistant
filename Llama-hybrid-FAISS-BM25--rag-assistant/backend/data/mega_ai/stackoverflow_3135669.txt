How to use the NOEXPAND hint with Linq to SQL?

I have an indexed view that I need to specify the noexpand hint for in order for it to perform reasonably. Unfortunately as seen with regard to modifying the Linq to SQL generated T-SQL query from the NOLOCK hint it appears that there is no easy way to take advantage of these hints directly or is there? My thought is that it would make sense to allow customization of this stuff through the use of attributes or declaratively through the dbml. Also since Linq to SQL seems to only work targeting SQL Server it only makes sense that we are also able to leverage these advanced features (if they exists). Regardless of the implementation though I'm interested in any creative ways of solving this problem.
