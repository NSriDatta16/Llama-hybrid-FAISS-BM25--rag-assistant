C#: Drag and Drop in WPF (Richtextbox)

i want to implement a Drag/Drop mechanic in WPF, but it didn't work... With Windows-Forms it worked, ... First i set AllowDrop to True. In windows-forms you can already drag items into the richtextbox and the cursor changes. With WPF .... nothing happens. The nexT point: Implement DragEnter and DragDrop Methodes. I did it like the online-manuals says. (ok i had to try out something more, because DragDrop doesn't exists in WPF) I think all tutorials for drag/drop is only for Windowsforms, nothing for WPF... Is there a problem with the richtextbox? If i change it to "allowDrop" - nothing happens. The cursor is still a not-allowed-symbol. Hope someone can help :) Examplecode from tutorials i read: richTextBox1.AllowDrop = true; void richTextBox1_DragEnter(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { e.Effect = DragDropEffects.None; if (e.Data.GetDataPresent(DataFormats.XXX)) { e.Effect = DragDropEffects.Copy; } } void richTextBox1_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { //intert in richtextbox ... richTextBox1.methodeXY(); }
