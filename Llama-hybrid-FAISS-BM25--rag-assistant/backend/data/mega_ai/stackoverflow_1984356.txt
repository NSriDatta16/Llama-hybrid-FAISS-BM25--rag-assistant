Sort of hard to tell without your markup, but it seems that in some cases your width + margin + padding would exceed 960px horizontally. But again, without knowing how you have your markup nested, it's hard to tell. And I agree with Jonathan Sampson -- no sense in reinventing the 960 grid system. If you get this to work, you'll inevitably still run into weird issues in some browsers if that's a concern to you. Why not just leverage other peoples' efforts who've already worked through all that.
