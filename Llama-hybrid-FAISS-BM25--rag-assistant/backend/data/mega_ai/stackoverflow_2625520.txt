Java and C#, how close are they?

I've been using C/C++ and Python, but I now I see that a lot of new programming books use Java or C# as examples. I don't think I'll use Java or C# for the time being, but I guess I have to study one of the languages (or both of them) in order to read/understand the books. How similar Java and C#? If I learn Java, is learning C# almost free? Or vice versa? If I have to choose only one of the two languages, which would be better? Which has wider coverage in terms of programming language?
