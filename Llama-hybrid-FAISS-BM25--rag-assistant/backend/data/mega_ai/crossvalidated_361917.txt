In principle, there's no reason to believe that using PCA as a dimension-reduction strategy will help with any particular modeling problem. Empirically, it can help in many circumstances. On the other hand, if the outcome is strongly correlated with the PC corresponding to the smallest variance, then applying PCA and omitting the final PC (because it has the least variance), you've removed the strongest signal in your model.
