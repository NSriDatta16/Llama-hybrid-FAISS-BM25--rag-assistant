How about this: In the objective DataGrid (the one where you suppose to drop), when the mouse pointer reaches the end or the begining, you start scrolling down or up (of course it will be controlling the mousein/mouseout events). Try dragin an object in excel, if you reach the end/begining of what you can see it will start scrolling down/up. I don't know if i explain myself, let me know and i'll try to make it more explicit
