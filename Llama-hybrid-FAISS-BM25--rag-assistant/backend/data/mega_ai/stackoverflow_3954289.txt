Here is the total of my test script. To use put it in a file at the Magento root and type it's URL directly in your browser, it is not handled by Magento's controllers. This is a good way of experimenting as it is not as influenced by other modules, page layouts, etc. getSelect()->reset('columns'); $collection->joinTable('sales/order_grid', 'customer_id=entity_id', array('order_entity_id' => 'entity_id')); $collection->joinTable('sales/invoice_grid', 'order_id=order_entity_id', array('*')); foreach ($collection as $invoice) print_r($invoice->debug()); ?> As with your previous question I choose to reset the initial columns because I don't believe in giving the database more work than necessary. However it's not essential, the test still succeeds without it. If this doesn't work in your installation then we need to consider what that outside influence could be.
