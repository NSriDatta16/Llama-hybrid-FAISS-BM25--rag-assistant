This is a total VB hack, but I think you can leave the listbox enabled, and then drag a transparent label (with blank text) over all of the listbox except the scrollbar. The label will intercept any mouse clicks (although this won't affect keystrokes). This will only work if the label is transparent like I remember (it may be the image control - without a loaded image - that works like this in VB).
