Are "Probability Distribution" and "Probability Function" the same thing?

I have these two definitions for "Probability distribution" and "Probability function": Probability Distribution: Assigns a probability to each measurable subset of the possible outcomes of a random experiment, survey, or procedure of statistical inference. ( Wikipedia ) â€Ž Probability Function: Assigns an event A a probability P(A) that represents the likelihood of event A occurring. ( MITx 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science ) Those are very similar yet slightly different definitions. Specifically, Probability Function seems to refer to a single event whereas Probability Distribution seems to refer to a collection of events . I've googled around but not found a satisfying answer as it seems that both terms are used in different contexts.
