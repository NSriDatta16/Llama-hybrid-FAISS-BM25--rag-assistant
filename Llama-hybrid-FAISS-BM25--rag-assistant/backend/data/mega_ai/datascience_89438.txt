Does a Convolutional Layer in a Neural Network learn the correlation between its input signals via its kernel?

I am interested in the theory behing what a convolutional neural network learns with its convolutional operations. I think it learns (useful) kernels which measure the correlation between its input signals. Moreover, on a technical perspective: the convolution operation is implemented as "cross-correlation". So, is my assumption right?
