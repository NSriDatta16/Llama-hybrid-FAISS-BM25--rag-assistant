It is completely reasonable to consider the individual pixels (to continue the analogy to images) as features, giving you $2500$ features from a $50\times 50$ image. It is not clear why there should be opposition to this. The relationships between pixels in the image are captured by dependence between features, so you are not losing information by working this way, and this is probably the easiest way to proceed. There are techniques from image processing to extract features from images, and you might find success in considering such feature extraction techniques. One of the comments mentions histogram of oriented gradients and scale-invariant feature transform . To that list, I will add Fourier and wavelet transforms. I know that I have played with wavelet transforms of MNIST digits in R . However, you are not obviously making a mistake by considering the original features. Even the convolutional neural networks that exploit the spatial orientation of pixels in images can be viewed as fully-connected networks that use weight-sharing and parameter dropping .
