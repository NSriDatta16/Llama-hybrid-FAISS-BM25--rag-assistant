I'd suggest this algorithm: Apply a distance transformation to the image, so that all background pixels are set to 0, all foreground pixels are set to the distance from the background Find the local maxima in the distance transformed image. These are points in the middle of the lines. Put their pixel values (i.e. distances from the background) image into a list Calculate the median or average of that list
