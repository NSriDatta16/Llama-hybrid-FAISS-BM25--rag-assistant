Sequential semi-automatic model selection of time series forecasting

I have a number of univariate time series that I would like to incorporate in a production system. I have daily data from a month and I would like to forecast every day the corresponding values for the next week (horizon=7) for each time series. Every day new data arrives, so I can rebuild all models with the updated values. I have a number of competing methods (e.g. auto.arima , ets or ensembles) and I would like to select the best method every day in an automated way. My first thought was, at day $d$ to use the daily data for days $1, \ldots, d-8$ to build the models and compare out-of-sample forecast accuracies on days $d-7, \ldots, d$, and then pick the best model every day. I am sure that this is not the right thing to do (probably increased variance in predictions). Is there any reference on how to use such models in a production system? I did not manage to find anything relevant.
