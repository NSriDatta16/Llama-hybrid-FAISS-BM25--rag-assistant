Sentiment analysis using python

I have some text files containing movie reviews I need to find out whether the review is good or bad. I tried the following code but it's not working: import nltk with open("c:/users/user/desktop/datascience/moviesr/movies-1-32.txt", 'r') as m11: mov_rev = m11.read() mov_review1=nltk.word_tokenize(mov_rev) bon="crap aweful horrible terrible bad bland trite sucks unpleasant boring dull moronic dreadful disgusting distasteful flawed ordinary slow senseless unoriginal weak wacky uninteresting unpretentious " bag_of_negative_words=nltk.word_tokenize(bon) bop="Absorbing Big-Budget Brilliant Brutal Charismatic Charming Clever Comical Dazzling Dramatic Enjoyable Entertaining Excellent Exciting Expensive Fascinating Fast-Moving First-Rate Funny Highly-Charged Hilarious Imaginative Insightful Inspirational Intriguing Juvenile Lasting Legendary Pleasant Powerful Ripping Riveting Romantic Sad Satirical Sensitive Sentimental Surprising Suspenseful Tender Thought Provoking Tragic Uplifting Uproarious" bop.lower() bag_of_positive_words=nltk.word_tokenize(bop) vec=[] for i in bag_of_negative_words: if i in mov_review1: vec.append(1) else: for w in bag_of_positive_words: if w in moview_review1: vec.append(5) So I am trying to check whether the review contains a positive word or a negative word. If it contains a negative word then a value of 1 will be assigned to the vector vec else a value of 5 will be assigned. But the output I am getting is an empty vector. Please help. Also, please suggest others way of solving this problem.
