After the first pass you know which "half" the k'th element will be in. Now you repeat the process on that "half", etc. So, in the average case in the first iteration you do n steps, in the second n/2 steps, then n/4 steps and so on. As a back of the envelope calculation, assume n = 2**k. The total number of steps would be 2**k + 2**k/2 + 2**k/4 + ... = 2**k + 2**(k-1) + 2**(k-2) + ... + 2 + 1 = 2**(k+1) - 1 = 2n - 1 So, the algorithm is O(2n - 1) = O(n).
