How do you know that the assumptions of the model have been satisfied, and it’s ok to run the algorithm?

when using any simple algorithm like logistic regression, svm or even complex ones, how could you know that it’s ok to run the algorithm and use it in the industry? for example :when using logistic regression i assume that the data is represented by a specific function, how could i know that my assumption is good?
