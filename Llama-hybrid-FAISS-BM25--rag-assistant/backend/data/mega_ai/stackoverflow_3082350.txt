HttpContext.Current.Request is read only and so does HttpContext.Current.Request.UserAgent . This is so by nature of web, there's no reason why you may want to change anything within HttpRequest object since this has sent by some HttpClient on which you may never have control. Even in a case when you could change it, you're losing the integrity of the original Request which is obviously not recommended . I don't know what you're trying to achieve by changing the Request object or its properties, but I know for sure that's not the way to go. Try to work out some other way instead of changing the Request object, or write your actual problem statement here and we'll try to help you out.
