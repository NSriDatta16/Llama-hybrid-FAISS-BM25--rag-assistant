Should you tune 'ntree' in the Random Forest algorithm?

In the original paper, I was under the impression that the RF couldn't really overfit. However, in practice I'm seeing that increasing 'ntree' sometimes increases test set error. Is this due to randomness, or is there an optimal level for 'ntree'? Right now, I'm only using cross-validation to choose the optimal 'mtry'. I am using R and the randomForest package implementation.
