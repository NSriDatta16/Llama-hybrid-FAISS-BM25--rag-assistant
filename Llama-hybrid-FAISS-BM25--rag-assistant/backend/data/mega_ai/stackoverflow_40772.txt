As a day-to-day programmer, I'd say it's worthwhile to continue as far down the path to solving halting-style problems, even if you only approach that limit and never reach it. As you pointed out, virus scanning proves valuable. Google search doesn't pretend to be the absolute answer to "find me the best X for Y," but it's also notably useful. If I unleash a novel virus (muwahaha), does that create a bigger solution set, or just cast light on an existing problem area? Regardless of the technical difference, some will pragmatically develop and charge for follow-up "detection and removal" services. I look forward to real scientific answers for your other questions...
