Is random effects model in meta-analysis a Bayesian approach?

Unlike fixed effect model meta analysis, assumption in the random effects is that the effect size of an individual study deviates from the true effect, not only because of the sampling error but also due to the fact that even the true effect size of that study is only part of an over arching distribution of true effect sizes (Borenstein 2011). So, it is assumed that there is no one true effect size, but a distribution of true effect sizes, isn't this a Bayesian approach, unlike frequentist, where true effect size is considered constant? I do not understand the intricacies of Bayesian vs frequentist, so please highlight if I am wrong with my understanding.
