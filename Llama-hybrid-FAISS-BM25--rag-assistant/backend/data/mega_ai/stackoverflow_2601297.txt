Formally speaking, assuming that x is number of rows and y is number of columns you should sum all the probabilities of every possible direction for every possible word. Inputs are: x , y , l (average length of a word), n (total words) so you have horizontally a word can start from 0 to x-l and going right or from l to x going left for each row: 2x(x-l) same approach is used for vertical words: they can go from 0 to y-l going down or from l to y going up. So it's 2y(y-l) for diagonal words you shoul consider all possible start positions x*y and subtract l^2 since a rect of the field can't be used. As before you multiply by 4 since you have got 4 possible directions: 4*(x*y - l^2) . Then you multiply the whole result for the number of words included: total = n*(2*x*(x-l)+2*y*(y-l)+4*(x*y-l^2)
