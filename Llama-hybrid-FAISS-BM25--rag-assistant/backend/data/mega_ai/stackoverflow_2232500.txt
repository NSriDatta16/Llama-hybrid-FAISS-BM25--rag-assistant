Starter iPhone Development Questions

I have been asked by many of my family and friends if I could develop applications on the iPhone or iPod touch. The answer I always gave was "sure, if I could get everything I needed." I have discussed this with many friends and we believe that if we can crank out cheap-o fun games and get a million people to buy them for a buck, and do this every month or so, a good bit of money could be made. Not enough to retire, but enough to make it worth while. So my question is quite vague and leaves a lot of room for a variety of answers: What does it take to develop on the iPhone? I was under the impression that you needed a Mac, and needed MacOS. You can't get away with partitioning your hard drive and installing MacOS? Or run a virtual machine and install MacOS? I am primarily a windows developer with a lot of linux experience. What do I need to buy to develop for the iPhone? What do I need to download? Can you name a few books? Where should I begin? I encourage you to share your experiences, hurdles you had to overcome, things that you thought would be hard that ended up to be easy?
