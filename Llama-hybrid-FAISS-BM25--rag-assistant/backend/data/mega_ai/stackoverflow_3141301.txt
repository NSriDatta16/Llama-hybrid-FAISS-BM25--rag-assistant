First, I want to mention that I know nothing about image processing in general, and about OCR in particular. Still, a very simple heuristic comes to my mind: Separate the pixels in the image to connected components. For each connected component decide if it is a line or not using one or more of the following heuristics: Is it longer that the average letters length? Does it appear near other letters? (To remove ink bloats or artifacts). Does its X gradient and Y gradient large enough? This could make sure that this connected component contains more than just horizontal line. The only problem I can see is, if somebody writes letters on a horizontal line, like so: /\ ___ / \ / \ |__| |___/ -|--|---|---|------------------ | | \__/ In that case the line would remain, but you have to handle this case anyhow. As I mentioned, I'm by no means an image processing expert, but sometimes very simple tricks work.
