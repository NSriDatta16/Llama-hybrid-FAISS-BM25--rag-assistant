You can't detect if an image is rgb or not by direct examination of the the three buffers. You need to know what format it's in before making it available to another process or app. I suggest you decide to use rgb for all your interprocess buffers and ensure that all the images are converted to rgb in each originating process. in Opencv use "CvtColor" to get the native bgr into rgb. From other apps - if they don't support image conversion - then you can use cvconvert to get them all into rgb if you need to. You can also use "Merge" and "Mixchannels" to make simple rgb to bgr without any fuss and in-place. in 2.2 there is a better rgb to hsv fuinction which uses all 256 values for hue. it is better than the older one. docs here: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/
