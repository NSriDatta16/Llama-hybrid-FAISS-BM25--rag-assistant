I think it depends. If you just need to store the color, then hex notation should be fine. If you need to perform queries against specific color channels, then you'd want smallint fields for each color channel (be it RGB, ARGB, CYMK, etc). So, for simple storage, keep it simple. If you need to perform analysis, you'll need to consider alternate options as dictated by your problem domain.
