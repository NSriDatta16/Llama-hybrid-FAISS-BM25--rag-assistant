How to interpret daily vs. hourly "% chance of rain" precipitation forecasts?

Looking at the National Weather Service forecast for daytime precipitation tomorrow, it shows a 70% chance of rain ("showers likely"). I interpret this as meaning that on average it will rain 7 out of 10 days with a similar forecast -- leaving 3 days of 10 with no rain. Looking at the hourly breakdown of the same forecast it shows a 50% to 70% of rain for each daytime hour (a 12 hour period). Simplifying to 50%... if I flipped a coin at the beginning of each hour, the odds of a heads are the same as the odds for rain (50%). Taking this further, that means that "no rain today" is as likely as "12 heads in a row" ... a far, far, smaller probability than the 30% implied by the 70% forecast for the day. How can I interpret the hourly forecast percentage to be consistent with the daily forecast?
