Typcast a null pointer to char*

Suppose I have a char* elem that is supposed to hold a char** , such that elem[0] = char** , elem[1...m]= . Is there a way I can put a null ptr within char* elem ? When I try to set elem = NULL , it gives me a type error because NULL is an int. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
