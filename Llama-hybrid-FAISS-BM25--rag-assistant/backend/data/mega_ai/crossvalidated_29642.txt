Clustering 5 dimensions into 4 based on mean?

In my project, one variable named Organizational Culture has 5 dimensions namely Employee Development, Harmony, Customer Orientation, Social Responsibility and Innovation. In SPSS, I need to configure these 5 dimensions into 4 types so that: The highly integrative culture has high scores on all 5 dimensions. The market oriented culture describes the organizations that emphasize customer orientation more than any other cultural dimension. The moderately integrative culture shows average scores on all ?ve culture dimensions. Lastly, hierarchy culture show low score on all culture dimensions. In short, here is what I need: I need to cluster the firms from which I got data into 4 types (highly integrative, moderately integrative and so on) on the basis of the score assigned by their (firms') managers to the the 5 culture dimensions. As a result I will have four types of firms which will have four different culture types. I do see some hope in the method you suggest in your above post. Thank you very much for your time and I appreciate any help :)
