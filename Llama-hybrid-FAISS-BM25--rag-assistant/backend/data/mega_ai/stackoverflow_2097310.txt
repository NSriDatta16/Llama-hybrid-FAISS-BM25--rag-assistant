jQuery: val() updated too late

UPDATE: there was a problem with some other code. I'm trying to get the value of some input text field. The problem is that the value I obtain by my_val = $('#MyInput').val(); is not really updated. If I write in the field 'foo' and then click on the element which triggers the script, then I get my_val = undefined. On the other hand, if I write in the field 'foo', CLICK SOMEWHERE ELSE, and then click on the element which triggers the script, then I get my_val = 'foo'. It looks like Firefox updates val only on blur. Is there a way to get the correct value? (No, $('#MyInput').blur() does not work). EDIT: I add more info as requested. I'm currently using Firefox 3.5 on Ubuntu 9.10, but the same happens on the latest beta of Chrome. The simplest example is Bar and then a Javascript of $('p').click(function() { my_val = $('#input').val(); alert(my_val); }); Try writing something in the input and then clicking on the paragraph without leaving the field. EDIT2: never mind, it was some other code that was interfering. Sorry for wasting your time :-(
