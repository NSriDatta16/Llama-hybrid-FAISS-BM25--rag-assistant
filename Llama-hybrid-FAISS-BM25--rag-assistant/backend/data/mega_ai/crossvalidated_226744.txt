How to compute the KL-distance between 2 Bayesian networks?

Suppose I have a Bayesian network that can be factorized like this: P(A,B,C,D)=P(A)*P(B)*P(C|A,B)*P(D|C) Each of the variable is a binary and I've got all the tables of conditional probabilistic distribution. I then simulate from this network and got a synthetic data-set: A B C D 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 etc. I then estimate the parameters (the probabilities) with MLE and Bayesian estimator from the synthetic data and would like to compare these 2 learners by their KL-distances against the true distribution at various sample sizes. However, I'm not sure how to do it. The book I read about the relative entropy of Bayesian network just has notations in it and it's very hard to follow. Thanks!
