Yes, I'm answering myself because I just found out what's going on. It's a bug in cupcake's linker . The variable sym_name is the one used to report the error 7 lines below, but is never set to the name of the symbol whose lookup failed (or to anything at all besides that NULL ). This has been fixed (at least) in eclair (Android 2.0). Once I run my code on it I found what symbol was, yes, missing in my dynlib, fixed it, and now I'm a little bit less grumpy about the platform.
