Decision Tree as variable selection for Logistic Regression

I have to do a Logistic Regression, and have to use a subset of the variables. I received this "tip": do a Decision Tree first, and use the most relevant variables in the Logistic Regression . Is this a valid technique? If not, what problems does it face? PS: This tip is also given here for a standard regression. UPDATE : First of all thanks for all the answers. I'm definitely going to try the LASSO model. But, the algorithm must be simple, and easy for the IT to implement. It's a "millions of lines" kind of database, and the model needs to recurrently be estimated. Does it change the approach?
