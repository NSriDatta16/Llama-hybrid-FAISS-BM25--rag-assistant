You may already be aware of this but think about checking LayoutViewer to see what the layout thinks it is using. Although I'm sure your example config.xml is just an example please make sure that you've remembered to create a rewrite for form_test and that there is a valid blocks section for your own module. BTW, LayoutViewer could really do with being packaged properly for Magento Connect. The linked file lacks the necessary config to enable the module and it would be much more useful if accessible from PEAR.
