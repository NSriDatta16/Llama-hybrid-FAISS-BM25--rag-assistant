full index checkbox while creating new database

I am creating a new database, which I am basically designing for the logging/history purpose. So, I'll make around 8-10 tables in this database. Which will keep the data and I'll retrieve it for showing history information to the user. I am creating database from the SQL Server 2005 and I can see that there is a check box of " Use full Indexing". I am not sure whether I make it check or unchecked. As I am not familiar with the database too much, suggest me that by checking it, will it increase the performance of my database in retrieval?
