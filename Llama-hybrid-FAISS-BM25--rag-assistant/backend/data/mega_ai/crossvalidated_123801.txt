LR can only be compared to linear SVM - both work in the data space. I dont know exactly when logistic regression will perform better than linear SVM, but you should not that they approach the problem from a different angle - logistic regression will look at all the data in both classes while a linear SVM will only take into consideration the data in the border between both classes. A RBF or polynomial SVM will (in my limited experience) perform better than a LR in most cases. There was a very recent paper on the JMLR http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/delgado14a.html that reached that same conclusion. They also probably tested LR and linear SVM on a large set of datasets, so you can compare if linear SVM has a similar performance to LR, for practical purposes. This answer assumes that you are talking about a classification problem, despite the fact that you included a tag on regression.
