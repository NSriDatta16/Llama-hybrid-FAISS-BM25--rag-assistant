how to extract common aspects from text using deep learning?

Can you suggest me some papers to read about deep learning models that find patterns/similarities between different texts? What I have is a set of reviews with the following categories for each review: Rating, Review title, Review body, date, and helpful votes. What I would like to do is understand whether there exist similarities among the reviews. For instance, there exists a cluster of customers that complains about a specific aspect of a product. Or, as another example, to see if there exists a problem related to the season e.g. a product has many bad reviews in summer because it does not work well with high temperatures. Thank you for your help.
