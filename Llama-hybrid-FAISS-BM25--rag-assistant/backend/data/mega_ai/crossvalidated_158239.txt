K-means is all about the analysis-of-variance paradigm. ANOVA - both uni- and multivariate - is based on the fact that the sum of squared deviations about the grand centroid is comprised of such scatter about the group centroids and the scatter of those centroids about the grand one: SStotal=SSwithin+SSbetween . So, if SSwithin is minimized then SSbetween is maximized. SS of deviations of some points about their centroid (arithmetic mean) is known to be directly related to the overall squared euclidean distance between the points: the sum of squared deviations from centroid is equal to the sum of pairwise squared Euclidean distances divided by the number of points . (This is the direct extension of the trigonometric property of centroid . And this relation is exploited also in the double centering of distance matrix.) Thus, saying "SSbetween for centroids (as points) is maximized" is alias to say "the (weighted) set of squared distances between the centroids is maximized". Note: in SSbetween each centroid is weighted by the number of points Ni in that cluster i . That is, each centroid is counted Ni times. For example, with two centroids in the data, 1 and 2 , SSbetween = N1*D1^2+N2*D2^2 where D1 and D2 are the deviations of the centroids from the grand mean. That where word "weighted" in the former paragraph stems from.

Matrix of squared Euclidean distances between the 3 group centroids (see https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/148847/3277) .00000000 22.92738889 11.76592222 22.92738889 .00000000 43.32880000 11.76592222 43.32880000 .00000000 3 centroids are 3 points, but SSb is based on N points (propagated centroids): N1 points representing centroid1, N2 points representing centroid2 and N3 representing centroid3. Therefore the sum of the distances must be weighted accordingly: N1*N2*22.92738889 + N1*N3*11.76592222 + N2*N3*43.32880000 = 259.51969998 259.51969998 / N = 43.25328333 = SSb Moral in words: maximizing SSb is equivalent to maximizing the weighted sum of pairwise squared distances between the centroids. (And maximizing SSb corresponds to minimizing SSw, since SSt is constant.)
