You should check out using modules with ZF. You can have a default module to contain non-admin stuff, and an admin module to contain everything administrative. Using a default module will not change your current URLs and the admin module URLs will look like server.com/admin/controllername/actionname/params . This will solve your controllers all being in the same place and getting cluttered. Also, you can subclass Zend_Controller_Action and make a Master_Controller in your models to keep shared functionality. Then just make an Admin_Controller that extends the master controller for shared administrative functionality and have every controller in your admin module subclass that. You can use a similar structure to organize shared non-admin functionality in your other module(s). Zend Framework - modular directory structure
