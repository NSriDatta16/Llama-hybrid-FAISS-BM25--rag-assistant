To account for covariates, use a regression model instead of a statistical test. It turns out that models generalize tests [1, 2]. In your case you would regress post-surgery ANG7 on pre-surgery ANG7 and BMI. Since you want to generalize the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, use ordinal regression (aka proportional odds logistic regression or POLR). References [1] Biostatistics for Biomedical Research course notes. Available online [2] Inference of nonparametric tests as linear models . More about the covarite BMI: Analyze log(BMI) instead of BMI because BMI is a ratio of two quantities, weight and height (squared). Even better, if you have those measurements, you can substitute log(BMI) with log(weight) and log(height).
