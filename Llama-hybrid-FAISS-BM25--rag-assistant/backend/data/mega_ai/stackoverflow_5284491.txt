I've got no answers for ten days, so I think the question is too trivial to draw anyone's attention. Although I couldn't find any great underlying knowledge about universal libraries nor even an official document from anyone, but I just decided to make a simple dumb check on my binary size. I checked the size of binaries when I linked against an ordinary library and an universal library. The results was the same. So I could conclude the link process does the right thing and close my stupid question =).
