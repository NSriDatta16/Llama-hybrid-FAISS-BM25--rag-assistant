from itertools import groupby [key for key, _ in groupby(sortedList)] The list doesn't even have to be sorted , the sufficient condition is that equal values are grouped together. Edit: I assumed that "preserving order" implies that the list is actually ordered. If this is not the case, then the solution from MizardX is the right one. Community edit: This is however the most elegant way to "compress duplicate consecutive elements into a single element".
