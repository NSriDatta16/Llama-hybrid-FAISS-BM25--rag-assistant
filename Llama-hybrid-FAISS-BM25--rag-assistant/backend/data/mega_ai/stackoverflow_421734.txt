Even if each planet has 100 billion people, the total is still only 1E16. This is well within the limit of a signed 64 bit integer (2^63 goes to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 which is almost 1E19... You could go with a Million Billion people per planet, with 100000 planets before you got close to the limit... As to fractions and averages and such, can't you convert to a Float or double when you do any such calculations ?
