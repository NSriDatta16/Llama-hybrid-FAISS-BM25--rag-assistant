What is the best Classification Method alternative to Nominal Logistic Regression, if your Response and all Predictor variables are Categorical?

Hy, I need help in choosing the best classification method. My response variable is nominal with "4" categories and five predictor variables, two of them are nominal and three are binary. Kindly explain to me which method I should go with as I try using Multinomial logistics regression from R library "nnet" and I am not getting satisfying results.
