UDP is a unreliable datagram protocol. The packets are not guaranteed to arrive at their destination, or in the order that you sent them either. In addition, when sending packets larger than around 1500 bytes you'll find they get fragmented, or worse, dropped. The receiver will try to piece it together best it can. But if anything is missing, goodbye packet. So really, the limit is actually around that 1500 byte mark but sometimes much less to ensure no fragmentation and that they arrive. To send data larger than that a higher level protocol is going to have to put them all back together for you and request anything thats missing. How big will the images be? 64K might be too small anyway. You have two or three options. 1) Use TCP - it's reliable and stream orientated. You don't have to worry about how big or small or fragmentation as this is taken care of for you. 2) Use UDP but develop a higher level application protocol on top. Depending on your protocol that could be quite a bit of work. I'm doing this right now though. 3) Have a look at using the UDT library. It's designed for transferring bulk data over a WAN and has better performance than TCP. However, I would like to suggest that TCP will likely suit your needs just fine.
