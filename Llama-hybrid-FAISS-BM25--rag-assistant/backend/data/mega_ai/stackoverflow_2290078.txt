mod_rewrite question about modifying urls

I've finally got the mod_rewrite rule down somewhat, but would like to do a bit more with it and am not sure how. Here's what I currently have: RewriteRule ^rider/(.*)/(.*)*$ /bar/standings/rider.php?lnum=$1&short=$2 Which allows me to do this: http://pca.localhost/rider/214142/sme instead of http://pca.localhost/bar/standings/rider.php?lnum=214142&short=sme That works all fine and dandy, but I'd like to refine it more, so that it would be: http://pca.localhost/rider/fred/flinstone However, I need to pass the lnum variable because it's the only true id key (ie their could be two people in the db named fred flinstone). The short variable doesn't matter as much. My goal is to somehow pass just the name without showing the lnum variable. Is there a way to do this? Can I somehow hide the lnum variable when it's passed? Or, do I need to do some slick php/mysql work? Any advice, comments or suggestions are welcomed.
