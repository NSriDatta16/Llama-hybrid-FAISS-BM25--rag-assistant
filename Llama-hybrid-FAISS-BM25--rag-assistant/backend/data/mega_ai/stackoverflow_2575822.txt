In my perfect world I would have it work like this. Double click on a word selects the word only (a word according to the grammar rules of the locale), no trailing space (this is for easier copying between programs so that I would not need to remove any spaces when pasting) If I remove the selected word my text editor is aware of my content and removes any additional spaces left over A triple click selects a line with no trailing newlines. (A paragraph is a long line that has been wrapped)
