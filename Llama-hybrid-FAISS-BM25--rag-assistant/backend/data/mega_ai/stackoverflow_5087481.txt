You connect objects created in your XIB in Mac OS X the same way you do for iOS programs. Just add an NSImageView property to your main view, mark it as an IBOutlet and connect it up. For example, In MainView.h create a property for your NSImageView and make it an IBOutlet: #import @interface MainView : NSView { NSImageView *imageView; } @property(retain) IBOutlet NSImageView *imageView; @end In interface builder, make sure the class for the custom view is set to MainView, to do this click on the File's Owner object in the custom view XIB and then select the identity option in the inspector and enter MainView as the class type. Next, CTRL+click File's owner and drag the arrow to the NSImageView and select the imageView outlet. That's all there is to it. You should be able to reference the image view from code now.
