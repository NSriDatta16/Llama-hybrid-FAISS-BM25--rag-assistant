Why can't Bayesian variable selection be used with categorical variables with more than 2 levels?

I am reading this article which is the first approach on Bayesian variable selection. In the discussion section it says that one of the major limitations of the particular method is that it cannot be used with a class variable that has more than two levels. Does anyone know why?
