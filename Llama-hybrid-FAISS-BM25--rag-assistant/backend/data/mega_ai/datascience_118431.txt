Speaker Recognition using Deep Learning

I am trying to develop a speaker recognition model using deep learning. I want to use the VoxCeleb2 audio dataset but I cannot find it. The one on their website has YouTube links, but I would rather use data that is already in mp3/audio file format. Any idea where I can get it?
