PL/SQL is an Ada derivative, however Ada's style guide is almost as gut-twisting disgusting as the one most "old-school" DB-people prefer. (The one where you have to think their caps lock got stuck pretty bad) Stick with what you already know from .Net, which means sensible identifiers, without encrypting/compressing half the database into 30 chars. You could use a dictionary and split camel-cased or underscored identifier parts and check if they are real words. Kinda like what FxCop does. Could be bit annoying, though. Since the average Oracle database has the most atrocious and inconsistent naming guidelines that were obsolete even 30 years ago. So, I don't think you'll reach the goal of getting clean identifiers everywhere in your projects (or your user's) Since PL/SQL is case insensitive and columns are preferred over equally named local vars, you'll have to make even more tradeoffs. You can take parts of the style guide of other pascal derivatives (Ada is based on Modula, which is based on Pascal), like Delphi which feel a bit closer to home for PL/SQL (I use a mixture of .Net & Delphi). Especially the "aPrefix" for parameters can be a life saver, because you won't collide with column names that way: subtype TName is SomeTable.Name%type; subtype TId is SomeTable.Id%type; function Test(aName in TName) return TId is result TId; begin SELECT t.Id INTO result FROM SomeTable t WHERE t.Name = aName; return result; exception when No_Data_Found then return null; end; Without the prefix, oracle would always pick the column "Name" and not the parameter "Name". (Which is pretty annoying, since columns can be qualified with an alias...) I configured my PL/SQL Devloper to make all keywords in lowercase, however, I made the ones that are used in plain SQL to be uppercased (SELECT,WHERE, etc) As a result, SQLs are sticking out of the code, but not all my code has to be brutalized by all-upper keywords. (They are highlighted anyways, so what's with the all-upper fetish? ;-) ) When your tool is capable of identifying plain SQLs and give some visual clue, then even the SQL keywords wouldn't need to have a different casing. btw, I'd love to take a look at it. Can you post an url, or is still "under cover"? Cheers, Robert
