Why does MVC think multiple different addresses to the same page are SEO friendly?

It has come to my attention that http://www.example.com/Home/About is considered completely different from http://www.example.com/homE/abouT , yet they are the same page and both have header response of 200 . These URL's should either be all lower or upper case and any variation should return a 301 and redirect to the all lower or upper case URL. This may be ok with an “AboutUs” page but if you are per say a large store front with a large number of products this could kill any ranking you have or may attain in the future. Wish MVC/ASP.NET can some kind of option to set strict URL’s in the routing engine.
