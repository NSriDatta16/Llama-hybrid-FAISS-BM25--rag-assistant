Tree-based algorithms and ordinal features

For tree-based methods (e.g., DT, Random Forest, Gradient boosting, etc.), does the conversion interval of an ordinal feature to continuous matter matters? (I can see why it matters for linear model, but I am not clear for tree-based methods) For example: Is there a difference between converting an ordinal feature from [‘Low’,’Medium’,’High’] to [1,2,3] compared to converting it to [1,99, 876]
