How to change the names of the layers of deep learning in Keras?

I am using vgg16 to create a deep learning model. I want to know how to change the names of the layers of deep learning in Keras? I tried this for layer in vgg_model.layers: layer.name = layer.name + str("_") But when I change the names of the layers, the model accuracy become low .
