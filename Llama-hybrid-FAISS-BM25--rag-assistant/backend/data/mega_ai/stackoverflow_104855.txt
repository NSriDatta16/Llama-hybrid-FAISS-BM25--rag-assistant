I think defmeta's method is the best one if it's possible to make everything be children of the "main" draggable object -- it's the fastest (in terms of UI response time) and most simple, and requires the least amount of code. If that is not an option, there are a couple of other methods at your disposal: If you're using Flex, you can have other objects move along with the map by listening to MoveEvent .MOVE events on it and moving themselves accordingly You can implement the drag functionality yourself so that you'll have more control over it (see below). Here's an example that implements drag functionality for an object that will also move a bunch of "sibling" objects along with it. In this example, Any variable beginning with an underscore is a private member of the class that contains this code _siblings is a Dictionary in which the keys are the other objects that need to be moved. . private var _dragStartCoordinates:Point = null; private var _siblingsDragStartCoordinates:Dictionary = null; private function mouseDownHandler(event:MouseEvent):void { this.startDrag(); _dragStartCoordinates = new Point(this.x, this.y); _siblingsDragStartCoordinates = new Dictionary(true); for (var sibling:DisplayObject in _siblings) { _siblingsDragStartCoordinates[sibling] = new Point(sibling.x, sibling.y); } stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, dragMouseUpHandler, false, 0, true); stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, dragMouseMoveHandler, false, 0, true); } private function dragMouseUpHandler(event:MouseEvent):void { stage.removeEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, dragMouseUpHandler, false); stage.removeEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, dragMouseMoveHandler, false); this.stopDrag(); moveSiblings(); _dragStartCoordinates = null; _siblingsDragStartCoordinates = null; } private function dragMouseMoveHandler(event:MouseEvent):void { moveSiblings(); } // expects _dragStartCoordinates and _siblingsDragStartCoordinates // to be set private function moveSiblings():void { var xDiff:Number = this.x - _dragStartCoordinates.x; var yDiff:Number = this.y - _dragStartCoordinates.y; for (var sibling:DisplayObject in _siblings) { sibling.x = _siblingsDragStartCoordinates[sibling].x + xDiff; sibling.y = _siblingsDragStartCoordinates[sibling].y + yDiff; } }
