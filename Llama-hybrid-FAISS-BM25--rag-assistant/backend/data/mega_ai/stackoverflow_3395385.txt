will all devices have same JVM? No, definitely not. The fragmentation is terrible in the mobile Java world. Part of that fragmentation comes from all the different (and differently bugged, sadly) VMs. are all JVMs owned by sun micro systems? No, certainly not. There are several companies writing Java VMs for cell phones. Esmertec used to be (and probably still is) one of them. how sun gets profit? That's one of the most problematic issue Sun faced during its pre-Oracle life: they've invented just so many great technologies (both hardware and software) but never really got enough profit from them. Java is a prime example of both a major Sun success and a major Sun failure. Sun had, for example, machines where both the hardware and the OS was supporting CPU hot plugging literally decades before a similar thing will work (it still doesn't) in the "x86" world. That's just one example I'm thinking of. Sun was made by geniuses, with geniuses, but they clearly where close to absolute-zero when it came to both marketing and selling the amazing stuff they came up with. (I can think of at least one software company who's the total opposite: amazing marketing but crappy, insecure, bloated, underperforming software and the funny thing is that everyone knows which company I'm talking about ;)
