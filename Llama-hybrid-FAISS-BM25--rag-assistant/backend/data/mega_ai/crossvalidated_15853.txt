How to develop a forecast for counts where the counts per period is low?

I'm trying to analyze for any trends in what I consider to be low observations or counts. Let's say you have a bus service with the following commuters: year average count 2001 12 2002 15 2003 17 2004 13 2005 18 2006 12 2007 9 2008 12 The above numbers are fictitious but similar to what my problem is. How can I analyze the above data for any trends and perhaps attempt to forecast for 2009 to 2012 values?
