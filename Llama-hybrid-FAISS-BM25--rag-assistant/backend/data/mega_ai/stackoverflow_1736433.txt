can realloc move pointer if new size smaller?

I am wondering whether the C or C++ standard guarantees that a pointer is not changed when realloc is called with a smaller (nonzero) size: size_t n=1000; T*ptr=(T*)malloc(n*sizeof(T)); // Basically, can the OS decide on its own that since we freed a large memory block, he wants to take advantage of all reallocs to defragment the memory, and somehow move ptr2 ?
