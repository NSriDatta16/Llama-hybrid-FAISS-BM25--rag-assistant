rules in LPS give a logical semantics to production rules, which they otherwise lack. In the following example, lines 1-3 are type declarations, 4 describes the initial state, 5 is a reactive rule, 6-7 are logic program clauses, and 8 is a causal law: 1. fluents fire. 2. actions eliminate, escape. 3. events deal_with_fire. 4. initially fire. 5. if fire then deal_with_fire. 6. deal_with_fire if eliminate. 7. deal_with_fire if escape. 8. eliminate terminates fire. Notice in this example that the reactive rule on line 5 is triggered, just like a production rule, but this time its conclusion deal_with_fire becomes a goal to be reduced to sub-goals using the logic programs on lines 6-7. These subgoals are actions (line 2), at least one of which needs to be executed to satisfy the goal. Related systems Constraint Handling Rules: rule-based programming language.
