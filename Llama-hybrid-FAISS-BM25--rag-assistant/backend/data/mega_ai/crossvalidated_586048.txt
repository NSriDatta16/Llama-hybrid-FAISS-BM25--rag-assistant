Calculate variance of estimates in logistic regression

I was wondering if there exist formulas or reliable approximations (but not simulation or bootstrap based) to calculate the variance of the parameter estimates in logistic regression? If my model is $$ y\sim \operatorname{bern}(p) \quad \operatorname{logit}(p)= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1$$ , I would want to find for example: $$\operatorname{Var}(\hat{\beta_1}),$$ where the parameter estimation is done by maximum likelihood. I know this might be difficult because the parameter estimation of parameters in logistic regression is done numerically and does not have a closed form and using standard errors might not be reliable.
