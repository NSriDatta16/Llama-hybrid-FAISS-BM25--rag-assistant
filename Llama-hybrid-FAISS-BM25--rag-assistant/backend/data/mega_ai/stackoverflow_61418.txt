How to disable a warning in Delphi about "return value ... might be undefined"?

I have a function that gives me the following warning: [DCC Warning] filename.pas(6939): W1035 Return value of function 'function' might be undefined The function, however, is clean, small, and does have a known, expected, return value. The first statement in the function is: Result := ''; and there is no local variable or parameter called Result either. Is there any kind of pragma-like directive I can surround this method with to remove this warning? This is Delphi 2007. Unfortunately, the help system on this Delphi installation is not working, therefore i can't pop up the help for that warning right now. Anyone know off the top of their head what i can do?
