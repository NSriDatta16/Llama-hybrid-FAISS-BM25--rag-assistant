Drag and drop .app files into NSImageView and get the file path

I have an NSWindow containing and NSImageView. I want that the user can drag 'n drop a .app file (application) into the NSImageView, and my application see which file is dropped. Is there a way to do this (okay, I'm sure there is a way to do this -_- but which one :p )? So much like iWeb does it with image files. A tutorial would be nice (english or dutch). Thanks in advance.
