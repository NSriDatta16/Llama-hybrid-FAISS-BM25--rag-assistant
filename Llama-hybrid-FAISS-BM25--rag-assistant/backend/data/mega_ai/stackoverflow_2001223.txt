Today i am looking for the same example about the Java web start... I thing this link will work for you,i have used as a beginner. Click Here As mention With Java Web Start software, users can launch a Java application by clicking a link in a web page. The link points to a Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) file, which instructs Java Web Start software to download, cache, and run the application.
