Generally, yes. Basically you we are talking about the bias-variance tradeoff. If you use data to build up your model (training and validation data) and you iterate over different hyperparameters and you try to maximize an averaged performence metric your model might not be as good as indicated. However, especially in small datasets the additional split might lead to an even smaller training set and result in a bad model.
