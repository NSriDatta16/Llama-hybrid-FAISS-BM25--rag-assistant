I am wondering if applying dimensionality reduction/PCA to my dataset will affect the outcome of my model and whether if it is advisable to use it to process my data. In short - you don't know. You need to perform experiments, to check, if reducing dimensionality helps your models to perform better. There's little things you can state a priori . Generally, 40 features isn't that much, to observe dimensionality curse. One you obviously need to do, is to check your features correlation and check if any of the feature damages your output.
