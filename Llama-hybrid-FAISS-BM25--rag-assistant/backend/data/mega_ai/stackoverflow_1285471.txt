TFS - TF209026 - ItemNotFoundException

I try to execute a build batch on my build Agent, the following error I get: TF224003: An exception occurred on the build computer : TF209026: An un expected error occurred on the Team Foundation server http://tfsserver:8080/ : Item NotFoundException The item %2f%2f&changesetVersion=35&deletionId=0 does not exist at the specified version I have noticed that the map on the server is created but the TFSBuild.proj is not placed from source control. Somewhere it went wrong, I have no clue what goes wrong.
