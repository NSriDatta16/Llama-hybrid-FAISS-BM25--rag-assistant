I hope you will take a look at Twilio. Our REST API and TwiML make it very easy to make outbound calls programmatically with any language that can output XML. We've got some sample code for voice broadcast that you might find useful: http://www.twilio.com/docs/howto/broadcast Regarding .NET, you might want to check out some of the work John Sheehan has done with Twilio. Robert McLaws has also written a Twilio .NET library you may want to check out. (Both are Google-able, just started this account so not enough rep point to post multiple links yet) In full disclosure, John is so awesome we recently hired him to become a developer evangelist for Twilio. Cheers - Danielle @ Twilio
