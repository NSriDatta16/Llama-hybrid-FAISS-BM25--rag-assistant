When using services, whether my own or third party, I design to interfaces as a matter of course, so I tend to focus on the interactions there. This encourages me to design minimal interfaces. I check state on anything focusing on value objects, just as simple calculations, lookups, and the like. The next time you find yourself designing something that typically follows Model/View/Controller-or-Presenter, I highly recommend trying the Presenter First approach (Google it) using interfaces for the Model and View. This will give you a great feel for how to use stubs/mocks effectively.
