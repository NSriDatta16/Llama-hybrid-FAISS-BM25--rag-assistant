I have exactly the same problem. Rubin's rule tells us to average the estimates (and something a little more complex to calculate the pooled variance). The estimates in a logistic model are the betas, not the exponent of the betas (odds ratios), although these are the ones we are usually interested in. My conclusion, therefore, is that I should average the betas (which are the log of the odds ratios) and their confidence interval limits; these estimates will follow Rubin's rule. Once we have averaged the betas (that is, the log of the odds ratios) and their confidence limits (again, the log of the confidence limits of the odds ratios) then we can transform them back again into odds ratios (and their confidence limits) by exponentiating them. With a little bit of math we can safe ourselves all the back and forth: unless I got this wrong, the exponent of the average of the betas (our pooled odds ratio of say, m imputed datasets) is equal to the (product of the m odds ratios)^(1/m). Just multiply all the odds ratios you want to pool, and calculate the m-root. I have just looked into this solution this afternoon, and I was trying to find out what others say, so if I got this wrong I will appreciate some kind feedback. Thanks!
