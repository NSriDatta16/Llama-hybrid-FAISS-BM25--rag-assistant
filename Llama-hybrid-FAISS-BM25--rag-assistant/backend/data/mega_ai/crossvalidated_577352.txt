As it stands at the moment in my mind, a causal forest is built using a combination of causal trees, my bare understanding is that when estimating for a group or cluster average treatment effects given a treatment assignment condition then a causal forest is the best choice, whereas if estimating treatment effect heterogeneity for an individual then the causal tree is more optimized for that. I may be wrong but that is how I get my head around it.
