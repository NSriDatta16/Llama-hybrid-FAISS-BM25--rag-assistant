There is actually a binomial formula to use. This is due to a correspondence between the geometric distribution and the binomial distribution. Waiting time The geometric distribution relates to the waiting time (more general is the negative binomial distribution that Sycorax mentions). $$\begin{array}{rccc} P(\text{wait until $k$-th trial}) &= & P\left(\substack{\text{you had not yet}\\\text{ a monster}\\\text{ in the $k-1$-th trial}}\right)& P\left(\substack{\text{get monster}\\\text{ in the $k$-th trial}}| \substack{\text{you had not yet}\\\text{ a monster}\\\text{ in the $k-1$-th trial}}\right) \\ &=&(1-p)^{k-1}&p \end{array}$$ The distribution looks like below: Number of success The binomial distribution relates to the number of monsters Say you have $n$ trials then with the the value of $p$ you can estimate the probability of $1, 2, 3, \dots , n$ successes. $P(\text{$k$ successes}) = {n\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$ This distribution looks like below: The number of trials for the median of the geometric distribution ( $n=12$ ) corresponds to the binomial probability being approximately equal to $P(K=0) = 0.5$ . So the binomial formula $1-p^n = 0.5$ is correct, but it gives you the median and not the average (expected value). Relations The following are approximately equivalent 'Median of waiting time is $k$ ' versus 'probability of 0 events in $k$ trials is 0.5' The following are approximately equivalent 'average waiting time is $\mu$ ' versus 'average number of events in $k$ trials is $k/\mu$ ' To find the number $x$ in "with $x$ samples we have a 50% chance to obtain said character" You need the first case and that is either the median of the waiting time or the probability $P(K=0) = p^n$ for a binomial distribution.
