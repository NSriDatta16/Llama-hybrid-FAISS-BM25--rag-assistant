The classical definition of an improper prior in Bayesian statistics is one of a measure $\text{d}\pi$ with infinite mass $$\int_\Theta \text{d}\pi(\theta)=+\infty$$ See, e.g., Hartigan's Bayes Theory , which formalises quite nicely the use of improper priors. Any measure $\text{d}\pi$ with finite mass can be normalised into a probability measure with mass $1$. See also this related Cross validated entry on improper priors.
