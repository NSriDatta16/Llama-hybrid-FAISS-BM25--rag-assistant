Generally you can access the camera the same way you do it in Silverlight - there is the CameraCaptureTask - you need to add a reference to Microsoft.Phone first and then call it from the game. Microsoft.Phone.Tasks.CameraCaptureTask task = new Microsoft.Phone.Tasks.CameraCaptureTask(); task.Completed += new EventHandler (task_Completed); task.Show(); That would be for static capture, and your event handler is like this: void task_Completed(object sender, Microsoft.Phone.Tasks.PhotoResult e) { // Do something with e.ChosenPhoto } Currently, video recording is done through the undocumented way - this will most likely get your app submission disapproved from the Marketplace, but it is possible nonetheless. What's done that way is a MP4 file is constantly updated in the IsolatedStorage as the recording is in progress. But then again, there are methods present to include the file in the media library.
