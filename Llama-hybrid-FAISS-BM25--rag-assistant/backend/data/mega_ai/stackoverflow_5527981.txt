Script to convert ASCII chars to " " unicode notation

I'm doing some changes in Linux locale files /usr/share/i18n/locales (like pt_BR ), and it's required that format strings (like %d-%m-%Y %H:%M ) must be specified in Unicode, where each (in this case, ASCII) character is represented as . So a text like this: LC_TIME d_t_fmt "%a %d %b %Y %T %Z" d_fmt "%d-%m-%Y" t_fmt "%T" Must be: LC_TIME d_t_fmt " " d_fmt " " t_fmt " " Thus I need a command-line script (be it bash, Python, Perl, or something else) that would take an input like %d-%m-%Y and convert it to . All characters in the input string would be ASCII chars (from 0x20 to 0x7F ), so this is actually a fancier "char-to-hex-string" conversion. Could anyone please help me? My skills in bash scripting are very limited, and even worse in Python. Bonus for elegant, explained solutions. Thanks! (by the way, this would be the "reverse" script for my previous question )
