C# - filling in empty dates in a collection

Assume that the class Data is defined as {DateTime TransactionDate, int ItemCount} . I get an original IEnumerable containing scattered TransactionDates and ItemCounts and I need to write a method that returns a collection with all the days filled in between the minimum and the maximum days in the original collection. For instance, if I get: 12/5/2009 15.00 12/7/2009 10.00 12/10/2009 75.00 I need to generate something like this: 12/5/2009 15.00 12/6/2009 0.00 12/7/2009 10.00 12/8/2009 0.00 12/9/2009 0.00 12/10/2009 75.00 Get you give me an elegant way of doing this with c# 3.0? I have a list of all dates between the minimum and maximum dates. So I assume all I have to do is "foreach" the intersect collection (allDates-existingDates) and insert a new element for each of these. Am I right? Thanks
