How to handle unequal trials between conditions in Mixed Effects Models? R

I have a rather simple design, but I am unsure how best to (properly) handle the data analysis. I have an experiment with two between-subjects factors and one within-subjects factor. I will use, as an example Gender(Male v Female) and Training(Noob vs Pro) for the between, and Shapes(Red and Blue) for the within. My problem: the Shapes factor has unequal trials based on the Training condition, where Noob sees 5 Red and 6 Blue, while Pro sees 6 Red and 5 Blue trials. What I care about is "accuracy in correctly detecting the colour of a the shape". Now, I have no idea how to analyze this data. If I just input the data in long form, with Trial as a factor, would a MEM in R analyze the data based on AVERAGES (due to the difference in trial number) or SUMS (which would be wrong)? I also assume that there are differences in the scores people given to specific trials, so i need to have this as a random effect. Any advice is appreciated.
