First step would be to create a map of what functionality is used in what application. Centralizing means you need to develop some way to track changes to applications (dependencies). Your situation now is simple: everything is independent, so a change to one will not break another application. It is a lot of work, as the same change needs to be made to all relevant apps. With a more centralized system, you'll need some organizational changes: someone needs to be responsible for changes to each functional area. Developers can no longer just make any change they like.
