It depends. I assume you understand backpropagation algorithm, as it is used by most of NN architectures, and CNNs and RNNs and all that stuff is not that hard if you know backpropagation. On the one hand , Theano/Tensorflow don't seem to be a good example since they are basically DSLs to write matrix/tensor computations, and they're pretty math-heavy and low-level (you write down actual mathematical operations, and not only use fit , transform / predict api). On the other hand , there is Keras and scikit-learn, which only have high-level apis, and don't require as much plumbing. In particular, in Keras you can use some models that were pretrained or have a predefined architecture that is known to work for some problems. Of course if you don't have good math knowledge you can run into problems with black-box models, but if you just want to apply stuff that seems to work with something to some other thing, then it's definitely possible, for example check out this simple project . You might also be interested in Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow as it seems to be aimed at nontechnical people (I don't know if it's feasible to learn it without any technical background, but at least it contains lots of cool examples).
