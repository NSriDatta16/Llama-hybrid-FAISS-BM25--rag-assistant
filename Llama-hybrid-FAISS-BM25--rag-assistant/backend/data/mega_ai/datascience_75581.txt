Try to use the concatenated vector of average word2vec and max pool word2vec. You may get better results than tfidf and PCA. Remove the words like stop words. Also, try with lemmatized words. If you okay with computational time, go for transformer-based transfer learning embedding like BERT, ALBERT etc...
