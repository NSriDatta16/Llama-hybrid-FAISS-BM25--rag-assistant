Which cost function should be used for t-distributed noise?

I'm new to Machine Learning. I've looked around and it seems that when we assume that a certain process has an underlying function plus some normally distributed noise, then a good choice for the cost function is the MSE. So my question is: If we assume that our noise is t-distributed instead, which would be the best cost function to use? I couldn't find this anywhere!
