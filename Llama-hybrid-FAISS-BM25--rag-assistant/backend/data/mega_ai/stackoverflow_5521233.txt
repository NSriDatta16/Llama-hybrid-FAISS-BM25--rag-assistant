How do I make my android apps fill the screen on Honeycomb?

I just got a Xoom on Wednesday, and upon loading my apps onto it, they run in a small window, as if they are being run on a smaller device. Various other apps fill the screen of the Xoom, although they don't seem to be using any specific honeycomb APIs, as they just seem to be the same UI I get on my phone, just stretched to fit. How would I go about getting my apps to fill the screen? Do I have to use fragments, or is there a simpler way?
