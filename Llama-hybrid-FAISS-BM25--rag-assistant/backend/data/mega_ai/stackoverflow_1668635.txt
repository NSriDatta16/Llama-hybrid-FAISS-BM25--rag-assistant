Because it doesn't work in Oracle! You could declare all columns as VARCHAR2(4000) if you wanted, but it isn't recommended by any means. There will be no difference in storage or performance of the database, but: you lose a constraint on the sensible values that can be stored in the column some client applications will allocate 4000 bytes of memory to receive data from the column when (say) 10 is all it will ever contain.
