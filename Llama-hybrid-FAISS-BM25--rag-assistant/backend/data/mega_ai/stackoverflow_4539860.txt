One good way is to make your services RESTful . From Wikipedia - Representational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the World Wide Web. REST style web services leverage the existing capabilities of HTTP to expose the services. Since almost every technology of building software can deal with HTTP you can be sure that your web services can be consumed by any non-DotNet consumer. A very good example of RESTful services would be the stackOverflow API . Here are some good links you can start with - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/index-137171.html http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd315413.aspx
