firstly, you should be using .html.erb as your template extension secondly you can use logic to detect the type of layout to use based on the user agent ( request.user_agent ). layout :site_layout def site_layout some_way_to_detect_the_layout_to_use end Note, the user_agent can be faked, but a majority of people wont bother faking it so the solution should be "good enough" for 99.9% of cases.
