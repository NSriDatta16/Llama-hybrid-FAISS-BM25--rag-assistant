If it were me, I would create a user control dedicated to creating a single entry in the listing. The user control would only need one parameter (the post number it's responsible for). The page itself need only maintain an array (or list or whatever structure you would prefer) of these user controls and add them to whatever panel they need to be displayed in dynamically. The user control would contain a panel with class "newsBox", a label for the title, and another panel (or possibly just a regular HTML paragraph) for the content, so its output would be the same as what you're building in your example. The difference is it would be created using ASP and HTML objects instead of a string. Also, if it were me, I wouldn't have a user control responsible for querying its own data from the database. A DAL would really be beneficial here, as you could have a function "GetNewsDetails(int postNumber)" that could cache news posts if they've been queried recently and could be reused by other user controls if necessary.
