It also looks like rpart directly handles categorical variables, but scikit-learn doesn't. Why do categorical variables need preprocessing in scikit-learn, compared to other tools? Most of scikit-learn assumes data is in NumPy arrays or SciPy sparse matrices of a single numeric dtype. These do not explicitly represent categorical variables at present. Thus, unlike Râ€™s data.frames or pandas.DataFrame, we require explicit conversion of categorical features to numeric values, as discussed in Encoding categorical features. See also Column Transformer with Mixed Types for an example of working with heterogeneous (e.g. categorical and numeric) data.
