How few training examples is too few when training a neural network?

I'm a beginner trying to put together my first project. I had a song classification project in mind, but since I would be manually labeling, I could only reasonably put together about 1000 songs, or 60 hours of music. I would be classifying with several classes, so it's possible that one class would have as few as 50-100 songs in the training set- this seems like too few! Is there a general rule of thumb for how much data is needed to train a neural network to give it a shot at working? Edit: I was thinking of using a vanilla LSTM. The input features will have dimension 39, output dimension 6, my first attempt for hidden layer dimension would be 100.
