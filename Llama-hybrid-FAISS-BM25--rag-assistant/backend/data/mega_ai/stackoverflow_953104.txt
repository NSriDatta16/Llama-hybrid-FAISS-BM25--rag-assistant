If you have the image file already (i.e. someone uploads it) and just want a place to put it that's not your local machine or your database you can look into using some sort of cloud-storage system like Amazon S3 (Note: this will cost you money). You can then use a library like ThreeSharp . You can also have Amazon serve up the images instead of your webserver. If you don't already have the images, i.e. you want to generate images, you'll need to be more specific on what exactly you need. There is a wide array of libraries and some are better suited for certain scenarios than others.
