Predictive Model with added data

I built a predictive model in R using XGBoost to predict the success of a binary event. All the data fed to the model is as of a single point in time, say Day 0. How would i alter the model such that it can add in new variables once they are available, say on Day 5? To be more specific, i am practicing model building on nfl rookie performance. My day 0 data are all prior to the season starting. How would i "re-score" their probability for success once i get data from games played? Do i need a whole new model? Or do i leave those new variables as NULL in the original model? Thank you!
