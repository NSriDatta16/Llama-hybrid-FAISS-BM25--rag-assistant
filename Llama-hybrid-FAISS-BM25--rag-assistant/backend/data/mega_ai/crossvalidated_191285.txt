If I understand correctly, the system your describing is actually a single observation (i.e. spectrum) with the amplitude at each wavelength a variable. Thus, you have just a single observation with ~1000 variables! Typically, spectroscopic analysis uses the amplitude (in your case reflectance) of certain parts of the spectrum to predict some quantity. What you need to do however is "teach" the algorithm what the spectrum looks like when you vary your target variable. For example, assume you were using the spectrum to understand the water content of the plant. The first thing you would want to do is amass a spectra set of the plant's reflectance when the plant has various levels of water concentration. Once you had this spectra set, you could then use PCA to find the proper wavelengths that predict the water content, effectively reducing your variables.
