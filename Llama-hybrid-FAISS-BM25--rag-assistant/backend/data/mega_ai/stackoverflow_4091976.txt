Note: I say pixel, but this could be regions using an average of the pixels. Optimization is another issue... Sounds like you need to analyze a function (pressure over time) for each pixel and determine where the function turns (when it changes > X in the other direction it is considered a turn to counter errors). If you know at what frames it turns, you will know the frame where the pressure was the most hard and you will know where it was the least hard between the two paws. In theory, you then would know the two frames where the paws pressed the most hard and can calculate an average of those intervals. after which I'll get to the problem of deciding which paw it is! This is the same tour as before, knowing when each paw applies the most pressure helps you decide.
