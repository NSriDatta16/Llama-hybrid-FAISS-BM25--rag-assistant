What is the difference between "loadings" and "correlation loadings" in PCA and PLS?

One common thing to do when doing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is to plot two loadings against each other to investigate the relationships between the variables. In the paper accompanying the PLS R package for doing Principal Component Regression and PLS regression there is a different plot, called the correlation loadings plot (see figure 7 and page 15 in the paper). The correlation loading , as it is explained, is the correlation between the scores (from the PCA or PLS) and the actual observed data. It seems to me that loadings and correlation loadings are pretty similar, except that they are scaled a bit differently. A reproducible example in R, with the built in data set mtcars is as follows: data(mtcars) pca What is the difference in interpretation of these plots? And which plot (if any) is best to use in practice?
