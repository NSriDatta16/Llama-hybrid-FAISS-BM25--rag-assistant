Are neural networks smart enough to overcome unbalanced data sets?

From what I have read, many models have issues with unbalanced data sets in classification problems. Are neural networks smart enough to overcome this flaw or should I still look into creating a balanced data set. I am able to feed the model a lot of data, but it will be unbalanced. Thanks
