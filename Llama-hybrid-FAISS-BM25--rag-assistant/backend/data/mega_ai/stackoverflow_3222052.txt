The difference is that the latter is C and the former is not. Never use #pragma once ; always use #ifndef . One other thing to note when using the #ifndef method is that any preprocessor symbol beginning with two underscores or an underscore followed by a capital letter is reserved and cannot be used . You should use things like #ifndef MYHEADER_H and not #ifndef _MYHEADER_H .
