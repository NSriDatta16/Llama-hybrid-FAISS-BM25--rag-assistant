You can use soft targets, but you would need to have them. The soft target for classification would be the probability that the sample belongs to a particular class, this is usually not something that you could observe. It is even available in the Râ€™s implementation of logistic regression. The scenario where you would have the soft targets is when using aggregated data, where row of dataset is an aggregate of multiple observations where the label is the fraction of the observations that belonged to the particular category. By the way, this nicely shows how logistic regression is a regression, not classification, algorithm and how the boundary between regression and classification can be blurry. In model distillation you have the soft targets, because they are the probabilities predicted by the base model.
