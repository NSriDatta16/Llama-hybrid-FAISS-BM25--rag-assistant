Weighted Survey Predicted Probabilities

I have a question about calculating prevalence using predicted probabilities from a survey weighted generalized linear model. Say my goal was to calculate the prevalence of a binary outcome using the predicted probabilities of that outcome over some characteristic (like age or sex).And I were to create a generalized linear model using survey weighted data, and then use that model to predict the probability of the outcome on the same data set I used to build the model for each individual in the data set. If I wanted to calculate the prevalence of the outcome in the population that the data represents when weighted would I need to calculated the weighted average of the predicted probability over the other characteristic(age,sex), or would just the average of the probabilities be sufficient, since weighting was taken into account in the model?
