Scrolling down a page after rendering in Rails

Is there a way to scroll or jump down a page after rendering it? Specifically, in my controller action, there are some situations where I'll want to send the user to a particular place on the page. If it were just a link from another page, I'd probably use a URI fragment identifier - " http://blorg.com/page#id " - but this needs to be dynamically generated depending on some condition. Maybe I need to use JavaScript (Prototype) somehow, but I don't know how to call the function once the page is done loading, especially from the controller.
