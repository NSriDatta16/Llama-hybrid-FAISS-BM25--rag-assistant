Routes only want a show on default despite explicit member statement

When I go to .. www.website.com/admin/organizations/org_deals , I get : Missing template admin/organizations/show.erb in view path My routes.rb : map.namespace :admin do |admin| admin.napespace :organizations do |organization| organization.org_deals 'org_deals', :action => 'org_deals', :member => {org_deals => :get} end end In my rake routes : admin_organizations_org_deals /admin/organizations/org_deals {:controller=>"admin/organizations/", :action=>"org_deals", :member=>{:org_deals=>:get}} And last but not least. My file is in the directory : /admin/organizations/org_deals.html.haml But my app desperately wants a 'show'. How can I tell it, "no, no, no, what you really want is an org_deals, silly." Thanks!
