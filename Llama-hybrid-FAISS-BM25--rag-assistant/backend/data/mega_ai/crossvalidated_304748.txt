ARIMA (Statistical approach) Vs Regression approach to predict values

I have sales data of my organization for last 3 years and based on that I have to forecast Budget amount for next Fiscal Year. Sales data is available across different Geographies for various Product subscription. Now, I have gone through some blogs related to different Time series modeling on Analytics Vidhya and MachineLearningMastery and understand the basics pretty well. Que: What is the ideal way to approach this problem? Should I use Time series analysis(ARIMA) or simple regression would be the best option. Acc. to me since I have cross-sectional data(across geo and products) regression would best fit my problem. Though, if I divide my data into Distinct different combinations(Let's say 100) of Product/Geo/Year/Months, I might end up having 100 diff series which can be forecasted using ARIMA. Any help/suggestion/reference are appreciated. Regards, Jagbir
