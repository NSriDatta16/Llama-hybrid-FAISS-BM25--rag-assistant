You first need to decide what question(s) you are trying to answer. You could analyze your data with anything from running basic summary statistics to doing an unsupervised (or supervised) random forest, the first may not answer the questions of interest (or it may) and the second may be overkill (and still may not answer any questions of interest). How to combine survey answers into a single score (or even if you should do this) depends on what question you want to answer. Whether to do a single analysis of combined data or do a few different analyses on seperate parts of the data depend on the question(s) of interest. If you give more information on the actual question(s) of interest and how the data relates to the question(s) then we may be able to give better pointers. Actually, often the process of figuring out a good research question will clarify what techniques to use.
