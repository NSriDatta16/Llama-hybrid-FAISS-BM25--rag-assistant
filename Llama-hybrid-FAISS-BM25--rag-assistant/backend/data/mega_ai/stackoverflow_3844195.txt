I can recommend the "Magento without sales" approach (I call it "catalog-driven") from personal experience. You can disable the core modules that are not required which will significantly improve performance. There are some dependencies that are not particularly obvious, so some trial and error is required to disable and test. Make sure that you disable the modules in app/etc/modules/ by setting false as just setting them to disable in the Web Admin only disables the admin rendering functionality. If you can achieve reasonable performance (and there are plenty of wiki articles, blog posts, etc on that!), then I haven't found any downside to this approach, and plenty of advantages from the framework. It also gives you the opportunity to add in eCommerce down the track without rewriting the site.
