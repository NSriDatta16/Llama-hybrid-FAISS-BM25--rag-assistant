Depends. The Non paged pool should be reserved for memory that must stay in RAM so if you are doing something critical that would affected by a memory page from disk operation then use non paged. See here for more info. Looking at this (though it discusses c++ as opposed to C) it would seem that by default the globals can be located in either by #pragma. Also on p22 of this we see how to do this. Finally this discuss here we see that the data segment should be non pagagable by default.
