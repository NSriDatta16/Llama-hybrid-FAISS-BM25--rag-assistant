In XCode, create a new View XIB file and open it in Interface Builder. In this xib file, delete the View and drag a UINavigationController into it's place. Then, in your view controller code, something like UINavigationController *controller = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithNibName:@"ModalViewController" bundle:nil]; [self presentModalViewController:controller animated:YES]; [controller release]; Will load your XIB and present it. Hope this helps, any other questions don't hesitate to comment on this answer! S
