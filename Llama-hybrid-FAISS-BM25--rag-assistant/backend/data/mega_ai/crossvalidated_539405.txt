The following is a link to an archived page from R-help that will be helpful for you: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2007-February/126254.html First, your instincts are right about not wanting to put too much emphasis on the results of the Woolf test to assess the assumptions of the CMH test. It's like when you are assessing a general linear model: you don't really want to use a hypothesis test to see if the residuals are reasonably normal or homoscedastic. The R-help link has code to look at odds ratio of the tables in the individual strata. (I guess the code works for individual tables that are 2 x 2.) I would look at those results. How large of a difference among odds ratio is too large? I don't know. But I think this a better way to assess the variation among the odds ratios than to use a hypothesis test. The R-help link also presents a different approach to conduct the analysis: logistic regression. This would probably be my preferred approach anyway. At least when using R, there are options to include interactions among your factors and there are options for post-hoc analysis, and so on.
