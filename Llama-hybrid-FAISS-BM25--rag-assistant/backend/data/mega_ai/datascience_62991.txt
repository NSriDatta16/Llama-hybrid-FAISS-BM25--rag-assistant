Is consecutive multiple transformation of Y variable a valid approach statistically?

I am going to run a regression analysis. But my response variable is highly right-skewed Firstly I used a log(x+1) transformation and it increased the situation dramatically. But there is still right-skewness in my transformed data. My question is; can I apply another transformation to my already transformed variable? For example I have applied a sqrt transformation to my log(x+1) transformed variable and it is now very close to normality. Is it valid in terms of data science and statistics? Can I apply such multiple data transformations to my data? Thanks
