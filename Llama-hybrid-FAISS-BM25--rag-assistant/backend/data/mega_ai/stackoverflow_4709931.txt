I am new to running queries like this, but I find this thread very informative. Would something like this work as well? $query = "SELECT shop.id, shop.name, agent.name FROM shop LEFT JOIN agent ON shop.id = agent.id"; $res = mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error()); while($row = mysql_fetch_array($res)){ echo $row['shop']['name']. " - ". $row['agent']['name']; echo " "; }
