 Russian President Vladimir Putin stated "Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind... Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world". Putin also said it would be better to prevent any single actor achieving a monopoly, but that if Russia became the leader in AI, they would share their "technology with the rest of the world, like we are doing now with atomic and nuclear technology". Russia is establishing a number of organizations devoted to the development of military AI. In March 2018, the Russian government released a 10-point AI agenda, which calls for the establishment of an AI and Big Data consortium, a Fund for Analytical Algorithms and Programs, a state-backed AI training and education program, a dedicated AI lab, and a National Center for Artificial Intelligence, among other initiatives. In addition, Russia recently created a defense research organization, roughly equivalent to DARPA, dedicated to autonomy and robotics called the Foundation for Advanced Studies, and initiated an annual conference on "Robotization of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation." The Russian military has been researching a number of AI applications, with a heavy emphasis on semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. In an official statement on November 1, 2017, Viktor Bondarev, chairman of the Federation Council's Defense and Security Committee, stated that "artificial intelligence will be able to replace a soldier on the battlefield and a pilot in an aircraft cockpit" and later noted that "the day is nearing when vehicles will get artificial intelligence." Bondarev made these remarks in close proximity to the successful test of Nerehta, an crewless Russian ground vehicle that reportedly "outperformed existing [crewed] combat vehicles." Russia plans to use Nerehta as a research and development platform for AI and may one day deploy the system in combat, intelligence gathering, or logistics roles. Russia has also reportedly built a combat module for crewless ground vehicles that is capable of autonomous target identification—and, potentially, target engagement—and plans to develop a suite of AI-enabled autonomous systems. In addition, the Russian military plans to incorporate AI into crewless aerial, naval, and undersea vehicles and is currently developing swarming capabilities. It is also exploring innovative uses of AI for remote sensing and electronic warfare, including adaptive frequency hopping, waveforms, and countermeasures. Russia has also made extensive use of AI technologies for domestic propaganda and surveillance, as well as for information operations directed against the United States and U.S. allies. The Russian government has strongly rejected any ban on lethal autonomous weapon systems, suggesting that such an international ban could be ignored. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing Russia-Ukraine war has seen seen significant use of AI by both sides and has also been characterised as a drone war. Advances in AI-powered GPS-denied navigation and drone swarming techniques are significantly improving operational capabilities for Ukraine. Fully realised drone swarms, where multiple drones coordinate and make decisions autonomously, are still in the early stages of experimentation but Ukraine is exploring and implementing these techniques in a real conflict situation. The Defense Intelligence of Ukraine (DIU) has been at the forefront of utilizing drones with some elements of autonomy for conducting long-range strikes into Russian territory. Domestic drone production has significantly expanded, with approximately 2 million drones produced in 2024, 96.2% of which were domestically manufactured. Rather than replacing human involvement, AI is primarily serving to augment existing capabilities, enhancing the speed, accuracy, and overall efficiency of numerous military functions. Perhaps the most important way in which AI has been used by Ukraine is in int
