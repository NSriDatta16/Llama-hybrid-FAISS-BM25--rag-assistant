Heres what I've got searching tru the net To check the overlap: Let CondA Mean DateRange A Completely After DateRange B (True if StartA > EndB) Let CondB Mean DateRange A Completely Before DateRange B (True if EndA Then Overlap exists if Neither A Nor B is true ( If one range is neither completely after the other, nor completely before the other, then they must overlap) Now deMorgan's law, I think it is, says that Not (A Or B) Not A And Not B Which means (StartA = StartB) NOTE: This includes conditions where the edges overlap exactly. If you wish to exclude that, change the >= operators to >, and So, base on the overlap value, I can determine how many column should I add.
