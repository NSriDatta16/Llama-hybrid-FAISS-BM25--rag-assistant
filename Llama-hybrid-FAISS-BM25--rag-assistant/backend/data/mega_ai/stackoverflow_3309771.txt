I think setting the undo managers setGroupsByEvent: will do what you want. Sets a Boolean value that specifies whether the receiver automatically groups undo operations during the run loop. If YES, the receiver creates undo groups around each pass through the run loop; if NO it doesnâ€™t. A cleaner solution might be to simply not commit the objects position to the data model until the end of the drag event.
