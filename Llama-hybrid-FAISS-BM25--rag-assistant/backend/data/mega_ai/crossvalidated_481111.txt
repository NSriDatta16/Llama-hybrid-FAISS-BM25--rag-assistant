Does a z-test make sense here?

I have been assigned to collect data about the contents of an additive in wine. The additive is approved, but also fairly poisonous in the right amounts. The dataset consists of test results for +3000 bottles tapped between 1999 and 2019. All tests were performed in 2020. The number of bottles per year varies. We test bottles from a variety of producers, but not necessarily the same producers or wines every year. The additive was found in 41% of all bottles tested, but there is a lot of variance between years. We have observed the additive in between 35 % and maximum 46 % of the tested bottles per vintage. The values shift up and down between vintages, meaning that there is no growth or decline. The thing that had caught my customerâ€™s attention is that 2019 broke the record with the additive being present in 47.5% of all bottles. The customer has, upon receiving the results, performed various statistical tests. One of them is a two proportion Z test which confirms that the gap between 2019 and the average for the rest of the vintages is statistically significant. According to our client, this suggests that wine makers have increased the usage of the additive. I am however a bit skeptical about that conclusion. Although 2019 has the maximum value, we have observed a lot of variance between the previous years. To me it seems like a coincidence. What should I tell my client?
