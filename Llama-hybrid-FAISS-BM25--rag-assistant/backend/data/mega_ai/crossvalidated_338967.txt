How to deal with categorical features in machine learning models?

For instance I have a set of categories from a variable called 'category'. From python, here are my categories and their corresponding counts. Category_Others 1430 Application/Website 1345 Backups 900 Software/OS 800 Hardware/Virtual 700 Network 302 There are two options I am considering; however, I am not sure which one is more legit. I assign a value to each category as follows: Category_Others ---- 0 Application/Website ---- 1 Backups ---- 2 Software/OS ---- 3 Hardware/Virtual ---- 4 Network ---- 5 Or I introduce 5 new variables into my data frame. Then I end up with 5 more columns (i.e. columns with names of each category) i.e. on Python category = pd.get_dummies(incident['category'], drop_first=True)
