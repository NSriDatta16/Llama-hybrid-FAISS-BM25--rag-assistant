It was brought to my attention that webforms could be used inside of an MVC application. This gives the me the ability to use the Infagistics schedule components for a week/month/day views of a calendar inside of an MVC application, even though the infragistics components are not MVC compatible. Mixing webforms in an MVC solution is an ugly solution, but at this point looks better than the alternative of trying to write my own month/week/day view appointment calendar UI.
