Not sure if I get correctly where you want to embed it. But if PHP is a requirement, there is the option of using http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Server . It's rather minimalistic, but should thus be easily adaptable and have less issues with a HipHop transformation. The second alternative would be Nanoweb. While that's designed as a real webserver and feature-wise comparable to Apache, it's not suitable for embedding. But there are probably others, if you want to go that particular route.
