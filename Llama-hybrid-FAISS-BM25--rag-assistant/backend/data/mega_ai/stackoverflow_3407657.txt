For one argument optimizer will change that IN into =, in real execution statement. As both of this arguments are Sargeble (Joe Stefanelli thanks for attention); the difference in performance may by found where you have sequence value in in clause, for example IN (1,2,3,4,5,6) is slower that between 1 and 6 , because for the IN the index has to be read for each value in this case 6 time for between only once.
