The MCMC-MH algorithm requires the ratio of the PDFs at the proposal value $x'$ and the existing value $x_t$ . Let $K$ be the dimension of $X$ . We can approximate the ratio by looking at the ratio of probabilities that $X$ is in a neighbourhood of $x'$ or $x_t$ $$ \frac{f(x')}{f(x)} = \frac{\lim_{e \to 0}P[X \in x' \pm e]/e^K}{ \lim_{e \to 0}P[X \in x_t \pm e]/e^K} = \lim_{e \to 0} \frac{P[X \in x' \pm e]}{ P[X \in x_t \pm e]} \approx \frac{P[X \in x' \pm \epsilon]}{ P[X \in x_t \pm \epsilon]}, $$ where the approximation should hold for small $\epsilon$ . However it's not obvious how to use that approximation in log-space, which will likely be important given that both the numerator and the denominator will be very close to 0. In particular, $$ \log P[X \in x' \pm \epsilon] = \log\left(P[X
