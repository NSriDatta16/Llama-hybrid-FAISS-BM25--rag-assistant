I prefer not to use a prefix on interfaces: The prefix hurts readability. Using interfaces in clients is the standard best way to program, so interfaces names should be as short and pleasant as possible. Implementing classes should be uglier to discourage their use. When changing from an abstract class to an interface a coding convention with prefix I implies renaming all the occurrences of the class --- not good!
