HTTP error 403 just means Forbidden . The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. In other words, the server side decided based on the request-specific information that the requester isn't allowed to receive the response. That can have many causes: specific information is missing in request headers, the IP address is disallowed, the user agent is disallowed, etcetera. Your most honest bet would be contacting the admin of the website in question, asking for clarification and permission. You could also use a real webbrowser and track using a HTTP traffic tracker like Firebug or Fiddler2 to check the request/response details. Jsoup's HttpConnection class at least offers several methods to set headers, cookies and/or user agent whenever necessary.
