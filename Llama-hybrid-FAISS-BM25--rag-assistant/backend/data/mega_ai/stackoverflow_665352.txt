I am not sure I understand your question and the title is also confusing. Are you sure that the calculations run synchronously? Are you using Ajax calls? If yes, then the hide call will run before the calculations finish. Anyway, jQuery supports custom events, which you can create and programmatically trigger. Have a look at this link for example. This would be an elegant solution for your situation. Since you can also send parameters with the events, you could also easily update the status of the modal dialog.
