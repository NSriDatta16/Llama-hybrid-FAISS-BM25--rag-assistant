What are the pros and cons of transforming data to unit variance (just scaling by std) vs standardizing ? This is prior to use it PCA on stock returns

I am working with dataset of stock returns and plannig to use PCA. I need to decide on standardizing (centering the returns and then dividing by standard deviation) or simply dividing by std. The question is what are the pros and cons of both methods. Standardizing seems to be the default option, but by centering the data, I am getting rid of the "trend" on returns which I believe contains valuable information.
