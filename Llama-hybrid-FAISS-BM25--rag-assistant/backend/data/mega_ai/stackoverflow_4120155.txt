how to detect browser and OS in Java applet

I'm working on a complex Java applet which runs well in Safari and in various browsers on Windows and Linux but has problems on Macintosh in Chrome and Firefox. For debugging, it would be really helpful if Java code could detect and report the browser, the browser version, the OS, and the OS version when there are errors. What is the easiest and most reliable way for Java to detect that info? This looks good, but requires Apache log4j, and I don't know if I can convince the team to run that: http://code.google.com/p/user-agent-utils/ ' I guess Java could get the user-agent string via JavaScript, but I can't find any good example code that clearly shows how to do that.
