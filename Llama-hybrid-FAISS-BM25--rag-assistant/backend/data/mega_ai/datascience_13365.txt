You can check this whitepapers for time series prediction with KNIME. https://www.knime.org/files/knime_bigdata_energy_timeseries_whitepaper.pdf https://www.knime.org/files/Anomaly_Detection_Time_Series_final.pdf I am not sure though if you are trying to predict how many events will happen say in the next hour or just count how many events have happened per hour in the past. In this last case, just use a GroupBy node. Let me know if this helps -- Rosaria
