If this is something you're only going to do once, I'd do it this way: 1) ls the files into a new file: ls datadir > mytmp 2) edit the mytmp with your favorite editor. 2a delete any lines that aren't data files you care about, like "." and ".." 2b edit each line into a shell command to rename the file. I like emacs, and would build a keyboard macro to: clip the file name, insert "mv ", insert the filename, insert space, insert the filename again, edit the inserted filename into the desired format. 2c save 3) run sh Done! Not elegant, tedious if your editor doesn't support macros or similar functionality, but guaranteed to work and git-er-done.
