Where is the log file located when verbose history logging is turned on for SQL 2005 replication?

I keep getting the The merge process was unable to create a new generation at the 'Subscriber'. Troubleshoot by restarting the synchronization with verbose history logging and specify an output file to which to write. (Source: MSSQL_REPL, Error number: MSSQL_REPL-2147200994) Get help: http://help/MSSQL_REPL-2147200994 message. I went ahead and followed the advice and from the Replication monitor->Agent Profile I changed the profile to Verbose history. Now, where is this file located? There are not properties in Management studion to sepeify the location. Thank you.
