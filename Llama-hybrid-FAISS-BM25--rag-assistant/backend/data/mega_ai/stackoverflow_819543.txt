BindingSource relies on IBindingListView.Filter for this functionality. The behaviour depends entirely on the specific list implementation. Is this a DataTable / DataView ? If so, this maps to DataView.RowFilter , with syntax listed here . The DataView implementation has no regex support, but supports LIKE via * - i.e. where FilterText is something like "Foo*Bar*" . At least, that is my understanding. I'm still assuming that you are using DataTable / DataView ... a pragmatic alternative might be to introduce an extra (bool) column for the purpose. Set/clear that marker as the predicate (using a regex or any other complicated logic), and just use the row-filter to say "where set". Not very clean, maybe, but a lot simpler than implementing a custom data-view / binding-source. If you are using objects (rather than DataTable ), then another option might be the Dynamic LINQ Library . I don't know the full range of what it supports, but it ( Where(string) ) certainly has some / much of the RowFilter capability. And since the code is available in the sample project, it is possible you could educate it to apply a regex?
