Qt drag and drop animation

I have two QTreeViews side by side and I want to implement dragging one item from one table into the other table. What I would like to do however is that when the item to be dropped reaches the destination table, that the two rows sort of "make space for it" and separate to really show the user exactly where the item would be dropped. Could someone point me in the right direction as to how to do this as I have no idea really where to start. Thanks, Stephen
