If you are only looking for a projection for the year I would recommend this: Divide the sum you have for the current year * 365 so far in the data by days to date. That will give you a cheap sum. sum * 365 / total days to date Ideally you could figure out the ratio of revenue and you have a seasonal business: Last year to date / last year total = Last year percentage to date This year to date / Last year percentage to date : would project the average for the full year.
