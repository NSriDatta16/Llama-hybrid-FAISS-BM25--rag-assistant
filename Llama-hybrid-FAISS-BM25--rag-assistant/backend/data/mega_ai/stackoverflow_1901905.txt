Here is a good start for you to actually understand what the fuzzy lookup component does (Similar to the fuzzy grouping) : SSIS fuzzy lookup I actually used this at a client where I was receiving their client data that was fat fingered in by someone. I created a static lookup table based on company names: Lku Table (notice how these are the same at the beginning) Name | Lookup Output Name Microsoft | Microsoft JP Morgan Chase | JP Morgan Chase McDonalds | McDonalds I would receive data in a text file that looked like this: Typed Name Microsft JP Morgan McDons Using the fuzzy lookup, I would join on the Name column(dont forget this is case sensitive-user upper or lower to cast) to get the lookup ouput name. I set the similiarity threshold to about 80% (recommended percent or higher). I would then view my matchups via the data viewer which might look like this: Typed Name | Lookup Name | Confidence | Similarity Microsoft | Microsoft | 100% | 100% JP Morgan | JP Morgan Chase | 88% | 90% McDons | McDonalds | 60% | 50% Then based on a conditioal split, I loaded the ones with both a confidence and similiarity percent > 80% and less then Look Up Table Name | Lookup Output Name Microsoft | Microsoft JP Morgan Chase | JP Morgan Chase McDonalds | McDonalds JP Morgan | JP Morgan Chase Error Table Name | Proposed Name | Error message McDons | McDonalds | Confidence was 60% and Similarity was 50% Hope this helped.
