It really seems like a permissions issue. When you execute it manually it's running as your network account. When you execute it from a job it's running as NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE. Try changing your SQL Agent service account to run as you, i.e., your network account. Then let it execute the job running under your credentials (make sure you start and stop the service). This will verify if it is really a permissions issue.
