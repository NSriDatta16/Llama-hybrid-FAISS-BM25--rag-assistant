It's a compromise between your position and your friend's position, and each game will make a slightly different decision on this to achieve their desired trade-off. The server may try not to send more information than it needs to, eg. performing the distance check, but inevitably will send some information that can be exploited, such as sending the position of an enemy that is behind a rock, simply both because it is too expensive for the server to calculate the exact line of sight each time and also for the latency issue you mention. Typically you'll find that FPS games do tend to 'leak' more information than others because they are more concerned with a smooth game experience that requires a faster and more regular rate of updates. Additionally, unlike MMOs, an FPS player is usually at liberty to move to a different server if they're finding their game ruined by cheats.
