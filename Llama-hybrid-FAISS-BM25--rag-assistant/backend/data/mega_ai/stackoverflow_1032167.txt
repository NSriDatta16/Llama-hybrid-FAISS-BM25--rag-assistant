User Control Does not appear in ToolBox in VS2005

When I create a user control in VS2005, it does not appear in toolbox. My project has quite huge number of User Control so the workaround to drag/drop usercontrol dll to toolbox is not a possible solution. Can any one suggest how I can get rid of this VS2005 bug. Thank you.
