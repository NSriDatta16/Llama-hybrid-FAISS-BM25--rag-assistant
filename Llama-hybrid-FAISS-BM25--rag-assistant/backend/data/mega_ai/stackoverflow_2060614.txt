IKImageView and scroll bars

I'm trying to use the IKImageViewDemo provided by apple ( http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/samplecode/IKImageViewDemo/index.html ) and I'm trying to add scrollbars to it. I've tried two things: 1) embedding the IKImageView in a ScrollView. This had all sorts of weird effects, like the image was no longer located where it should have been, and the scrollbars seemed to be in a fixed place, no matter how big the window was (So I could shrink the window and lose the scrollbars, even though the scrollview was set to resize with the window) 2) I added [_imageView setHasHorizontalScrollers: YES] (and vertical) into the code in the openImageURL method. This appears to have done nothing. Am I missing something obvious? Additionally: Why does NSLog(@"scrollbar? H %d V %d hide %d", _imageView.hasHorizontalScroller, _imageView.hasVerticalScroller, _imageView.autohidesScrollers); _imageView.hasHorizontalScroller = YES; _imageView.hasVerticalScroller = YES; _imageView.autohidesScrollers = YES; NSLog(@"scrollbar? H %d V %d hide %d", _imageView.hasHorizontalScroller, _imageView.hasVerticalScroller, _imageView.autohidesScrollers); give me: scrollbar? H 0 V 0 hide 0 scrollbar? H 0 V 0 hide 0 ? Additionally additionally: Equivalently why does: BOOL b = _imageView.autohidesScrollers = YES; NSLog (@"b %d scrollers %d", b, _imageView.autohidesScrollers); print b 1 scrollers 0 ?
