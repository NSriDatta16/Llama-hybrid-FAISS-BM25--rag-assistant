Split a string into an array based on runs of contiguous characters

I've been searching for an answer to this in Ruby for a little while now and haven't found a good solution. What I am trying to figure out is how to split a string when the next character doesn't match the previous and pass the groupings into an array. ie. 'aaaabbbbzzxxxhhnnppp' becomes ['aaaa', 'bbbb', 'zz', 'xxx', 'hh', 'nn', 'ppp'] I know I could just iterate over each char in the string and check for a change but am curious if there's anything built-in that could tackle this in a elegant manner.
