Where is IIS Out-Of-Process in Windows Server 2008?

I've installed all the components of IIS 7 on a Windows Server 2008 box but I don't see IIS Out-Of-Process Pooled Applications in Component Services. How do I get it ? I have a .dll file that I want to drag it here. I have IIS 6 locally and it has IIS Out-Of-Process Pooled Applications under Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Component Services -> Computers -> My Computer -> COM+ Applications. But the same is missing in Windows Server 2008. Thanks, Nandagopal
