ARMA models and invertibility

I'm reading the book Time Series Models by Franses et al. It says that if we have an $ARMA(1,1)$ model with $\phi=1$ and $\theta=-1$ we have $y_t=\epsilon_t$. So, this means that in the equation $(1-L)y_t=(1-L)\epsilon_t$ we can cancel out $(1-L)$ in both sides. I'm wondering if this is a licit operation since having $\theta=-1$ means that the $MA$ model is not invertible.
