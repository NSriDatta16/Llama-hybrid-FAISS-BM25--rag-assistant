reading html from an inputstream java

I am reading a html file using an inputstream from a java servlet. But the contents of the original and the read one are in a different format although when displayed in a web browser they are the same. These are the two links for the html files after reading output http://www.fileflyer.com/view/gQREGAe orginal output http://www.fileflyer.com/view/mWXHVAE Is there a way to get the original html when reading? why is this happening? my java code is as follows; InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(inputStream); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr); String line = null; while ( (line = br.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line); } Any help would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you, rana.
