Neither is necessarily better than the other. A black box approach tends to be a user focused approach. So this is a good way to ensure the usability and correctness of an application from a user perspective. The drawback to testing from just a black box perspective is many of the code paths may remain unexercised. This is where white box testing comes into play. Using both together is frequently referred to as grey box testing and it allows you to build user focused scenarios as well as verify you are getting good code coverage as well as efficient use of your test cycles. A couple good resources for additional information include How We Test Software at Microsoft , Testing Computer Software .
