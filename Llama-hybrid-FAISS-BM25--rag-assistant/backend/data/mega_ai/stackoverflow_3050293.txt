Sorry, I don't have a solution for you, but I wanted to mention that the User Interface Guidelines specifically discourage implementing navigation controllers this way. In the iPhone universe, users are used to tapping the leftmost button on a navigation bar to take them to the previous view. With multiple back buttons, tapping the leftmost button takes the user back to the beginning. This may be a reason why this question hasn't been answered and may be a reason for the app no being approved.
