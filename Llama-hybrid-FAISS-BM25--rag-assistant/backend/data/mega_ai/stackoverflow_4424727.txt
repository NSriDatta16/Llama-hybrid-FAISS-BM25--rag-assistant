Efficient Way To Check 10,000s of Blog Feeds in Perl

We have 10,000s of blogs we want to check multiple times a day for new posts. I'd love some ideas with example code on the most efficient way to do this using Perl. Currently we are just using LWP::UserAgent to download each RSS feed and then checking each URL in the resulting feed against a MySQL database table of already found URLs one at a time. Needless to say this doesn't scale well and is super inefficient. Thanks in advance for your help & advice!
