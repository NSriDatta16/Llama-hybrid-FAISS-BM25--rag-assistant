Do you think that Principal component Analysis for Mixed Data is able to make a classification for groups?

In fact, I used Principal component Analysis for Mixed Data, for that I have used PCAmix in R as it is shown in this tutorial : I have some results as it is shown in page 13 But this result doesn't mean that I have any classification, for that I am asking If PCAmix is able to make classification? If it is not , how to make classification after using PCAmix please?
