Receive data from PostBack in JavaScript

I'm using jQuery to make postback then in my .ascx file I have code like this: Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance().add_endRequest(EndRequestHandler); function EndRequestHandler(sender, args) { if (args.get_error() == undefined) { var dataItems = args.get_dataItems(); alert(dataItems['ctl00_cphContent_articleList_tbUpdate']); } } Where on the Internet can I find specification of args object? What methods has it got? Second, why do I have to pass in my server side data into control using ScriptManager? Code on the server side is: ScriptManager.GetCurrent(this.Page).RegisterDataItem(tbUpdate, DateTime.Now.ToString()); and tbUpdate is the control on the site. Is there any more elegant way to get access to data sent back to the client side. Do I have to send this data to any control? What does it really mean that data is sent to control? How can I consume this data from that control? I had to use Firebug to find the id of the control and get access to it.
