Can a user be a member of multiple Organization Units (OU) in Active Directory?

Can a user be a member of multiple Organization Units (OU) in Active Directory? Also, is there a standard format mentioned by Microsoft on how an OU should be created and what its attributes are? I found this on Wikipedia : However, Organizational Units are just an abstraction for the administrator, and do not function as true containers; the underlying domain operates as if objects were all created in a simple flat-file structure, without any OUs. It is not possible for example to create two user accounts with an identical username in two separate OUs, such as "fred.staff-ou.domain" and "fred.student-ou.domain".
