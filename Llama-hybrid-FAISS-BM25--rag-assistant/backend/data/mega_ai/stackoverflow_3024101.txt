I haven't used SPSS macros very much, but maybe they can get you where you need to be? Check out this site for some examples: http://spsstools.net/Macros.htm Also, the SPSS Data Management book may be helpful as well. Lastly, if memory serves, I think the problem may even be the main example of how to leverage Python inside of SPSS syntax. I have only used Python and SPSS a few times, but it is very handy to have that language accessible if need be. HTH
