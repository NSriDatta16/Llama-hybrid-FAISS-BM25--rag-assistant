What is the continuous depth concept in Neural ODE paper by David Duvenaud?

I read the ever so celebrated - https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366 paper. I am still confused. Does the concept of continuous depth neural network correspond to the fact that the ODEint or the integrator block takes into account the value of the derivative to decide the step size and then performs an "integration"? Or does it refer to something else?
