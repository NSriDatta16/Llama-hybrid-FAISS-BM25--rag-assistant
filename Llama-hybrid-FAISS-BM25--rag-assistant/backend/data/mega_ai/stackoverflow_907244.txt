I'm not sure what your question is here. You seem to answer it yourself in the last paragraph - DWR site goes down, schema validation in Eclipse fails. Note that Eclipse (even with the Spring IDE plugin) doesn't use META-INF/spring.schemas to resolve the namespaces, that's done by the Eclipse platform. If the schema can't be found at the schema location, then you get these errors. As for the auto-complete, Eclipse will still provide this by inferring from existing structures in your document, if it can't find the schema. This isn't a problem in the application itself, since Spring will use the META-INF/spring.schemas file to resolve schemas from the JAR.
