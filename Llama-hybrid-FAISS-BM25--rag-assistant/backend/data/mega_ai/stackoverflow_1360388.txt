How do you map aggregate functions in NHibernate?

I'm new to NHibernate and trying to create my first mapping. I have created a class like this (my example is simplified): public class Buyer { public int BuyerID { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public decimal AverageOrderAmount { get; private set; } public DateTime LastOrderDate { get; private set; } } Normally, to get this data out of SQL Server, I would write a query using aggregate functions like this: select b.BuyerID, b.Name, avg(o.OrderTotal) as AverageOrderAmount, max(o.OrderDate) as LastOrderDate from Buyers b join Orders o on o.BuyerID = b.BuyerID where BuyerID=@BuyerID group by b.BuyerID, b.Name My question is, how do I communicate this in my mapping? Is this possible? I supposed I could store these calculated values in the Buyers cable and recalculate them as needed, but that doesn't feel right.
