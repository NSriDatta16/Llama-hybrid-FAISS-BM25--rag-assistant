Is there such thing as a case-weighted PCA?

Say I have 300 samples from a population containing two groups, A and B, and data for several variables. I have 150 from Group A and 150 from Group B. However, I know that Group A makes up roughly 20% of the population and group B makes up 80% and the two groups differ on the variables in question. Is there a way to weight the PCA by cases to make it more representative of the population? Would it be enough to just to do a weighted standardization?
