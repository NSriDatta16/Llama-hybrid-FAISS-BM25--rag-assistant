You can grab the value you are looking for like this: // using seo as an example. look at the path field on core_config_data $value = Mage::getStoreConfig("web/seo/use_rewrites"); Put this in a template that will echo your code: magento_config = {} magento_config['seo_value'] = " "; // ... add more ... Add that template to your layout and you will now have a global JS object called magento_config that you can use to grab your values. Depending on where you put your template, you may have to wait for the page to load before your variables are available. Make sure not to echo these values indiscriminately, as there may be security implications in echoing store config data to the frontend. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
