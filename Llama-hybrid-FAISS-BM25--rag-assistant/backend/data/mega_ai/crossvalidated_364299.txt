If the labeled and unlabeled data are from the same distribution (i.e. generated by the same process) then you should use both for training PCA, as you'll get a better estimate of the covariance matrix. But, if using PCA for dimensionality reduction, keep in mind that it's unsupervised. So, the directions of greatest variance in the input may or may not coincide with the most informative directions for your classification problem.
