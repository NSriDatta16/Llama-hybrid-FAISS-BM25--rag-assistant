Client data cache in isolated storage - asp.net - jquery - ajax - silverlight

I have a couple of customer websites that have been in use for 4+ years. One of the pages on both sites contain drop downs that now contain 3000+ items. I have attempted initial solutions to this problem by adding new pages to both sites where one site is using silverlight and the other is using ajax. The silverlight page currently performs better than the ajax page once the control has loaded but requires the user to have silverlight or the permissions to install it. The ajax version has issues that it sends the still requires an initial download of all of the data to complete the drop downs when the site is first loaded. The ajax version still uses view state and sends 400k+ to the server on every request. What I would like to do is use the ajax version but cache the drop down data on the client and only download the data once a day. If I save the data using asp.net to isolated storage (I have that part sorted) is it possible to access it using client side code such as jquery?
