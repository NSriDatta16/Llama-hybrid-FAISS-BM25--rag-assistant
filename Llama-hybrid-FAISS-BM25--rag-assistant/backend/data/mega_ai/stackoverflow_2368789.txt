Java and C# allocate memory in much different fashion that C++ does. In fact, in .NET for sure all the arrays of AoA will be close together if they are allocated one after another because memory there is just one continuous chunk without any fragmentation whatsoever. But it is still true for C++ and still makes sense if you want maximum speed. Although you shouldn't follow that advise every time you want multidimensional array, you should write maintainable code first and then profile it if it is slow, premature optimization is root for all evil in this world.
