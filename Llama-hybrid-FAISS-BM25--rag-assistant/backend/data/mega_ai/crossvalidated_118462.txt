Simply adding your age term is equivalent to holding age constant. Let's say you are looking at $\beta_1$, the coefficient on $X_1$. It would be interpreted as "On average, all else equal , a unit increase in $X_1$ is associated with an increase of $\beta_1$ in $Y$." You could also add an interaction term. Let age be denoted by $X_2$. If you include the term $X_1X_2$ in your regression equation, then the coefficient on $X_1X_2$ is telling you, on average, how much the slope $\beta_1$ (the coefficient on $X_1$) increases per unit increase in age. If the coefficient on $X_1X_2$ is not significantly different from 0, then there isn't enough evidence to say that the effect of $X_1$ on $Y$ varies with age. Note: if you add in $X_1X_2$, be sure to have $X_1$ and $X_2$ in your model. You could plot the residuals of your model against age - if you see an increase or decrease in variance associated with age, then you have non-constant error variance, and the assumptions of your regression model are violated.
