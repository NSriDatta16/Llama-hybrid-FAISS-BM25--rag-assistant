The most elegant solution for your loop would be an enhanced for loop (java 5 or newer): List list = myObject.getList(); for( BusinessObject myBo : list ) { process(myBo); } But even with the code you provided there will be no performance problem, because all the temporary variables only hold references to the BusinessObject , which is very cheap.
