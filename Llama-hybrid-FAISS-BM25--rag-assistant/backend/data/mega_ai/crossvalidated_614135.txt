This question only matters if the design is actually panel data. It's no different from logistic regression on panel data in this respect as well. In short, you can absolutely fit fixed effects to panel data in a probit model. The main objective of the data modeling strategy is that the response data are mutually conditionally independent so that the standard statistical inferential approaches are accurate. Random effects are only one way of achieving number 2. Fixed effects do not necessarily mean that you adjust for a dummy variable for each subject in an analysis. You may, for instance, adjust for predictive effects - such as age, income, employment status, health history, etc. etc. A "random effect" is nothing more than a sum of all the unobserved patient-level variables. If the panel data contain clusters that are large enough and contain enough variability, you can still adjust for individual level fixed effects. The problem of course is that for a large number of sparse clusters, these fixed effect terms become unstable and it's desirable to employ an estimator with shrinkage properties, either REML GLMM (your random effect) or even a Ridge estimator (penalized regression with L2 penalty).
