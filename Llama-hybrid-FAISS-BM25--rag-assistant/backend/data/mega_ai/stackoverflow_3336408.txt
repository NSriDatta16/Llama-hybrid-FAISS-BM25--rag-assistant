How to understand everything regarding a Simple Program creation?

I have referred quite a few books on C, C++, etc. in fact i have even read the Dragon book on Compilers. But my basic doubt remains, is there any link or book i can read which explains a simple C program creating from writing source code in a Editor to Compilation to Linking? Would appreciate an internet link is provided.
