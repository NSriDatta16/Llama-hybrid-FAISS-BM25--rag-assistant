Dump objects build with Clay in C#

Is any way to dump objects to console / logfile build with ClaySharp in C#? Clay is a dynamic C# type that will enable you to sculpt objects of any shape just as easily as in JavaScript or other dynamic languages. Project Link Ex object build with Clay: // Build a Clay object dynamic New = new ClayFactory(); dynamic directory = New.Array( New.Person( FirstName: "Louis", LastName: "Dejardin", Aliases: new[] { "Lou" } ), New.Person( FirstName: "Bertrand", LastName: "Le Roy" ).Aliases("bleroy", "boudin"), New.Person( FirstName: "Renaud", LastName: "Paquay" ).Aliases("Your Scruminess", "Chef") ).Name("Some Orchard folks");
