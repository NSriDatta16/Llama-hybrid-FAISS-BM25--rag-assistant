I see no issue with scaling the MAE by the mean of non-zeros. It amounts to expressing the MAE as a percentage of the mean of non-zero demands (or whatever you are measuring), whereas dividing the MAE by the overall mean expresses it as a percentage of that. It's just a question of interpretation, and of making errors for different series comparable, and of what interpretation you are most comfortable with. I hope you are aware that the MAE (or any scaled multiple of the MAE, whether scaled by the overall mean or by the mean of non-zeros, or by the in-sample random walk MAE as for the MASE) can be heavily misleading as a forecast accuracy measure for intermittent time series. Specifically, the smallest MAE (or multiple thereof) will probably be achieved by a flat zero forecast, which is usually not very useful. See Kolassa ( 2016 and 2020 , both in the International Journal of Forecasting ).
