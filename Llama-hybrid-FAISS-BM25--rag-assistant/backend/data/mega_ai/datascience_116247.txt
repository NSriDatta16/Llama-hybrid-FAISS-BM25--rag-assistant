I see you are more concentrated on trying to hyper optimize the model than actually looking into and solving the real problem here, which in my opinion is the data. It's almost always the data. My solution would be to try and get more samples in a synthetic or non-synthetic way. Have you tried implementing any over-sampling techniques such as SMOTE or ADASYN and then running XGBoost?
