Are you using Sql Server 2008? If so, you could leverage the full-text search features built right into it. Then it would be as simple as passing the user's (sanitized) input into a sql query. For example, here's a query that would search the Author, Title and PostContent fields for the user's inputted text. SELECT Author, Title FROM Posts WHERE CONTAINS((Author, Title, PostContent), @userInput); SQL Server 2008 supports different search methods too , like simple token, weighted word values, synonym, proximity and prefix searches... it's pretty awesome.
