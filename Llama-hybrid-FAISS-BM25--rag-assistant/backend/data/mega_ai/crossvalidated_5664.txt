Is there a name for 10% best individual grades?

I'm a complete newbie to statistics (although I find it really interesting!), and I have taken the task of distributing feedback to speakers of a conference I'm co-organizing. Each speaker was given a grade on the scale 1-5 from the participants, and we combine feedback from all participants into a mean score, for instance 3.56. We can then order the speakers by mean score. In addition to giving the speakers their mean score, we also want to give them a clue about how they did compared to the other speakers. To avoid discouraging the speakers who did the worst (we want people to try again!), we came up with giving back a more fuzzy metric. We want to divide the speakers into four groups: 10% best/20%/30%/40% worst. Does there exist a name for this? EDIT : I'll try an example. If I have ten talks with scores of { 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.4, 2.7, 3.0, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.5}, I would divide them up like this: 10% best: 4.5 20% "next best": 4.2, 4.1 30% "next worst": 3.2, 3.0, 2.7 40% worst: 2.4, 2.1, 1.3, 1.2 What I want to know is if there is a name for these ranges.
