re: moving to sdcard and losing the widget http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/install-location.html#ShouldNot "... you should not allow your application to be installed on the external storage if it uses any of the following features ... App Widgets ..." ie, it's a known and documented limiation. re: ldpi, not sure if it will solve it for you, but if in uses-sdk you set minSdkVersion to whatever is appropriate and set targetSdkVersion to something high (eg 11 stating honeycomb compat), then you don't need supports-screens as targetSdkVersion effectivly implies / sets defaults for all sizes supported by targetSdkVersion.
