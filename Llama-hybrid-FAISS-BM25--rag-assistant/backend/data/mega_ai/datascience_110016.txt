Orange's Results are not reproducible

I've been watching a few training videos from Orange here and attempted to reproduce the process. They used iris dataset for classification task. When I compared my confusion matrix to theirs, I didn't get the same results. Is this a problem with Orange software or with sklearn (I know they somehow leverage sklearn)? When you run a code again 6 years later, you get different results, even though the dataset is the same...
