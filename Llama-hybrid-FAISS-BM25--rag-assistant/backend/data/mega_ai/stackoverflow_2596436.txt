Is there a Silverlight week picker control?

We have a report that compares data between weeks, and it seems like this is the exception and not the rule in the reporting world. I'm looking for an elegant way of selecting "a week" in a Silverlight control. I'd prefer not to spend the time building it ourselves, so it would be nice if I could buy a well polished control that does this. Sure, I could use a drop down list, but I would like a way to easily navigate through potentially years worth of weeks. Any existing controls out there? Any clever ways of using basic controls to achieve our goal? Thank you!
