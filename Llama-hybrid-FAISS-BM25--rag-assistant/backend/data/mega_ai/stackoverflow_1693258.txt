The difference is that it is isolating the use of the method from the implementation of it. If the implementation of the property were to change -- say to keep the birthdate and then calculate age based on the difference in time between now and the birthdate -- then the code depending on the method doesn't need to change. If it used the property directly, then the change would need to propagate to other areas of the code. In this sense, using the property directly is more fragile than using the class-provided interface to it.
