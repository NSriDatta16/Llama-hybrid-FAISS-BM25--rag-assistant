Here is a figure that shows your problem on two scales: at left is the original scale in terms of pounds; at right is the standard of z-scale often used in testing. To begin, let's look at your problem in terms of the fixed significance level $\alpha = 0.01 = 1\%.$ In the right-hand panel, your $Z$ -score is shown at the heavy vertical bar at $-2.67.$ The "critical value" for a test at the 1% level is shown by the vertical dotted line at $-2.326,$ which cuts 1% of the probability from the lower tail of the standard normal distribution. Because the $Z$ -score is to the left of the critical value, one rejects the null hypothesis at level $\alpha = 1\%.$ The P-value is the probability under the standard normal curve to the left of the heavy blue line. That area is smaller than $1\%,$ so in terms of P-values, we reject $H_0$ when the P-value is smaller than $1\%.$ You can see that the left-hand plot is the same as the right-hand plot, except for scale. It is not possible to make a printed normal table for all possible normal distributions. By converting to $Z$ -scores we can always use a single printed table for the 'standard' normal distribution, which has mean 0 and standard deviation 1. If we were going to do this production-monitoring procedure repeatedly with $n = 36$ observations each time, then we could find the critical value on the 'pound' scale; it is at 2.581 pounds. (That's because $(2.581 - 3)/.18 = -2.236,$ where the $0.18$ is the standard error.) Then we could turn the testing job over to a non-statistician, with instructions: "If the average weight for 36 cans is less than 2.581 pounds, let me know because we aren't putting enough stuff in our cans." (Or if we can't even trust the non-statistician with averages, the criterion might be a total weight less than 92.92 pounds.)
