A simple approach The Pareto distribution may be used as a decent first-order approximation for the distribution of the upper tails of income distributions. Henson (1967) provides one such application (among other things) in the estimation of the mean of the truncated upper tail: $$\overline{X} = X - \left(\frac{V}{V-1}\right)$$ Where: $\overline{X}$ is the mean of the truncated upper tail. $X$ is the lower-limit of the truncated (open) income interval. $V = \frac{c-d}{b-a}$ $a$ is the natural log of the lower limit of the preceding (closed) income interval $b=\ln (X)$ $c$ is the natural log of the sum of the frequencies of both the top (open) interval, and the (closed) interval below it. $d$ is the log of the frequency of the top (open) interval. A little more sophistication If you happen to have educational attainment data (specifically eighth grade or less, some high school, high school graduate, some college, college graduate, and post graduate), Angle (2004) developed an estimator for truncated right tails of income distributions (specifically in the context of the US Census' Current Population Survey) which is tailor-made for your purposes. As Angle writes: The Salamander was devised as a solution to the problem of inferring the difference between the Gini concentration ratios of nonmetropolitan (nonmetro) annual wage and salary incomes and metro ones. The Salamander estimator of the mean income in the top (open) income interval is: $$\overline{X}_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^{I}w_{it}M_{it}\left[\frac{(1- \omega_{i})}{\left(1 - \frac{4}{3}\omega_{i}\right)}\right]$$ Where: $X$ is the lower-limit of the truncated (open) income interval. $\omega_{i}$ is a parameter of Angle's (2002) inequality process (the theoretical loss from a loser won by a winner in a competitive economic encounter) linked specifically to educational attainment—Angle's 2004 paper provides estimates for each of these in a table on page 10. $w_{it}$ is the proportion of the population at level $i$ of educational attainment at time $t$ . $M_{it} \approx \frac{3\alpha_{i} - 1}{3\lambda_{it}}$ is the median of a $\Gamma$ PDF. $\alpha_{it} \approx \frac{1-\omega_{i}}{\omega_{i}}$ is the shape parameter of the income distribution for educational attainment $i$ at time $t$ . $\lambda_{it} \approx \frac{(1-\omega_{i})\sum_{i=1}^{I}\frac{w_{it}}{\omega_{i}}}{\overline{x}_{t}}$ is the scale parameter of the income distribution for educational attainment $i$ at time $t$ . Unfortunately: $\lambda_{it}$ cannot be estimated unless an estimate of $\overline{x}_{t}$ is available. However, Angle (2004) is optimistic that $\overline{x}_{t}$ can be estimated, but goes into more detail than I wish to transcribe here. References Angle, J. (2004).
