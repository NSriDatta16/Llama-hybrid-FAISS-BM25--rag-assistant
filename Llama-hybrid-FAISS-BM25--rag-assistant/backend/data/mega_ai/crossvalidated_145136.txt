Kernel SVM overfitting after training set extension

I am training Kernel SVM from sklearn package for binary classification problem. I perform a gridsearch for parameters optimization. Parameters are taken from following ranges: 'C':[1., 10., 100.], 'gamma':[1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3]. With larger training set (180k vs 90k samples) I have more overfitting. Is it possible? What could cause that effect?
