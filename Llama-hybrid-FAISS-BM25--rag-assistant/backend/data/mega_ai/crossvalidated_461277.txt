Under some assumptions, AIC is an optimal model selection criterion. It strikes an optimal balance between goodness of fit and model complexity. Under these assumptions, it does not make sense to choose a model with a higher AIC value, even if the difference between the AIC values of the models under consideration is (very) small. However, when the difference is small, you would also expect a small difference in performance. If you have to choose a single model, you would still go with the one that minimizes the AIC. But if you have an option to choose more than one model and do some sort of model averaging, a small difference between the best models would suggest both of them deserve to be part of the model combination. (It is commonly observed in forecasting that model combinations do well relative to the individual models.)
