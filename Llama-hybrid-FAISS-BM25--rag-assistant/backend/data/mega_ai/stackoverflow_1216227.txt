Looking for a JS library to move text

I'm looking for a javascript library that will allow me to drag text over an image with some resize handles that will automatically wrap the text. I've tried doing some searches but don't think I'm using the right search terms. I'm hoping someone has come accross simliar functionality before. Thanks :)
