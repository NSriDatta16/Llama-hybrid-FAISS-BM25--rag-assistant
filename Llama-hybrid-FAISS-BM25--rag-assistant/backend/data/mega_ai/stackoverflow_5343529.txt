I think you're probably overthinking this a little bit. While there is probably a very elegant design pattern for this that uses eight classes and four interfaces, I think the simplest route forward would be to make it a normal, mutable class. Think about your intention: you want a Model that can be loaded from external data (perhaps a static method returning a Model instance) with parameters that can change according to user input. This seems like a use case for your everyday, garden variety Class. You may also choose to separate your classes into a Data class and Strategy class, the second which contains the changeable parameters and uses something like a Strategy pattern to calculate the results.
