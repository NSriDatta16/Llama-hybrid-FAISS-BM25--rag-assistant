The average height of Binary Trees is Theta(sqrt(n)). This has been shown (or referenced, not very sure) in the following paper: http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/arch/extreme.heights.pdf . But perhaps you are more interested in the average depth of a random node and this is Theta(log n), as can be seen here: http://www.toves.org/books/data/ch05-trees/index.html (Section 5.2.4).
