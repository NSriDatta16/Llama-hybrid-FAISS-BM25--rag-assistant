The procedure you are describing is a feature selection procedure (see other threads tagged as feature-selection ) and has nothing to do with Bayesian approach. Bayesian approach is not about "reallocating of credibility". The main points about Bayesian approach are explicitly defining models in probabilistic terms, treating parameters as random variables, and using priors to include your out-of-data knowledge about parameters into the model (including so-called "uninformative" priors ). I can't see any of them in your description. See also the Who Are The Bayesians? and What exactly is a Bayesian model? threads.
