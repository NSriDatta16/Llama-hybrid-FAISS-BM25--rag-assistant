Refactoring PHP code that outputs csv with formulas

I have some PHP code that is designed to make a spreadsheet with formulas already in it to sum some columns. It seems there should be a much more elegant way to do this than the code below. What are some refactorings or design patterns that could accomplish something like the code below better?
