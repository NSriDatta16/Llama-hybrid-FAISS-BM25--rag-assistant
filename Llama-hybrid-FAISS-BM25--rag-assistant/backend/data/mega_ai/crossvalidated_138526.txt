What is probably meant is a "univariate" time series model (e.g. ARIMA or exponential smoothing). A univariate model only looks at the variable in question and usually tries to estimate some kind of auto-regression, trend, and seasonality in the time series. Contrast this with a "multivariate" time series model that takes into account external factors. For example, pretend you're trying to forecast electricity usage for a large utility. You have a historic dataset of electric usage (in megawatt hours) for each month for the past several years. You might build a simple univariate model by predicting that load this month will be the same as load last month (this is known as a "naive" model). You might improve this model by averaging usage for each month and forecasting each future month to be it's historic mean (this is known as a "seasonally naive" model). These models are known as "univariate" models because they only take into account a single variable: historic electric usage data. Now lets pretend you're getting a little more creative, and you realize that on hot days people use a lot more electricity (to run air conditioners). You add a second variable to your model: average monthly temperature, and build a regression where electricity load is a function of what month it is and how hot it is. Since this model takes into account 2 variables, it is a "multivariate" time series model. Finally, one small problem with multivariate models is that you need to forecast each of the component variables (e.g. temperature) before forecasting. This is why univariate models remain useful.
