Resource names have to be proper Java identifiers. Call them card1 through card52 instead of just their numbers (if I understand you correctly). EDITED TO ADD: To map an integer to the correct image, your code should manage the mapping itself. One (not terribly elegant) way is to explicitly create a Bitmap[] cardImages = new Bitmap[52]; array and assigning each resource into the array, as in e.g. Resources r = context.getResources(); cardImages[0] = loadBitmap(r.getDrawable(R.drawable.card1)); // ... cardImages[12] = loadBitmap(r.getDrawable(R.drawable.card13)); // ... cardImages[51] = loadBitmap(r.getDrawable(R.drawable.card52));
