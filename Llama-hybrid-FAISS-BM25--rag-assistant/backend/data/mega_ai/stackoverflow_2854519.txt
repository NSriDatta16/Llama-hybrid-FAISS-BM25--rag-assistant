More elegant way to write a multi-dimensional array of characters in ruby?

I am trying to make a multi-dimensional array of characters in ruby, and this works, but is there a more elegant way? def initialize(text) @map = Array.new i = 0 text.split("\n").each do |x| @map[i] = x.scan(/./) i += 1 end #@map = text end#constructor
