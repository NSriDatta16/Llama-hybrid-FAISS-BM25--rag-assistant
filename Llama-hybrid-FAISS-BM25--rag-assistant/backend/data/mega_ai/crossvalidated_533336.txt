how to select random effects in a GLMM?

I have data from a group of subjects (n=7) performing a two-alternative forced-choice task, where they can respond left or right. The number of trials depends on the subject in the range of 1000 to 2000 trials per subject. I want to model the response as a logistic regression depending on several variables: y ~ a 0 + a 1 x 1 + a 2 x 2 + a 3 x 3 So far my approach was to fit a glm for each subject and then calculate a 1 , a 2 , a 3 as the mean of the values obtained. I think this approach is correct if the number of trials for each subject is large enough so the values that I obtain for each subject are accurate. The value of a0 (bias left-right) was very idiosyncratic for each subject, but I am not really interested in it. The values of a 1 , a 2 , a 3 are similar for all the subjects although they have certain variability across subjects. I am interested in the mean values for the population of these sensitivities. Now I am performing more experiments where I won't have so many trials for each subject. I won't be able to use the previous approach, I think I should fit a generalized mixed model using the subjects as random effects. But I don't know how to select the random effects, Is ok to fit a glmm just adding random effects for the intercept? + (1 | subject) Or should I include random effects for all the slopes? + (1 | subject) + (a1 | subject) + (a2 | subject) + (a3 | subject)
