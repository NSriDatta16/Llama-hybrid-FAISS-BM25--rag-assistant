Is this the right way to restyle an ExtJS application?

I have a web application in ExtJS and used the Gray Theme . Now I want to adapt it to a specific layout design, e.g. I want to change the color and add a graphic behind the word "Application". I've been reading information on how to edit ExtJS Themes but it's not the core components that I want to change but specific areas on the screen, e.g. this page header. So the way I'm going about this is looking at the HTML output in Firebug: and then in an extra CSS file styling the tags that I think are going to effect my style change, e.g. .x-panel-body-noheader { background-color: #307E7E; } which for the most part works but this but this seems to be very hit-and-miss , e.g. in some places the only way I can style the area I need is to use the seemingly arbitrary element id , e.g. div#ext-comp-1003 { background-color: #307E7A; } This seems very fragile, as if these id numbers might change in the future etc. Is this the correct way to go about styling an ExtJS application or is there a more appropriate way?
