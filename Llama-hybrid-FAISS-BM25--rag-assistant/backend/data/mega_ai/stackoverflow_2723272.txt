Salesforce: Launch S-Control in a new window from VisualForce

I'm writing a VisualForce page to replace an old legacy S-Control. Originally the Custom S-Control was launched from a Custom Button, and it opened in a new browser window (The S-Control is type HTML, and the Custom Button has Behavior: Display in new window) For certain old records, I want to do a similar thing from VisualForce. So: Do HTML S-Controls have a URL that I can launch using a link? In which case, how do I figure out the URL? Or: Is there a way of embedding 'Custom Buttons' (that is, the buttons defined in "Setup->Customise->Account->Buttons and Links") into VisualForce pages? If so, I can embed the existing button that knows how to open the S-Control Or: Can you suggest some other way of doing this? Key features: Open an S-Control in a new window from VisualForce. Thanks
