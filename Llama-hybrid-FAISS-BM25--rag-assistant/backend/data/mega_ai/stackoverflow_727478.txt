If the app is a typical two-tier job, logging to the database with AdoNetAppender is probably appropriate. AdoNetAppender batches up log messages in chunks of up to 100, though you'll probably want to configure it to write through on at least WARN severity events. You may also want to consider logging to the All Users Application Data directory, although this may make it equally unwieldy to retrieve logs. Perhaps consider adding a shortcut somewhere? Finally, if log accessibility issues are a common theme in your organization, you may want to consider a log collection app such as Splunk .
