Computing elasticity of log-transformed variable in probit model

I would like to estimate the own-and cross-price elasticities of demand of a health product. Consider following model: $Product_{ij}=\beta_0+\beta_1ln(priceA)_j+\beta_2ln(priceB)_j+\beta_3Insurance_{ij}+X\beta+\epsilon_i+\nu_j$ Where: The indices $i$ and $j$ represent the individual and village, respectively $Product$ is a binary variable which takes on the value of 1 if the respondent chose Product B and 0 if the person chose Product A $ln(priceA)$ is the average price of Product A in the village $ln(priceB)$ is the average price of Product B in the village, and $Insurance$ is a binary variable indicating whether the person has health insurance coverage (1) or otherwise (0) I fitted a probit model because the outcome variable is binary. I am unsure how to calculate the elasticity. Given that the prices of products A and B are both entered in the model with the log transformation, would I calculate the elasticity (EY/EX) of the log-transformed variable or a semi-elasticity (EY/DX)?
