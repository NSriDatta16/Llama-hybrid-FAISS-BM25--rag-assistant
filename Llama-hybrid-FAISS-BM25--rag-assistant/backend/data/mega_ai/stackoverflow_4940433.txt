You need to access the scope for this relationship in order to be able to properly construct these objects. This is available to a class method: class Redirect I've taken the liberty of DRYing up your creation code because you had a lot of duplication in there. Also note that calling find only to exercise a relationship is a waste of resources. If you know the ID of the record, simply pass that along as an attribute unless you have a very good reason for retrieving it first. The scoped.scope_for_create call returns attributes defined by your current scope or scopes. These are usually in the form of something like { 'website_id' => 101 } and can be passed through to your create call.
