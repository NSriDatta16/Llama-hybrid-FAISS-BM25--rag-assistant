How do you test if the average of a population is the same as the variance of the same population?

What can be a statistical test to find out if a population has the mean equal to its own variance? I.e. Mean(X)=Var(X)? I am interested in it because Poisson regression makes the assumption that the mean of the predicted variable is the same as the variance of the predicted variable, i.e. lambda = E(Y) = Var(Y) where lambda is the parameter for the Poisson distribution for Y.
