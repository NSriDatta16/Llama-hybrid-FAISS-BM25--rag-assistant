When Bayesian estimator coincides with MLE

Assume that $\theta$ is an unknown parameter with prior belief $p(\theta)$ and that $X_1,...,X_n$ is an iid sample from $p(x|\theta)$ . What does it say about our prior distribution $p(\theta)$ when the Bayesian estimator $E[\theta|X=x]$ coincides with the maximum likelihood estimator $\hat{\theta}$ ? My professor posed this question in his notes and I don't know the answer. Edit: The question was posed following an example where the prior distribution was improper, but not uniform.
