c(B)=1-\prod _{i=1}^{n}(1-y_{i})} . Standard MI assumption is asymmetric, which means that if the positive and negative labels are reversed, the assumption has a different meaning. Because of that, when we use this assumption, we need to be clear which label should be the positive one. The standard assumption might be viewed as too strict, and therefore in the recent years, researchers tried to relax that position, which gave rise to other more loose assumptions. The reason for this is the belief that standard MIL assumption is appropriate for the Musk dataset, but since MIL can be applied to numerous other problems, some different assumptions could probably be more appropriate. Guided by that idea, Weidmann formulated a hierarchy of generalized instance-based assumptions for MIL. It consists of the standard MI assumption and three types of generalized MI assumptions, each more general than the last, in the sense that the former can be obtained as a specific choice of parameters of the latter, standard ⊂ {\displaystyle \subset } presence-based ⊂ {\displaystyle \subset } threshold-based ⊂ {\displaystyle \subset } count-based, with the count-based assumption being the most general and the standard assumption being the least general. (Note however, that any bag meeting the count-based assumption meets the threshold-based assumption which in turn meets the presence-based assumption which, again in turn, meet the standard assumption. In that sense it is also correct to state that the standard assumption is the weakest, hence most general, and the count-based assumption is the strongest, hence least general.) One would expect an algorithm which performs well under one of these assumptions to perform at least as well under the less general assumptions. Presence-, threshold-, and count-based assumptions The presence-based assumption is a generalization of the standard assumption, wherein a bag must contain all instances that belong to a set of required instance-level concepts in order to be labeled positive. Formally, let C R ⊆ X × Y {\displaystyle C_{R}\subseteq {\mathcal {X}}\times {\mathcal {Y}}} be the set of required instance-level concepts, and let # ( B , c i ) {\displaystyle \#(B,c_{i})} denote the number of times the instance-level concept c i {\displaystyle c_{i}} occurs in the bag B {\displaystyle B} . Then c ( B ) = 1 ⇔ # ( B , c i ) ≥ 1 {\displaystyle c(B)=1\Leftrightarrow \#(B,c_{i})\geq 1} for all c i ∈ C R {\displaystyle c_{i}\in C_{R}} . Note that, by taking C R {\displaystyle C_{R}} to contain only one instance-level concept, the presence-based assumption reduces to the standard assumption. A further generalization comes with the threshold-based assumption, where each required instance-level concept must occur not only once in a bag, but some minimum (threshold) number of times in order for the bag to be labeled positive. With the notation above, to each required instance-level concept c i ∈ C R {\displaystyle c_{i}\in C_{R}} is associated a threshold l i ∈ N {\displaystyle l_{i}\in \mathbb {N} } . For a bag B {\displaystyle B} , c ( B ) = 1 ⇔ # ( B , c i ) ≥ l i {\displaystyle c(B)=1\Leftrightarrow \#(B,c_{i})\geq l_{i}} for all c i ∈ C R {\displaystyle c_{i}\in C_{R}} . The count-based assumption is a final generalization which enforces both lower and upper bounds for the number of times a required concept can occur in a positively labeled bag. Each required instance-level concept c i ∈ C R {\displaystyle c_{i}\in C_{R}} has a lower threshold l i ∈ N {\displaystyle l_{i}\in \mathbb {N} } and upper threshold u i ∈ N {\displaystyle u_{i}\in \mathbb {N} } with l i ≤ u i {\displaystyle l_{i}\leq u_{i}} . A bag B {\displaystyle B} is labeled according to c ( B ) = 1 ⇔ l i ≤ # ( B , c i ) ≤ u i {\displaystyle c(B)=1\Leftrightarrow l_{i}\leq \#(B,c_{i})\leq u_{i}} for all c i ∈ C R {\displaystyle c_{i}\in C_{R}} .
