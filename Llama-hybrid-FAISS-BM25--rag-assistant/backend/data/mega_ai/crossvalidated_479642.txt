If you get zero error in any machine learning problem, it means you are overfitting. Getting a zero error means your model has figured out the true function which cannot happen as there will always be indeterministic noise present even if you have zero bias and variance which is a highly improbable scenario. This is all part of machine learning theory and how generalization happens. In short, your model hypothesis will always approximate the true function which is always unknown in machine learning and hence cannot achieve 100% results.
