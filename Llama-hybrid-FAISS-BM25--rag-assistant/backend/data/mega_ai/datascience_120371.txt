Why is cycle consistency loss alone not sufficient to produce meaningful output?

Imagine an adaptation of CycleGAN, in which the discriminators were removed in lieu of using only cycle consistency loss. Well, it turns out that the original authors of Cycle Consistent Adversarial Networks attempted this in their paper (figure 7, leftmost generation), and the result was not impressive. I am left wondering; why is that? Cycle consistency loss requires the output of one generator (G1) to be processed by another generator (G2), and is calculated by computing the difference between this final generated content and the input to G1 (and vice versa). Therefore, it seems that cycle consistency loss alone should be sufficient to enforce the output of both generators to produce output in the desired domain. Then, why is it necessary for CycleGANs to incorporate discriminators' loss additional to cycle consistency loss? I understand why it is necessary in regular GANs, considering they do not encompass a second generator with which cycle consistency loss can be calculated. TL;DR: Why do CycleGANs rely on discriminators given that cycle consistency loss alone should - seemingly - be sufficient to enforce meaningful/plausible output?
