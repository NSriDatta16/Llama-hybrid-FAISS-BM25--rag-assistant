You'll probably want to stress-test the memory usage and general performance of various browsers when storing many 300kb strings. You can monitor them in task manager, and also use performance tools like Speed Tracer and dynatrace ajax edition . If it turns out that caching is a performance win but it starts to get bogged down when you have too many strings in memory, you might think of trying HTML5 storage or Flash storage to store the strings--that way you can cache things across sessions as well. Dojo storage is a good library for this.
