UIButton doesn't appear on UIToolbar

I have a UIToolbar where I have dragged a UIButton. When I set the button properties to Custom, and assign an image (or background image) the graphics don't appear. However, when I give it a custom text, the text will appear. Why is it that the images don't appear?
