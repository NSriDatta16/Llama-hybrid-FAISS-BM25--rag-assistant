When does a PHP web application become too big for average web host

I'm asking this because i'm hoping to start developing an online community (social network) and i'm reluctant to contact my existing web host and just add a domain on to my account and just use them. They give me unlimited bandwidth & diskspace but i mean its obvious to say that Google, Twitter, Facebook and Yahoo, etc, doesnt just use your average web host do they? They would have datacentres and cloud servers and god know what else. So my question is, when does a web application warrant using cloud servers, data centres, etc?
