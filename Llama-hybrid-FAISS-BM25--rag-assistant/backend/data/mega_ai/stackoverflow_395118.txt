If you still want to use c++ and curl try to figure out what the javascript in the page does - I assume it just uses the timer to send a AJAX request and updates the page (although it could be more complicated). Use a tool like firefox with firebug (the "Net" spying is what you want) to see what kind of a request it is - you'll get: an url of the request parameters the returned contents (it could be html, text, xml or json) With a bit of luck you'll have enough to mimic the behavior in c++ with curl. If you can't make anything out of the gathered data, you'll have to browse through the javascript and try to figure out what it is doing (but most of the time page updates are really simple). The easy way to do this would be to do this inside a browser, eg. as a firefox plugin (written in javascript) - if this is needed for anything other than a pet project this might be a bit "unelegant", but it should be really easy to do: monitor the DOM tree for updates (html DOM level 2 has all kinds of "mutation" events, but I never used them so I don't know much about them or if they "work"/are supported - see DOM mutation events ). There is even a possibility this kind of stuff would work in greasemonkey which would mean you wouldn't have to make a full firefox plugin - eg. Post-processing a page after it renders should get you started (you don't want to track 'load', but something like "DOMSubtreeModified"). If the mutation events don't work you can always use a timer and compare the html contents. or do as the firebug does and monitor the network requests and do something with the results
