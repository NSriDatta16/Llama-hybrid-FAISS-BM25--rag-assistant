How to change database connection on the fly for PhpUnit tests

I am working on a Magento 1.4.1 project, and I want to use PhpUnit to test my models. I am able to run my PhpUnit test using the default connection, but I want to use a different database connection than the one I use to test the interface. What I would like to know (if its possible): Is there a way to select a different connection for my models before I run all my tests; Can I just add a connection in my local.xml like this: 1 if yes, how do I access it. thanks.
