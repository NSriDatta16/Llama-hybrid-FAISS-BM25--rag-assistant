determining statistical significance of a mean of a mean

I have done an experiment in which I have 8 repetitions per test subject (for each of several measurements). Of this I took the mean. Then I did this for 8 test subjects in total. So basically I took the mean of the repetitions per test subject and then I took the average of all test subjects. Now I'm trying to determine the statistical significance of the mean of 8 means. How would one do this?
