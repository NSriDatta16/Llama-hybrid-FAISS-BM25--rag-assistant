.NET Generic List Problem, works by design, need work around. Add value instead of reference

I have a List and I need to avoid the behavior I'm about to outline: // assume cls and numberToAdd are parameters passed in. int pos = numberToAdd; List objs = new List (numberToAdd); for(int i = 0; i This results in this writeline printing the same value. Basically what I need is to change the behavior of the "Add" method. I'd like to add a new instance of the object with the same values and not simply a reference to the same object. I understand this will use alot more memory.
