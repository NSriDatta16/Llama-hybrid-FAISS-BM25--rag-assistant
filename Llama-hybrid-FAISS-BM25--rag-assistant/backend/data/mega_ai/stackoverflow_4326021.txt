There's very little point in comparing the costs of two vastly different sets of requirements. Anyway, there is no such thing as an "average" project. OLTP refers to one type of database workload whereas OLAP refers to a set of technologies used for decision support applications. They are literally incomparable. Nor do I understand on what you are basing your idea that OLAP is "rare". OLAP is only one type of solution, inevitably the universe of all other database solutions is much bigger than just OLAP. EDIT: Maybe you might rephrase the question this way: "Why is there less money spent on decision support database applications than there is on other types of database applications?". It depends how you define "decision support" of course. However, if you look at the proportion of most organisations' resources dedicated to "decision support" versus the resources used on doing other stuff then I think you will see the reason.
