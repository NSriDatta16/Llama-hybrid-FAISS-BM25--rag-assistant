ehcache cache "streams" of data

I want to cache the response to image requests. The images are the results of dynamic resizing of a larger image. I am using ehcache already for some caching. I would like to use it here. I don't want ehcache to keep the resized image in memory; neither when cached or when being read in. How do I make ehcache only store on disk (no memory storage)? I don't need it read into memory so how would I get an InputStream from ehcache?
