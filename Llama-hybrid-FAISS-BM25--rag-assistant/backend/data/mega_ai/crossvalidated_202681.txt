testing if timeseries is stationary

I'm trying to run adf.test on the time series below which exhibits a clear 24 hour seasonal pattern. The results of the adf.test seem to imply that the data is stationary. If the data has a strong seasonal pattern shouldn't the adf.test imply that it is non-stationary? I used TBATS to forecast the data and it picked the pattern up very clearly. I've posted some sample data below. I'm new to forecasting so any advice is very much appreciated. Code: library(forecast) library(tseries) tsCustCount Output: Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: tsCustCount Dickey-Fuller = -17.541, Lag order = 28, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary Warning message: In adf.test(tsCustCount, alternative = "stationary") : p-value smaller than printed p-value Data: dput(ds$CustCount[1:144]) c(3, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 1, 5, 6, 8, 5, 2, 7, 7, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 5, 6, 8, 7, 3, 5, 6, 6, 8, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, NA, NA, 4, 2, 2, 4, 11, 2, 8, 1, 4, 7, 11, 5, 3, 10, 7, 1, 1, NA, 2, NA, NA, 2, NA, NA, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 5, 9, 6, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7, 5, 8, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 1, NA, NA, 3, 2, 2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 10, 3, 10, 5, 8, 6, 6, NA, 4, 3, 6, 2, 4, 1, 2, NA, 2, 3, NA, 2, 2, 8, 4, 8, 5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 3, 6, 6, 7, 6, 2)
