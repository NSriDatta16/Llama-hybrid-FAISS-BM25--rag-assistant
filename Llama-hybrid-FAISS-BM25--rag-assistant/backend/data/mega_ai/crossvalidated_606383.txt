Lmer model fails normality and homogeneity of the residuals; model-predicted lines are not great. Some predictors might not be linear. What can I do?

CONTEXT: I gathered data from 1000 participants in five different countries, with each line in my dataset corresponding to a unique participant. My study examines how much individuals support the idea of their government being more open to their input related to policy making, with the dependent variable being the mean score of several Likert items (rated from 1 to 7) per participant. I used various predictors including dummy variables, mean scales, and single items that were all mean centered, including the country variable. MAIN MODEL m_lmer Although all predictors were significant, the model violated assumptions of normality and homogeneity of residuals . > check_heteroscedasticity(m_lmer) Warning: Heteroscedasticity (non-constant error variance) detected (p check_normality(m_lmer) Warning: Non-normality of residuals detected (p check_collinearity(m_lmer) # Check for Multicollinearity Low Correlation INFORMATION ABOUT DISTRIBUTIONS It's worth noting that some predictors have outliers, but I decided not to remove them in this context. Also, the fitdist() function classified the dependent variable and many of the predictors as having Weibull distributions, while some predictors had lnorm and gamma distributions. Distribution of my dependent variable: GAM MODEL THAT I TRIED AS ALTERNATIVE I tried a gam model with smooth terms and two of my predictors seemed to be non-linear, but the gam model also seems to fail the homogeneity of the residuals and did not accept country as a random effect with bs = 're'. m_gam check_heteroscedasticity(m_gam) Warning: Heteroscedasticity (non-constant error variance) detected (p performance::compare_performance(m_lmer, m_rlmer,m_gam, rank = TRUE) # Comparison of Model Performance Indices Name | Model | RMSE | Sigma | Performance-Score --------------------------------------------------------------- m_gam | gam | 1.050 | 1.065 | 57.13% m_rlmer | rlmerMod | 1.072 | 1.017 | 50.00% m_lmer | lmerModLmerTest | 1.071 | 1.073 | 3.40% QUESTIONS Despite attempting to log transform the dependent variable, the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of residuals continued to fail. What should I do? It's not ok using these models because of the failed homogeneity, right? Does rlmer handle non-constant and non-normal residuals? Or should I try bayesian approach and specify the distributions of all the predictors in the priors? EDIT: In response to @GeorgeSavva I couldn't run the GLMMADAPTIVE's approach: m_glmm With truncreg the residuals look like this: m_trunc With GAMLSS's approach, the model seems to be better but the deviation is still present. m_gamlss Are these deviations problematic in a GAMLSS model?
