Controls in Windows Forms can be transparent. You need to set the TransparencyKey of the Form to some color that you never plan on using (many people seem to love/hate Magenta for this), and then set the BackgroundColor of each PictureBox to the same color. The result should be a transparent PictureBox with its Image drawn over it. I'm pretty sure this won't work with the BackgroundImage property, mind you- just the Image property. One potentially unwanted side effect of this method is that you'll be able to see whatever's behind your form (the desktop, other application windows, etc.) through the transparent places in the PictureBox.
