How to perform logistic regression with unbalanced classes?

I will be doing a logistic regression to determine if a number of variables influence whether or not a patient received a certain health care service. I will likely have approximately 500 or so observations, and there will likely be far more zeros (patient did not receive service) than ones (patient did receive service). In the event that I have a very small amount of ones (I am guessing I will have maybe 20-30), what would be the best method to account for this?
