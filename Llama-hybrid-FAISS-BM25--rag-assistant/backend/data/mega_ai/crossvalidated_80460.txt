In R, you can try functions: na in package timeSeries , function na.approx in package zoo or function na.interp in package forecast . If I remember correctly in SAS, the "expand" procedure was also to interpolate missing values in a time series. I don't think there is a best software as you mentioned. To find out which one is performing better, you can remove some of your time series data, deliberately to create some missing data yourself. Next apply all of above packages and generate your missing data using them. Since you know the observed values of your missing data, you can easily assess the performance of them by looking at the true values. This may not be the best way, but at least will give you an idea of how well they perform. One last thing, there may be other packages to handle missing values for time series.
