Actually, if you look at the way things are, MS doesn't have nearly as much involvement in game studios. Bungie is now a semi-independant entity, they shuttered Ensemble ( Age of Empires, Halo Wars ) for who knows what reason... they shut down the Flight Simulator group, they let their exclusivity with Bioware ( Dragon Age, Baldurs Gate, NWN ) and Bizarre ( Project Gotham Racing ) go and they shut down FASA Interactive ( Shadowrun ). At this point, what do they have really have in house? All I can think of is.... Rare and Lionhead. As to why didn't they make AAA titles with C#. I imagine a big chunk of it was legacy issues. PGR, Forza, Age of Empires, Halo, Flight Sim, pretty much every game they made was an iteration of a previous series, so would have already had substantial investments in existing infrastructures. That leaves 3rd parties. Why wouldn't third parties use C#? That easy, its not available on Wii or PS3.
