Statistical test for joint stationarity?

Suppose I am given two time series, $x_t$ and $y_t$ . I wish to determine if they are jointly stationary because I want to make a cross-correlation function and know that it's really a function only of the lag, i.e., that the correlation $\rho(x_t,y_s)$ depends only on $h = |t-s|$ and not on $t$ or $s$ . I know how to test that $x_t$ is stationary and that $y_t$ is stationary, but I don't know a test for joint stationarity. Is there a statistical test for this? Can it be carried out in R?
