Another vote for outside the database. In the past, I've used an approach similar to what James recommends, but SQL Server 2008 supports a new FILESTREAM storage option, which can store varbinary(max) columns outside the database on NTFS, and might be worth looking into. SQL Books Online has a lot of good information, starting with "FILESTREAM Overview".
