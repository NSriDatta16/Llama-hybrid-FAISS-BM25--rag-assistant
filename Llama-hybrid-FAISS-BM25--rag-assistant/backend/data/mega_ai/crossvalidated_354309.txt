On the one hand, this is a small data set, and random forest is data-hungry. On the other hand, maybe something is better than nothing. There's nothing more to say than "Try it and see." You get to decide whether or not any particular model is "good;" moreover, we can't tell you whether any model is fit for a particular purpose (nor would you want us to -- there's no cost to us if we're wrong!).
