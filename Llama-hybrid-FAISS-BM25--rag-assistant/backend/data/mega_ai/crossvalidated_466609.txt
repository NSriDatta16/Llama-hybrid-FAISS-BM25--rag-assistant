Given uniform distributions of X and Y and the mean 0 and standard deviation 1 for both, what’s the probability of 2X>Y

I saw this question online as a prep question for stats/data science interviews. I’m familiar with the concept of uniform distributions and joint probability distributions, but I wasn’t able to make sense of this question, I’m wondering if I am interpreting it incorrectly or if this is a concept I’m unfamiliar with. If anyone could help explain what the question is asking it would be very appreciated!
