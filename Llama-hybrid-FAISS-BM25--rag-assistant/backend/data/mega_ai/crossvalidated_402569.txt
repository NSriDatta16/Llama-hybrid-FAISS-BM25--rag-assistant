Why do we use Gaussian distributions in Variational Autoencoder?

I still don't understand why we force the distribution of the hidden representation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to follow a multivariate normal distribution . Why this specific distribution and not another one ? This is maybe linked with another question : Why is the weights distribution in a neural network following a Gaussian Distribution ? Is it just the application of the Central Limit theorem that tells you that many independent inputs will generate many independent errors, and the observed weights are the results of these multiple back-propagated signals... ?
