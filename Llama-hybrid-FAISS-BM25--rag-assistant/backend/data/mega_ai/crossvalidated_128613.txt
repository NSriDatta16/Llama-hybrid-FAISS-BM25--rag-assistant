If I'm understanding you correctly, you should be running a repeated-measures model, sort of like an interrupted time series model except you only have 1 (in some cases, none) observations before the treatment. Longitudinal regression models can handle imbalance, if you treat it as a repeated-measure hierarchical or multilevel model. In this case, the level 2 model is the person, and the level 1 model is for the observation within the person. Something like this: Level 1: $y_{it}=\hat{\beta_{0i}}+\hat{\beta_1}treat+\hat{\beta_2}time_t + \epsilon_{it}$ Level 2: $\hat{\beta_{0i}}=\alpha+\Sigma\hat{\gamma_i}X_i + \mu_i$ Where indices $i$ and $t$ represent person and time, respectively. $\epsilon_{it}$ is the level 1 error term, for the observations within persons, and $\mu_i$ is the error term for the persons. The variable $treat$ is a binary variable, 1 if the person was treated at time $t$, 0 otherwise. I have here time as a linear term, but you could add polynomials as well. This specification should tell you if on average, independent of when the measurement was taken, if it was taken after the treatment was it higher than before. You can then also see if there is a time effect independent of treatment. $\gamma_i$ is the coefficient for time-invariant person characteristics $X$, assuming you have that. You could also include time-varying person characteristics, if you tracked them. I've also only assumed you are interested in a random intercept - which means the intercept for each person is a normally distributed, random variable, centered around the mean. This is a basic model - you can make it far more complicated. But it can get your started. Regarding individuals with no pre-treatment observation, that can still be included in your model - they will not contribute any pre-treatment information, but they will provide additional comparison for those with pre-treatment observations. If you have additional covariates this would make it much stronger.
