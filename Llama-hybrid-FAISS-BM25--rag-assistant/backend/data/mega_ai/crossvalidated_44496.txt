In addition rather than contradiction to MÃ¥ns T 's answer, I simply point out that there is no such thing as "the prior" in Bayesian modelling! The Dirichlet distribution is a convenient choice because of (a) conjugacy, (b) computing, and (c) connection with non-parametric statistics (since this is the discretised version of the Dirichlet process). However, (i) whatever prior you put on the weights of the multinomial is a legitimate answer at the subjective Bayes level and (ii) in case of prior information being available there is no reason it simplifies into a Dirichlet distribution. Note also that mixtures and convolutions of Dirichlet distributions can be used as priors.
