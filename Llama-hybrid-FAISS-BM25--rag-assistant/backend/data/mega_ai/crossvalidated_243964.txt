I highly recommend Neural Network Design by Martin Hagan. I believe this is exactly what you are looking for. I have a similar background as you and I worked through the book in a couple of weeks, working out some of the use cases described and it provided me with a very good understanding of the (various) inner workings of the main aspects of the (various) neural network designs.
