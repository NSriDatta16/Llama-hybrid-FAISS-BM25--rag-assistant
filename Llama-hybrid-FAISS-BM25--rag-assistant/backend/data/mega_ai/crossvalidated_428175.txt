The things you have considered are pretty standard. Based on your description, it sounds like you do have thresholds that make sense to you, but they are combinations, not a single number of an attribute. The real solution, then, will depend on your domain expertise and what analyses reach your version of a threshold. Some things to look into: z-score of the change in attributes. You may find that analyzing the derivative of your attribute comes closer to your intuition, and that setting a threshold of 4 or 5 captures the changes you're looking for. Mahalanobis distance is quite useful for multi-variate distributions. You can provide a window of attributes and then check if a single row would fall into that distribution. In your case, you might need to label your history to capture distances that make sense to you (compute distance and run it through a random forrest classifier or something), but you can also compute histograms and select bins as outliers. There is a good review, including a few other techniques for multivariate distributions here , which focuses on outliers. I've had success with the projection methods, but it isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. In general, "outlier" is very contextual and depends on your version of what is unusual. There isn't a blackbox tool for that which isn't simply statistical (i.e. "basic"). But, with machine learning, you can label and teach using some of those methods!
