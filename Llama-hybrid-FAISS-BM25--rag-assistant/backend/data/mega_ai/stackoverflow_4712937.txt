CORS / xhr.getRequestHeaders

Greetings, I am trying to use CORS ( http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-cors-20090317/#access-control-allow-methods-header ) for an application on Safari, and when I try to read the response headers from the XMLHTTPRequest, I only receive the Content-Type. None of the other quite standard headers gets through, and I cannot figure out how to get this to work. Anyone would happen to know how to fix this issue? Could this be a WebKit bug? Edit here is the config i use with nGinx: add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *; add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers Cache-Control,Pragma,Date; add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods GET,POST;
