Are MCMC based methods appropriate when Maximum a-posteriori estimation is available?

I have been noticing that in many practical applications, MCMC-based methods are used to estimate a parameter even though the posterior is analytical (for example because the priors were conjugate). To me, it makes more sense to use of MAP-estimators rather than MCMC-based estimators. Could anyone point out why MCMC is still an appropriate method in the presence of an analytical posterior?
