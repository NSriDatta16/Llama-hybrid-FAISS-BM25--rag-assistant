How to implement movement and placing of UITableViewCells in iphone?

I am developing an application in which I need to achieve movement and placement of UITableViewCells by dragging them to the desired positions(just like as we do for icons by long pressing them and placing them to the desired place). How to achieve it for the table view cells? Code for this is appreciable.
