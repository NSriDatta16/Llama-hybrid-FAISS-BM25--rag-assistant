I used to do Java and C# on Windoze. I'd second these sources: IDE : Try Apatana RadRails 3 Sneak Peek: http://www.radrails.org/3 . Its the closest thing you'll get to Visual Studio. I play with it here and there but still love the lightness of Textmate. OS : Mac OS gets the most if not all love from Ruby community. Anything else is treated like a bastard child. Books : The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide (the pickaxe book) Agile Web Development with Rails Screencasts : Peepcode (pay) is a nice way to pick up concepts quickly Railscasts (free) is a good weekly way to pick up new gems and concepts incrementally Railscasts (pro) is also a good way to pick up concepts for a pretty low price.
