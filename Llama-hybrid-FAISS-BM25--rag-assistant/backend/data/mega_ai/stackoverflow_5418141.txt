If your web app has any access control feature, then I think it would be good to include a role management and user access control module along with the account management module. If your billing module makes use of any constant values or factors (like tax or exchange rates or something like that) you could also have a module that would allow maintenance of such changeable values, since other organizations may be using different values. Since you're porting your web app from catering to a specific organization into an SAAS app, I think you could just start with identifying which parts of your app are specifically or statically set and creating a way to make it customizable for use in other organizations.
