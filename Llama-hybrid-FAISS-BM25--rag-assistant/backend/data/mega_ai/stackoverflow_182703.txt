I went from SQL Server to Oracle in 2001 where I went from working on a VB6/SQL Server project (as a developer) to working as an Oracle development DBA for a large J2EE project. Here are the edited highlights of my experiences and some reflections. For development, the basic principle of SQL is not radically differnt. T-SQL is a somewhat different beast to PL/SQL so the idioms are a bit different. Most competent programmers should be able to make the jump by just tinkering around and getting some good SQL server books such as the Guru's Guide or Oracle books such as Expert one-on-one Oracle , depending on which way you're going. I'd say for a developer a week or two to get used to another database platform will get you most of the way there. The basic principles are fairly similar (modulo differences in the architecture); really only the window dressing is different. However, if you're going to Oracle, get a copy of a third-party query tool such as TOAD as these are much, much, much better than the ones that Oracle supplies. Agents are notoriously bad for matching specific buzzwords and I get this on a semi-regular basis (I'm a contractor). If you need to bone up on SQL Server the Developer Edition is very cheap and will install on a desktop O/S such as Windows XP. Oracle also offers Free downloads for all their supported platforms that you can use to tinker. You might also get some mileage from asking a stackoverflow question along the lines of "What are the main idiomatic differences between PL/SQL and T-SQL".
