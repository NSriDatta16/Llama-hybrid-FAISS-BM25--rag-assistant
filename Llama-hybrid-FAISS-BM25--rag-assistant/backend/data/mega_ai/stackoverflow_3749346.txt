Extracted from this link : The easiest way I have found to pass data from a child window to a parent window is to use an application wide property. This property is an object, and is not the most elegant form to pass data from a child window to a parent, but it's the least amount of programming. The best way to do this is using get and set accessor properties. Create a main window (mainWindow) Create a child window (in this case, Password) In the main window, the child window must be shown, say, within a button click. This window would have a button to do something, in this case, it's to delete a record from the database. private void btnDelete_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { Password passwordentry = new Password(); passwordentry.ShowDialog(); if (Application.Current.Properties["PassGate"].ToString() == "mypassword") { Code, or call to delete the record; } Application.Current.Properties["PassGate"] = ""; } In the child window (Password), the property for the application is set using a textbox. This is a simple window that has a textbox called PasswordTextBox and a couple of buttons, like Accept and Cancel. private void AcceptButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { Application.Current.Properties["PassGate"] = PasswordTextBox.Text; this.Close(); }
