locks are only ever nessecary if you have multiple agents writing to a source. If they are just accessing, locks are not needed (and as you said defeat the purpose of multiprocessing). Are you sure that would crash the system? On a web server using CGI, each request spawns a new process, so it's not unusual to see thousands of simultaneous processes (granted in python one should use wsgi and avoid this), which do not crash the system. I suggest you test your theory -- it shouldn't be difficult to manufacture 10 simultaneous accesses -- and see if your server really does crash.
