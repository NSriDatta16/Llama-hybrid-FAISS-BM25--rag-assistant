PCA is based on variances and covariances, $\mathrm E[x_i x_j]$ (assuming mean-free variables). These are measures of second-order dependencies because the data enter in the form of terms of order 2. After PCA, the principal components have 0 covariance between them, so second-order dependencies have been removed. However, it is still possible that higher-order dependencies exist, e.g. that $\mathrm E[x_i x_j x_k] \neq 0$ for some $i$, $j$, and $k$. By removing second-order dependencies by applying a linear transform, PCA in a way "reveals" second-order dependencies in the form of that transform, but it does not "reveal" higher-order dependencies.
