Reaction time not normally distributed

I am trying to analyze a dataset. My independent variable (IV) is instructing participants to think fast or slow and my dependent variable (DV) is participants' average reaction time. As expected, the average reaction time is not normally distributed. I'm trying to run a $t$ -test but if the data is not normally distributed at all I'm not sure how to approach this. Here's an example of the distribution of average reaction time for one for one of the groups: And I'm not sure if removing outliers is the best approach as the groups were instructed to think fast or slow.
