I will try to reply using empirical evidence. Let's assume you are measuring the heights in a men sample. In this case, the outlier will be represented by a very tall men (a giant). It is very likely this men will represent an outlier also for other variables like for instance shoe size or arms lengths and so on. Other case, you are measuring financial performance of US Public company. An outlier will be a very successful company with a sales growth twice the industry average. Very likely the same company will be an outlier in respect of any measure of profitability or stock price appreciation. In a nut shell, I am incline to think something behaving exceptionally out of the norm will tend to conserve this property across different manifestations. Is there a theorem that disprove this theory?
