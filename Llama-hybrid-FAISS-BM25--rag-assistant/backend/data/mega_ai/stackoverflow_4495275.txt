How to check if a mouse is over a control

How does one check if the mouse is over a certain HWND? I have tried using the WM_MOUSELEAVE and WM_MOUSEMOVE messages to keep track, but if you click a button and drag the mouse out of the button, it doesn't receive the WM_MOUSELEAVE until the mouse is released, which is too late, because: When you click a button, the WM_COMMAND message is only sent if: 1. The mouse was originally depressed over the button 2. The mouse is over the button 3. The mouse is released over the button I need to replicate this functionality.
