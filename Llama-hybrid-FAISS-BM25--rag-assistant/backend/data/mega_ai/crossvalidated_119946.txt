Predicting Y from a regression model for dY

I have some time series data where I'm modelling temperature as a function of various predictors. On physical grounds, I can expect that $$\frac{dT}{dt} \propto T_a - T$$ where $T_a$ is the ambient temperature (which can vary over time, but whose values are known). I thus fit models of the form $$\Delta T(t) \sim \alpha + \beta \left[ T_a(t) -T(t) \right] + \gamma X(t)$$ with $X$ being the other covariates, and $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the regression parameters. I can fit these easily enough in R: lm(diff(T) ~ I(Ta - T) + x, data=df) and I can get predictions for the change in $T$. However, what I really want are predictions for $T$ itself. At the moment I'm calculating these via a loop, where I plug $\hat{T}(t)$ into the regression equation to obtain $\hat{\Delta T}(t+1)$. Is there any R package, probably time series-related, that will do these calculations automatically? Also, if there are any issues with this approach, I'd be happy to know about them.
