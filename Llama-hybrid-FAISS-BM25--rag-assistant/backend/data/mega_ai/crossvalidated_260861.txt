Dealing with a dependent variable across multiple markets and time periods

I am looking to forecast rents across several markets. I have time series data going back 15 years for 4 different markets. I also have variables that I expect to correlate with Supply and Demand and am hoping to include them as independant variables. The model I am looking to run is roughly $rent_{it} = \beta_0+\beta_1demand_{it}+\beta_2supply_{it}$ where $i=market$. I have attempted running arima models by each market (four separate regressions) but I seriously doubt this is the best way to approach the problem. I feel I am leaving a lot of data unused by running a series of regressions instead of using all data in one model. Is there an appropriate model or technique that will allow me to include all rent, supply and demand data across markets in a single model? Also, I am using R for this analysis.
