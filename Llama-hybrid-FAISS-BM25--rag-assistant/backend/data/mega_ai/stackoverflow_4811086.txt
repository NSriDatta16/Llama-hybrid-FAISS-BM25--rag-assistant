How to close connection after reactor.connectTCP in Twisted

I wanted to ask a question on how to close the connection in twisted RPC . I know a similar question was asked but it doesn't seem to answer mine. I am doing some basic connection as sketched below: cfactory = pb.PBClientFactory() reactor.connectTCP( , , cfactory) dfr.addCallbacks( , , ...) ... (in the func) remote.callRemote('myfunc', ...) It all works and does the stuff I need. But the trouble is that I see the connection still active ("ESTABLISHED") if I check it by netstat -a . Since I'm doing this between a client and a server that run indefinitely, I cannot just keep accumulating the active connections. I can't stop the reactor either for the same reason. So, is there a way to close the connection, short of going through creating one's own protocol? I wanted to check first since it is all in working order except this one fact - If possible I'll just add the one needed thing rather than starting with protocol setup and all. Thanks for your attention and any general advice would be appreciated. Tony
