Turning simple questions into answers is not simple whatsoever. The first technology to do this as broadly across technology and accurately will be a big winner. However, there are some out there, filling in the gaps with "answering questions" with Artificial Intelligence (e.g. IBM Watson, and Amazon Alexa). This requires solving the language complexities related to the data in question, what's in the data stores, and what are nouns, verbs and pronouns. Microsoft ventured here with English Query but, then stopped. Kueri.me is a Python based platform doing about the same thing. Structured Query Languages (SQL) and the like, SOQL, MDX, Hive, Impala and the newer takes on old fashioned SQL. Have not yet replaced much of anything, all these pieces are small fixes to the grander "End Goal" and that lies in Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically, Machine Learning. The question being: "Can the computer, figure out what you want." Not yet. It takes Linguists, Mathematicians, Engineers and more to all contribute their piece of the pie so we can enjoy some of that sweet Artificial Intelligent and Machine Learned cake.
