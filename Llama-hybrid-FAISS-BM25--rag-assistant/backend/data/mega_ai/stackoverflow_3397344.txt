Check if directory path ends with DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR

In PHP I'm receiving a string from the user for a local file directory $path I want to know if they've included the trailing slash (/) or not. I would like this to be cross platform so I'd like to use the PHP constant DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR My failed attempts include trying to do a preg_match like preg_match("/" . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . "$/", $path); I basically just want an elegant way to test if the string ends with the DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR .
