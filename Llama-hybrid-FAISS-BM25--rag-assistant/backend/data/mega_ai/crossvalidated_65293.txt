A stochastic process is a collection of random variables ${\bf X} = \{ X_t : t \in T \}$ defined on a common probability space, taking values in a common set $S$ (state space), and indexed by set $T$ , often either $\mathbb{N}$ or $[0, \infty)$ , and thought of as time (either continuous or discrete). (Reference: Random Services ) Common examples of stochastic processes are: Random Walks Simple random walk: defined on the integers in discrete time, and is based on a Bernoulli process, where each $iid$ Bernoulli variable takes either the value $+1$ or $-1$ . Bernoulli Process A sequence of $iid$ Bernoulli random variables, where each event is a Bernoulli trial. Wiener Process Stochastic process with stationary and independent increments whose size is normally distributed. Poisson Process Defined as a counting process, which is a process that represents the random number of points or events up to some time. The number of points of the process that are located in the interval from zero to some (given, non-random) time is a Poisson random variable. Markov Chains (both continuous and discrete time) The behavior of the process in the future is stochastically independent of its behavior in the past, given the current state of the process. Martingales A discrete-time or continuous-time stochastic processes with the property that the expectation of the next value of a martingale is equal to the current value given all the previous values of the process.
