Any way to represent a random forest regressor model?

currently doing some EDA into a random forest regressor that was built; there seems to be observations where the model prediction is off. what library can i use to visualise the representation of the random forest for me to understand better how the model splits for each node, etc. the model is built in pyspark (pyspark.ml.RandomForestRegressor)
