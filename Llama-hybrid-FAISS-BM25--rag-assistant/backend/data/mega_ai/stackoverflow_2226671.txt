EDIT:: @chrisgoyal Order of execution is an ambiguous term. There are two different things here. The syntactical order, and the semantics of the expression. Syntactically, the operator ++ is applied first. If the *s is applied first, then the following is equivalent to what @Hogan said: (*s)++ = (*t)++ Which is very different from Joel's sample. The semantics of the operator ++ is that it is executed after the expression. Hope that clarifies what I meat. Actually, s++ and t++ are applied first. Don't forget that the post-fix operator is executed after the expression is done. Basically the operator ++ is applied for both, then *s = *t is executed.
