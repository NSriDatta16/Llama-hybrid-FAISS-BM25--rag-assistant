Can't help you with a concrete example as I decided to use something else. However, one of the first things I wanted to do after I cloned the repo was remove the ecore dependency. Here's a patch submitted to the mailing list to do just that: https://garage.maemo.org/pipermail/python-purple-devel/2009-March/000000.html Incidentally, if you're looking for AIM take a look at twisted.words. For Yahoo, trying getting the source for curphoo or zinc (both are console YMSG clients). For GTalk/Jabber, I've had good experiences with xmpppy.
