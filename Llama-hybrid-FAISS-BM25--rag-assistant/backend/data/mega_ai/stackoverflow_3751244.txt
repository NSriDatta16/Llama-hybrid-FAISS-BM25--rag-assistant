1°) To Crop the Image, try to add a method to UIImage class to do it (you can google it without problem, or even on StackOverFlow) 2°) To add a "window" over your image, just add an UIImageView over your image wich has transparency. It should work ;-) 3°) To know when an image is touched, you can use "touchesBegan" to detect which image were selected. But I think it's the last of your problems ^^ What you cant to achieve isn't so hard, just to it step by step ! If you want more help in one step, say it. But I can't code it all for you ;-) Good Luck
