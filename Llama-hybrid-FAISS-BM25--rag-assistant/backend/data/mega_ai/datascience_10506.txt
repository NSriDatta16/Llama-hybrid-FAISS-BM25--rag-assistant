I ended up using Feature Forge , which is a python library that "provides a set of tools that can be useful in many machine learning applications (classification, clustering, regression, etc.), and particularly helpful if you use scikit-learn (although this can work if you have a different algorithm)". I chose it because it seems to be a more specific tool for machine learning than Sacred, which appears to be a more generic tool. Feature Forge also provides a convenient framework for describing features in a scalable and reusable class-based way. It also has functions to store experimental results in a Mongo database. Thanks to @Emre for pointing to reddit discussion , where featureforge was mentioned. UPD : I wrote a library based on Feature Forge to support the full machine learning experimentation pipeline: classifier configuration management feature description training/testing classifiers storing/analyzing results.
