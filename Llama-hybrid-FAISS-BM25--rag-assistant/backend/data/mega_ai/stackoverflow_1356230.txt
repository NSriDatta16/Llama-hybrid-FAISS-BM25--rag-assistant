How to Organize my File/Folders in Linux?

I am Using Fedora 10, I would like to organize my files and folders? ie: Suppose I got a .bin file it automatically install all files properly, we don't want to bothered about anything. (Like windows all the files are into the " c:\Program Files "). But in Linux Which is the path for the install files. One of my installation goes to ' /usr/local/Zend/ZendStudio-5.5.0 ' but this is .bin file. If i got an extract package where do i put the extracted folders. (firefox.tar.gz is a package but we just need to extract that to run. in this case where is the proper location to extract these kind of installation files ). I think it bit difficult to understand my English. if you have any doubt please ask me.
