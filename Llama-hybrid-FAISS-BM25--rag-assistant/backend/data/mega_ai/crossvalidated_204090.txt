In this case, you should directly quantify the size of the interaction (between the treatment group variable and the age group variable) within studies. You can do this by taking the difference between the two log RRs within studies. The variance of the difference is just the sum of the two squared standard errors, since the two subgroups within trials consist of different individuals (below/above 50 years of age) and are therefore independent. So: df.diff So we get: study yi vi 1 1 0.5108256 0.1268421 2 2 1.0986123 0.2553729 Then you can meta-analyze these values: res This yields: Random-Effects Model (k = 2; tau^2 estimator: REML) tau^2 (estimated amount of total heterogeneity): 0 (SE = 0.2703) tau (square root of estimated tau^2 value): 0 I^2 (total heterogeneity / total variability): 0.00% H^2 (total variability / sampling variability): 1.00 Test for Heterogeneity: Q(df = 1) = 0.9039, p-val = 0.3417 Model Results: estimate se zval pval ci.lb ci.ub 0.7059 0.2911 2.4248 0.0153 0.1353 1.2765 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 So, the estimated size of the interaction effect is $0.7059$, and since we computed (log RR for below 50) - (log RR for above 50), this value indicates that the log RR is on average $0.7059$ points higher in groups that are below 50 years of age. Or: predict(res, transf=exp) yields: pred ci.lb ci.ub cr.lb cr.ub 2.0256 1.1449 3.5839 1.1449 3.5839 which indicates that the RR is on average roughly twice as large in groups that are below 50 years of age. I'll leave aside the question whether using random-effects models with $k=2$ is sensible or not, but since the estimated amount of heterogeneity is 0 anyway, we would obtain the same results if we had used a fixed-effects model ( method="FE" ).
