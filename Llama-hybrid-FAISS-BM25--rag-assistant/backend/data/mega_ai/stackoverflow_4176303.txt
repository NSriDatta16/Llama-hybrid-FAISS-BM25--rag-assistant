It's not inelegant. SQL is relational, joins are a natural part of life. Thinking they're "inelegant" is what leads to stereotypically poor database designs. You've determined you have two different kinds of data -- text you often need to search, and blobs you do not. There is absolutely nothing wrong or inelegant about storing these in two different tables.
