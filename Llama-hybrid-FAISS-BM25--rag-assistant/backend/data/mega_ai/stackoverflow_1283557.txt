jQuery AJAX: How to append a "SAVED" message and make it disappear after a second

this is probably really simple for a jQuery expert. I have blahblah I want a SAVED message appear and disappear. But I DO NOT want to make the form or its elements disappear. I have a AJAX call that is like the following. function saveCaption(id) { var queryString = $('#form'+id).formSerialize(); $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "includes/ajax.php?request=saveCaption", data: queryString, success: function(response) { $('#form'+id).append(response) } }); return false; } I was wondering.. I can append the response. But is there a way to fade it out right away after a second. Right now, it just keeps repeating and adding to the last append. I would like it to appear and disappear right after using fadeOut. UPDATE: I did this based on theIV and RaYell's response. It works.. but is it elegant? function saveCaption(id) { var queryString = $('#form'+id).formSerialize(); $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "includes/ajax.php?request=saveCaption", data: queryString, success: function(response) { $('#form'+id).append(' '+response+' '); setTimeout(function () { $('#message').fadeOut(function(){ $(this).remove(); }); }, 1000); } }); return false; }
