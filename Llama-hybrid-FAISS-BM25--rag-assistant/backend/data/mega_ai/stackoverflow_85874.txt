There are a lot of different options here. Where I work we use #if pragmas but it could also be done with separate assemblies for the separate versions. Ideally you would at least keep the version dependant code in separate partial class files and make the correct version available at compile time. I would enforce this if I could go back in time, our code base now has a whole lot of #if pragmas and sometimes it can be hard to manage. The worst part of the whole #if pragma thing is that Visual Studio just ignores anything that won't compile with the current defines and so it's very easy to check in breaking changes. NUnit supports both 1.1 and 2.0 and so is a good choice for a test framework. It's not too hard to use something like NAnt to make separate 1.1 and 2.0 builds and then automatically run the NUnit tests.
