Whatever makes sense to you is good enough. Frankly, when someone else comes looking for something in your stylesheet - or when you come looking for something, for that matter - they're not going to try to figure out what your organizing structure was. They're just going to search for whatever class or element they need to see. So as long as you generally keep stuff that's related together, and section things off with comments like @Matt suggests, you're fine. The fact of the matter is that even with a very well-thought-out organizational structure - just like with a well-thought-out filing system - it's not always obvious what goes where; so you're better off just being somewhat sensible, not devoting a lot of time to keeping things organized, and relying on search tools to find what you need.
