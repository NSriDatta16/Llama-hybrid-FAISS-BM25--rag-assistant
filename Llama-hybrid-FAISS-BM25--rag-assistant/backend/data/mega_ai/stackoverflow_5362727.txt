What are the main use cases for tools like memchached and Redis?

My main interest resides in use cases where these tools could be used to performance tune existing transactional RDBS-based applications. Are there good sources for common design patterns involving these tools? After some reasearch I found the following sample use-cases for Redis , more difficult (surely slower) to implement on a SQL datastore: Feeds or tail-like logic (last post appears on top) Thanks to Redis' list-management features: LPUSH post: :comments //posts comment LRANGE post: :comments 0 9 // instantly gets last 10 comments Tag management Leveraging Redis' Set-management functionalities (and set intersaction) it's easy to implement tag systems Score boards on high-concurrency high-volume services Redis can insert scores in O(log(N)) (i.e. fast enough) and then use sorted sets to retrieve score boards that in SQL would require SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY score LIMIT 0 10
