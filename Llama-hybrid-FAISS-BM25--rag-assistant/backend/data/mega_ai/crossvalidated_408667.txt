I worked with data scientists who do not know linear algebra. The field, which pretentiosly has "science" in its name, is so vast that there's something to do for everyone willing. It is somewhat similar to programmers not knowing electronics, and most of them have no clue. You can survive and even prosper without linear algebra but you will not be able to do certain things, and you'll be slower at certain tasks. The main area where you will get hurt is research. Ng's lectures show a bit of internals, he often refers to papers, shows equations etc. If you're going to be implementing new algorithm that are just off the press, it would be very difficult without linear algebra to understand a lot of research papers. Here, it will be like coming with a knife to a gun fight, you'll be the dumbest guy in the room almost all the time. It would be depressing. However, possibly 90% of work in data science is not of this nature. Most of the time you'll be asked to create reports, massage data, and maybe call libraries. This doesn't require any knowledge of anything. Any programmer could do it, if they wanted to spend a couple of weeks on learning the frameworks.
