Is there a way to drag & drop to copy files between two visual studio instances?

Is there a way to copy files between two Visual Studio 2008 instances ? A plugin, setting, or something else ? Currently, dragging a file from one instances to another does nothing (mouse shows that it's invalid operation). Right-clicking a file and selecting "Copy" from instance 1, and pasting in instance 2 results in the following error: The source files for this operation cannot be found in this solution. Any ideas or solutions ?
