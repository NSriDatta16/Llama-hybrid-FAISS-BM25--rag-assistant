java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException issue

I am a new Java programmer. The following is my code: public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { BPM2SampleProcessor processor = new BPM2SampleProcessor(); processor.setSampleSize(1024); EnergyOutputAudioDevice output = new EnergyOutputAudioDevice(processor); output.setAverageLength(1024); Player player = new Player(new FileInputStream(args[0]), output); player.play(); log.log(Level.INFO, "calculated BPM: " + processor.getBPM()); } It shows a runtime error as Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0 in the following line: Player player = new Player(new FileInputStream(args[0]), output); Please explain what the error is and how to overcome it.
