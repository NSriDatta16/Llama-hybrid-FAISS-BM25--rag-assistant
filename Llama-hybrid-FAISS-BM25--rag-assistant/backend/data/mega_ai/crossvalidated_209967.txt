There is a mistake in your notes: if you have a point mass at $\theta_0$ with a prior$$\pi(\theta)=\pi_0\delta_{\theta_0}(\theta)+\pi_1 g(\theta)$$where $\delta_{\theta_0}$ denotes the Dirac point mass at $\theta_0$, the posterior distribution on $\theta$ given $x\sim f(x|\theta)$ is$$\pi(\theta|x)\propto f(x|\theta) \{\pi_0\delta_{\theta_0}(\theta)+\pi_1 g(\theta)\}=\pi_0f(x|\theta_0)\delta_{\theta_0}(\theta)+\pi_1 f(x|\theta)g(\theta)$$which has as normalising constant$$\begin{align*} \int \pi_0f(x|\theta_0)\delta_{\theta_0}(\theta)+\pi_1 f(x|\theta)g(\theta)\text{d}\theta&=\pi_0f(x|\theta_0)+\pi_1\overbrace{\int_{\theta\ne\theta_0}f(x|\theta)g(\theta)\text{d}\theta}^{\text{denote by }r(x)}\\ &=\pi_0f(x|\theta_0)+\pi_1\,r(x) \end{align*}$$ Hence, $$a_0=\pi(\theta=\theta_0|x)=\dfrac{\pi_0 f(x|\theta_0)}{\pi_0f(x|\theta_0)+\pi_1\,r(x)}=\left[1+\frac{\pi_1\,r(x)}{\pi_0 f(x|\theta_0)}\right]^{-1}$$ In this solution $r(x)$ is the marginal density of $x$, not a supremum and not a plug-in quantity. For your example, since $\bar{X}\sim\mathcal{N}(\theta,1/5)$, if one assumes a prior like $\theta\sim\mathcal{N}(\theta_0,1)$ [but any other choice is as acceptable in this framework], then $$r(x)=r(\bar{x})=\int_{\mathbb{R}} \sqrt{5}\varphi(\{\bar{x}-\theta\}\sqrt{5})\varphi(\theta-\theta_0)\text{d}\theta=\varphi(\{\bar{x}-\theta_0\}/\sqrt{6/5})/\sqrt{6/5}$$the density of a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\theta_0,1+\frac{1}{5})$. Remark: An explanation for my choice of a $\theta\sim\mathcal{N}(\theta_0,1)$ prior is that (a) I have no idea what the problem is all about, hence no prior information; (b) the value $\theta_0$ is a special value since it is tested and a possible value for $\theta$ as otherwise it would not be tested, so I centre my prior around this value; (c) the choice of a unit variance means that I weight my prior choice as much as a single observation in the sample, which is a reasonable scale if I do not have other items of prior information. An alternative would be to chose a Cauchy $C(\theta_0,1)$ as being less narrow than the normal and it would lead to a different numerical and formal answer, both being acceptable within the Bayesian paradigm.
