Check for integers - if the continuous data happen to be integers, then they may be confused with categorical. Normalising the continuous data will reduce the risk of this error. Consider adding binning and bagging, dealing with outliers, transform skewed datasets, PCA/factor analysis etc Deal with time-series data After doing the above, reducing the number of features can actually improve NN results.
