Factors or dummy variables for a categorical binary response variable? Which approach is better for Machine Learning/Logistic regression in R?

I am new to R and I am creating a glm for a dataset trying to see the covariates that affect if someone is hyper or not hyper(my target categorical binary variable)[hyperness variable]. I am wondering whether it makes a difference to create a dummy variable that is coded as 0 and 1 or use the as.factor function that is coded as 1,2 ? All the other variables are continuous. Thank you
