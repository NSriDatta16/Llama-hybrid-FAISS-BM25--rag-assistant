Matlab Javabuilder using GWT

Anyone know how to integrate the Matlab compiler runtime with Google Web Toolkit? Basically, I have GWT client-server app where the server side does some big computation using Java components compiled using the MATLAB Builder JA. Then server side sends the result back to the client (typical stuff). I get the GWT app to compile fine but I can not access any of the .dylib files in the Matlab compiler runtime directories once running. Typical error: Caused by: java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.io.FilePermission /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v713/runtime/maci64/libmwmclmcrrt.7.13.dylib read) I know that it's killing my access b/cuz of sandbox issues. But, I have to access these dylib files somehow. What is the best/secure way to to integrate these libraries with GWT? Additional info: using Mac OSX 10.6.5 Eclipse JavaEE Helios + GWT 2.1 and app-engine plugin Any help would be awesome. Cheers
