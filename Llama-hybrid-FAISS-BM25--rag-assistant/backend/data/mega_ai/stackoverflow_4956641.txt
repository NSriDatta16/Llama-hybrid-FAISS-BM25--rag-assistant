(iphone) uiscrollview not scrolling even though it receives touchesBegan/moved/ended event

I've set scrollView.userInteractionEnabled to NO so that superview catches the touch event. In appropriate times, from one of my custom view class I call scrollView.userInteractionEnabled = YES; [scrollView touchesBegan: touches withEvent: event]; or moved/ended similarly. I can see that my scrollView is getting the touche event messages with my debug output. But I don't see it scrolling how could this be? contentSize is big enough and scrollEnabled is YES. (When I set scrollView.userInteractionEnabled = YES at start up, the scrollView scrolls fine) for instance, my subclass of UIScrollView has - (void) touchesBegan: (NSSet *) touches withEvent: (UIEvent *) event { SYSLOG(LOG_DEBUG, "MyScrollView touchesBegan"); [self setUserInteractionEnabled: YES]; [self setScrollEnabled: YES]; [super touchesBegan: touches withEvent: event]; } Edit overloading touchesBegan in a view class or view controller class makes a difference maybe?
