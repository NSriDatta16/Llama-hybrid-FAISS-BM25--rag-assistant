Typical measures of autocorrelation, such as Moran's I, are global estimates of clumpiness and could be masked by a trend or by "averaging" of clumpiness. There are two ways you could handle this: Use a local measure of autocorrelation - but the drawback is you don't get a single number for clumpiness. An example of this would be Local Moran's I* Here is a document (from a google search) that at least introduces the terms and gives some derivations http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-4146.00224/abstract Use a statistic specifically geared towards point distributions and their clumpieness at various spatial scales, such as Ripley's K. This metric is global as well but it lets you look at clumpiness as you change scale of analysis. This way you might see, for example, your data is clustered at 2m scale but uniform at 50m scale. http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Ripley%27s+K&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart
