I suggest having an interface such as "Character", which defines what all of these entities should be able to do. Then your Dragon and Wizard classes are just implementations. Another route is to have a Base class from which you extend from and use this to control the "hierarchical sprawl" associated with large projects, by drawing out a hierarchy of your objects and identifying extended base classes.
