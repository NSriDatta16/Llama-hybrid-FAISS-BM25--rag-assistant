Is this an example of a multiple comparisons problem?

I am conducting a comprehensive research determining the effect of 3 independent variables on the metabolic rate of an organism. However, the set-up of my data analysis leads me to believe that I might be committing a multiple comparisons problem or some other violation. Lets say that my dependent/numerical variable is rate, and the 3 independent variables are race (black and white), gender (male and female), and eye color (blue, green). All of my independent variables are dichotomous. METHOD 1: performing TukeyHSD on all my samples #####My entire compiled dataset consisting of 250 samples########## detach() attach(mydata) hist(rate) compiled METHOD 2: Subsetting my data #######Only Black males detach() sub1 #######Only Black females detach() sub3 #######Only white males detach() sub5 #######Only white females detach() sub7 #######Only blue eyes males detach() sub9 #######Only blue eyes females detach() sub11 #######Only green eyes males detach() sub13 #######Only green eyes females detach() sub15 The last 4 subsets would follow this same format, but test rate~gender. In most cases, the individual Anova among each subset varies from the pairwise analyses from the TukeyHSD. TukeyHSD on the entire dataset is not appropriate since race, gender, and eye color each are dichotomous variables. What analyses should I go for?Are the subsets a valid way of statistically analyzing my data, or is this a violation of multiple comparisons problem? Thank you in advance, and I apologize for this confusing explanation.
