If you actually want to plot the information of more than 100.000 teams I would only plot the T1 and T2 time for each team on a density plot. So put T1 and T2 on the x and y axis, separate both into bins (like 1 min intervals) and the plot on each square of the grid the number of teams in that square coded via a color or grey scale variation. If on average the T2 times are shorter than the T1 times, you should see more density in the bottom right of the plot and less in the top left. If you only plot a handful of teams you could make use of a lot more of the columns in your data and completely different plot types would be appropriate.
