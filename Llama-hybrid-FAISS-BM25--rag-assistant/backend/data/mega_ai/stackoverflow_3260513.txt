Why should I upgrade to c# 4.0?

I know there are some nice new features in C# 4.0 but I can't, for the life of me, think of a compelling reason for either upgrading existing projects or for switching to new projects. I've seen some posts where people have said that if their hosting service didn't provide .Net 4 that they'd find another provider as .Net 4 was pinicle to their direction . Now my boss is trying to get me to agree to switch all our production environments to C# 4 and to do it now. So the question is has anyone either began using, or converted a project to, C# 4 for a compelling reason? Was there a feature that you just had to have that would make your life so much easier?
