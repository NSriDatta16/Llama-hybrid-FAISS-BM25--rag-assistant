As per your previous question , you're referencing the resource in a HTML tag. All URLs in the HTML source code must be http:// URLs (or at least be relative to a http:// URL). Most browsers namely refuse to load resources from file:// URLs when the HTML page is itself been requested by http:// . You just need to let the URL point to the servlet. If the servlet's doGet() method get hit, then the URL is fine and you should not change it. Your concrete problem is in the way how you open and read the desired file in the servlet. You need to ensure that the path in File file = new File(path) points to a valid location before you open a FileInputStream on it. String path = "file://myip/storage/ogg/VX-276.ogg"; File file = new File(path); // ... If the servlet code is well written that it doesn't suppress/swallow exceptions and you have read the server logs, then you should have seen an IOException such as FileNotFoundException along with a self-explaining message in the server logs whenever reading the file fails. Go read the server logs. Update as per the comments, it turns out that you're using Windows and thus file:// on a network disk isn't going to work for Java without mapping it on a drive letter. You need to map //myip on a drive letter first, for example X: . String path = "X:/storage/ogg/VX-276.ogg"; File file = new File(path); // ...
