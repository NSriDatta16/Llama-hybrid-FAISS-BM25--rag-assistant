How can I create my web pages Read Only for peoples?

I have a website http://www.bccfalna.com/ and the contents on this site are in HINDI Language. I want to make all these pages read only for peoples so that they can not copy the content. Since I have written some books in HINDI Language on Computer Technology and I know that there are very few Information in HINDI language on the Internet about the Computer and I.T. Technology so I want to sell my EBooks in PDF format. To show the usefulness of the contents of my books, I have placed all the contents in TEXT format in my website, so that people can see, read and can make decision to buy the book if the book is useful for them. Since I have placed my whole books in Content form on my site so that various search engines also can give more and more traffic to my site but I am afraid that since I have placed all my content on my site in text form, any one can copy and will not be interested to buy them as PDF Format EBOOK. I want that people can Read the content of my site but can not be able to copy the contents in any word processor. Is it possible? I don't want to make image like content, because Google, Yahoo like modern search engines don't gives too much importance to image sites. I don't want to use Flash like sites too. The reason is same. Modern Search Engines don't gives too much attention to these kinds of sites. I want my contents in TEXT format but I want to make them READ ONLY. Is it possible? If Yes: I would like to know HOW? and if No, I would like to get the alternative type solution. Is there someone Genius to solve this problem? Thanks.
