Common Neural Network practice

I am in the early stage of studying the Neural Network . Here are the list I made during the online classes. Shuffle the data Normalized the data by Sk-learn: StandardScalar Initialized the weight with He initialization Use adaptive learning rate L2, L1 optimization Train in mini-batch size Change cost function They are 7 cases I have to do when I need to find tune the accuracy. Are they any topic left behind? Or some of them is redundant to do? Do you normally follow all of these? Or not do if the accuracy is high enough?
