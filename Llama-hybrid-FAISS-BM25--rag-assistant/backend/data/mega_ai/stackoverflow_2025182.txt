Is there's a clear industry standard for developing web based UIs using Java related technologies? Well, Sun's Java EE standard is Java Server Faces (JSF) but the version 1.x of JSF is IMHO a kind of failure. This explains why they are so many alternative out there. But NO , there is no clear winner. Ideally I would like to learn a framework which I can use in the majority of real world jobs (and preferably one which can be used from Eclipse). Actually, Matt Raible has done very famous presentations on presentation frameworks that you'll find in Comparing JVM Web Frameworks Presentation (the latest version goes beyond Java frameworks only). Really, have a look at both of them, this is very, very good material (with real life metrics). Personally, I'm a JSF 1.x skeptic so I would not go in this direction (there isn't lots of demand for JSF in my country anyway) but rather choose an alternative. I think that Struts 2, Spring MVC, Stripes (this one is my preferred one), Wicket (this one is getting more and more attention) are all decent choices, they'll all get the job done, the 2 first one being I believe more asked on the job market (but not the smartest). For the final choice, I'd follow Matt's advice: Eliminate, Don't Include . If the popularity on the jobs market is an important criteria, then I guess Stripes and Wicket will get eliminated. If configuration verbosity is a concern, Stripes wins. If you're looking for a kind of Swing experience, Wicket is your friend. Now, I need to mention that the freshly released JSF 2 and CDI (JSR 299) should be a big improvement (according to the people who worked on it). As I said, I'm a JSF skeptic and I need to take a second look (because Gavin says so ). But I still didn't so I can't say anything for now and I won't make any bet on the adoption and future market demand of this new version. But it's worth noting that JSF 2 with CDI should be a really new and different experience.
