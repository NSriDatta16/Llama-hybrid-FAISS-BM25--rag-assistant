Error Creating Control - Cannot find web project item

I'm getting this error: Error Creating Control - Label1 Cannot find web project item 'http://localhost:61952/WebSite/Default.aspx'. (It's a Visual Studio 2010 Website.) Can't view Labels, User Controls, nothing in design view... Can't drag and drop controls from the tool box either... I have no idea what caused this problem... Any hints? Thanks.
