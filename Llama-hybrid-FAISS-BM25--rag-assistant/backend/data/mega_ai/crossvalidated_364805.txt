Should I include zeroes in my dataset for a machine learning study?

I am trying to predict the taxi demand in New York city depending on pickup location and hour. I am constructing a dataset of taxi pickups grouped by the tracts in NYC and hour of the day. However, there are tracts where no taxi pickup took place for a certain time. Should I include those observations with zero pickups in my dataset? It gives me more information if I add them, but on the other hand my dataset gets much bigger and, hence, computational costs increase.
