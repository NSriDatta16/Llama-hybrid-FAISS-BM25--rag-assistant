Often times, I've needed to display a user-friendly value based on an Enum value, but didn't want to go the custom Attribute route, as it didn't seem too elegant. With this handy extension method: public static string EnumValue(this MyEnum e) { switch (e) { case MyEnum.First: return "First Friendly Value"; case MyEnum.Second: return "Second Friendly Value"; case MyEnum.Third: return "Third Friendly Value"; } return "Horrible Failure!!"; } I can do this: Console.WriteLine(MyEnum.First.EnumValue()); Yay!
