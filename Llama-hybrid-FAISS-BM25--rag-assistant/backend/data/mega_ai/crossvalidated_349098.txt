What you are dealing with is multinomial response data, which is usually modelled using some kind of multinomial response model (e.g., multinomial logit regression, etc.). You have two categorical output variables with three possible outcomes, which gives you $3 \times 3 = 9$ possible outputs in total. As David Dale has suggested in his answer, you should combine your two outputs into a single categorical variable with these nine possible outcomes. Modelling this categorical variable using a multinomial response model will give estimated probabilities for each of these nine outputs, which also gives you implicit estimation of the marginal probabilities and correlations for the individual output variables. Since multinomial outputs from an exchangeable sequence of observations are, by definition, perfectly fit by the multinomial distribution, the only real question in fitting a multinomial response model is whether the particular regression and link functions you use give reasonable estimates of the probabilities. As with any data-modelling exercise, we cannot specify the best model a priori - this must be assessed by the fit of the data to different models, as judged by diagnostic plots, etc. However, a reasonable starting point would be a multinomial logit model (classical or Bayesian). I would suggest you try fitting this model to your data and see how the diagnostic plots look, and whether your link seems reasonable. Assuming this model is not falsified by the diagnostic plots, it will give you estimated probabilities of each possible outcome (out of nine outcomes), from which you can calculate marginal and conditional probabilities and correlations for the two outputs.
