Most commonly used and implemented discrete wavelet basis functions (as distinct from the CWT described in Robin's answer) have two nice properties that make them useful for anomaly detection: They're compactly supported. They act as band-pass filters with the pass-band determined by their support. What this means in practical terms is that your discrete wavelet decomposition looks at local changes in the signal across a variety of scales and frequency bands. If you have (for instance) large-magnitude, high-frequency noise superimposed across a function that displays a low-magnitude shift over a longer period, the wavelet transform will efficiently separate these two scales and let you see the baseline shift that many other techniques will miss; a shift in this baseline can suggest a disease outbreak or some other change of interest. In a lot of ways, you can treat the decomposition itself as a smoother (and there's been quite a bit of work done on efficient shrinkage for wavelet coefficients in nonparametric estimation, see e.g. pretty much anything on wavelets by Donoho). Unlike pure frequency-based methods, the compact support means that they're capable of handling non-stationary data. Unlike purely time-based methods, they allow for some frequency-based filtering. In practical terms, to detect anomalies or change points, you would apply a discrete wavelet transform (probably the variant known either as the "Maximum Overlap DWT" or "shift invariant DWT", depending on who you read) to the data, and look at the lower-frequency sets of coefficients to see if you have significant shifts in the baseline. This will show you when a long-term change is occurring underneath any day-to-day noise. Percival and Walden (see references below) derive a few tests for statistically significant coefficients that you could use to see if a shift like this is significant or not. An excellent reference work for discrete wavelets is Percival and Walden, "Wavelet Methods for Time Series Analysis". A good introductory work is "Introduction to wavelets and wavelet transforms, a primer" by Burrus, Gopinath, and Guo. If you're coming from an engineering background, then "Elements of wavelets for engineers and scientists" is a good introduction from a signal-processing point of view.
