regarding the elements of array_? What property holds for them in each case? Nothing is said about the elements. The only thing that is guaranteed is that the array_ reference is not null. Note the difference between Object[] array = null; and for instance Object[] array_ = { null }; or Object[] array_ = { }; The first line would violate the invariant, while the latter two would be allowed, as array_ would point to an actual array (even though this array may only contain null elements or even no elements at all). Another difference is that in the invariant array_ != null; approach, array_ != null must only hold before after each method, while if you use the non_null pragma array_ != null must hold at every control point throughout the program.
