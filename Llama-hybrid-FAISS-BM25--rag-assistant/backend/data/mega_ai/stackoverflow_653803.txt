How should the Request Body look like?

I have a WCF service with a method which looks like this (returns null for testing with the debugger, I care only about getting data in for now): [OperationContract] [WebInvoke(Method = "POST", UriTemplate = "fares", RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json, BodyStyle = WebMessageBodyStyle.WrappedRequest)] public List GetFares(Dictionary itineraries, decimal? threshold, bool includeInternational) { return null; } I am trying to make a request to that method using Fiddler, but can't get my head around on what the correct Request Body should be. I could change the Dictionary parameter to something else if that works better. In Request Headers I pass: User-Agent: Fiddler Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 What should I put in the body?
