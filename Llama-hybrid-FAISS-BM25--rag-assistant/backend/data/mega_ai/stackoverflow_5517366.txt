Honeycomb Gmail Fragment shift

I'm wondering how when you open a new Fragment , you can have the view shift so that the new Fragment is centered in your view. In the Honeycomb Gmail app we see this when you select an email to open. The list of emails that you can open shifts to the left side of the screen and the email contents is then shown on the right. How do make this shift happen? Thanks.
