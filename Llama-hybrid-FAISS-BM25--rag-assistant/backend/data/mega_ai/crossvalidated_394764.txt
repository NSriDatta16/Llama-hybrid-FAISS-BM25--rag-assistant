A partial dependence plot for a logistic-type model is constructed by setting all but one feature to fixed, static values, varying the remaining feature throughout a range, and plotting: $$ t \mapsto \log \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right) $$ Where $p$ is the (probability) prediction for your model when the varied feature is set to the value $t$ . Note that, in particular, the $y$ -axis of a partial dependency plot is measured on the log-odds scale, not the probability scale. For a standard logistic regression, the functional form of your model is: $$ \log \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k $$ So the form of the partial dependence plot is: $$ t \mapsto \beta_j t + \text{constant} $$ where $j$ is the index of the feature you are constructing the partial dependence plot of. This is why you get a line, the slope of that line is the parameter estimate $\hat \beta_j$ in the regression. In a random forest the functional form of your model is: $$ p = \text{average} \left( T_0(x), T_1(x), \ldots, T_{\text{n_trees}}(x) \right) $$ where the $T(x)$ 's are the probability predictions from your individual classification trees. So the partial dependence plot is the unwieldy: $$ t \mapsto \log \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right) = \frac{\text{average} \left( T_0(t), T_1(t), \ldots, T_{\text{n_trees}}(t) \right)}{1 - \text{average} \left( T_0(t), T_1(t), \ldots, T_{\text{n_trees}}(t) \right)} $$ This can be a very complicated, non-linear function of any individual feature, resulting in a vast multitude of possible shapes for the partial dependence plots. The fact that you are seeing a soft threshold shape is due to the particulars of the problem you are solving, not something structural about partial dependence plots.
