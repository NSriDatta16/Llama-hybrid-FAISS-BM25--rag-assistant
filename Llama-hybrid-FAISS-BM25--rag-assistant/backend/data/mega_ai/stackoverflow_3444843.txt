Can a regex be used as input method?

I saw somewhere that a regex can be used as an input method, is this possible? How? I really don't know anything else about that, I supposed that there's a way to procude Strings from a regex and feed an object with that String, again, this is only what I pictured and I don't know if it's even possible. EDIT I know I didn't explain myself, I was in a hurry, sorry for that. Well, long story short. Last week I saw an article about regex, and in one paragraph said "regex could be used as input", thats all it said about that, I couldn't find the article again so I think I could ask here. Thanks for the votes down. Next time I'll make sure to explain correctly my doubts and to not piss someone off...
