I have a work-in-progress Serialization lib that I've been working on. (Some commentary here .) It's not done but it works, it just lacks a lot of polish and "convenience" features. If you are interested in using it, I'd be interested in feedback and feature requests. As for DB storage, I'd just go with SQLite or MySQL. From what I've read, the query optimizers for DBs use more information than you can have a compile time (they look at data distributions and such). OTOH I have been thinking of making a compile time SQL engine that uses meta-programming to build query plans at compile time. I've got a few other projects that I'll need to get done first though (like a file_malloc to allocate space in a file.)
