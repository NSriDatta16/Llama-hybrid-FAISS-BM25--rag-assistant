If disk space is a concern, you really need bigger hard drives. Even in a redundant, secure environment, they're cheap enough that it's ridiculous to ever have to think about them. As for how often you check in, it's often going to be a matter of personal policy. Within my own seven-coder team, I tend to check in once per job ticket while one coworker averages about six check-ins a day. It's really a matter of what you're comfortable with. The only official policy is: Don't break the build and don't break working features. If you may have to hand over your work mid-stream, check in more often. This works for us.
