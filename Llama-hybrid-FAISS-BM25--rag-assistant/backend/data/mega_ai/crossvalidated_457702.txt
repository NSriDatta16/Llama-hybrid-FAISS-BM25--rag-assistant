Suitable prediction model for data with longitudinal and time invariant predictors

I have a data set that obtained from a study that conducted at multiple time points(waves).Basically there are 4 waves. I used the data from first 3 waves to obtain the predictors and the response (dependent) variable is from wave 4. My goal is to develop a prediction model to predict response in wave 4 from the predictors in wave 1-3. Predictors can be longitudinal(time varying) or can be time invariant (such predictor can be gender). Longitudinal predictors can be from all 3 waves or it can be from 2 waves out of 3. My response variable is a binary variable. For further clarification, this is how my data looks like. ID X1T1 X1T2 X1T3 X2T1 X2T2 X3 Y 1 . . . . . . . 2 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . N . . . . . . . I would want to know, what type of techniques can be applied to analysis this type of data . I know it is not suitable to use standard logistic regression model due to presence of time varying predictors. I went through this paper also : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22246815 . But it contains how to analysis this type of data, when response also time varying. Any suggestion would be great. Thank you
