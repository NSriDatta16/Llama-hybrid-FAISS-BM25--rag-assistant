Why does the deployment package from my buildserver have additional assemblies?

I've got an asp.net mvc deployment package that I'm trying to build with team city. The package builds without any problems, but the bin folder contains file that are not needed (and cause the site to fail when present). If I build the same package from visual studio the additional files are not present. The additional files are: Microsoft.VisualBasic.Activities.Compiler.dll mscorlib.dll normidna.nlp normnfc.nlp normnfd.nlp normnfkc.nlp normnfkd.nlp System.Data.dll System.Data.OracleClient.dll System.EnterpriseServices.dll System.EnterpriseServices.Wrapper.dll System.Transactions.dll What can I do to prevent these additional assemblies and .nlp files from being included in the package? UPDATE After a bit more digging through log files I've found that the _CopyFilesMarkedCopyLocal build task is copying the files into the bin directory. The odd thing is that the assemblies are not marked as copy local.
