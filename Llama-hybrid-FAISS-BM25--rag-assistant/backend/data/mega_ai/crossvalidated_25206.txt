As @gmacfarlane suggests, you should probably use multiple imputation. However, it's not necessary that anything be normally distributed. Most good software, including the Amelia package will impute other kinds of data as necessary. Indeed one of the nice things about Amelia is that it can also take into account the fact that your data is a time series. For multiple imputation to work your data should be 'missing completely at random' (MCAR) or 'missing at random' (MAR) which are (very regrettably) technical terms in this field. See other questions on this site for a definition of MCAR and MAR. Alternatively slides 14-19 of @guest's link provide some more details. Specific to your question: you should use anything that might be informative to impute your missing data. Specifically that includes the complete data you have from 1980 and later. (Counterintuitively, it also includes any dependent variable values you might be working with.) Using all the information you have to impute will ensure you are not actively introducing any discontinuities. The only constraint is that you should ideally not have a final analysis model with variables not available to the imputation model; that really might cause artifactual discontinuities. After you've imputed your half dozen completed data sets, you run the analysis you originally wanted to do on each imputed dataset and combine the results. The multiple imputation FAQ discusses how to do this, and also the issues above.
