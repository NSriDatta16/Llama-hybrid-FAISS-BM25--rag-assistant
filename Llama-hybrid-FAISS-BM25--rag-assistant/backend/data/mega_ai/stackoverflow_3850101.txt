If you are absolutely certain no copies will end up in the Session storage or will be persisted/migrated to another instance/whatever, there is no need to do it. If you need to keep these objects over multiple sessions/requests then it makes sense. Another use-case is when you need to decouple loginc and persistence layer very thoroughly (i.e. to swap different persistence layers) then the coupling through the annotations could be troublesome.
