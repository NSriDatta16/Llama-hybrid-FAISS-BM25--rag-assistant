Are Measurements made on the same patient independent?

I am currently working on the classification of pulmonary diseases using spirometry. This is a procedure in which the patient blows air in a tube and we collect air volume, pressure, etc, in order to obtain the spirometric parameters. My question is : If I perform the spirometry in the same patient three times, can I consider these three exams, at the same day, to be three different data points in my training of testing set or it is better to average the results and consider only one data point? If the patient comes in a different day, can I considered this exams to be independent? I think it is okay to consider the exams to be different data points, but I would like to hear other opinions.
