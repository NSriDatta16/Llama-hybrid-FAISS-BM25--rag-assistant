I made JPanel component in NetBeans with overridden paint method: @Override public void paint(Graphics g) { super.paint(g); Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g; ... //draw elements ... } It has some custom properties accessible through NetBeans properties window. public int getResolutionX() { return resolutionX; } public void setResolutionX(int resolutionX) { this.resolutionX = resolutionX; } public int getResolutionY() { return resolutionY; } public void setResolutionY(int resolutionY) { this.resolutionY = resolutionY; } I put it in my palette using: Tools->Palette->Swing/AWT Components. It even has the same look I painted in my overridden paint method while I am doing drag/drop in another container. I didn't associate icon to it though. Hope this helps.
