Interesting. I like using plots, but I don't like the first two. William S. Cleveland, who is a leading expert on statistical graphics, has shown that stacked bar charts are not a great method of showing this kind of comparison. The third plot is (as the code shows) a mosaic plot. I think these should be used more. But, at least for this graphic, I would make one category out of everyone below \$10,000. And you should put the x-axis on two lines (I don't know how to do this in ggplot, because I don't use that). For statistics, rather than chi-square, I would use regression. I would start with an ordinal logistic regression where the dependent variable is politics and the independent variable is income. (And, for that, I would NOT lump categories of income together, unless they were causing problems with estimation). Finally, on choice of color, a very good site is Color Brewer. Since income is a single, ordinal variable, I would use one color and change intensity or saturation. R has an RColorBrewer package. (I know the site for Color Brewer says "for maps" but it is broader than that).
