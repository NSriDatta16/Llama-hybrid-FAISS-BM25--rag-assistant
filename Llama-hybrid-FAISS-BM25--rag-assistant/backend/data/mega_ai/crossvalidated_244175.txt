Your model should have a set of residuals that can be represented by a random process. These residuals should have a constant mean i.e. no pulses/no mean shifts/no trend and a constant error variance over time . These residuals should not be predictable by either contemporaneous or lag effects of any of your user specified variables. Multiple Linear Regression is never a good choice when you have time series data unless your resultant model generates errors/residuals that reflect a random process. EDITED TO SUGGEST THE SUGGESTED SCRIPT: I would use Transfer Function Identification using cross-correlations (pre-whitening to adjust for auto-correlation within each predictor series for identification purposes) to form a possible contemporaneous and lag effects model. I would then add in 51 weekly dummies in addition to the aforementioned contemporaneous and lag effects. I would examine the tentative residuals for pulses/level shifts/local time trends and augment the tentative model appropriately. I would estimate this model and delete (slowly !) any and all insignificant variables. I would then review the acf of the newly formed tentative error process and augment the current model with an appropriate ARIMA structure. I would then (again) delete any and all non-significant structure yielding a minimally sufficient ( and possibly useful !) model. If this is too much trouble or work or beyond your software's capabilities then just assume a textbook model and pray ....
