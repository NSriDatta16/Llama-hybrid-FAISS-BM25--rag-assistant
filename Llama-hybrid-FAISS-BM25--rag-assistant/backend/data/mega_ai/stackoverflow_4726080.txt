For me the problem was that Web Deployment Agent Service was not started. A simple net start msdepsvc fixed it. You could also set startup mode to Automatic on this service. The arguments I'm using are: /p:DeployOnBuild=True /p:DeployTarget=MsDeployPublish /p:MSDeployPublishMethod=RemoteAgent /p:MSDeployServiceUrl=stagingserver /p:DeployIisAppPath=test.local /p:UserName= You only need to specify the server name, and not the full path (no http needed). Note that UserName is left empty to work around a bug with NTLM authentication (this way it uses the credentials of the TFS build agent for the deployment). see the accepted answer here
