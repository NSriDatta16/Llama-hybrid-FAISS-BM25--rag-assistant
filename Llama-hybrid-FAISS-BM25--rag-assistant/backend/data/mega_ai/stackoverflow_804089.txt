Depends on your priorities. If performance is your absolute driving characteristic, then by all means use the fastest one. Just make sure you have a full understanding of the differences before you make a choice Unlike serialize() you need to add extra parameter to keep UTF-8 characters untouched: json_encode($array, JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE) (otherwise it converts UTF-8 characters to Unicode escape sequences). JSON will have no memory of what the object's original class was (they are always restored as instances of stdClass). You can't leverage __sleep() and __wakeup() with JSON By default, only public properties are serialized with JSON. (in PHP>=5.4 you can implement JsonSerializable to change this behavior). JSON is more portable And there's probably a few other differences I can't think of at the moment. A simple speed test to compare the two
