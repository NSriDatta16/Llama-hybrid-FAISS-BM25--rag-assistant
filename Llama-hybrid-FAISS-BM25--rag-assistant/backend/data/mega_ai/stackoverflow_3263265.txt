Drawable-hdpi, Drawable-mdpi, Drawable-ldpi Android

I was working on Android 1.5, but I have now moved to the latest version. So there is only one "drawable" folder in Android 1.5, but now there are three different folders for storing images in the Android project. And I have found some articles for these three folders that says hdpi means High-dpi mdpi means medium-dpi ldpi means low-dpi But what is the exact purpose of these three folders and when should I use a particular folder to store images in?
