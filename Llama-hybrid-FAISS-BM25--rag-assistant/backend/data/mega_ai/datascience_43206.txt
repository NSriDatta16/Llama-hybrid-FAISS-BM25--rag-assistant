Financial Time Series data normalization

I'm using Keras in R to predict financial time series. It's easy to normalize price, simply compute returns or log returns, usually it's enough. I want to use Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index and MSCI World Index to predict other securitites and I want to use levels and their returns or first differences. I think that using minmax or z-score normalization is not appropriate because series distribution will change. So, the question is how to normalize nonstationary time series data?
