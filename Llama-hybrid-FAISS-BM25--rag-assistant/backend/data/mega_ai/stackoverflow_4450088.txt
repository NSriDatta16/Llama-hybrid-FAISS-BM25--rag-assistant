Physics required to make a basic weighing scale?

Okay so I need to make a basic activity (working Flash/as3) that simulates very basic weighing scales. All the objects that go on to the scales are the same weight. If you imagine the classic weighing scales (http://www.metalminnie.co.uk/mm1/scales-S1055936773790.JPG) - we are dragging/dropping stuff on to the sides and animating accordingly. I don't want anything fancy, just the maths required to affect the scales according to how many objects are on each side. What I'm looking for is probably the angle of rotation of the horizontal arm. Any pointers?
