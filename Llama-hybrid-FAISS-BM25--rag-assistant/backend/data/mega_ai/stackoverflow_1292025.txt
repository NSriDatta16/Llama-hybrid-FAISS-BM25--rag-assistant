You can use java web start to launch an application from a desktop shortcut as well. If you do, then the web start framework can download and install JREs just as if it was started from a browser. If you distribute the application as a browser based web start application then you can set properties in the jnlp file that creates start menu and/or desktop icons on first launch. If you choose another distribution form you can manually create a shortcut that will call javaws instead.
