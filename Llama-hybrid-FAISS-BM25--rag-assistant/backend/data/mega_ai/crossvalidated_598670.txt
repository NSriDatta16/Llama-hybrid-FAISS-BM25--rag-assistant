How do you determine that the intercept is the same for both methods of delivery $w$ , from a plot of the observed probability of survival $p$ against the dose $x$ ? Recall that a logistic regression is a linear model for the log odds (here, of survival): $$ \begin{aligned} \log\frac{\operatorname{P}(Y)}{1-\operatorname{P}(Y)} =\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} \end{aligned} $$ So it's more informative to plot the log odds of survival on the y-axis: This plot doesn't suggest to me to specify that the slope is the same for both $w$ but to add a quadratic term for $x$ . Here are two fits, both on the logit scale (the link function of the logistic regression is the logit). The first fit is for the model y ~ x + x:w ; it has the same intercept, different slopes for $w$ . The second fit is for the model y ~ w + rcs(x, 3) : restricted cubic splines with 3 knots in the dose $x$ , with a vertical shift between the two methods of delivery $w$ . The second model suggests that the relationship between dose and the log odds of survival is mostly linear for $x\geq2$ . Created on 2022-12-11 with reprex v2.0.2
