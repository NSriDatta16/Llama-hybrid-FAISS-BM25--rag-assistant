Populate list via a bi-Condition

im interested to implement something but im not sure if it would be possible and would like your intake on it. here is my scenario: i will have two validation cells which will be shown as List that I will pick from. those are my condition that i would like to meet and ommit my list from a database. I have a list of agents going threw B13:B23 and next two them i have columns of data assuming that my data base looks like this B C D E X | Y | Z agent1 1 | 1 | 0 agent2 0 | 1 | 0 agent3 0 | 1 | 1 agent4 1 | 0 | 0 ... i want to populate a list of agent name from column B, when i select from the validation cell1: X and validation cell2: 1. it should show only column: agent1 agent4 or agents in column X with 0... i read somewhere about array formula but i dont know if this is convenient and i unfortunately dont have any background in macros:( but i know in C++ something like this is fairly easy with conditional statements. thanks in advance,
