No, a confusion matrix doesn't make sense here. While you are assigning inputs to clusters, you do not know which cluster is 'correct' for each input. That is, it is not a supervised multi-class classification problem. You do not even know what each cluster "means". All you can measure here are metrics like intra-cluster distance: how far on average are points from their assigned cluster? Lower is better. Metrics like silhouette score are probably even better: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)
