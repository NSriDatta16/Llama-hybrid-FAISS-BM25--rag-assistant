The Storage-Model is tied to a specific provider, which will cause the Entity Framework to reject any DbConnection implementations that are not compatible with the specified provider. If you look at an Entity Framework connection-string, you can see that the StorageSchema, ModelSchema and Mapping are specified in three different files (which are generated from your .edmx and than embedded in the assembly). You could take your .edmx apart and embed the .ssdl, .csdl and .msl yourself and than create another .ssdl for SQL Server CE. This is basically just copy & paste and replacing the provider and some column-types. I wrote about here: Comparison Entity Framework
