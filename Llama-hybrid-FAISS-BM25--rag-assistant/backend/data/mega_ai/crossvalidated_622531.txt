The value of multiple imputation is that, when pooling results across imputed datasets, the uncertainty in the imputed values (which are not known but estimated) is properly captured. Without accounting for this uncertainty you will likely end up with standard errors which are too small. For an inferential statistic like a regression coefficient, this is the reason you can't simply 'pool' the data by averaging across imputations before fitting the model. You need to account for between-imputation variance for standard errors to be valid. It seems like some of the things you plan to present won't have associated uncertainty (visualisations, etc). I'm sure it depends on the particulars but in general it seems to me that you're probably safer to use the imputed data rather than complete cases. MI is unbiased if your data are MAR but complete case analysis might not be. So in this case why not just 'pool' your data by averaging across imputations? The fact that between-imputation variance isn't properly captured isn't so much a problem when you aren't presenting uncertainty anyway. As a caveat, these are my personal intuitions and a genuine missing data expert may say differently!
