You need: to pick one registry server declare ( mktag and register ) the other vob from the other registry server in the first one make sure the global path of the other vob is accessible from your client and from the first vob server (Windows to Unix can work, with, for instance, Samba. But if your VOB server, the one that you pick, is a Unix one, it won't be able to access VOB managed by a Windows Vob server) Note: the hard part is to mktag and register the other vob in your registry server: you cannot do it in command line, because it will try to modify some files in the vob storage (which your first registry server has no right to do) You can however do it graphically: launch ccadminconsole.msc Select the 'Registry' section: create a new VOB object
