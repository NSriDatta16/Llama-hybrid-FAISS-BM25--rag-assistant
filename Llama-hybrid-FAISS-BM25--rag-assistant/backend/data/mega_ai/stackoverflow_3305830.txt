Nice excerpt from wikipedia: Serialization, however, breaks the opacity of an abstract data type by potentially exposing private implementation details. To discourage competitors from making compatible products, publishers of proprietary software often keep the details of their programs' serialization formats a trade secret. Some deliberately obfuscate or even encrypt the serialized data. Another words, serialization in itself is not secure at all, since it can potentially expose data rather than obfuscate or hide data. Human-readable serialization probably makes this dilemma worse. As a totally side note, may I suggest looking at protocol buffers rather than serialization? http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/faq.html Protobuf-net Also: Jon Skeet's C# port of the protocol buffers (from Java, I believe...)
