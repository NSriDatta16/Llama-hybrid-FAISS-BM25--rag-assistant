ActiveRecord BelongsToAssociation sometimes not resolving to object

So, I've got a couple of models in Rails 2.3.11: class RememberToken And in a controller, I do: tok = RememberToken.find_by_token(token_str) if tok u = tok.user ... end When I go to do something with u, it turns out it's an instance of ActiveRecord::Associations::BelongsToAssociation , not ActiveRecord::Base . When I change the code to: u = User.find(tok.user_id) all works well. But this is not Best Practices in Rails-land. Even more frustratingly, the first example only fails in my controller -- doing the same in script/console works fine. I suspect that this behavior started when we upgraded Rails from 2.3.8 to 2.3.11, but it's hard to know for certain. I'm completely baffled by this behavior -- any suggestions?
