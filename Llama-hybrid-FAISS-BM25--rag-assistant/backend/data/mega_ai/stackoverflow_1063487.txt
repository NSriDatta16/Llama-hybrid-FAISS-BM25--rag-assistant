This depends on the weight you want to give to each level. If I were you I would choose the first method that you mentioned (i.e. put the same weight on items on the same level) so 1 with 50% would look right to me and the difference of having more nodes would be seen by a slower increase of 'done' percentage for 1.2 node. To get a node to affect more distant ancestors you could calculate the ancestor percentage as an average of all the leafs in its subtree (that would give 33% completion for task 1), but this doesn't seem quite right to me. It all depends on how you really want to represent the data - I don't think there's a 'right' way of doing it.
