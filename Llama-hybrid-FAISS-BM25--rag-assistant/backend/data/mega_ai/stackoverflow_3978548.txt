You could also try a code coverage tool. For example, if you have Resharper and dotCover , you can run your application (via the dotCover->Cover Application... menu item) and when the application finishes, dotCover will show you which lines of code were run in the VS IDE by highlighting them in green. Lines of code which where not run are coloured in red. I don't know if there are other tools which do this, but it's an option.
