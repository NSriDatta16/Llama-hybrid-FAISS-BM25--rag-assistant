How do I create an Image Dataset for a CNN?

I'm currently working on assembling a CNN for image classification with tensorflow.keras. I have all my images in a file which I already uploaded to my program. Also I have CSV-Files for training and testing which includes the Name of the imagefile and the classification (8 classes possible) split by a semicolon. Example: Imagefile: Image01.png Classification: Cat What it looks like in CSV file: Image01;Cat Image02;Bird Image03;Dog ... I have no clue how to deal with this input data. What I wann do is, that I wanna have the images somehow as x_train/x_test and the classifications as y_train/y_test so I can use that in my CNN. The CNN is built like the simple example on the Tensorflow website ( https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn ) Can anybody help?
