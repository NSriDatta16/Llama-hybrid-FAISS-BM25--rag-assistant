How to write unit tests for widget code?

Now I'm experiencing a problem about in testing, We have developed a platform with C++, and this platform include 2 layers, one is engine layer, the other one is widget layer, and I'm a dev in widget layer, The widget layer used by client app (those app is our product), now the problem is this: 1, We want to add some unit test for widget layer to enhance our whole platform quality and reliability, but in fact, this platform has been release for several versions, so now, what's kind of unit test could be most suitable for our project? To add some unit test in kinds of validation/bad input/path cover/stress or to add some unit test that simulate the client scenario? I think the former one will enhance code coverage very well, but i also think about that if we can simulate how our client using those api in their application, those unit test maybe more make sense for our platform, right? 2, just as i mentioned before, i'm in widget layer which is above and depended on engine layer, but we has no authority for engine layer code, and almost all widget API could call in engine layer, so it's difficult for us to implement good path cover unit test for those api, because we have no idea(and no document)about engine layer code, but i still want to ask, is there any ways, tools or frameworks could make someone write high quality unit test to cover path for those black box API?
