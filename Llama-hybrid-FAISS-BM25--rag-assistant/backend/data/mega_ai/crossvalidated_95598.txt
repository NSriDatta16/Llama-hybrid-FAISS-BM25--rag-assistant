Regression analysis for multiple related outcomes

This is my first post in CrossValidated :) I have the dependent variables: 1. Coughing when being fed liquid (Yes/No) 2. Coughing when being fed solid (Yes/No) and an independent variable: 1. Age group I am thinking of using logistic regression method to answer the question "Is coughing related to age?". However, I am not sure how to accommodate both dependent variables in the model. I note the discussion here about multiple related outcome analysis but would like ask for your advice if it's relevant to my analysis. Thanks in advance.
