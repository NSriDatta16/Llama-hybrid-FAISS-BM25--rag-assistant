4 parameter logistic fit

I am trying to fit some enzyme inhibition data by using 4PL. My problem is that the assay I used (AlphaLISA) to generate the data can not be used at high inhibitor concentrations thus, the inhibition can not reach its maximum and IC50 can not be calculated. My question is whether the 4PL analysis is still valid in such case or should I use a different analysis tool? In addition should I average duplicates or should i use them individually as separate data points when applying 4PL?
