This can probably be done in a hand crafted way. No reason to use CNNs. If you do then why don't you pass your second last fully connected layer in to decision tree. Otherwise the problem you are facing is that linear functions are not bounded. So use sigmoid activation on fully connected layers till the last one. If you are facing issue around 180 degrees, i would oversample such cases in the train set so network learns this very strongly
