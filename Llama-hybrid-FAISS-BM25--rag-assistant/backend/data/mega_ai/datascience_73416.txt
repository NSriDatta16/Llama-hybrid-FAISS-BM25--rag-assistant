Since the daily dataset does not contain labels, you could aggregate the daily data into annual and then do the join. It sounds like a (binary) classification problem, which can be done using methods such as logistic regression. You will however have to handle missing values caused by the left join, one method would be imputing them. Or just doing an inner join if the missing data is random without patterns (e.g. companies of certain type don't have missing data more often than the other types) and if there's enough data that is not missing.
