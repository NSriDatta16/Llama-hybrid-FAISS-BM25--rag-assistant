Having had a quick scan on the MySQL reference pages here , they seem to suggest that you cannot add milliseconds to a column of type datetime. The direct quote is "However, microseconds cannot be stored into a column of any temporal data type. Any microseconds part is discarded." This implies that you cannot use Timestamp either. Are the miliseconds necessary? Could they be stored in a secondary column and then recombined with the basic datetime upon retrieval?
