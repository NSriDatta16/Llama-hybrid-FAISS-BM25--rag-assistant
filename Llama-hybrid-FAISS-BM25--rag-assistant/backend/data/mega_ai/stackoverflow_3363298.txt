It depends. A single table is easier to query, and 6 additional fields aren't that much in the way of additional storage. If the number of rows in your existing table is small, or the number of existing columns is already pretty big, then on balance I would add the additional fields to the existing table. On the other hand, if this change would massively inflate the size of an already-large existing table, it would definitely be worth considering setting up a new table.
