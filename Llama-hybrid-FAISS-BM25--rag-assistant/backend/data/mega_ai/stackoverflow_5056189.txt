Let's imagine you get 86,400 entries in a day - over 100 times as much as the 500 you mention. That's still only one per second, on average - and a second is a very long time in CPU terms. Of course, if each of these XML files is several gigabytes in size, then 500 of them is going to be quite a lot to handle. How big are these files likely to be? Basically, this sounds like a non-problem. Find the simplest code you can (which will depend on what else you're doing), work out a budget in terms of how much CPU and data you're content to use, and then benchmark what you've got to decide whether it's good enough or not.
