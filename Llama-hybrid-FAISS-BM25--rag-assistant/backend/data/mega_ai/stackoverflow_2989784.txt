I can't imagine that there would be any sensible way to accurately measure ROI on developer tools and practices. The only thing I can think of where that would might be possible would be in factory environments where you you might be able to measure productivity and average quality. I'd suggest doing what everyone else does, which is pick some formulas that will support what you want and then tweak them until the ROI is high enough to justify the investment.
