Dragging the mouse down to reveal a panel? (using MooTools)

I have a simple DIV panel that I want to slide in when the user clicks and drags a smaller tab. There are plenty of tutorials for showing on click and sliding elements etc, but this requires the user to click once on a button to reveal the panel.
