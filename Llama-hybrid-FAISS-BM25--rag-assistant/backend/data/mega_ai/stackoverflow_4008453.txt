Rspec: testing nested controllers

I have a nested controller that works fine, and I'd like to setup rspec to also test a nested controlled, but it doesn't test the controller unless I specify it. i.e. my rspec test controller is here: /spec/controllers/organizations/memberships_controller.rb but when I run rspec to test everything, it tests everything except the nested controller: bundle exec rspec spec to test the nested controlled, I have to specifically ask rspec to test it: bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/organizations/memberships_controller.rb Is there anyway to make rspec test the nested controlled automatically? Thanks. Sean
