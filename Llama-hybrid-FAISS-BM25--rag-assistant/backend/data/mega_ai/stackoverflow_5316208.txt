This step looks wrong UI: Shrink files: (type =data, group = primary, filename = db name) 1. Release unused space 2. reorganize pages... setting shrink file = 2GB (max it allows) 3. reorganize pages... setting shrink file = 361,360 (min allowed) Among your question steps, this is the right one. Shrink File File type (Data), group (PRIMARY) Name () Shrink Action = reorganize pages (=move to front), Shrink File * Shrink File is entered in MB, so a value of 361,360 would be a third of a Terabyte. The easiest way to set it to minimum is to enter 0, tab out -> it will replace with the min allowed. Right now we need to get the size down to something manageable for backups This is completely the wrong way to go about it. BACKUPs do not include free space, so whether your primary mdf file has 100GB of free space or 1TB, as long as the data resides on 200GB, that is the size of the backup files. For SQL Server 2008, you can use "with compression", which gives an average size of about 1/6th.
