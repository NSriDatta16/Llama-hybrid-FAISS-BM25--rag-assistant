If you subclass NSButton and make your button of that type and override the following in your subclass you can pass the events back to the parent view, in your case the scroll view The following would make the button never trigger an event and instead all would be dealt with by the parent view: - (void)touchesBegan: (NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } - (void)touchesMoved: (NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self.nextResponder touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event]; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { [self.nextResponder touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; } If you want to have the button deal with one of those events instead use [super touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event];
