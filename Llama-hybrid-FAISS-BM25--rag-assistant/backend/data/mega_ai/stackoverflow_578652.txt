Doing a "code-behind" is painful in Flex. There is no concept of partial classes or the flexibility of prototypal inheritance as in Javascript. Google for "code-behind in flex" for many resources. I think it's better you get used to the idea of embedding code in mxml. Use script tags avoiding inline code as much as possible. If you have to write a lot of code within MXML, perhaps you may want to re-factor the code into multiple custom components. Bonus points if they are reusable.
