How to achieve SHAP values for a CatBoost model in R?

I'm asked to create a SHAP analysis in R but I cannot find it how to obtain it for a CatBoost model. I can get the SHAP values of an XGBoost model with shap_values but not for CatBoost . Here is the reproducible code for my CatBoost model: library(data.table) library(catboost) train_example $target train_X categorical_feature How can I proceed to get the SHAP values here?
