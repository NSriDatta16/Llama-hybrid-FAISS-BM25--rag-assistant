Use e.g. the PhpConcept Library Zip library. Resuming must be supported by your webserver except the case where you don't make the zipfiles accessible directly. If you have a php script as mediator then pay attention to sending the right headers to support resuming. The script creating the files shouldn't timeout ever just make sure the users can't select thousands of files at once. And keep something in place to remove "old zipfiles" and watch out that some malicious user doesn't use up your diskspace by requesting many different filecollections.
