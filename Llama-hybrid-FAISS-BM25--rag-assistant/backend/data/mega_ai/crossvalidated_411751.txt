Gauss's Original Gaussian Distribution Proof Help

I am refering to the proof of the guassian from the famous document: https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Allendoerfer/stahl96.pdf I have attached the pictures below of the proof. The proof starts on pg 105. I was unable to understand on pg 106 how this step took place M2 =M3 =···=Mn =M−nN Why are all the observations set to the same value? It just doesnt make any sense, this will never happen in real life. But this is a general proof so there must be something I am missing. [Someone told me that they are not really equal but the statement is saying they can be expressed in that form,however this does not seem so to me] Here are the assumptions used in the proof: Gauss explained that he used the least squares criterion to locate the orbit that best fit the observations [12]. This criterion was justified by a theory of errors that was based on the following three assumptions: Small errors are more likely than large errors. For any real number ε the likelihood of errors of magnitudes ε and −ε are equal. In the presence of several measurements of the same quantity, the most likely value of the quantity being measured is their average. Here is the proof:
