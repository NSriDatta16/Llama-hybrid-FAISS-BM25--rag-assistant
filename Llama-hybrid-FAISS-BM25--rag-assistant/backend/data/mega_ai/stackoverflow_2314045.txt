Best practice for determining the probability that 2 strings match

I need to write code to determine if 2 strings match when one of the strings may contain a small deviation from the second string e.g. "South Africa" v "South-Africa" or "England" v "Enlgand". At the moment, I am considering the following approach Determine the percentage of characters in string 1 that match those in string 2 Determine the true probability of the match by combining the result of 1 with a comparison of the length of the 2 strings e.g. although all the characters in "SA" are found in "South Africa" it is not a very likely match since "SA" could be found in a range of other country names as well. I would appreciate to hear what current best practice is for performing such string matching.
