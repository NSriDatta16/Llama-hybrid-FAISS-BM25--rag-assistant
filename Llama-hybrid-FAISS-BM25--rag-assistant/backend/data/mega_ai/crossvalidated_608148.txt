Determine seasonal frequency from the values of the time series alone

What are some algorithms for determining the seasonal frequency (or equivalently, the length of the seasonal period) from the values of the time series alone? That is, the values of the time series are given, but the time stamps are missing. However, we know the data has been sampled at equal time intervals. (Further nuance could be added to the question, e.g. how this should be approached if our goal is to detect the "true" seasonal frequency vs. if our goal is to forecast the time series optimally under a given evaluation loss function. A motivating example for the latter case can be found here . A reference to an R implementation would be a bonus.)
