Correct interpretation of Kendall's W

This is a follow-up to my earlier question . Let me summarise what the original question dealt with. I asked whether I could compute Kendall's W for a case where the same question was asked for different entities. It asked the judges to assess how democratic certain organisations were. I was told that Kendall's W could be computed for that case. Please tell me whether my interpretation of the results is correct. UPDATED Below you can find the results computed in R . Kendall chi-squared = 40.547, df = 3, subjects = 4, judges = 23, p-value = 8.159e-09 alternative hypothesis: Wt is greater 0 sample estimates: Wt 0.5876359 The assessment of organization democracy by different judges were concordant to a low but satisfying degree (p W = .59). In the case of A organisation most judges (15 out of 23) claimed it had conformed to fourth point of scale. C organization was deemed as more democratic than A organisation. In that case most often answer (10 out of 23) was the answer two. The third and fourth answer chose in each case five of the judges. UPDATE 2 Here's my data: Input = (" Organization A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S T U W X Y Disneyland 4 4 4 4 3 4 2 4 3 5 4 5 2 3 5 2 2 3 4 4 3 4 4 IKEA 3 4 2 1 3 2 1 4 2 2 4 4 2 2 3 2 1 2 2 3 4 2 3 KFC 4 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 4 5 2 5 4 5 5 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 5 Walmart 4 4 3 3 2 2 2 4 3 3 3 3 2 4 2 2 3 2 4 3 4 3 4 ")
