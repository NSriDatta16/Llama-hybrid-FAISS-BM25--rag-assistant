What is the best evaluation of training the sequential modeling?

It's concerned with the probabilistic modeling of the sequential dataset. As far as my understanding, well-known RNN methodologies consist of two steps: firstly, train the model representing $p(y_{i}|y_{i-1})$ with respect to the loss calculated from the pair of consecutive samples $(y_{i-1}, y_{i})$ , and then, consequently obtain $p(y_{N}, \cdots y_{1}|y_{0}) = p(y_{N}|y_{N-1})\cdots p(y_{1}|y_{0})$ given a sequence $(y_{0}, y_{1}, \cdots, y_{N})$ . However, there can be another option for training: sample any sequence from the dataset: $(y_{0}, y_{1}, \cdots, y_{N})$ and then train $p(y_{i}|y_{i-1})$ with respect to the loss evaluating $p(y_{N}, \cdots y_{1}|y_{0}) = p(y_{N}|y_{N-1})\cdots p(y_{1}|y_{0})$ (e.g. logarithm likelihood, Wasserstein distance, etc.). Those two methods train a recurrent unit $p(y_{i}|y_{i-1})$ and the loss function is theoretically the same thing. Is there any difference between them in the practical sense? For example, the latter can reduce the over-fitting?, the latter can be better at long-term prediction, but not at short-term one?etc.
