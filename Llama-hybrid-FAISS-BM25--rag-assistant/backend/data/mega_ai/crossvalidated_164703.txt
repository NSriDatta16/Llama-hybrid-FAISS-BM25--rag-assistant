As mentioned in the page linked to by gung, the Elements of Statistical Learning is a great, in-depth reference. An Introduction to Statistical Learning is a more approachable book that covers many of the same topics and also provides examples in R. I have also found Applied Predictive Modeling to be a really good, practical machine learning reference that has examples in R. A recent Machine Learning book for Python is Building Machine Learning Systems with Python . I haven't used it yet, but it seems to provide a pretty good intro to machine learning. Lastly, the scikit-learn Examples page provides many good examples if you already have an idea of the theory behind what you're trying to do.
