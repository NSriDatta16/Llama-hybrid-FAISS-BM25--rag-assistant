Though technically there shouldn't be any protocols that don't handle IP fragmentation correctly, there's a couple (such as NFS) that benefit greatly from lack of fragmentation . How often you see fragmented packets is largely a function of your network environment. Packet encapsulation for VPNs, poorly-designed or implemented UDP protocols, and L1/L2 protocols that drop the end-to-end MTU below endpoint values can all cause IP fragmentation. Most modern hosts implement PTMUD , which will automatically detect the MTU size unless non-compliant devices or over-paranoid firewalls are involved. In these days of Ethernet Everywhere, I don't expect them to be particularly common on the internet at large.
