I've used that sample with the 1.3 release. It does work. However, overall I've found that there are severe restrictions with using Table Storage for membership - if you use table storage, then it's hard to get even simple information out like how many users do I have? If your Membership needs are very trivial then you can use Table Storage as shown in these examples. However, if you have more advanced needs, then you'll either need to do a lot of work on the samples, or you'll need to switch to SQL Azure. For the sites I'm building, where I'd like to one day have a paid membership scheme, then I've started using more normal SQL-based Membership.
