While PHP and Ruby are both interesting languages to get to know and would be good skills to have in your UI designer career, I'd really encourage you to just start tinkering a little with Objective-C. I think starting with some small examples and experimenting a little, you'd soon become comfortable with the language and have the confidence to branch out. You say you don't have the experience in programming to get to grip with Objective-C; well, now's your chance to learn some really nice stuff with a real goal in sight. There's obviously a learning curve here, but there most certainly will be with Ruby and PHP too, so you can maybe proceed in a more direct fashion by going straight for Objective-C. I've read the Hillegass book and it's a fine text but I'm not sure if it's quite right as a beginning point. Have you had a look at Scott Stevenson's tutorial ? That might be a good place if you do decide to go the ObjC way. I also think once you see how object oriented programming works in practice, you'll soon get the theory behind it.
