If you don't want to enable the drop handler, I could imagine a way that this might be possible. It's a bit of a comedy chain, but I could see myself implementing this if I was backed into a corner and needed that functionality. You can create an IFRAME which has its src as a temp folder somewhere. This folder will be displayed as an Explorer view. You can then drag files into that. Set up a polling routine against that folder to see if there are any new files. And voila, you have a lame way to support drag and drop operations with a given file.
