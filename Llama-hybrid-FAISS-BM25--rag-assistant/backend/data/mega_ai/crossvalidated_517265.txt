Interpreting Correlation and Scatter Plot Results

I tested for correlation between average unemployment rate and log average real GDP (U.S. 2017 dollars) for 163 countries, and created the scatter plot below: Based on the correlation coefficient and the scatter plot, is it fair to say that there is a small yet positive correlation between the two variables? I am a bit puzzled as I expected a negative correlation where unemployment rate declines as log GDP rises.. However, I also understand that the relationship may go in the opposite direction where in low-income countries, people may have a greater incentive to work, and thus lower unemployment rate. Is my reading of the scatter plot and correlation coefficient correct? corr avg_unemp log_avg_gdp (obs=163) | avg_un~p log_av~p -------------+------------------ avg_unemp | 1.0000 log_avg_gdp | 0.0177 1.0000
