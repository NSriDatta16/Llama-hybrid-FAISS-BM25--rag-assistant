(My)SQL - batch update

Hey, I have a table with "id", "name", and "weight" columns. Weight is an unsigned small int. I have a page that displays items ordered by "weight ASC". It'll use drag-n-drop, and once the order is changed, will pass out a comma-separated string of ids (in the new order). Let's say there's 10 items in that table. Here's what I have so far: Sample input: 5,6,2,9,10,4,8,1,3,7 Sample PHP handler (error handlers & security stuff excluded): $val) { mysql_query("UPDATE tbl SET weight = '$weight' where id = '$val' LIMIT 1"); $weight++; } ?> When I make a change to column order, will my script need to make 10 separate UPDATE queries, or is there a better way?
