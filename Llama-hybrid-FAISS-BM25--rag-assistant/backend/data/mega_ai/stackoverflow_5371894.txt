Those events you have mentioned above have nothing to do with the View at all, because the View is either going to get created or going to be destroyed with those events. That point makes the events propogate in to ViewModel code need not be a MVVM way mainly because there is no View involved in those event raising times. Just to implement this properly for a 'Seperation of Concern', you can have you MainViewModel (Mostly singleton) has all 4 methods and call it directly from App.xaml. Or else an event delegate ( messenger) would be more clean. I assume you want to do some general operations on those events like IsolatedStorage or serialization/deserialization operations.
