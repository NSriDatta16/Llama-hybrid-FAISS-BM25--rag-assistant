How do I create Variables in XSLT that are not document fragments?

Consider the following XSLT 2.0 template 1 2 3 var1 has elements. var2 has elements. The output of this template is var1 has 1 elements var2 has 2 elements The first line outputs 1 (and not, as I first expected 3) because var1 is a document fragment that contains the elements as childen. Now for my questions: How can I create a variable that does not contain a document fragment? I could do it like I did with var2 , only leaving out the predicate. But maybe there is a way without using a second variable. Or, as an alternative: How can I preserve the document fragment in a variable while filtering out some elements? Background Information: I will be using the variable contents in a recursive function that checks the first element in var1 for certain criteria. If the criteria are met or the list of elements is empty, it returns a value. Otherwise it will call itself with the first element of var1 removed (like I do in var2 ). When using var1 as a parameter that contains a document fragment, the XPath expressions in my template will not match.
