UITextView (subclass of UIScrollView) includes a lot of event processing. It handles copy and paste and data detectors. That said, it is probably a bug that it does not pass unhandled events on. There is a simple solution: you can subclass UITextView and impement your own touchesEnded (and other event handling messages) in your own versions, you should call [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; inside every touch handling method. #import "MyTextView.h" //MyTextView:UITextView @implementation MyTextView - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ NSLog(@"touchesBegan"); } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; NSLog(@"touchesMoved"); } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ NSLog(@"****touchesEnded"); [self.nextResponder touchesEnded: touches withEvent:event]; NSLog(@"****touchesEnded"); [super touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; NSLog(@"****touchesEnded"); } - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ [super touches... etc]; NSLog(@"touchesCancelled"); }
