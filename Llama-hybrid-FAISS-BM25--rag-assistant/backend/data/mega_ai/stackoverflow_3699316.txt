Your SQL query looks good, but I would remove the quarter with a left statement: select state, gender, left(year,4) as [Year], count(ID) as N from table1 group by state, gender, left([year],4) Then you have a classic case for a Matrix. Create a new report with the Report Wizard, choose "Matrix", then drag the fields across: Rows: State Columns: Year, Gender Details: N This should give you the required Matrix. Then replace the expression of the textbox with the Gender from =Fields!gender.Value to =IIF(Fields!gender.Value="M", "Male", "Female") Good luck.
