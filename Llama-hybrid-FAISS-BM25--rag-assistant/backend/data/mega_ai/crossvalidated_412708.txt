Propensity scores in logistic regression models

I have a query after reading a paper, which is about the effectiveness of a medical device. In summary, what the authors did was 1. Generating a propensity score using a multivariable logistic regression based on x number of covariates to see the probability of receiving the medical device. 2. They subsequently evaluated the association between the device and a pre-specified patient outcome Y using logistic regression models. Their model was as follows: Y ~ propensity score + presence of device + variable Z in which variable Z is an ordinal variable They then assessed for effect measure modification of the medical device on patient outcome depending on the level of variable Z by introducing an interaction term significance of the interaction in the model My queries are as follows: What is the advantage of not introducing variable Z when generating the propensity scores? Why did they have to use the propensity score as one variable and variable Z separately? Since they were interested the effect modification, it would signify that variable Z did play a role in influencing the presence of the medical device and the outcome, therefore putting it into the propensity score analysis should be valid? Are there any limitations in introducing the propensity score into the logistic regression model, as opposed to using the propensity score to do matching (e.g. greedy/ optimal, with/without replacement)? Then finding out the relationship using odds ratios?
