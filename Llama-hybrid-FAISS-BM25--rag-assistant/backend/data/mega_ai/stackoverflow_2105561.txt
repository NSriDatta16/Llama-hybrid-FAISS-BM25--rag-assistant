You may be able to use the starts-with selector. i.e: var nodes = document.DocumentNode.SelectNodes("//*[starts-with(@class, 'cnn_')]"); Where @class is the attribute you are looking for. Update: If you're interested in just the datasource and/or id you could run: //*[@datasource] or //*[contains(@id, 'WC_'] However knowing what you're trying to extract would help refine the selector.
