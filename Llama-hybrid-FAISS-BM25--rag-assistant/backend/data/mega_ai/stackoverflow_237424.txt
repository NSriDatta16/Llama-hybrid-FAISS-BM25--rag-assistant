Generally, reboots between install and running are because you're replacing system DLLs that are locked. The installer sets up a run-once registry entry that copies the DLLs during boot before they're locked by Windows, and then your application can use the new DLL that you laid down. In general, this is highly discouraged. There should be no reason anymore for anyone other than Windows itself to need to reboot after install anymore. I'd suggest going back into a debugger to find out more details about why your application is crashing. Hopefully you have enough tracing available in your code to allow that type of debugging.
