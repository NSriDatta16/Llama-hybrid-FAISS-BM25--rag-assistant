See the javadoc for java.awt.Font . It appears you may be able to use the public static Font decode(String str) method to accomplish what you want. The last paragraph of the javadoc for this method says: The default size is 12 and the default style is PLAIN. If str does not specify a valid size, the returned Font has a size of 12. If str does not specify a valid style, the returned Font has a style of PLAIN. If you do not specify a valid font name in the str argument, this method will return a font with the family name "Dialog". To determine what font family names are available on your system, use the GraphicsEnvironment.getAvailableFontFamilyNames() method. If str is null, a new Font is returned with the family name "Dialog", a size of 12 and a PLAIN style. If the font family you are looking for does not exist, you will get "Dialog" returned. As long as you do not get that as a return value, the font family exists.
