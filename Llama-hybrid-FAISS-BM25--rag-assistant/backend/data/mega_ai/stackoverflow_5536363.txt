Problem Reading Saved File : Android

I am read & write username & password to android device using my application to internal storage. I am successful writing to the device, but while reading I get error. On start of the aplication I read that file and I get "The applicaton (...) has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again." with "Force Close" button and the app closes. I tried different ways to read, but all showed same results. I write my data as username + "\n" + passwrd + "\n". This is the code for reading data : private static String ReadFromFile(String fileName) { String text = ""; FileInputStream fis = null; byte[] fileData; try { StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(); int c = 0; fis = AppContext.openFileInput(fileName); if (fis.available() != 0) { fileData = new byte[fis.available()]; c = fis.read(fileData); Log.i(TAG, "Read Byes = " + c ); java.util.StringTokenizer stk = new java.util.StringTokenizer(new String(fileData), "\n"); text = stk.toString(); } else throw new IOException("fis.available() No path is used and the filename directly is given to write & read file. I checked out Problem facing in reading file from Internal memory of android from where I tried StringTokenizer. Can anyone help me know where am I going wrong. The following permission are set : Also how do I debug the application. How to check the data written in Log. If I use SOP, where does it dispaly - it doesn't display in Console window ? Please help me, I am n newbie in android development. One more thing to clarify : My motto is to store username and password in such a way that user must not be able to read them directly. I have already used MODE_PRIMITIVE. Is their a need to use JSONObject to save this data. I had a look at JSON in couple of sites & API but couldn't make out why and where it should be used. Using MODE_PRIMITIVE I believe even the user can't read the file. Only my application can read it. Then I don't think I should use JSON. Please correct me if I am wrong. Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks.
