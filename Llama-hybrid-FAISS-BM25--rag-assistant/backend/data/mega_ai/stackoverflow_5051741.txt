VS2010, Web Performance Test, No hidden field detected on large response (>5MB)

I have a web performance test which contains a request whose response is greater than 5MB, and the Extract Hidden Fields rule fails to find (necessary and required!) hidden fields in the response. Response header contains HTTP/1.1 200 OK Transfer-Encoding : chunked Vary : Accept-Encoding, User-Agent Cache-Control : private Content-Type : text/plain; charset=utf-8 Date : Sat, 19 Feb 2011 15:24:38 GMT Server : Microsoft-IIS/6.0 X-AspNet-Version : 2.0.50727 X-Powered-By : ASP.NET Other than that and the response size, there is nothing remarkable about this scenario. In fact, this same test succeeds when a smaller data set is used. I suspect the Web Performance Test framework is having issues parsing the "chunked" encoding or sheer volume of data. Ahem, how can I obtain these required hidden fields from my response? Any hints or pointers would be much appreciated. ie resolutions, work arounds, converting auto-extraction to manual, etc. Cheers!
