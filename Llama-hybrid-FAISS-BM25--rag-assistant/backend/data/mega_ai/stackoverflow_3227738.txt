Just after lunch, I tried symbolicating using XCode 3.1 and it worked. So here's the scoop - if you have an application that is compiled with XCode 3.2.3 & running on a device with anything earlier than iOS4, the XCode 3.2.3 Organizer will not symbolicate your logs. You need to install XCode 3.2.1 (or probably 3.2.2) in order to get any symbolication. And I just found out that XCode 3.2.1 will symbolicate my iOS4 crash logs as well. Fun times!
