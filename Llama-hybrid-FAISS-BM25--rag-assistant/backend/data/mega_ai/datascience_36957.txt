How can I find anomalies in each row of data?

I have some reported data I want to spot anomalies on. The columns are a facility name then monthly reports of that given facility. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Facility | 2017 Jan Visitors | 2017 Feb Visitors | 2017 March Visitors | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Facility 1| 1234 | 1345 | 100345 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Facility 2| 56 | 567 | 34 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- How can train this panda dataframe like this row-wise? Planning to use one class SVM from sklearn. I want to get the anomalies in each facility e.g. in Facility 1 I'd mark 100345 as an anomaly. I have data spanning a couple of years. While we are here I am a super noob in ML and data science can I get a pointer to a condensed tutorial on unsupervised learning most of the ones I am coming across are for supervised.
