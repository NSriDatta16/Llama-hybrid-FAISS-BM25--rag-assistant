Philosophical issues arise with binomial CIs when there are no successes or all successes (and for Poisson with no successes). Are you really prepared to contemplate that the the true success probability could be $0$ or $1$ ? Examples: (1) You want to know whether Montana is completely free of a cattle disease. You test 1000 randomly chosen cattle and find all disease free. But there are many more than 1000 cattle in Montana. Maybe you wouldn't want to give a CI that includes $0.$ (2) As far as is known, particle G always decays within several microseconds of creation in a high energy collision of particles. Theorists hold out hope for a more stable G particle. Your group has made 1000 G particles all of which decayed almost instantly. What would you mean by a CI that includes $1?$ I suppose there may be 'conventions' about including $0$ or $1,$ or not, depending on the purpose and setting of the CI. If you are in a setting where a Bayesian approach is appropriate, you could choose a prior distribution that envisions possible $1$ parameter values (or $0$ ) or a prior that does not. Then your interval estimate would be based on a Bayesian posterior distribution. The fundamentally Bayesian Jeffreys interval estimate based on an 'uninformative' prior is often used as a frequentist CI (see Wikipedia on binomial CIs). Maybe you should consider it in its 'native' Bayesian sense.
