One possible issue with inconsistent behavior might be because scikit-learn is designed to learn to weight features to predict the targets. The Timestamp column is an index, not a feature according to scikit-learn. The dataset does not have any features according to scikit-learn. The count column is the target. A better option would be to use a package specifically designed for time series data.
