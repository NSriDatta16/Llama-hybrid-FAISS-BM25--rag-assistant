How do I find P(a<x<b) with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2 for a normal distribution

Mean = u = 10 std = o = 2 Finding a and b such that P(a So I looked at a Z table and found 0.90 sitting between a Z-Score of 1.28 and 1.29. I added those values up and took the average so that. 1.28 = 0.899727432 and 1.29 = 0.901474671 (0.899727432 + 0.901474671) / 2 = 0.9006010515 Z= 1.285 Then I used the standard normal equation. Z=(x-u)/o where x = b 1.285 = (b - 10) / 2 b = 2(1.285) + 10 b= 12.57 Are A and B the same then? I'm not sure I'm approaching this problem correctly.
