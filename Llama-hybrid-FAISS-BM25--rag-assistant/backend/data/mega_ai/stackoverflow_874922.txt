Off the top of my head: Use Transactions. Make sure your SQL leverages tables in the correct order . Don't add indexes you're not entirely sure you need. Perhaps not only specific to iPhone but to embedded devices there are some great tips here . This link pertains to an older version of SQLite but still proves useful. Lastly this Stack Question also has some good info. We use SQLite with a .Net Compact Framework Application currently and it's performance is fantastic and we've spent a bit of time optimizing but not nearly as much as we could. Best of luck.
