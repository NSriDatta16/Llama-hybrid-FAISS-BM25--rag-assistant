This is doable if you can combine multiple repositories into one working tree. The most simple solution would be symlinks. The problem (which makes it hard) is that VCSs want to preserve the notion of change sets. So if you commit such a file together with regular versioned files - should the changes belong to the changeset or not? Having the same changeset mean different things on different machines is clearly confusing. With multiple repositories, you can certainly have commits that go in one repository or the other. How much local setup this requires depends on the VCS system. For example, for svn:externals, you would need to use the same file: repository on each machine, but they could point to different sets of files. With symlinks, you could organize it in any form you please (assuming the symlink itself is not versioned).
