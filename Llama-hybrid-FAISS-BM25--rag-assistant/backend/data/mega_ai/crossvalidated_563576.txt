Before going to machine learning, I think it will clarify your approach to the problem to formulate it first as a linear regression. After you have identified a regression that clearly describes the relationship between the variables that is physically meaningful and compatible with your data set, then consider more elaborate regressions. For example, if you had columns for worker (categorical), unit processed (categorical), hours labored on the unit (numeric), you could regress hours ~ worker + unit . Worker and unit might be treated as random effects if you have a large number of levels. The coefficients will indicate the hours required to labor on each unit, and whether a worker has more or fewer hours on average. A regression with interaction terms hours ~ worker*unit can also describe different labor times for each worker on each type of unit (if worker B is fast at processing unit delta but slow at processing unit gamma). If you only had the total time per week, you might instead create the model total_time ~ unit_alpha + unit_gamma + worker ... where unit_alpha represents the number of alpha units that a worker processed during that time. Again, the coefficients for worker will indicate if a worker took more or less time than other workers, and coefficients for units will indicate how long each unit takes to process. You can also consider terms for worker-unit interactions, random effects treatment of worker, and estimated marginal means for more rigorously measuring "the processing time for unit alpha for a typical worker and its standard error."
