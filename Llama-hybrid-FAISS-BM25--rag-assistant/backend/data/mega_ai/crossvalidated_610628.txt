Does the average eigenvalue equals 1 in PCA applied to standardised data?

From what I understood when we are doing PCA, we can work both with raw or standardised data, depending on the situation we're in. Is it true that the average of the eigenvalues is equal to 1 when we are working with standardised data? If yes, why?
