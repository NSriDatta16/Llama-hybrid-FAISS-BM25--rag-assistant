1) Read the Code of popular Open Source Projects. There are a few that have some really good practices in place. I recommend checking out BlogEngine.NET . Also if you're more ambitious, I'd suggest looking at the code for ASP.NET MVC 1.0 . 2) Sometimes you need to "get back to the basics" when you've been working with a particular framework since a much earlier version. In this case, it can be really useful to pick up a book that covers some of the newer features. Here's a good book that shows of some of the new features in C# 3.0: C# 3.0 Design Patterns 3) It may seem odd, but reading up on other languages/platforms (such as Ruby on Rails) will help you in the way you design your classes and code by taking tips of the good and bad of different platforms and combining them. 4) Read some books on general best practices and development methodologies. Some of these books I recommend are: The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master Practices of an Agile Developer: Working in the Real World Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction
