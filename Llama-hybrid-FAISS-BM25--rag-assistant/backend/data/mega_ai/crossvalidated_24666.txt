Discrete scenarios from an ARMA forecast

Given an ARMA model and a historical time series, I'm trying to create a set of $n$ forecast scenarios, where each scenario $s$ is a potential future hourly time series $x_s[t]$, with a given probability, $p_s$. I'm familiar with how to generate an ARMA point forecast for a given horizon - how do you extend this theory to forecast a series?
