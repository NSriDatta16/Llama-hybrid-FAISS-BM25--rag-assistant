You seem to have the right intuition in your last paragraph. It is possible for variable x and z in a regression to appear non significant even though they have some effect on the dependent variable y. The following small reproducible example illustrates that fact. set.seed(890) x 30, sqrt(x), 0) + rnorm(1000, mean=12, sd=10) m1 This produces the following output (troncated for readability): Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 10.61151 1.79312 5.918 4.48e-09 *** x -0.00765 0.11085 -0.069 0.945 z 0.08651 0.05514 1.569 0.117 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 10.34 on 997 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.002464, Adjusted R-squared: 0.000463 F-statistic: 1.231 on 2 and 997 DF, p-value: 0.2923 Estimate Std.

However, in m1, there does not appear to be a significant effect of either x or z on y when you only include the main effects. In m2, the interaction becomes significant (albeit barely). Note that neither m1 or m2 are very good models for the data. In terms of interpretation, you would probably say that x has a significant effect on z for some values of z. There are several ways of testing for this. The one you mention in the last paragraph, excluding part of your sample based on the score of observations on a certain variable is usually refered to as "split-sample" analysis in social sciences. Other ways of testing for this imply to calculate the marginal effect of an interaction, depending on the values of one of the two interacted variables.
