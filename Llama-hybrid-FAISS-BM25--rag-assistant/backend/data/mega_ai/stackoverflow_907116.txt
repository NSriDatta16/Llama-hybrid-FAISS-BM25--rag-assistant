We use ours to store Coding Style docs Setup and Deployment procedures for web servers and sites Network diagrams (what are all the servers in Dev, Staging, QA and Production called etc.) Project docs (pdfs, visios, excel, docs, etc.) are stored in SVN. For the non-techies we have links to those docs in the wiki that point to an up-to-date share on my box. (tip: some wikis provide source control integration but ours doesn't) Installation and Setup procedures for development tools Howto's on things like using our bug tracking system, our unit testing philosophy When doing research on a topic I often capture the important information in a wiki page for others to learn from I've seen them used to keep seating charts in medium to large size organizations for the new people At my previous company all of the emergency contacts and procedures for handling a critical outage where available on the front page of the wiki The best part about a wiki is that it's searchable. Some wiki's support searching inside uploaded or linked docs as well. If you setup a wiki and encourage or even require people to use it the amount of information that will accumulate can be amazing. It's definately worth the effort especially if you have someone in IT with some spare time on their hands to set it up.
