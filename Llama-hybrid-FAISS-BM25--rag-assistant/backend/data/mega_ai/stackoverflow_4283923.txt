Error 3002: Problem in mapping fragments | c# linq to entities

I have a console application and what I'm trying to do is that every time the appllication runs, the date and time is sent to a table within my database. The table structure is like so: FTPRuns ID int Last Run datetime Simple enough. I've updated the model.edmx within my application also to reflect this new change, However now I am getting the below error and I'm not entirely sure what it means. Error 3002: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line 1330:Potential runtime violation of table FTPRuns's keys (FTPRuns.ID): Columns (FTPRuns.ID) are mapped to EntitySet FTPRuns's properties (FTPRuns.ID) on the conceptual side but they do not form the EntitySet's key properties (FTPRuns.ID, FTPRuns.LastRun). Here is the snippet of code that I use to update the database also: using (ModelContainer ctn = new ModelContainer()) { try { FTPRun ftp = new FTPRun { LastRun = DateTime.Now }; ctn.FTPRuns.AddObject(ftp); int changes = ctn.SaveChanges(); Console.WriteLine(changes.ToString() + " Changes saved"); Console.WriteLine("The LastRun Date Has Been Updated"); } catch (InvalidOperationException ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString()); } } If anyone can help me I'd be very grateful :) thanks.
