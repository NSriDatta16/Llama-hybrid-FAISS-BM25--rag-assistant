How to calculate output of this neural network?

I am sure this is a pretty easy question for someone well versed with neural networks but it has had me running round the bends. While I understand how this is to be done in principle, i.e. readjustment of weights according to the thresholds, but a solution or atleast a partial solution will be highly helpful. Thank you
