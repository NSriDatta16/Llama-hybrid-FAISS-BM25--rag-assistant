Multiple instances of same jQuery plugin

In an aspx page I am calling a jquery plugin for two listboxes as below. $(document).ready(function() { $("select.select_AdditionalLanguages").custSelectBox(); $("select.select_Organisations").custSelectBox(); }); Problem is, in the plugin jQuery(this) holds the listbox which was loaded last. Please suggest how to solve this issue. I have also tried the below without any success. $(document).ready(function() { var languages = $(' '); if (languages) { languages.custSelectBox(); } alert(languages); var organizations = $(' '); if (organizations) { organizations.custSelectBox(); } }); EDIT: Managed to solved this issue by having same class name for both the listboxes and then passing both the list box objects to the plugin $('select.select_field').custSelectBox(null, $('#EditUsers_Organisations'), $('#EditUsers_AdditionalLanguages')); This might not be the best solution but nothing else worked for me.
