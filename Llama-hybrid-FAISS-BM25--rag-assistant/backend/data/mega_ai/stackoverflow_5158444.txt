Performance: Absolute vs. Relative URLs

What's faster? Hot linking (inline linking) to an absolute URI or hosting the resource yourself and using a relative URI ? In his tutorial on how to style HTML5 elements in Internet Explorer , Remy Sharp states that hot linking causes an "extra HTTP [GET] request." I agree if you're comparing hot linking to copying & pasting (embedding) the script into the HTML. But, if you're comparing hot linking to hosting the script locally and linking via a relative path, then I'd argue that hot linking is actually (ever-so-slightly) faster because the browser doesn't have to resolve the absolute URL from the relative path. In both cases, however, an extra HTTP GET request is performed, correct?
