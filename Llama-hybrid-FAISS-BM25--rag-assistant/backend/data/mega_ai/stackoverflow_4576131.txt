jQuery: How can I get the HTML from inside NoScript to display in a differend div tag?

I've got a small script that detects if the user is using a certain browser var is_chrome = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('chrome') > -1; if(is_chrome){ $('.ifChrome').attr('style', 'display:block;'); $('.ifChrome').html($('noscript > div').html()); }; If they are using this browser, we want to display a div tag and show the HTML from a different div tag inside. Your browser does not properly support the WMD Markdown Editor. Please use Markdown to style your input. What I'm trying to do is show the "not supported" text from inside my tag to users who are using this browser (because WMD Markdown doesn't work properly with it). My existing Javascript is not working. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
