What options do I have to make my ORDER BY faster?

I have the following query: SELECT DISTINCT c.id FROM clients AS c LEFT JOIN client_project AS cp ON (cp.client_id = c.id) WHERE cp.project_id = 1 AND c.active_flag = 1 ORDER BY c.client_name If I remove the order by, the query takes 0.005 seconds. With the order by, the query takes 1.8-1.9 seconds. I have an index on client_name . What else would improve the speed? Edit: c.id is primary key, but there could be multiple records for it in client_project and therefore it may result in more than one record for each id. Also, removing the distinct makes 0.1 second difference in the query. Addition: Here is my clients table: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `clients` ( `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment, ... `organization` varchar(255) character set utf8 collate utf8_bin NOT NULL, `client_name` varchar(255) character set utf8 collate utf8_bin NOT NULL, `active_flag` tinyint(1) NOT NULL, ... PRIMARY KEY (`id`), KEY `active_flag` (`active_flag`), ... KEY `organization` (`organization`), KEY `client_name` (`client_name`) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1; Using MySQL 5.0
