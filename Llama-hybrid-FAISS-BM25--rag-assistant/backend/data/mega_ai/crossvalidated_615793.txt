While this may not be directly answering your question, I can provide an idea using a conditional probability approach, because you want to know the probability of getting head given that you are at some specific position. As far as I understand, your probability of landing on a bin itself is a random variable, say $Y$ . I would consider this random variable to follow a multinoulli (or multinomial distribution), with parameters $p{_i}$ corresponding to the probability of landing on the bin $i$ . Then you do the flipping experiment. Let's represent this experiment by $X$ . Given that it is an unbiased coin, this follows a uniform distribution with parameter $p$ =0.5. Then your probability of getting head given that your coin lands on a particular bin is the conditional probability $P(X|Y)$ , which equals to $P(X\bigcap Y)/P(Y)$ . This is the probability that you want to estimate (you do not estimate probabilities though, you estimate parameters). Your question obviously implies that the probability of getting head and being in the bin $i$ is not independent, e.g. they have a functional relationship. You can find the distribution of $P(Y)$ by sampling where your coin flips end up at, and then do distribution fitting. If your parameters $p{_i}$ turn out to have a well-defined functional relationship, you may generalize this to an increasing number of intervals. However, even at this point you are unable to know the exact probability distribution of $P(X\bigcap Y)$ , and in practice joint probability distributions are hard to define exactly (precisely the reason we develop regression models). If you have an intuition on how this joint probability distribution changes with respect to the result of experiments, you can choose a suitable distribution and estimate its parameters using your observations. I want to conclude by saying that generally, probabilistic questions like this actually begin with you defining a probability space following your theorization about a phenomenon. Depending on how the probability space is constructed, you may have different solutions. See: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bertrand_paradox_(probability)
