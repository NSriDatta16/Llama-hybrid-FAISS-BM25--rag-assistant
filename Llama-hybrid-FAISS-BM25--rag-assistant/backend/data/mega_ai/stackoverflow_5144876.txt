my first recommendation would be to try saving it as a png as the quality is better. my second recommendation is to try the quality parameter in imagejpeg($image, $filename, $quality) . recommendation #3 - I worked on a site that I had to rewrite the image storage system because they implemented just what you are doing, storing images as BLOB s in the database. Their system only had about 20K images in it and it was crashing weekly because the database could not handle the load. The conversion process for 5-6K images should not take more than a couple hours no matter how large the images. When I converted my images to disk storage from db storage, I ran 1K images at a time and each run took 5-10 minutes.
