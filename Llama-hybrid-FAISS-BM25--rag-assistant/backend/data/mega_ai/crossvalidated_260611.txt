Why are gradient-based methods better for nonstationary environments?

In the book Independent Component Analysis (Hyv√§rinen et al. 2001), it is mentioned on page 178: The advantage of such gradient methods, closely connected to learning in neural networks, is that the inputs $z(t)$ can be used in the algorithm at once, thus enabling fast adaptation in a nonstationary environment What does this sentence mean and why are gradient-based methods superior in nonstationary environments in general?
