Autocorrelation linear combination

Suppose I have an index $X_t$ over time, which is a linear combination of $N$ other time-series $x_{i,t}$ . So $X_t= \sum_i^n w_{i}x_{i,t}$ ,. Is there a theoretical/statistical formula that decomposes the autocorrelation structure of the index in terms of the autocorrelation of the underlying time series and potentially the interaction among these time series; for example $x_{i,t-j}$ is correlated with $x_{z,t}$ ? For variances this is clear, there we can decompose the variance of an index in terms of the variances of the underlying variables and their corresponding co-variances. I wonder how this works for autocorrelations. I was not able to find a similar question on this forum.
