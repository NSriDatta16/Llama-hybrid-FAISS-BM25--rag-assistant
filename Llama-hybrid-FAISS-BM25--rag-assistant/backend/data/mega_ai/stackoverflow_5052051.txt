Not case sensitive search with active record

I use rails 3.0.4 here is a piece of Arel query in my rails application, How can I use the upcase method to make a none case sensitive search in a database agnostic way? Customer.where("company_id = ? and (firstname like ? or lastname like ? or reference like ?)", current_user.company_id, "%#{params[:query]}%", "%#{params[:query]}%", "%#{params[:query]}%") Thanks
