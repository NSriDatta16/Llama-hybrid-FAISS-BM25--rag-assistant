In response to the question title. Bartlett's test of sphericity $^1$, which is often done prior PCA or factor analysis, tests whether the data comes from multivariate normal distribution with zero covariances. (Note please, that the standard asymptotic version of the test is not at all robust to the departure from multivariate normality. One might use bootstrapping with nongaussian cloud.) To put it equivalently, the null hypothesis is that the population correlation matrix is identity matrix or that the covariance matrix is diagonal one. Imagine now that multivariate cloud is perfectly spherical (i.e. its covariance matrix is proportional to the identity matrix). Then 1) any arbitrary dimensions can serve principal components, so PCA solution is not unique; 2) all the components have the same variances (eigenvalues), so PCA cannot help to reduce the data. Imagine the second case where multivariate cloud is ellipsoid with oblongness strictly along the variables' axes (i.e. its covariance matrix is diagonal: all values are zero except the diagonal). Then the rotation implied by PCA transformation will be zero; principal components are the variables themselves, only reordered and potentionally sign-reverted. This is a trivial result: no PCA was needed to discard some weak dimensions to reduce the data. $^1$ Several (at least three, to my awareness) tests in statistics are named after Bartlett. Here we are speaking of the Bartlett's sphericity test.
