parsing out a second delimited data structure

I am reading in a .csv file similar to the following. Note that PhoneNumbers can contain multiple values delimited by the pipe character. FirstName,LastName,PhoneNumbers Bucky,Fuller,213.283.5555|714.345.5566 Stephen,Hawking,212.456.7897|312.345.6677|415.223.3423 Robert,Heinlein,562.457.8899 I am able to read in the .csv file and write out to a file using the following. ..... dReader = csv.DictReader(open('employee_import.csv', 'rb'), delimiter=',', quotechar='`') for row in dReader: file.write("\t\t\t \n") file.write("\t\t\t\t "+str(row.get('LastName'))+" \n") file.write("\t\t\t\t "+str(row.get('FirstName'))+" \n") file.write("\t\t\t\t "+str(row.get('PhoneNumbers'))+" \n") file.write("\t\t\t \n") ..... I was wondering if anyone had any ideas how I could iterate through the PhoneNumbers Key,Value pair so that I can separate out the multiple PhoneNumbers a person can have? Thank you.
