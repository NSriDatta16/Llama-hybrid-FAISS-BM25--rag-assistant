This is depend on the interface the camera exporting. If this is standard mass storage interface you just use standard file interface, i.e you will see the camera as removable disk and can use standard Create/Read/Write/File operation. Many new cameras have ptp (Picture transport protocol) interface. So you will need using Windows Image Acquisition API. You might find useful following Link . If i understand correctly this is a sample code for exactly what are you looking for. Google is your friend :) Another piece of info: many cameras will support both mass storage and ptp interfaces and it will be selectable by camera user interface. In case of automatic mode camera probably will switch to ptp interface.
