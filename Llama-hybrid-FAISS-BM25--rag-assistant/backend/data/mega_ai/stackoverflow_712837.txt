If the database is set to decent isolation level, uncommited writes can only be read from the transaction that created them. For example, in Oracle, if a procedure inserts or updates a row and then (without commiting) calls another procedure, which uses "pragma autonomous_transaction" to run in a seperate transaction, that other procedure does not see the new row. (An excellent way to shoot yourself in the foot, btw). For that reason, you should always consider your load operations as tied to the transaction.
