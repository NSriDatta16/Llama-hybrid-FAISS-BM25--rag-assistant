Where do you put your CSS Margins?

When you want to add whitespace between HTML elements (using CSS), to which element do you attach it? I'm regularly in situations along these lines: This is the heading This is a paragraph Here's another heading This is a footer Now, say I wanted 1em of space between each of these elements, but none above the first h1 or below the last div. To which elements would I attach it? Obviously, there's no real technical difference between this: h1, p { margin-bottom: 1em; } ...and this... div { margin-top: 1em; } p { margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em } What I'm interested is secondary factors: Consistency Applicability to all situations Ease / Simplicity Ease of making changes For example: in this particular scenario, I'd say that the first solution is better than the second, as it's simpler; you're only attaching a margin-bottom to two elements in a single property definition. However, I'm looking for a more general-purpose solution. Every time I do CSS work, I get the feeling that there's a good rule of thumb to apply... but I'm not sure what it is. Does anyone have a good argument?
