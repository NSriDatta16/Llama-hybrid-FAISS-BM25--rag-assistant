I'd go for the morphological analyzer. Morphological analyzers are a prerequisite for doing any NLP in a language with interesting word structure, and there are lots and lots of languages out there where almost no work has been done yet. Building a good morphological analyzer for a language you know well is a reasonable summer project, so you can probably get out of the workshop having built a working, useful piece of software that other people will appreciate having. The other areas are hotter topics these days and might look better on your CV, but they're also much more open-ended and are much harder for a relative beginner to make any real contribution in.
