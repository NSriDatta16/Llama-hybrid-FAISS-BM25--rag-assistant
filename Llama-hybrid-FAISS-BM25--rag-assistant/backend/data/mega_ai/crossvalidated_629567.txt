Based on your posts and comments, I imagine your data on two levels. You have a binary outcome, sales (made or not), let’s call it $Y$ . As you mentioned customers can have more than one sale. You also have information on customers with no sales. And I think there may be customers who made purchases sometimes but not in others. So, there is a nesting factor which I’ll call $\operatorname{ID}$ . You might have predictors at the sales level, denoted as $X$ (maybe the date of sale; some sales could be on holiday season, etc.), and customer level, denoted as $Z$ (e.g., sociodemographic variables). I also assume that participation in a campaign is at the customer level (someone participated or not). I would start with a random-intercept binary logistic regression model, taking into account this nested structure: $$ \begin{aligned} \operatorname{Y}_{i} &\sim \operatorname{Binomial}(n = 1, \operatorname{prob}_{\operatorname{y} = 1} = \widehat{P}) \\ \log\left[\frac{\hat{P}}{1 - \hat{P}} \right] &=\begin{aligned} &\alpha_{j[i]} + \beta_{1}{X_1} + \cdots+ \beta_{n}{X_n} \end{aligned} \\ \alpha_{j} &\sim N \left(\gamma_{0}^{\alpha} + \gamma_{1}^{\alpha}Z_1 + \cdots+ \gamma_{n}^{\alpha}{Z_n}, \sigma^2_{\alpha_{j}} \right) \text{, for ID j = 1,} \dots \text{,J} \end{aligned} $$ You can expand this model based on your analytical interests. As I said, I assume that participation in a campaign is at the customer level but that might not be the case, hence the third question raised by PBulls. Some sales could be made before a customer participated in a campaign or some customers could be exposed to campaign longer than others. If that’s the case, the model changes, and you should interpret the results accordingly.
