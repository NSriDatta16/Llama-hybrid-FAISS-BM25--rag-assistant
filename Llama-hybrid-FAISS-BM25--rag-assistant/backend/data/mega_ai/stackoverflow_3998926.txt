Map-widget-like, draggable

I'd like to embed my custom HTML in an area that is draggable, like the JavaScript Map widgets. For example, I want to put a 1000x1000 inside a 480x320 , without scrollbars ( overflow:hidden ) and be able to adjust the position of the inner layer by dragging it with the mouse. Ideally I'd like to catch scroll events too. I could implement it myself, but I'm wondering if there's a ready-to-use, well-tested cross-browser piece of JavaScript that could do this for me. Ideally a jQuery plugin.
