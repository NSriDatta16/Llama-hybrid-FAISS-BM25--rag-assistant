I strongly recommend .net MVC with the new view engine called razor. this allows you nice separation of layers and can you leverage a lot of front end technologies like jQuery without all of the heavy controls that webforms brings to the table. I view WPF a lot like flash and sometimes that is the best way to go but for most web apps I would say should be MVC. You can also find support easily for this either for the entire app or just for certain layers of the app.
