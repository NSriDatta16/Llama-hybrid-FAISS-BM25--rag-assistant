t-test, chi-squared test or Poisson test?

I have to compare the survival proportion between two treatments. Because of some limitations, I can only take a sample of $n_{1}=5$ animals from treatment 1, and $n_{2}=50$ animals from treatment 2. Both samples come from the same batch so that these two samples can be considered as paired. The survival proportion of sample 1 is then compared with the survival of sample 2. Note that the $5$ animals in treatment 1 are considered as one replicate, and the same is for the 50 animals from treatment 2. So that the experimental unit is 5/50 animals, rather than individual animal. If $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are both large, the differences between proportions can be considered as a continuous variable. Therefore, I could conduct the experiment N times, and apply a paired t-test to compare the average proportions between the two populations. However, due to a small number of sample $n_{1}=5$ for treatment 1, the survival proportion for treatment 1 is discrete: $0/5, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5$, which means it will be a problem for t-test. On the other hand, if I apply chi-squared test or test for Poisson distributions, the experimental units are defined as individual animals, which is not the same as this case. Can someone give some advice about how to compare the average proportion in this case? To add some explanation about this experiment: This is a typical ecological experiment, where the treatments are different-sized boxes making two different living environments. So basically we are testing the living environment, and the animals are living as a community. Imagine if we compare people's quality of life under two different community environments, people's feelings indeed are influenced by one another. If one individual feels stressed by the environment, people living together with him will be influenced.
