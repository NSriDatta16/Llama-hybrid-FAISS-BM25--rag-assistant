Python: How to test whether a logistic regression gets the distribution of the probabilities correct?

I have a dataset with y-values from 0,1 and one column of x numeric values between 5000 and 40000. My expectation is that the increase in the probabilities is a lot more "bumpy" than what the logistic regression predicts. I attempted to do a drawing in Paint below to illustrate this: My question is how do I actually test what the relationship of the data is? Is there any type of numeric test to use, or is there a way to plot this properly? When I try the following code: plt.scatter(X, y, alpha=0.5) plt.xlabel('x') plt.ylabel('y') plt.show() It only returns the following visual representation which doesn't really help me:
