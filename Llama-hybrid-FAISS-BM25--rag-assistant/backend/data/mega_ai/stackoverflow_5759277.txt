jQueryIO to drag/drop into a specific cursor location in nicEdit?

I am trying to see if/how I can possibly use the jQuery UI Droppable plugin to drop an object into a nicEdit container at a specific cursor location. I saw a similar question regarding pasting html code at a nicEdit cursor location here . Using the jQuery UI Droppable shopping card demo , I want to be able to select an item from the products area and drop it into the Shopping Cart area. However, instead of the drop event populating the example div: Shopping Cart Add your items here I want to drop the object into a textarea associated with the nicEdit control. In other words, I want to drag an icon/object on the page and drop into the nicEdit textarea at the active cursor location. Dropping the icon will populate some predefined html to be inserted at the cursor location in the nicEdit textarea object. Any suggestions are appreciated.
