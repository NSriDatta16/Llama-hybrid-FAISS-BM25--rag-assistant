What's your opinion on MS CAB (Composite Application Block)?

I'm in the process of evaluating the use of CAB for a new .net 3.5 winform project I plan to use the Infragistics toolset, which is known to be 'CAB compliant' While CAB has the immediate upside of letting me focus on my business instead of coding basic docking/login/etc code, I feel like I would be able to achieve the same level of functionnality quite radpidly by myself (with the added flexibility/reactivity bonus you have when you 'own' the code). I'm seeking some feedback on Microsoft's CAB from people using it : Have you experienced problems/bugs ? Do you feel like CAB saved your time ? Are there extra functionalities I don't know about (beside Docking/Login/WorkerThreads best practices?)
