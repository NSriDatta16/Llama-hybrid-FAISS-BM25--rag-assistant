The advantage with using a class or functions for this is that you can change the storage of the languages as the project grows. If you only have a few strings, there is absolutely no problems with your solution. If you have a lot of strings it could take time, memory and harddrive resources to load the language arrays on all page loads. Then you probably want to split it up to different files, or maybe even use a database backend. If using i database, consider using caching (for example memcached ) so you don't need to query the database hundreds of times with every page load. You can also check out gettext which uses precompiled language files which are really fast.
