phonegap.js crashes android app

I'm having this weird problem, where including the phonegap.js file in my project causes the app to crash on both the android emulator and my phone. I got the latest file from GitHub , so I can't see why this isn't working. This happens even if I try to build the sample project that's included in the PhoneGap download... Console log: [2010-12-17 11:05:14 - sample] Android Launch! [2010-12-17 11:05:14 - sample] adb is running normally.
