mootools sortables vs jquery sortables effect

I've been using mootools for some time and trying jQuery for a week so this probably is a newbie question - though I've found nothing in the manuals. In mootools, when you use the option clone in a sortables list it creates a clone of your image/object that helps you visualize where the image/object will be droppped - works great on my thumbnail sorting system. mootools sortables doc page Well, jQuery also has that same option, clone but when I use it doesn't do a thing. Meaning, it in fact clones the element and the one you drag around is a clone but when you drop-it the original stays exactly where it previously was. You can check this behavior with the draggable demo they have on their site. Take a look at the semi-transparent-clone , you can move it around and when you drop it is stays right there. Is this buggy behavior or just how its supposed to be? I could replicate mootools behavior on my own but though this would be a standard option... Thank you in advance!
