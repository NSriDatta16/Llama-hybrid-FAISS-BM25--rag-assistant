Census taking off the grid

We're writing software for child sponsorship organizations that need to collect data in remote villages (no electricity). Our idea is to use a small device to enter childrens' names and when the agent gets back to an Internet cafe, they can upload the data. Our thought is to use an XML file to store the data. What device can you recommend for doing this?
