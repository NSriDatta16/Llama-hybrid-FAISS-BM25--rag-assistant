Is Kernel regression a good idea for time series?

As title. I'm worried about the implications of autocorrelation (the timeseries is not stationary), if should transform it to be stationary, etc. Particularly worried since right now I'm having problems beating a simple Naive seasonal average model. If I transform the series, it is not clear to me how to best compare results unless I transform back, which I can do but then it makes it harder to use backtest methods included in Darts, my framework of choice :)
