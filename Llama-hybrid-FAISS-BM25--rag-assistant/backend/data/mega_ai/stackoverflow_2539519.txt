Set the volume of an android application

In order for the user to control the volume , my android application has a menu consisting of a slider that provides int values from 0 to 10 , when dragged. After I obtain a value , I must set the volume to the corresponding value chosen by the user , and well , this is the part that I don't know to implement and I 'd like to find about it.
