X, Y names in data-science

I am from CS background and moving towards Data Sciences, I have came to know ML is highly influenced by Statistical Inference/signal processing. The X we use in data science is called input, feature set or independent variables and Y is called target, class, label. What do you call it? Are they different in market and field among practitioners?
