Do you mean sendSynchronousRequest:returningResponse:error: by "synchronize`? If so, connection:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge: is not called for synchronous requests. But you can still provide NSURLCredential / NSURLProtectionSpace and store it into NSURLCredentialStorage before sending the request. Check Mike's answer here: Can I use NSURLCredentialStorage for HTTP Basic Authentication?
