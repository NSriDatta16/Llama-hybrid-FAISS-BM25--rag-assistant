initializing copy of photo in a different model with paperclip plugin for rails

Here's my question. I have a user model with one attached avatar. This model has many personal photos (with accepts_nested_attributes_for). I want to be able to initialize a personal photo automatically after saving a user object with whatever the user avatar turns out to be. So say Bob uploads his avatar, bob will automatically have one personal photo (with the correct different paperclip styles) generated from the avatar image. I'm not really sure how to go about doing this. Would I put it in my controller or user an after_save hook in the model? I'm using Paperclip with db storage so it would be good if somehow during save this was initialized so I don't have to pull it back out...Maybe I could use a hidden form field?
