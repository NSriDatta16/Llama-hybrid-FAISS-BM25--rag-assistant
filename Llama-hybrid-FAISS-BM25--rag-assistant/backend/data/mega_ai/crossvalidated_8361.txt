ggplot2 is an actively maintained, open-source chart-drawing library for r , written by Hadley Wickham , based upon the principles of "The Grammar of Graphics" by Leland Wilkinson. It can stand as an alternative to R's basic plot and the lattice package .

A PDF detailing many of the new features and changes is available. On Sept 11th 2012, version 0.9.2 was released. See documentation and a list of changes . Winston Chang's Cookbook for R has pages that have been updated to reflect changes in the new version of ggplot2 0.9.2. There are several related packages on CRAN that are based upon, or extend ggplot2's functionality: GGally : Package containing templates for different plots to be combined into a plot matrix, as well as a parallel coordinate plot function ggcolpairs : Combination of ggplot2 plots into a matrix based on data columns ggdendro : Tools for extracting dendrogram and tree diagram plot data for use with ggplot2 granovaGG : Graphical analysis of variance using ggplot2 nvis : Combination of visualization functions for nuclear data using ggplot2 and ggcolpairs ggmap allows visualization of spatial data and models on top of Google Maps, OpenStreetMaps, Stamen Maps, or CloudMade Maps using ggplot2 Finally, the package gridExtra is often useful, as ggplot2 is based upon the grid graphics system.
