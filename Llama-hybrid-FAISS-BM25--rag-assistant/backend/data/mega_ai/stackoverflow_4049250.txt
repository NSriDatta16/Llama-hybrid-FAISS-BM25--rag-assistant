This is messing around in undocumented internals, but the following is working for me: $("#some-div").load("/html/fragment/", function() { $(this).find("input").customTextInput(); }); There are equivalent methods for buttons, checkboxes etc. Have a look at the _enchanceControls [sic] method in http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0a1/jquery.mobile-1.0a1.js . Update for 1.0Alpha2 : As can be expected when playing around with the internals of a library, this no longer works in the latest version. Changing customTextInput() to textinput() fixes it a bit, but the theme isn't fully applied for some reason. We were warned...
