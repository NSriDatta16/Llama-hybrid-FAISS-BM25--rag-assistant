Android VideoView picture doesn't update wile playing

I've coded up apps using VideoView and MediaPlayer and both had the same behavior. I'm currently using the code example here . The problem I'm having is that the video doesn't play back continuously. The slider in the MediaController is moving but the picture doesn't change. If I manually drag the slider the picture will change like it should. I'm using an mp4 file loaded from the sdcard with a SDK 2.3.1 emulator device. Any help is appreciated.
