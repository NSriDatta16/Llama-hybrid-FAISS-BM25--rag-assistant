Performance - Table Service, SQL Azure - insert. Query speed on large amount of data

I'd read many posts and articles about comparing SQL Azure and Table Service and most of them told that Table Service is more scalable than SQL Azure. http://www.silverlight-travel.com/blog/2010/03/31/azure-table-storage-sql-azure/ http://www.intertech.com/Blog/post/Windows-Azure-Table-Storage-vs-Windows-SQL-Azure.aspx Microsoft Azure Storage vs. Azure SQL Database https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazure/thread/2fd79cf3-ebbb-48a2-be66-542e21c2bb4d https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2010/05/10/windows-azure-storage-abstractions-and-their-scalability-targets.aspx https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2711868/azure-performance http://vermorel.com/journal/2009/9/17/table-storage-or-the-100x-cost-factor.html Azure Tables or SQL Azure? http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2010/01/sql-azure-frequently-asked-questions/ https://code.google.com/p/lokad-cloud/wiki/FatEntities Sorry for http, I'm new user >_ http://azurescope.cloudapp.net/BenchmarkTestCases/ benchmark shows different picture. My case. Using SQL Azure: one table with many inserts, about 172,000,000 per day(2000 per second). Can I expect good perfomance for inserts and selects when I have 2 million records or 9999....9 billion records in one table? Using Table Service: one table with some number of partitions. Number of partitions can be large, very large. Question #1: is Table service has some limitations or best practice for creating many, many, many partitions in one table? Question #2: in a single partition I have a large amount of small entities, like in SQL Azure example above. Can I expect good perfomance for inserts and selects when I have 2 million records or 9999 billion entities in one partition? I know about sharding or partition solutions, but it is a cloud service, is cloud not powerfull and do all work without my code skills? Question #3: Can anybody show me benchmarks for quering on large amount of datas for SQL Azure and Table Service? Question #4: May be you could suggest a better solution for my case.
