Not necessarily, while it can be the case that two observations belong to the same 'group' and end up in the same leaf node (and thus get the same predicted value) there can also be multiple groups of observations that both have the same predicted value. If this is the case in your example is of course dependant on the data you are using. It would indeed be a time intensive task to manually check why certain observations have a certain predicted value there are an increasing number of methods/python packages to help explain a model's decision with the increased focus on interpretable/explainable machine learning models. An example of such a method is using Shapley values , which is implemented in the shap python package and can be applied easily on tree ensembles (see the example on the linked github page).
