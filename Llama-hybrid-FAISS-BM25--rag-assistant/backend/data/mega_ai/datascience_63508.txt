Types of Machine Learning/Data Analysis

I am looking for a framework or chart that classifies all the different types of data analysis/machine learning. I want to use this classification to organize my knowledge/areas to learn. Examples of what I mean by types of data analysis/ML include: - Geographical Maps - Image Recognition (CV, OCR...) - Signal Processing - Text/Speech Comprehension Is there a chart/framework classifying all those domains ?
