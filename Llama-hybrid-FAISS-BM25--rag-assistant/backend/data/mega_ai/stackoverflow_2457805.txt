How do you encourage users to fill out their profile?

I wanted to open up the topic to discuss ways to encourage or incentivize users to fill in information in a user profile on a website, such as skills, location, organization, etc. More information in a user profile can give a website an improved capability for its users to search, network, and collaborate. Without bugging users to fill in their profiles (ie - via annoying e-mail reminders), what other ways have you come up with to encourage user input?
