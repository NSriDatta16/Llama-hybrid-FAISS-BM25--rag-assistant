I would highly suggest you reference Craiglickr in your pursuit. While I have no desire to help you port it to PHP, it is the only open source tool that I personally know of that has anything to do with Cragslist. The short answer: yes, it is possible in PHP. No it won't be easy. And, PHP's lack of an event-driven framework will make it especially challenging.
