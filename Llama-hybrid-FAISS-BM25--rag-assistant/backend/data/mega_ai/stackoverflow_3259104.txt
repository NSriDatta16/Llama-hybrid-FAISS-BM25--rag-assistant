iPython - "broken" shell/terminal after realoading Django

I'm embedding iPython shell in a Django script (with development server, e.g. runserver at localhost) like this: ... from IPython.Shell import IPShellEmbed ipshell = IPShellEmbed() ipshell() ... which gives me interactive shell at the desired place. Now, if modify the source code, Django automatically reloads, probably without correctly quitting iPython shell, and "breaks" my terminal emulator (xterm, konsole) - text becomes invisible, etc. (same effect if iPython running inside Django is terminated with Ctrl+d). Any suggestions as what could be causing this? (I'm probably using iPython in a wrong way, but who knows).
