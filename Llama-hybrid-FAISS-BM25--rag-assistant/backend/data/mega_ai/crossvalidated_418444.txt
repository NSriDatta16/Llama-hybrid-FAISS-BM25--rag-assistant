Help in Handling multiple classes in independent categorical variables and improve performance

The dataset has 4 categorical and 1 numerical variable and a timestamp variable. Out of 4, three categorical variables are having more than 100 categories. I tried doing one-hot encoding on the whole dataset using "pd.get_dummies()" method and the number of columns increased from 6 to 6000. And the time consumption to do the dummy variables took more than 3 minutes. When you want to use these variables to build an unsupervised model using machine learning to detect anomalies, how should the categorical variables be handled if you have a dataset of a million rows? Should this be considered as a time-series data but you can data for every day but not recorded in fixed intervals? What models can be applied to this kind of dataset?
