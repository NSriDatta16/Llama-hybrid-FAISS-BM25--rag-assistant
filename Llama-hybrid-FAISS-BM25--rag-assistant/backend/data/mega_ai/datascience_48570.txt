In Machine Learning, performance measurement is an essential task. So when it comes to a classification problem, we can count on an AUC - ROC Curve. AUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for classification problem at various thresholds settings. It tells how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes. $$ TPR/Recall/Sensitivity = \frac{TP}{TP+FN} $$ $$ Specificity = \frac{TN}{TN+FP} $$ $$ FPR=1-Specificity = \frac{FP}{TN+FP} $$ and the model performance could be interpreted as This is an excerpt of this article Understanding AUC - ROC Curve
