For your first problem, NN without hidden layer is simply linear regression. Of course there is an activation function, but you can use the inverse function of that activation function on your target set, then it's basically a linear regression. Your second part of statement is confusing. You need to clarify what you want to do with your NN. Some unsupervised networks include Boltzmann Machine, auto-encoder, etc., for feature extraction and dimension reduction. However, we don't know if that's what you want. If it's reinforcement learning, then it's reinforcement learning. RL is neither supervised nor unsupervised.
