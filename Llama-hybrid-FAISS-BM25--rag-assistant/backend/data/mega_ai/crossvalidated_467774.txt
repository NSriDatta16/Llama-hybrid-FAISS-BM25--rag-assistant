Gauss- Markov Efficiency?

if I have a ragression model $y_i = x_i\beta + u_i$ were I know that the square of error have this $u^{2}=\gamma w^2_{i}+\epsilon_{1}$ , where I know only that $E(\epsilon_{i}|w_{i})=0$ , $E(u_{i}|w_{i})=0$ . I can assume that the expected value of $x|u$ is equal to zero for the law of iterated expectation? and what about the homoskedasticity? If $E(u|w)=0$ also $E(u^{2}|w^{2})$ is equal to zero? so an OLS estimator for $\beta$ is Gauss Markov efficiency?
