I assume you have a variable group that distinguishes the treatment and the comparison group. For example, group is equal to zero for the comparison group and one for the treatment group. If so, then the following will do it: tabulate group, summarize(yob) tabulate group, summarize(female) From the output, you can then compare the average values of yob and female across the two groups. If you really want to use regress , then the following will do it: regress yob group regress female group Assuming the variable group is defined as above, in each regression the coefficient on group will give you the difference across groups of the average of the dependent variable ( yob in the first regression and female in the second regression). If you do not have a variable group , then you should provide more information on how your group1 and group2 are coded so that I can explain how to generate the group variable.
