COleDataSource - setting drag & drop data between applications

Some code I am working on uses COleDataSource::CacheGlobalData , passing as CF_TEXT an HGLOBAL pointing to some memory allocated for the text. I want to also add a numeric value, so ythe drop-target can access either the text or numeric values. How can this easily be done? Can a 2nd CacheGlobalData call be made with a different CF_ value? And since I only want to pass an integer (DWORD) can I avoid having to allocate a messy HGLOBAL? Or do I have to encode all the data i want to send into a single chunk of memory? Does CacheGlobalData only let be attach one object to the drag event?
