That is a 95% confidence interval for $x$ , but not the 95% confidence interval. For any continuous strictly-monotonic transformation, your method is a legitimate way to get a confidence interval for the transformed value. (For monotonically decreasing functions, you reverse the bounds.) The other excellent answer by tchakravarty shows that the quantiles match up for these transformations, which shows how you can prove this result. Generally speaking, there are an infinite number of possible 95% confidence intervals you could formulate for $x$ , and while this is one of them, it is not generally the shortest possible interval with this level of confidence. When formulating a confidence interval, it is usually best to try to optimise to produce the shortest possible interval with the required level of coverage --- that ensures that you can make the most accurate inference possible at the required confidence level. You can find an explanation of how to do this in a related question here . Taking a nonlinear transformation of an existing interval does not give you the optimum (shortest) confidence interval (unless by an incredible coincidence!). The general method used to obtain the shortest confidence interval is to go back and look at the initial probability statement operating on the pivotal quantity used to formulate the interval. Instead of using "equal tails" in the probability statement, you set the relative tail sizes as a control variable, and then you find the formula for the length of the confidence interval conditional on that variable. Finally, you use calculus methods to determine the value of the control variable that minimises the interval length. Often this method can be programmed for broad classes of problems, allowing you to rapidly compute optimal confidence intervals for an object of interest.
