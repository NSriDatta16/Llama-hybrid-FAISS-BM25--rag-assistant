A Google search "pca for discrete variables" gives this nice overview by S. Kolenikov (@StasK) and G. Angeles. To add to chl answer, the PC analysis is really analysis of eigenvectors of covariance matrix. So the problem is how to calculate the "correct" covariance matrix. One of the approaches is to use polychoric correlation .
