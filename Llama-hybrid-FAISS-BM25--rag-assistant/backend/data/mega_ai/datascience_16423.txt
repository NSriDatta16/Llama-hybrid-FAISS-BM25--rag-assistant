Okay, think of it like this. In machine learning algirithms, such as linear regression or random forest you give the algorithms a set of features and the target and then it tries to minimize the cost function, so no it doesnt learn any new features, it just learns the weights. Now when you come to deep learning, you have atleast one, (almost always more) hidden layer with a set number of units, these are the features that are being talked about. So a deep learning algorithm doesnt just learn the sets of weights, in that process it also learns the values for hidden units which are complex high level features of the trivial data that you have given. Hence while practicing vanilla machine learning a lot of expertise lies in your ability to engineer features because the algorithm isnt learning any by itself. I hope I answered your question.
