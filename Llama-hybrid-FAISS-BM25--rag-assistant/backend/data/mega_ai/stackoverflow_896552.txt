A little analysis of the post data could possibly yield some image URIs, which you could use to modify the reference count (would work for direct edits too that way)? As well as reference counting, if you don't do this already, you could ringfence the uploaded media on a per-user basis - thus if they delete something they think they don't need, it's not going to destroy other user's work? Neither of these are particularly elegant ... but neither is the problem :P.
