what to do with really strong features in machine learning

Suppose you have a machine learning model that predicts if a given client is going to buy or not. The model has N features. One of those features, N[i] , when present, strongly indicates that the client is going to buy. There are 2 options: 1) If N[i] is present predict 1, if not present predict with the model. 2) Feed N[i] as another feature of the model and let it do it's job, trusting that it will detect the strong relation. Which one would you pick and when? what if the presence of N[i] is a really strong indicator that the client will buying, like 99.99% of the time , would you leave it to the model to figure it out then? Why not? EDIT: Note that if the variable is present you know the client buys but if it's not you have no certainty (it's not like the weight in kg/lb example described in one of the answers.)
