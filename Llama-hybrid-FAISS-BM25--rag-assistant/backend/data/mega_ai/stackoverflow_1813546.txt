In this case i would recommend TET from PDFLIB If you need to get a quick feel for what it can do, take a look at the TET Cookbook This is not an open source solution, but it's currently the best option in my opinion. It's not platform-dependant and has a rich set of language bindings and a commercial backing. I would be happy if someone pointed me to an equivalent or better open source alternative. To extract text you would use the TET_xxx() functions and to query metadata you can use the pcos_xxx() functions. You can also use the commanline tool to generate an XML-file containing all the information you need. tet --tetml word file.pdf There are examples on how to process TETML with XSLT in the TET Cookbook Whatâ€™s included in TETML? TETML output is encoded in UTF-8 (on zSeries with USS or MVS: EBCDIC-UTF-8, see www.unicode.org/reports/tr16), and includes the following information: general document information and metadata text contents of each page (words or paragraph) glyph information (font name, size, coordinates) structure information, e.g. tables information about placed images on the page resource information, i.e. fonts, colorspaces, and images error messages if an exception occurred during PDF processing
