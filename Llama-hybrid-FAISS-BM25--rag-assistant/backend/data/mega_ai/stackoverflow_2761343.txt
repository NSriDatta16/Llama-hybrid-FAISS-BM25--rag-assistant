Unable to login magento administration

I have just installed Magento on Windows using WAMP. Installation was successfull without any errors or warnings. When i browse administration page, i can see login screen. After entering the correct credentials it is not displaying me the Dashboard/Control Panel. Its displaying the same login page. If i enter wrong credentials, its authenticating and displaying a message as "invalid username or password" I am unable to determine the issue. If anybody has been through this issue and solved it please help me. How can i login Magento administration. Note: While installation i have selected session=Database. Will that be a issue?
