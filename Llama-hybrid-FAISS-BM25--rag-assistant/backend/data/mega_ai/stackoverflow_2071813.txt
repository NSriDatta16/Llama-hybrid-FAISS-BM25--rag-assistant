You can also do this: Member id name status Person (extends Member) id (links to member id) Organization (extends Member) id Visitor id date member_id (again, this links to the member table, you will have to do an outer join to get the actual member data, either person or organization) This uses a primary key join column and inheritance through separate table per subclass. In Hibernate, the queries are automatically written / handled for you, but they aren't that difficult to write. Let me know if that helps. Also, are you using PHP, Java, etc, and can you provide more background information into what you need or are using this for? There might be a better table design that is very different from this. Like I said, there are tools out there that automate this stuff for you so you're not worrying about low-level details. Of course, you need to understand the relationship even before using the tools, otherwise, you won't be any better off. It is good to understand them, but the tools are optimized for 90% of the stuff you will need. Walter
