Jason, I'm not sure I understand your question. This is a summary of what I've gleaned from reading it over: You capture form data for an application. Your requirements have changed to allow for user defined sections. This is a headache for you because in a relational database you'd have to dynamically alter the tables to accommodate this new requirement. This might be the case where you are using the wrong tool for the job. Relational databases are great for storing and retrieving data with well-established relationships, but are kind of terrible when you have loosely-coupled or undefined relationships in the data. You might find that you're better off with a technology like XML, which handles storage for loosely coupled data sets much better. Sorry if this is not what you were looking for. This is my first answer post on StackOverflow so I'm still getting the hang of this. Best of luck, Michael
