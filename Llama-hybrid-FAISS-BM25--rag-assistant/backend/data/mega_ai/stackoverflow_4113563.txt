Perf counters and ETW are two different things, they share no underlying infrastructure. Counters are used to provide information as to how well the operating system or an application, service, or driver is performing. The counter data can help determine system bottlenecks and fine-tune system and application performance. The operating system, network, and devices provide counter data that an application can consume to provide users with a graphical view of how well the system is performing. Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is an efficient kernel-level tracing facility that lets you log kernel or application-defined events to a log file. They can both be used for performance analysis, but ETW provides an audit trail of behaviour inside the app over time (like a traditional user-mode logfile), whereas PerfMon provides a view of either current statistics in the application ('current queue length'), or aggregated data over its lifetime (such as 'average throughput', 'total number of bytes sent').
