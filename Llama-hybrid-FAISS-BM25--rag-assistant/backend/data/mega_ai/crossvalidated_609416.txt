P(A|B,C,D) without needing to sample A,B, and C at the same time

This is my first question here, so I hope it is posed correctly. It is a Bayesian probability question: I would like to know the probability of P(A|B,C,D). I can sample everything (including P(A), P(B), P(C), P(A|B,C), P(B,C|A), P(A|C,D) etc.), except for anything that requires sampling B,C and D all at the same time. So I cannot compute P(B,C,D), P(B|C,D) P(B,C,D|A) directly (or any such probability). Is there any way to derive P(A|B,C,D) given these circumstances? I have looked into using Bayesian Model Averaging to help with this, but I was wondering if there might be a more direct solution with fewer assumptions. I look forward to your replies and thank you for taking the time to read this.
