Estimate of Uncertainty (95th Percentile - 5th Percentile)

I'm going through the Harvard Data Science Course (CS 109), and at one point, when trying to model the 2008 election, the instructor says: Compute the number of votes at the 5th and 95th quantiles, and display the difference (this is an estimate of the outcome's uncertainty) Could someone please explain how computing these quantiles would help determine uncertainty. What does uncertainty even mean in this context? Thanks Edit: I am trying to generate a model to predict the 2008 election based on polling data. Here is the hist that I created
