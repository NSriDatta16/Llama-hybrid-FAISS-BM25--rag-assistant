Which Java version are you using? With JDK 1.6.0_19, I get the behaviour you seem to be expecting. Iterating over your example XML fragment gives me three events: START_ELEMENT (root) CHARACTERS (whitespace between and ) START_ELEMENT (child) The fourth invokation of next() throws an XMLStreamException: ParseError at [row,col]:[2,12] Message: XML document structures must start and end within the same entity.
