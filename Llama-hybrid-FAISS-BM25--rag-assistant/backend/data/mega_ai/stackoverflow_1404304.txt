I would look at using a tool like CodeSmith and creating a custom template to create your Datasets rather then using the "drag + drop" designer. Creating a template takes longer in the first place, but gives your control and repeatability over what you create. Otherwise look at one of the better ORM systems and customise itâ€™s mapping to do what you want.
