For the most general approach, what you want to do is combine the data into one model. You can think of these data as having a dependent variable (Did / Didn't) and a couple of independent variables (0/B and A/not-A). You could model these data with logistic regression. The question you are asking is if there is an interaction between 0/B and A/not-A. There are traditional tests for this question for 2 x 2 x k tables. Namely, the Woolf test and Breslow-Day test. Because you have low counts in some cells (e.g. 1, 2), these approaches might be deficient. The following example uses R. It could be run at rdrr.io/snippets . To summarize the results here, as you suspected, there is a significant interaction of the effect of (A/not-A) with (0/B) (from Woolf test, Breslow-Day test, or the interaction p in the Anova results). (You'll note that the results of the Woolf test agree precisely with those from the Wald test of the interaction in the Anova table.) ### Install packages and read data if(!require(vcd)){install.packages("vcd")} if(!require(DescTools)){install.packages("DescTools")} if(!require(car)){install.packages("car")} if(!require(emmeans)){install.packages("emmeans")} if(!require(ggplot2)){install.packages("ggplot2")} Data = read.table(header=T, text=" Group1 Group2 X Count 0 not-A Did 1 0 not-A Didnt 109 0 A Did 8 0 A Didnt 102 B not-A Did 7 B not-A Didnt 103 B A Did 2 B A Didnt 108 ") Data $X = factor(Data$ X, levels = c("Didnt", "Did")) Data $Group2 = factor(Data$ Group2, levels = c("not-A", "A")) ### Woolf test and Breslow-Day test Table = xtabs(Count ~ Group2 + X + Group1, data=Data) library(vcd) woolf_test(Table) ### Woolf-test on Homogeneity of Odds Ratios (no 3-Way assoc.) ### ### X-squared = 6.5759, df = 1, p-value = 0.01034 library(DescTools) BreslowDayTest(Table) ### Breslow-Day test on Homogeneity of Odds Ratios ### ### X-squared = 8.4376, df = 1, p-value = 0.003675 ### Model logistic regession and analysis of deviance table model = glm(X ~ Group1*Group2, weights=Count, data=Data, family=binomial()) library(car) Anova(model, test="Wald") ### Analysis of Deviance Table (Type II tests) ### ### Df Chisq Pr(>Chisq) ### Group1 1 0.1109 0.73908 ### Group2 1 0.0033 0.95417 ### Group1:Group2 1 6.5759 0.01034 * ### Produce estimates of probabilities and plot library(emmeans) marginal = emmeans(model, ~ Group1:Group2, type="response") marginal ### Group1 Group2 prob SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL ### 0 not-A 0.00909 0.00905 Inf 0.00128 0.0617 ### B not-A 0.06364 0.02327 Inf 0.03064 0.1275 ### 0 A 0.07273 0.02476 Inf 0.03679 0.1387 ### B A 0.01818 0.01274 Inf 0.00455 0.0698 ### ### Confidence level used: 0.95 ### Intervals are back-transformed from the logit scale library(ggplot2) pd = position_dodge(.2) ggplot(as.data.frame(marginal), aes(x = Group1, y = prob, color = Group2)) + geom_point(shape = 15, size = 4, position = pd) + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = asymp.LCL, ymax = asymp.UCL), width = 0.2, size = 0.7, position = pd) + theme_bw() + theme(axis.title = element_text(face = "bold")) + ylab("Probability of Did")
