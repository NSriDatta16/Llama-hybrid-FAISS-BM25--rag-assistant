A Minor addition to dmex's post. The following defines the variables and the constant. private const uint WM_DROPFILES = 0x233; private const uint WM_COPYDATA = 0x004A; private const uint WM_COPYGLOBALDATA = 0x0049; private const uint MSGFLT_ADD = 1; Also, you may want to consider using ChangeWindowMessageFilterEx if you're application is on Windows 7. I also believe that OLE drag and drop may not use Windows messaging. So it wouldn't effect that at all.
