Is there literature on use of Conditional Odds Ratios to estimate Marginal Odds Ratios? Is COR equal to 1 when MOR is?

I write my questions in brief here upon requests from IWS (thanks for your reply): 1) Has anyone ever given a proof that Marginal Odds Ratio$=1->$ Conditional Odds Ratio$=1$ (let's call them $MOR$ and $COR)$? Because, in this case, we could consider the test on $COR=1$ and $MOR=1$ equivalent. 2) Has anyone ever studied the bias of using $COR$s to estimate $MOR$s? Below the long-version question: It seems to me it is recognized that both Conditional Odds Ratios ($COR$s) and Marginal Odds Ratios ($MOR$s) may be quantities of interest, but measuring different things: the $COR$ an individual effect, while the $MOR$ a population-based effect (see, for example, Burgess, 2013). However, while I found literature discussing the bias of using $MOR$ to estimate $COR$, I didn't find anything about doing the opposite: using $COR$s to estimate $MOR$s. 1) Is it due to the fact that $MOR$ is a confusing term, given in literature not related to treatment effects/the counterfactual setting it's used with the meaning of "crude $OR$"? Or because it's easier to estimate $MOR$s than $COR$s, so the problem of estimating $MOR$s by using $COR$s never occurs? 2) I read, in a paper (Gail et al., 1984), after referring to a Corollary showing that, when $COR$ is $1$, then also $MOR$ (or better saying any $OR$ estimated by omitting covariates) is $1$: This is in accord with the very general validity of significance tests of the null hypothesis $\alpha = 0$ which are based on the randomization distribution. Such tests, of course, have valid size, regardless of what covariates may or may not have been omitted, and regardless of the form of the population model. So, authors state that a test having, as null hypothesis, $Log(COR)=0$ may be valid even if performed on $Log(MOR)$. Also, again in Burgess (2013), it is stated: Although odds ratios typically differ depending on covariate adjustment, a null causal association of X on Y leads to an odds ratio of one no matter which covariates the odds ratio is considered to be marginal and conditional across. Is there a mathematical demonstration that the sentences in these papers are correct? What I'm interested about, in particular, is that also $MOR=1 -> COR=1$ holds, so that we could conclude that $COR=1 MOR=1$. I also found another paper about the estimation of the non-collapsbility effect (Pang et al., 2013), but they repeat conditions for collapsibility of $OR$s are at least one among: $COR$=1; no effect of the covariate on the outcome; independence between treatment and the covariate conditional on the outcome . I would find the demonstration I'm looking for is trivial ($MOR=1->MRR=1->CRR=1->COR=1$, being RR the relative risk/risk ratio), exploiting the fact a $OR$ of $1$ corresponds to a $RR$ of $1$, and viceversa . However, Samuels (1981) warns about the fact that the risk ratio is only collapsible if it constant. Is constancy of $OR$s (thus, $RR$s) an obvious assumption (otherwise, an interaction term would be added) or not? Edit 03 July I've realized that there is a problem: we should add the condition that $COR$ is constant across individuals. Moreover, the demonstration I'm giving above ($MOR=1->MRR=1->CRR=1->COR=1$) is invalid, because it would require, as additional hypothesis, not a constant $COR$, but a constant $CRR$.
