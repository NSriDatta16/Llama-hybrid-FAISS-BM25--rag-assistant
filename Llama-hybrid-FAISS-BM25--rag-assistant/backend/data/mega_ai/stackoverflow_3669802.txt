Concatenated / Calculated Columns in Dynamics CRM View

I am new to MS Dynamics and I would like to know if there is a way of adding column to a view within that is a concatenation of some other columns, for example: Firstname + ' ' + Lastname As Fullname There doesn't seem like there is an obvious (elegant) solution to this, all the suggestions I have seen suggest using javascript to maintain an new attribute. Taken one step further, if I want to derive or calculate a column from another column for example a person's age from their date of birth, this would need to be calculated on the fly when view loads, correct? Again I can't immediately see a way to provide this simple functionality with the CRM framework. Perhaps I am missing something? Any advice would be much appreciated.
