Could always try a silhouette score , although it may not perform well on high dimensional data. Silhouette scores compare a datapoint's placement relative to its own cluster to its placement relative to other cluster/clusters. The values returned will range between -1 (indicating a poor clustering) to +1 (indicating "good" clustering). Using Wikipedia's example, use 2 clusters and assume there is an observation i that has been placed in Cluster 1. The Silhouette score uses distance measures (Euclidean, for example, but others can also be used) to determine the average distance of i ' to every other point in Cluster 1. Then it determines the average distance of i to every point in Cluster 2. The silhouette formula for point i would be: silhouette (i) = $\frac{b(i)-a(i)}{Max\left \{ a(i), b(i) \right \}}$ Remembering for this example that i is in Cluster 1, then: If an object is closer, on average, to the points in Cluster 1 than Cluster 2, then a(i) If an object is closer, on average, to the points in Cluster 2 than Cluster 1, then a(i) > b(i) and silhouette score is negative for that point. Run this comparison across all points and all clusters, then average, and you will obtain a global silhouette score. You will see most people capture silhouette score in a for loop where they vary the number of clusters; this allows quick comparison of a range of clusters.
