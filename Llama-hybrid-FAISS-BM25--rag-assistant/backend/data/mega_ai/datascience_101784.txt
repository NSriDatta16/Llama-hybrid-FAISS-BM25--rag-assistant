How to measure the accuracy of an NLP paraphrasing model?

I using the HuggingFace library to do sentence paraphrasing (given an input sentence, the model outputs a paraphrase). How am I supposed to compare the results of two separate models (one trained with t5-base, the other with t5-small) for this task? Can I just compare the validation loss or do I need to use a metric (if so, what metric)?
