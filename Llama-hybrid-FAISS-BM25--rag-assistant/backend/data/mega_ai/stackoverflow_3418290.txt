You should select SUM and group by the MONTH(date) function as follows: SELECT SUM(value), MONTH(date) FROM TABLE GROUP BY MONTH(date) EDIT: Ooops, I misread the question, revising my answer now! You'll need to use some more complex TSQL to get the days in the months, find the average and set into each field then present it in a monthly format update Create a function to give you days in your range such as this one, which I modified from a function created by Michael Baria CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[GetDays](@StartDate DATETIME, @EndDate DATETIME) RETURNS @MonthList TABLE(DayValue tinyint NOT NULL, MonthValue tinyint NOT NULL, YearValue int NOT NULL) AS BEGIN --Variable used to hold each new date value DECLARE @DateValue DATETIME --Start with the starting date in the range SET @DateValue=@StartDate --Load output table with the month part of each new date WHILE @DateValue Join your table to this function then sum based on the days SELECT SUM(data/DATEDIFF(dd,startDate,endDate)), M.MonthValue FROM TABLE JOIN (SELECT * FROM [dbo].[GetDays] (startDate,endDate)) M GROUP BY M.MonthValue I can clean this up a bit if I get some sample data
