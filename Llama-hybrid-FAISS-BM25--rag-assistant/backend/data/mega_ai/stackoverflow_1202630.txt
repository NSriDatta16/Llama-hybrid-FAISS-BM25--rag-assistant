I would guess that 5 fingers is the upper limit. I imagine the engineers assumed most people have two hands with five fingers per hand, so the average person holding the phone in one hand only has five fingers to work with. Holding your phone with just your thumbs seems precarious at best, so using it as a trumpet seems unlikely.
