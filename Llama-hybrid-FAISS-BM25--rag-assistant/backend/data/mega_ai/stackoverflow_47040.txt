My school has always had a download link for the Lockdown browser , but I've never taken a course that required it. You can probably force the student to use it with a user agent check, but it could probably be spoofed with some effort. Proctored tests are the only way to prevent someone from cheating. All the other methods might make it hard enough to not be worth the effort for most, but don't discount the fact that certain types of people will work twice as hard to cheat than it would have taken them to study honestly.
