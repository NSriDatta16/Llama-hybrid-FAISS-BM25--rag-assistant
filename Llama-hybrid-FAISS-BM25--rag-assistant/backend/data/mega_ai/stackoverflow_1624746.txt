So after reading the question twice, I think I understood the question: you're asking about using globalStorage in file:/// documents. globalStorage ( as well as localStorage ) doesn't work very well in file:/// documents as of Firefox 3.5. I didn't see the specific bug report about this issue, but since globalStorage is deprecated in favor of localStorage , it doesn't really matter. If you're just testing it out, install some kind of web server locally, it's not complicated at all.
