PCA: What does it mean that the number of necessary PCs for a given explanation of variance percentage changes?

I initially asked this question at stackoverflow, but there was no answers. Someone suggested that I ask the question here, and here it follows. Say one has a program that performs PCA. The program calculates the number of PCs necessary in order to cover a given share of total variation in the data, e.g. 95 %. Say the number of PCs necessary in order to cover 95 % of the variance is 10 for the data used at time t=1. At t=2 we re-run the program with data from t=2. For t=2 the number of PCs necessary in order to cover 95 % of the variance is 5. Hence the number of necessary PCs in order to cover 95 % of the variance has dropped from 10 to 5 from t=1 to t=2. Main question: Can we make any conclusions about changes in the data from t=1 to t=2 in this case? Example: Can we say something like: "Since the number of PCs decreases from t=1 to t=2, there is more correlation in the data at t=1 than at t=2. With more correlation in the data, fewer PCs are needed to cover a given share of the varaince in the data."
