No, that is not the purpose of the test set. Test set is only for final evaluation when your model is done. The problem is that if you include the test set in your decisions your evaluation will no longer be reliable. To compare algorithms you instead set aside another chunk of your data called the validation set. Here is some info about good splits depending on data size: Train / Dev / Test sets from Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization by Prof. Andrew Ng . (Andrew uses the word dev set instead of validation set)
