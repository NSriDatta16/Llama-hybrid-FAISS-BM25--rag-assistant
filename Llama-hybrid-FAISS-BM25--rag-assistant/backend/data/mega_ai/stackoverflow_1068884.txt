In an OSGi bundle you can only see classes and resources from packages you have imported. The Hibernate bundle doesn't (and shouldn't) import your domain classes. Therefore, when Hibernate tries to process an XML mapping file it will complain that it can't find the class that is being mapped (your domain class). We get around the problem by using Equinox's buddy policy so every bundle that supplies domain objects is a class-loading buddy of Hibernate. I don't like this approach too much, but I don't have the time to write the (hopefully) elegant solution that's in my head. As I said in my earlier post, manipulating the context class loader is probably the best long-term bet when it comes to Hibernate.
