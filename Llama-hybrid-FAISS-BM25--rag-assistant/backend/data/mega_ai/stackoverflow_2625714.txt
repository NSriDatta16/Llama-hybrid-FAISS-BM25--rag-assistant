linebreak in url with Bibtex and hyperref package

Why is this item not shown properly in my bibliography? @misc{ann, abstract = {ANN is an implbmentation of nearest neighbor search.}, author = {David M. Mount and Sunil Arya}, howpublished = {\url{http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/}}, keywords = {knn}, posted-at = {2010-04-08 00:05:04}, priority = {2}, title = {ANN.}, url = "http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/", year = {2008} } @misc{Nilsson96introductionto, author = {Nilsson, Nils J.}, citeulike-article-id = {6995464}, howpublished = {\url{http://robotics.stanford.edu/people/nilsson/mlbook.html}}, keywords = {*file-import-10-04-11}, posted-at = {2010-04-11 06:52:28}, priority = {2}, title = {Introduction to Machine Learning: An Early Draft of a Proposed Textbook.}, year = {1996} } EDIT: I am using \usepackage{hyperref} not \usepackage{url} . It produces error when using url package together with it. So can the two not work together? I would like to use hyper links inside pdf file, so I want to use hyperref package instead of url package. I googled a bit, and try \usepackage[hyperindex,breaklinks]{hyperref} but there is still no line break just as before. How can I do it? EDIT: When using url and hyperref together, if it is just \usepackage{hyperref} \usepackage{url} the compilation by latex is fine, but the link is still hyperlink and has still no linebreak. If I do not use hyperref package, the link has linebreak, but I lose hyper links. Since \url can be used in both hyperref and url packages, how can I specify which package's \url is being used? If it is \usepackage{hyperref} \usepackage[hyphens]{url} the compilation by latex command will report clash with url: ! LaTex Error: Option clash for package url. So I wonder how I should do?
