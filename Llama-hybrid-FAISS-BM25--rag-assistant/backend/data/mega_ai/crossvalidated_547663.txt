How to decide model parameters of a neural network effectively

When choosing neural network parameters say numbers of features, layers and neurons, is the best way to do this by training each of the options several times by cross-validation and then take the average of the performance (RMSE) on test data? If there is a large range of things to test this could become very time consuming training so many neural networks - is there another way that can be used without such time demands? Could you do the exact same method but without cross-validation and it still be reliable?
