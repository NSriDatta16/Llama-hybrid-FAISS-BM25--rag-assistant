preg_replace with URL problem

I use a preg_replace to auto insert HTML links within paragraphs. Here's what I currently use: $pattern = "~(?!(?:[^ \]]|[^>\]]+ ))(".preg_quote($find_keyword, '/').")\b~msUi"; $replacement = " \$0 "; $article_content = preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, stripslashes($article_content), 1, $added ); It works great, except 1 problem: It doesn't match and replace if the keyword is a URL. If: $find_keyword="http://www.mysite.com/" it won't come up with any matches even though it's in the content. I already tried escaping $find_keyword with preg_quote, which didn't make any different. Any regex experts know a solution? Thanks.
