I've used AAR for a while without problems; it'll be as accurate as that data that you can feed it, but for general recommendation engines I think it's great. I recommend that you pre-calculate the recommended models; each day (or hour) run a rake task that calculates the recommended data for each of your models, store those, and that's what you display to the users. Otherwise it can be a drag on performance (but may not be if small datasets).
