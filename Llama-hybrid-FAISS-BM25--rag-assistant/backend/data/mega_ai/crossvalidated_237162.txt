Multivariate Regression equivalent to Multinomial Regression (aggregated variables)?

Context (optional) In genetics one often uses data coming from SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphismes) which are genetic markers of which several (usually 2) versions (a.ka. alleles) exists in a given population. If you consider a span of such SNP there are often (pretty much always) redundancies and often only a handful of SNP are enough to explain the whole. Let's say that in my sample I am considering a span 4 SNP of alleles A/T, T/C, A/G and A/G. Let's say that for such a span I only observed the following sequences : ATATA, TTGG & ACAA. Then I can only use two of those SNP to describe the exact same sequences : for exemple the first and second are enough. To extract such SNP I am thinking of using LASSO logistic regression but I am now wondering if the "form" of the response variable(s) is important. Question The variables I'm working with are all categorical with 2 categories and the response variable is the aggregate of all values taken by those variables. So if an individual takes the values A, T, C, G for the variables then the corresponding response value is ATCG. I am trying to extract the smallest possible set of variable to predict the response variable using LASSO logistic regression. The question is : Is is equivalent to use a multivariate model where the response variables are duplicates of the independent variable and a multinomial model where the response variable is a categorical variable corresponding to the aggregate of the independant variable. Hope I was clear enough, thanks !
