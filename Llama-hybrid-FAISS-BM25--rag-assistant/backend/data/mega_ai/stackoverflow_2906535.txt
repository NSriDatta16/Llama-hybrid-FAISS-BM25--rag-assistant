Ahem. After a while trying to figure this one out, I got right back to the start and began questioning my assumptions. Usually in this kind of situation if nobody seems to have an answer I am doing something really dense. Sure enough, I have a couple of classes in my Web Service file ( because it's a stub for testing and will not be used in the long term ) and I had completely the wrong class named in my .asmx file as the supporting code for the web service. Once I corrected that, everything worked fine. I'm not proud, it's far from my proudest moment, but I'll leave this just in case anyone else runs into the same problem...
