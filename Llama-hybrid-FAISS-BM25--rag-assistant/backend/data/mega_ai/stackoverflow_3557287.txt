The way I was always told to think about it is that Entities should have as little in them as possible and that various objects should perform operations against entities. The entities themselves should not be aware of the DAL or they lose their data storage ignorance So in this case, a CarManager (or similar) which possibly has a dependency on the CarDAO should have a ChangeToRightHandDrive(Car) method. Oh and one other advantage to having a CarManager which performs the complex operations is that you're not relying on stored procs - This is almost certainly a religious issue but I prefer to have all the logic in my code rather than relying on SPs (There are a few exceptions but usually only around large sets). This means that if you changed to another DAL (say XML), you wouldn't need to re-implement your SP in your DAL/DAO - Otherwise, you'd end up with business logic embedded in your DAL.
