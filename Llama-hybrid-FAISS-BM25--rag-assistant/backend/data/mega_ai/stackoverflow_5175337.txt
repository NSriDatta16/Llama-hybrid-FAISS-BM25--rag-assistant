Caching asp.net page response on client side

I am trying to cache asp.net page response on client Browser by adding following cache headers Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(10)); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(System.Web.HttpCacheability.Public); With the above headers it is not working.. May I know what else to be added? I am using jquery from client side to get the page response
