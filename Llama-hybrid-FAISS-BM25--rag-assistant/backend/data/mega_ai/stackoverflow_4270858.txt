In my experience, UML Class diagrams are best used in an isolated context -- to describe a section of the system. So my answer is that if you are describing a piece of your system in a document, and a UML class diagram would help a reader understand the relevant section of the system then you should do a diagram for that section and include it. Doing one class diagram for the entire system is rarely, if ever, useful. And including various class diagrams without context is also rarely useful. Be strategic in your use of UML; it's a communication tool, not a documentation tool. (Sort of like writing. Words on paper means nothing unless used and organized thoughtfully)
