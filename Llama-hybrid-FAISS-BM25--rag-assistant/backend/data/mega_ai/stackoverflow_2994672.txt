If you want wide commercial support, you're looking more at #2 than #3 currently (or potentially even #1..). EDIT: Of course, it depends on what you mean by "commercial", but large commercial organizations tend to be behind-the-curve in developer tools. I've primarily seen SCM-per-project/group, but I'm sure less-technical commercial organizations might just use a single SCM solution provided by their IT group.
