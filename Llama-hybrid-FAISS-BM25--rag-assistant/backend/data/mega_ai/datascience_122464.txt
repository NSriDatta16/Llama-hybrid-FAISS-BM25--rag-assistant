Automatic statistical analysis / statistical "diff" tool?

I'm new to data science and wondered if there are ways to have a tool figure out relations between variables that may be relevant to a problem. Imagine I have a log file that I have pre-processed to the following tsv file (600k rows): time req ip latency status length |------------- |-- |--------------- |----- |----- |----- 11:59:59.8048 Foo 111.208.52.116 1728 200 OK 2422 11:59:59.9454 Goo 11.88.226.84 1567 200 OK 2422 11:59:59.9611 Bar 111.38.177.130 26460 200 OK 1068 11:59:59.9923 Foo 11.88.226.84 1795 200 OK 2422 12:00:00.0079 Foo 11.110.239.63 1816 200 OK 2422 12:00:00.0548 Bar 111.147.192.171 15265 200 OK 1024 12:00:00.0704 Baz 111.130.195.74 1801 200 OK 9876 12:00:00.0704 Foo 111.130.195.74 1803 200 OK 2422 12:00:00.1173 Bar 11.139.142.176 10527 200 OK 1024 ... 14:59:54.3229 Faz 111.136.253.236 1317386 200 OK 2417 14:59:54.3229 Foo 11.12.5.128 4319 200 OK 2418 14:59:55.4792 Far 111.100.110.47 25120 200 OK 5432 14:59:55.4792 Zoo 111.86.217.168 23236 200 OK 2417 14:59:55.4949 Rar 111.65.9.93 137184 200 OK 2417 Now I would like to know if this data can perhaps tell me what variables (or combinations of variables) are related to the CPUs being pegged at 100% (which was the case from 12:50 throughout 13:05) versus the CPU usage being around 50% (all other times). I can of course manually try to plot and aggregate variables against each other that I think are relevant, but that takes time and experience (although I found doing it with R is fast and fun, compared to spreadsheet apps), and I wondered if there is a way to just throw 2 sets of data at R or some other tool, and it will tell me what the differences of those sets are, statistically speaking. Of course variables can be combined and aggregated in a myriad of ways, but as Occam's Razor would suggest, this diff should start as simple as possible and only get more complicated over time, e.g. until I'm satisfied and tell it to stop.
