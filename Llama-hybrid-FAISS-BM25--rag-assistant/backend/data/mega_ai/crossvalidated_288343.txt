I'm not very sure as to how much people used neural networks back then, due to limitations in computational resources. There are, however, other methods with which one can train neural nets! Conjugate gradient, first proposed in 1952 Newton's method (i did not find any reference as to when the formula we use today in NN's was published) Quasi - Newton method (again, I found no reference to original publish date) Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, first published in 1944 For more information on each method, refer to the following link : https://www.neuraldesigner.com/blog/5_algorithms_to_train_a_neural_network
