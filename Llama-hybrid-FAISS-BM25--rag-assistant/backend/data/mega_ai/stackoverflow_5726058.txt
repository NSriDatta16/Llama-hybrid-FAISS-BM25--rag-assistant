Mixing Groovy MarkupBuilder with Converters

I am trying to inject XML fragments created by an XML converter into an MarkupBuilder. However I cannot get the formatting correct, and it seems as though there is unnecessary intermediate serialisation steps. import grails.converters.XML import groovy.xml.MarkupBuilder //... def writer = new StringWriter () def xml = new MarkupBuilder (writer) xml.response { status ("OK") myList.each { it as XML } //Insert objects by converting to XML } println writer.toString() The output required would be OK 5 5 My current attempt is this def writer = new StringWriter () def xml = new MarkupBuilder (writer) xml.response { status ("OK") myList.each { xml.mkp.yieldUnescaped ( it as XML ) } } println writer.toString() However currently each xml fragment is preceeded by Is there a groovier way to achieve this?
