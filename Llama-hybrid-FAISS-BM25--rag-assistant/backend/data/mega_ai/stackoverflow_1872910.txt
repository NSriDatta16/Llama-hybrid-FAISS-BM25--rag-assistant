Save and get arbitrary sort order in SQL Server

My client wants to sort products by drag & drop. The drag & drop part is easy with javascript. My problem is how do I save and get the sort order? I'm using .net c# and SQL Server 2008. When I move a product and drop it in a new position I get the id of the product that's moved, product in front and product behind. With this data I want to update the sort order of products. I was thinking of adding a field with position, but then I guess I have to update every item when position changes.
