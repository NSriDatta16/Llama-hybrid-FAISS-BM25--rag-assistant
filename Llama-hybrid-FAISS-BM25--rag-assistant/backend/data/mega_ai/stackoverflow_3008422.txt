Well, I think something like that is really hard to do but also it would be a great pet project. You should have notions of parsers, lexers, flow control, paradigms (imperative, functional, OO) and many other things. Many people says the Dragon Book is one of the best books for this. Maybe you can take a look at it :) Good Luck!
