Couple a months ago there was a presentation on Data Science Warsaw meetup on similar topic (data mining in energy industry). Unfortunately the presentation is in Polish. What follows will be based on the presentation. Q1, Q2: Anomaly detection seems like a good match, if you have systems which are fine most of the time, but can exhibit abnormal faulty behavior. The presentation mentions using autoencoders for such application. If you have labeled data (whether it should be alarming or not) you might be able to use classification . Of course then you'd need to be careful about your data, because if you have faulty/not faulty situation, then most likely you have mostly not faulty data which will result in severe class imbalance (see Class imbalance in Supervised Machine Learning ). Q3: I googled 'outlier detection industrial applications' and got this article . I think that this query, and also one with 'anomaly detection' might be of interest to you.
