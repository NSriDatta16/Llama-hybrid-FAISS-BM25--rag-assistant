Assuming $Y$ is a continuous variable, the main difference in a general regression problem (what you called 'machine learning') and time series analysis is that the latter contains observations indexed in time order. This is both multivariate regression problem, since there are multiple independent variables, and a time series problem. I believe the term Dynamic Regression is also used. Usually you create a regression problem where the dependent variables include exogenous regressors $X$ and past observations of the target variable $Y$ . Classical time series models can be extended to include exogenous regressors (for example ARIMAX ). Moreover, you can include past observations of $Y$ in the dependent variables and apply any regression algorithm from the machine learning literature. There are also hybrid approaches. Here is an example where a multivariate regression is first applied (only exogenous variables) and then ARIMA is used to model the residuals.
