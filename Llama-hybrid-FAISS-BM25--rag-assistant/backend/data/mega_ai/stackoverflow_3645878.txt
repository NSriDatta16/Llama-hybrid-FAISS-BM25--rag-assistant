Creating a file on the SD-Card in android

I want to create a file on the SD-Card and later save a CSV file in it. From surfing around I noticed that there seem to be two ways about going about it: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesExternal If you're using API Level 8 or greater, use getExternalFilesDir() to open a File that represents the external storage directory where you should save your files. This method takes a type parameter that specifies the type of subdirectory you want, such as DIRECTORY_MUSIC and DIRECTORY_RINGTONES (pass null to receive the root of your application's file directory). If you're using API Level 7 or lower, use getExternalStorageDirectory(), to open a File representing the root of the external storage. You should then write your data in the following directory: /Android/data//files/ And http://www.anddev.org/working_with_files-t115.html : FileWriter f = new FileWriter("/sdcard/download/possible.txt"); What way should I use? If the first, how do I write my application to be compatible with both API level =8? Is there some good tutorial for doing it the first way?
