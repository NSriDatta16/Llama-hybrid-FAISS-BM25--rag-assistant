You can launch an intent that will allow the user to choose what app will open the PDF with the following code, which will work for any file and mimetype. If the user doesn't have an app that can open it, you can display an error or do whatever else you need to do. Note that the file must be world-readable, so it must be marked as such if it is on Internal storage, or it must be in external storage. private void openFile(File f, String mimeType) { Intent viewIntent = new Intent(); viewIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_VIEW); viewIntent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), mimeType); // using the packagemanager to query is faster than trying startActivity // and catching the activity not found exception, which causes a stack unwind. List resolved = getPackageManager().queryIntentActivities(viewIntent, 0); if(resolved != null && resolved.size() > 0) { startActivity(viewIntent); } else { // notify the user they can't open it. } }
