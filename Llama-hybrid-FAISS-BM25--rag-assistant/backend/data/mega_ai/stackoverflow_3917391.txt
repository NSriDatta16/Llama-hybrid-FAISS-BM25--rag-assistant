OSX Port Python Library Path? Cant find ctypes

I am trying to use an application that has a dependency of ctypes, but am getting this error: $ python peach.py -t ~/Desktop/fuzz/wav/template.xml ] Peach 2.3.6 Runtime ] Copyright (c) Michael Eddington Traceback (most recent call last): File "peach.py", line 335, in from Peach.Engine import * File "/opt/Peach-2.3.6/Peach/__init__.py", line 40, in import Publishers, Transformers File "/opt/Peach-2.3.6/Peach/Publishers/__init__.py", line 37, in import file, sql, stdout, tcp, udp, com, process, http, icmp, raw, remote, dll, smtp File "/opt/Peach-2.3.6/Peach/Publishers/file.py", line 37, in from Peach.Engine.engine import Engine File "/opt/Peach-2.3.6/Peach/Engine/engine.py", line 835, in from Peach.Engine.state import StateEngine File "/opt/Peach-2.3.6/Peach/Engine/state.py", line 38, in import sys, re, types, time, struct, ctypes File "/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/ctypes/__init__.py", line 10, in from _ctypes import Union, Structure, Array ImportError: No module named _ctypes I have installed py-ctypes from ports, but it seems to only be a Python 2.4 version: $ port contents py-ctypes Port py-ctypes contains: /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_ctypes.so /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/_ctypes_test.so /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ctypes/__init__.py /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ctypes/__init__.pyc /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ctypes/_endian.py /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ctypes/_endian.pyc /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ctypes/macholib/__init__.py /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ctypes/macholib/__init__.pyc /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ctypes/macholib/dyld.py /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ctypes/macholib/dyld.pyc /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ctypes/macholib/dylib.py /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ctypes/macholib/dylib.pyc I then tried to run the application via python2.4, but it seems the application uses syntax that is only available in 2.5: $ python2.4 peach.py -t ~/Desktop/fuzz/wav/template.xml File "peach.py", line 498 finally: ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax My python install is also from OSX ports, and I noticed in the Peach application, it defines python as: #!/usr/bin/python Will that mess with anything if my default python executable points to my port installation (and I am running 'python peach.py')? $ which python /opt/local/bin/python Is there any work around for this? ctypes for python2.5? Ability to add 2.4 libraries to 2.5 path?
