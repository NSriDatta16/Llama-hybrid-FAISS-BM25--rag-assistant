(disclaimer: this may not correspond exactly to the content of your question, but it corresponds to the title) I think that about the topic of Rest representation of RDF data is a general problem of inverting the order of concepts. For me the normal would be to have a collection of Rest documents with RDF data and use a RDF database for indexing and making global querys. In this situation you can organize your resources in the way you prefer. Also (if you pretend to use the URI of the node as the exported resource) your approach will have subtle problems about what is the meaning of your resources: the Rest resources you propose here are " information resources " and then they cannot be abstract resources. There will be a conflict between information and meta-information. I published an article here explaining this view in more detail.
