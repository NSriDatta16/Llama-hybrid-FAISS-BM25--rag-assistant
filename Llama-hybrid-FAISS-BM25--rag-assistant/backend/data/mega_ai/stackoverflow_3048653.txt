As far as "implementation details tackling this 'by hand'", you could read about how database systems do this by searching for the original papers on database design or finding graduate course notes on database architecture. I did some searching and found a survey article by G. Graefe titled " Query evaluation techniques for large databases ". It somewhat exhaustively covers every aspect of querying large databases, but the entire section 4 addresses how "query evaluation systems ... access base data stored in the database". Also, Graefe's survey was linked to by the course page for CPS 216: Advanced Databases Systems at Duke, Fall 2001. Week 5 was on Physical Data Organization which says that most commerical DBMS's organize data on-disk using blocks in the N-ary Storage Model (NSM): records are stored from the beginning of each block and a "directory" exists at the end.
