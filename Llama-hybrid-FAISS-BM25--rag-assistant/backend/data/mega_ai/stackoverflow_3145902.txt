One way to do it is to have the video on the timeline of a flash file (when you drag the video into flash it will give you the option). then with actionscript you need to make sure the movieclip is paused and manually move the playhead of the currentframe backwards at about the frame rate of the movie. it isn't trivial but it's possible. Note that you won't have the sound working. HTH.
