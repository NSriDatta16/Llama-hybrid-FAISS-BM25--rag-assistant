Your answer depends on how long it takes for your BOSH session to timeout. It's usually 60 seconds until it throws away the session. Just a note- you probably do not want to automatically log in a user, since the proper XMPP flow is not done. Here's a typical flow: -> Login and establish a BOSH session. -> Send Presence ---> Server sends a packet to all entities in your roster, notifying them that you are available. ---> Server sends a presence probe to all of the entities in your roster's server, getting their current availability. -> Request roster items With the approach of using the same session, you skip all of this initialization, which I assume is important to your application, as you will not get presence of any entities until they change their presence. Sending another stanza will not send you the current presence of everyone in your roster. So... if that isn't important to you, go ahead and do it. I'm just providing some useful information before you go and implement the thing and find out that there are caveats to your solution. What worked for us was to use localStorage, and automatically log them in via a "Save my password" button. That makes it simpler and less work. Also, it can be confusing when a user reloads the page and they get logged back in automatically, versus a user closing the page and coming back in 5 minutes to be greeted by the login page. It's just plain confusing. Good luck!
