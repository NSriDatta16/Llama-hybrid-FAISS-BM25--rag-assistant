Which file system are you using? each file system has its own limitation on number of files/folders a directory can have (including the directory depth). So not sure how you could create and if created through some program were you able to read all the files back. As suggested above the FileNameFilter , is a post file name filter so I am not sure if it would be any help (although you are probably creating smaller lists of file lists) as each listFiles() method would get the complete list. For example: 1) Say Thread 1 is capturing list of file names starting with "T* ", listFiles() call would retrieve all the thousands of file names and then filters as per FileNameFilter criteria 2) Thread 2 if capturing list of file names starting with "S *" would repeat the all the steps from 1. So, you reading the directory listing multiple times putting more and more load on Heap/JVM native calls/file system etc. If possible best suggestion would be to re-organize the directory structure.
