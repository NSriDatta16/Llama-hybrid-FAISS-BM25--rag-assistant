categorizing a variable turns it from insignificant to significant

I have a numeric variable which turns out not significant in a multivariate logistic regression model. However, when I categorize it into groups, suddenly it becomes significant. This is very counter-intuitive to me: when categorizing a variable, we give some information up. How can this be?
