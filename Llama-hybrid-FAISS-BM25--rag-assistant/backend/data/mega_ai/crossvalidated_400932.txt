1) You might want to try a chi-square test to figure out whether symptoms A and B are equally present in cases where physical activity follows a specific pattern, say (Walk=yes&Swim=no&Physio=yes). Do this for all frequent patterns of physical activity and then focus your analyses on those patterns that affect the symptoms differently . 2) You could perform linear regression for each of ordinal disability variables , using numeric combinations of physical activity flag and physical activity measure as predictors. Your predictors should look like (Walk=yes|no)*(Number of times exercised: Walk) ; they can take positive or zero values. 3) The same combined factors could be used as predictors in logistic regression for each pattern of symptoms . I'd suggest not wasting your data on predicting events like (SymptomA=yes); rather identify frequent patterns of symptoms (or patterns of medical interest) and model events like (SymptomA=yes&SymptomB=yes).
