By overriding the Agent's action, Agent can theoretically take this action over and over and do nothing else, there is nothing to stop the agent from doing this, or teach the agent that this is not the intended action here. What I usually do in these situations is, I punish the agent if the action is not desirable. So if agent take the action to go to the left, but there is a wall on the left side, I would not change the state of the environment (So the agent won't move), but I would also send a minus value (punishment) as a reward. This way after some training, the agent would learn that this action is not desirable. The same can be applied to you Stock example. So if the agent tries to sell more stock that it actually has, you just don't sell the stock but also punish it with a big minus reward. This way it makes it easier for the agent to actually understand the environment. Hope this helps.
