You're trading off maintenance costs against costs of delivery. If you have fine-grained Event definitions each observer gets only exactly what he needs, so you don't pay for the overhead of delivery to observers who are uninterested - but that saving costs because every new kind of nugget needs to be added to the system in some way. In Pub/Sub messaging systems where the delivery costs are relatively high (messages flowing over networks) one typically needs to pay careful attention to the topic deifintions. A carefully designed topic hierarchy is often useful. So we get patterns like sport football england premier champioship scotland spl france ... cricket australia ... india sri lanka Hence allowing subscriptions at various levels. You can subscribe to all sport or (as some folks might) right down to sport/football/england/championship/watford
