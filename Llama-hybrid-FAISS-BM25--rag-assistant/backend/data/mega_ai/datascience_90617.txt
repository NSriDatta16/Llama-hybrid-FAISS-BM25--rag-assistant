In short, in RL we develop an agent that interacts with an environment by generating actions that have an effect to the environment. So the agent perceives the state of the environment e.g. by using a Neural Network and outputs the relevant action. For your first question take a look at the Openai pendulum environment . For your second question yes model.predict(observation) does exactly this. If you think that every model is a NN with input observations then the output will be an action (sometimes implicitly as you might get expected values as outputs and use them to define your action selection policy).
