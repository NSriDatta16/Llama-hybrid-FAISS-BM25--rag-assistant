Why does the probability of a binary outcome change with changes in the logistic model?

I am trying to predict whether a lightning strike starts a fire or not. In that regard, I am trying to calculate the probability of a lightning strike to start a fire. One variable is binary ( polarity ) and I change it to 0 representing negatively charged lightning strikes and 1 represents positively charged lightning strikes. The logistic model ( bcc ) is: print(bcc) Intercept -2.2241e+01 Polarity -1.5398e-01 Amplitude -1.8666e-03 and the average probability is calculated: probability = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(-2.224109e+01 + (bcc.amplitude * -1.866664e-03) + bcc.polarity_dummy * -1.539889e-01)` print(probability.mean()) 0.00043334521395529236 I realise, I made a mistake and the 0 actually represents positively charged lightning strikes, and the 1 is negatively charged lightning strikes. The model does not change considerably, only the polarity changes from negative to positive: print(bcc_new) Intercept -2.2241e+01 Polarity 1.5398e-01 Amplitude -1.8666e-03 probability = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(-2.224109e+01 + (bcc.amplitude * -1.866664e-03) + bcc.polarity_dummy * 1.539889e-01)` print(probability.mean()) 0.0004833008259756023 Now the probability changes from 0.0004 to 0.0005 . While the former is 'correct' in my opinion, I still struggle to understand why the probability changes so substantially (in relative terms) when the model does not really change. The ratio of negatively : positively charged lightning strikes are the same, the polarity coefficient changes to positive, when the positively charged lightning strikes are represented by 1 and negative vice versa. So why does the probability change so much? Have I done something wrong?
