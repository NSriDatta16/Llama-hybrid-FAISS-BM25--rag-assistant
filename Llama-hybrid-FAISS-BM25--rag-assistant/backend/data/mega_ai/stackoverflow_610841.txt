Here's an idea, but like others have said it might be based on your specific domain. Consider 1 "normalized" year = 365.242199 days counting all the leap stuff (says google) Calculate the average sales per day in your year based on the real number of days in that year Scale it up or down to sales per 365.242199 days So for example 2007 = $4000 in sales. There's 365 days in 2007, so avg sale per day = $10.96 Multpiplying times num days in a normalized year (365.242199) gives you $4003.05 normalized sales You can compare this directly to a similar calculation for 2008, 2008 = $5000 in sales. There's 366 days in 2008, so avg sale per day = $13.66 Multpiplying times num days in a normalized year (365.242199) gives you $4975.655 normalized sales for 2008!
