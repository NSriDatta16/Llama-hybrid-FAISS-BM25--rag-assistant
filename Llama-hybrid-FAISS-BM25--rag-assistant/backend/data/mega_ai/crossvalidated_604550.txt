You don't have enough data. When you only have very little data, you should stick to very basic models because they are less likely to give strange results and would be easier to interpret. In your case, you have only two points, so the simplest thing you can do is use linear interpolation . Yes, this model would be wrong, because at some point it would start predicting probabilities higher than one, but it would be a useful one to solve your problem. It wouldn't give you the prediction intervals. Using linear interpolation would be equivalent to linear regression, for linear regression, depending on implementation and how you would use it, it would return "not a number" for the intervals, or maybe zero width intervals, or maybe something else, because you don't have enough data. A more realistic answer would be that the intervals are something very wide and unlikely useful. Linear interpolation would give you a good rough guess and you probably can't expect to get much more than this without cheating yourself. One alternative could be if you have some prior knowledge and could formulate it as a Bayesian model, so the result would depend not only on those two points, but also the prior, but that's a different story.
