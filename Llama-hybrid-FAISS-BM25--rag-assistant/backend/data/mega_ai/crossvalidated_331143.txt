Let $S$ be the set of samples you get from your process. Let $I_i = \begin{cases}1 & i \in S \\ 0 & o.w. \end{cases}$. Then, $S = \{I_1,\cdots,I_{100}\}$, and your question "on average, how many unique integers are selected" can be translated to $$\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{100} I_i\right] = \sum_{i=1}^{100} P(I_i = 1)$$ Since the sample is equal probability, we can easily get: $$P(I_i = 1) = 1 - P(I_i = 0) = 1 - \left(\frac{99}{100}\right)^{100} \approx 0.633967$$ and this holds for all $i=1,\cdots,100$. Thus, the answer is $100\times 0.633967 \approx 63.3967$, which matches with your simulation.
