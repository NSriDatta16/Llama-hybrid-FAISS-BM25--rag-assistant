A wonderful historical example is afforded by the 1933 publication of Horace Secrist's Triumph of Mediocrity in Business . At the time, Secrist was a well-established statistician, author of a textbook (c. 1919, I recall), well-connected in the American Statistical Association, and head of a statistical research group at Northwestern University. He and his staff had spent the previous decade compiling time series of business data, which are reproduced and painstakingly analyzed in the book. It was meant to be a chef d'oeuvre by an ambitious statistician. Harold Hotelling's review of the book, which appeared in JASA later that year, pointed out that Secrist had merely documented hundreds of examples of regression to the mean (a fundamental topic in any introductory statistics course today, point #1 of the question). Secrist objected in a published reply. Hotelling's response to that is a classic: To "prove" such a mathematical result by a costly and prolonged numerical study ... is analogous to proving the multiplication table by arranging elephants in rows and columns, and then doing the same for numerous other kinds of animals. The performance, though perhaps entertaining, and having a certain pedagogical value, is not an important contribution either to zoology or to mathematics. [JASA v. 29 #186, June 1934, p. 199.] Secrist seems to have faded quickly from the statistical scene shortly after that ("careers ruined," point #2 in the question). His book is still available. (A few years ago I obtained a nice clean copy, obviously little read, through Interlibrary Loan.) From it you can extract any number of example datasets (point #3 of the question). Steven Stigler recounts this story in a book and a paper, The history of statistics in 1933 .
