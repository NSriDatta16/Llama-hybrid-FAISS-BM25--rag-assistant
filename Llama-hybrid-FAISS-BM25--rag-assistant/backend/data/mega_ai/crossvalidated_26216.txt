I am an economist and I have been working in research for 4 years now, mostly doing applied econometrics. There are plenty of econometrics packages out there, and there is room for all of them. In my view, in economics, Stata is used for almost everything but time series, Rats, Eviews and Ox are used for time series, Matlab and Gauss are used for more low level programming. The advantage of R is that it is capable of doing almost everything the other programs do, and it's free and open. It requires some more programming and has less canned procedures, but it gets things done at the end. I use Stata most of the time, but if I had to choose one software to do everything, I would choose R. R is pretty reliable on most econometrics problems, but I can provide examples of some routines written for R that are not reliable. I have had problems with 3SLS and demand system estimation routines. Numerical optimization routines are not as robust as in Stata or Gauss. On the other hand, R is much better at problems like quantile regression. Still, with a good working knowledge of R, you can find out what is the problem in R's user written routines, fix it, and continue working. So I don't think the lack of reliability in some specific routines is a compelling reason not to use R at all. My advice would be to continue using R but to have experience on other program that is widely used in your field , e.g. Stata for microeconometrics or Rats for time series.
