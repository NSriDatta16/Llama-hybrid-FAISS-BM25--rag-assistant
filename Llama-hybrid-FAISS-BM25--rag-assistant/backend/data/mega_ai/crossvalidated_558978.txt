There are two aspects here causal inference and explainability. From a causal inference perspective, domain expertise should guide the process of building relevant factors on a given purpose, targets, that are really linked and not just correlations explored or discovered by data scientists. Inference and Intervention: Causal Models for Business, by Ryall-Bramson (2013), routledge provides set of case studies on how domain knowledge can guide building causal models. In purely machine learning projects, bottom line is model's performance. So called feature discovery and extraction is usually performed without domain experts input, and best performing model is generated by data scientist. Domain experts involvement in this approach appears to be in ensuring to set to right business target in machine learning models. If it is a regulated environment or a requirement is there, then the machine learning model explainability work might require intervention from domain expert, see Interpretable Machine Learning .
