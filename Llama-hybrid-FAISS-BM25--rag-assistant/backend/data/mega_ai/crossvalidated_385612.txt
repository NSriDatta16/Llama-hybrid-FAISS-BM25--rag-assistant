Newsvendor problem with Poisson demand

Problem: The demand for a particular weekly magazine in a newsstand follows a Poisson distribution averaging 5.2 copies per week. The value paid for each magazine is 15.00 and the sale price is 30.00. Admit that, by the end of the week, the newsvendor can sell all the magazines left over for the price of 8.00 per unit. What's the weekly amount of magazines the newsvendor should buy? Partial Solution: Let $q$ be the weekly amount of magazines the newsvendor should buy: $$X = \text{Poisson}(5.2)$$ $$Y = \left\{\matrix{22X - 7q, &X \le q \\ 15q, &X \gt q.}\right.$$ We want to maximize newsvendor's profit, so we need to compute $q^* = \arg\max(E[Y])$ : $$E[Y]=\sum_{k=0}^{q} (22k - 7q) \frac{e^{-5.2} 5.2^k}{k!} + \sum_{k=q+1}^{\infty} (15q) \frac{e^{-5.2} 5.2^k}{k!}.$$ Question: Am I on the right track? If so, how to solve $\frac{\partial E[Y]}{\partial q} = 0$ ?
