MCMC provides You with samples $\beta_k$. First compute $y_{ik}$ for each sample of $\beta_k$ and find the scores at percentile $\alpha/2$ and $1-\alpha/2$ for the vector of samples $y_i$. The two scores provide the interval bounds. For instance in Python, the latter step can be easily done with the function scipy.stats.scoreatpercentile
