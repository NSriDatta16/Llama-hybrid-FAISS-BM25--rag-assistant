Python Beginner: Selective Printing in loops

I'm a very new python user (had only a little prior experience with html/javascript as far as programming goes), and was trying to find some ways to output only intermittent numbers in my loop for a basic bicycle racing simulation (10,000 lines of biker positions would be pretty excessive :P). I tried in this loop several 'reasonable' ways to communicate a condition where a floating point number equals its integer floor (int, floor division) to print out every 100 iterations or so: for i in range (0,10000): i = i + 1 t = t + t_step #t is initialized at 0 while t_step is set at .01 acceleration_rider1 = (power_rider1 / (70 * velocity_rider1)) - (force_drag1 / 70) velocity_rider1 = velocity_rider1 + (acceleration_rider1 * t_step) position_rider1 = position_rider1 + (velocity_rider1 * t_step) force_drag1 = area_rider1 * (velocity_rider1 ** 2) acceleration_rider2 = (power_rider2 / (70 * velocity_rider1)) - (force_drag2 / 70) velocity_rider2 = velocity_rider2 + (acceleration_rider2 * t_step) position_rider2 = position_rider2 + (velocity_rider2 * t_step) force_drag2 = area_rider1 * (velocity_rider2 ** 2) if t == int(t): #TRIED t == t // 1 AND OTHER VARIANTS THAT DON'T WORK HERE:( print t, "biker 1", position_rider1, "m", "\t", "biker 2", position_rider2, "m"
