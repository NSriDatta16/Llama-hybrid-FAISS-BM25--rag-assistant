Oracle SQL query question

I'm trying to complete this Oracle SQL query with no luck. "List the department that has the least average cost. (Hint: SELECT MIN(AVG(cost) ) is valid as long as no other column is combined in the SELECT statement. You can combine the above as a subquery with another query)" I'm able to get it to display the Depts with their average cost, but when I try to work in MIN it breaks. This is what I have so far. SELECT DeptNo, AVG(projcost) FROM projects, clinicians WHERE clinicians.Clinicianno = projects.Clinicianno GROUP BY DeptNo; That will give me the depts and their AVG, but when I change AVG(projcost) to be MIN(AVG(projcost) it breaks. The hint is to make it a subquery but I can't figure out how to do that yet. Any help would be much appreciated.
