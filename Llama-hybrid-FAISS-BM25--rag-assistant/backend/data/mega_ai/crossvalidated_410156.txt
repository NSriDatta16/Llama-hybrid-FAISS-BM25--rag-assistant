I'm dealing right now with this kind of topic for my last physics master degree exam, so I'll try to give what I think is the best way to tackle the question. Ergodicity in general is, as you stated, an intrinsic property of a dynamical system. Specifically, this coincides with the statement $\lim_{T \to \infty}\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T} dt f(x(t)) = \langle f(x) \rangle$ , so that given a certain well-behaved function $f(x)$ (observable) its time average has the distribution one as a almost certain limit. This happens $\textit{if and only if}$ the only invariant subsets of our dynamical space $\Omega$ are the $\emptyset$ one and the whole space itself. This is a very strong condition, which certainly implies LLN, which is evident taking as observable $f(x)$ the random variable $X$ itself. However, we could talk about ergodic properties of a system without meaning ergodicity in general, which is usually really hard to prove. In this framework the LLN on its own provides an $\textit{ergodic property}$ for the mean only! Other ergodic properties can in principle be studied, for instance related to the correlation function or to the distribution, meaning that the time correlation in the first case, and the normalized histogram in the second case, tend both to their distribution value. These various ergodic properties are actually more readily demonstrable than ergodicity in general. What I think you're missing is the definition of ergodicity, which is not related to mean ergodicity only, but to every function of the random variable $X$ . I hope that this explanation is clear enough. For any doubt about ergodicity you can check about Birkhoff's theorem.
