Rank-ordered logit is a good route (search for Bolton & Chapman's paper on Multinomial Logit for Handicapping horse races - their treatment is easy to digest). Regarding your questions: 1) Rank-ordered logit can return probabilities by horse for however many horses are in the race. STATA has a built in command for this (rologit) 2) You'll have to use domain knowledge on deciding which trainer features are most relevant. I'd start with trainer's overall win percent, win percent on today's surface, jockey-trainer combined win percent, etc. You could later incorporate features like trainer last 30 day win % divided by last 180 day win % to get a feel for whether recent momentum is predictive 3) In my opinion, definitely go with a model that can be interpreted like rank ordered logit. Deep learning model is probably overkill Hope this helps.
