I've seen this referenced as the Command pattern . I first learned about it reading Uncle Bob's Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C# . I believe its elegance is its simplicity. I've used it when I wrote a file processing service. The service performed all of the administration of reading / deleting files. When a file needed to be processed, it's respective plugin was loaded. Each plugin implemented a Process method, and did whatever was needed to process that type of file. (Mainly, parse the contents and insert into a database.) Everytime I had to process a new file type with a new layout, all I had to do was create a new Plugin that implemented Process . This worked for me because I needed a simple solution. If you need to take in more than one parameter, this probably is not the pattern to use.
