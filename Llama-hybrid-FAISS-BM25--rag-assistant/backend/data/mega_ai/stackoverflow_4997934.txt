Android web server

So for my Android app I need a centralized server so multiple phones can use it. This server is only going to hold text. Just coordinates and a string per request. I looked into Amazon S3 and Google Storage. These store "buckets" of info through a RESTful API. So basically, I can't put/get info into these things as I would into a database. I'm going to have to send/receive a text file correct? Would it make more sense (both financially and technically), to buy my own web server so I can just create a MySQL DB or something and do it this way, or would the bucket thing still be the best way to go (cloud storage). Thanks!
