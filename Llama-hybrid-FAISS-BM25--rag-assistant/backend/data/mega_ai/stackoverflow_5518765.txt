Batch Modification of Text File - grab one value, paste another automatically

I have a text file that is being processed as part of a batch script for storage in a Document Management System. It's similar to an XML, but slightly different (some proprietary format). Anyways, My text file looks like this: [BREAKDOC] [Y:PDF] [S:WORM] [C0:20110331] [C1:AC7100P] [C2:ACH FILE EDIT LISTING] [ENDBREAK] C:\COLD\PROC\AC7100P.PDF [BREAKDOC] [Y:PDF] [S:WORM] [C0:20110331] [C1:AT4550P] [C2:ATM AP MAINTENANCE REPORT BY TIME] [ENDBREAK] C:\COLD\PROC\AT4550P.PDF [BREAKDOC] [Y:PDF] [S:WORM] [C0:20110331] [C1:CD1640P] [C2:CD TRIAL BALANCE] [ENDBREAK] C:\COLD\PROC\CD1640P.PDF What I need is a vbscript or similar that can look into the file and wherever it sees the C0 value - which will always be a YYYYMMDD formatted date value, it will add a D value with the same date, only MMDDYYYY formatted. Like this: [BREAKDOC] [Y:PDF] [S:WORM] [D:03312011] [C0:20110331] [C1:AC7100P] [C2:ACH FILE EDIT LISTING] [ENDBREAK] C:\COLD\PROC\AC7100P.PDF [BREAKDOC] [Y:PDF] [S:WORM] [D:03312011] [C0:20110331] [C1:AT4550P] [C2:ATM AP MAINTENANCE REPORT BY TIME] [ENDBREAK] C:\COLD\PROC\AT4550P.PDF [BREAKDOC] [Y:PDF] [S:WORM] [D:03312011] [C0:20110331] [C1:CD1640P] [C2:CD TRIAL BALANCE] [ENDBREAK] C:\COLD\PROC\CD1640P.PDF Is this something that could be done with a simple vbscript?
