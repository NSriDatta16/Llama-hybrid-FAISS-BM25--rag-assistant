4 years late but I just had the same experience now. For logistic regression, the model should be smart enough to disregard useless variables. There is no constraint preventing the coefficients of these variables from being 0. It is important to remember how a logistic regression works. I believe the model optimises squared error not AUC directly. You might want to check if your MSE improved when your AUC deteriorated. In my case my MSE did improve despite my AUC getting worse. I did notice that there is sometimes a very small increase in my MSE with more features. I think it might be one of the model default parameters maybe maximum iterations or a tolerance criteria for convergence. BTW i am using logistic regression from sklearn.
