I do understand the constraint of the question, but why are you trying to avoid having an extra key? Sure, it is redundant information, but depending you your data (number of row, average length of the keys), having additional keys might actually improve your performance on SELECT s and you would be able to use eager-loading of the relationships in SA in the most trivial way. For example, you could do the following: Add another numeric identifier as PK and link the child/parent on this. Add another string identifier to point to the parent object (Key: Varchar, ParentKey: Varchar). In some RDBMS (like MSSQL) you can have a PERSISTENT COMPUTED column, so that your client does not even have to provide the parent key and it will be calculated from the KEY column automatically using the formula (cut the last character). In this case you have have a DB Index on this column and very fast relationship retrievals.
