Does atlas-based imaging segmentation generally involve machine-learning

Segmentation is an important task in medical imaging analysis. Many FDA approved medical device use "atlas-based" segmentation tasks. Newer device use "deep-learning based" segmentation approaches. For example https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K191928.pdf , page 6: I wondered if atlas-based segmentation algorithms generally involve machine-learning or not? I found an older post and an interesting paper , however, both sources do not answer my question. Update: I moved an updated version of this question to stackoverflow to get more attention.
