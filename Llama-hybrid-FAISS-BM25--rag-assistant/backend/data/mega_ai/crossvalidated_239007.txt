R - Confidence intervals for predicted probabilities from fitted()

My work looks at reproductive stages of an organism over two years, using bi-monthly sampling at 6 different locations. Using R, I did a multinomial logistic regression to analyze the data, and built a model using the following dataset (truncated for this example). Packages needed: nnet, ggplot2 SED To visualize the model, I generated predicted probabilities using fitted() and graphed them with ggplot2. SED_1_Fit I want to add 95% confidence intervals to the fitted values graphs, but most examples I have seen generate them using mlogit() or just lm(). What method or function can I use to get confidence intervals for the fitted values generated by fitted()?
