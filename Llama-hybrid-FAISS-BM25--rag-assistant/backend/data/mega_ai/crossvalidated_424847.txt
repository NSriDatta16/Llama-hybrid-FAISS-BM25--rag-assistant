A couple of points: It is not clear why you want to use permutation tests and not the classic $\chi^2$ distribution for the likelihood ratio test. Model glm2 uses glmer() but without including any random effects. Does this really work? You should better compare using anova() model mod1 the logistic regression without random effects (null hypothesis) with model glm1 that includes the random intercepts (alternative hypothesis).
