Stitching together multiple streams in one Stream class

I want to make a class (let's call the class HugeStream) that takes an IEnumerable > in its constructor. This HugeStream should implement the Stream abstract class. Basically, I have 1 to many pieces of UTF8 streams coming from a DB that when put together, make a gigantic XML document. The HugeStream needs to be file-backed so that I can seek back to position 0 of the whole stitched-together-stream at any time. Anyone know how to make a speedy implementation of this? I saw something similar created at this page but it does not seem optimal for handling large numbers of large streams. Efficiency is the key. On a side note, I'm having trouble visualizing Streams and am a little confused now that I need to implement my own Stream. If there's a good tutorial on implementing the Stream class that anyone knows of, please let me know; I haven't found any good articles browsing around. I just see a lot of articles on using already-existing FileStreams and MemoryStreams. I'm a very visual learner and for some reason can't find anything useful to study the concept. Thanks, Matt
