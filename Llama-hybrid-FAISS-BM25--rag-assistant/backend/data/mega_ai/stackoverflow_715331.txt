How much is "a lot of dead data"? With processing power and data storage so cheap, I wouldn't purge old data unless there's a really good reason to. You also need to consider the legal implications. Large (and even small) companies may have incredibly long retention policies for old data, to save themselves millions down the road when they are subpoenaed for it by a judge. I would check with whatever legal department you have and find out how long the data needs to be stored. That's the safest bet. Also, ask yourself what the benefit of removing the old data is. Is the only benefit a tidier database? If so, I wouldn't do it. Are you going to see a 10X performance increase? If so, I'd do it. This really is a complex question though, and it's tough for us to have all the information required to give you good advice.
