There is otherwise the package mtsdi for multivariate time series, it seems to offer an EM algorithm taking into account time auto-correlation and within variables correlation. This package seems promising, although there appear to be a few implementation problems, I ran into one and there is another one reported here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29472532/arima-method-in-mtsdi
