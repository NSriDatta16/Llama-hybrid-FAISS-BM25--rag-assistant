Vim : Moving Through Code

I want to be able to navigate the cursor across functions using Vim. Mainly, I want a command to allow me to go to the next function, like } allows me to go to the next paragraph. I found this: Go to the end of the C++ function in Vim Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work fine in JavaScript. Also, I believe it would also not work for Python, as Python don't depend much on { and }. Any help?
