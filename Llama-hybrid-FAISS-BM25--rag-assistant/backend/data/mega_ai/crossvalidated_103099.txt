In a logistic regression, you model the logit of the outcome, you can model the probability of the DV by exponentiating. So, how have you coded "political preference"? Suppose 1 = Republican and 0 = Democratic. Then $\text{logit}(Pr(D)) = -5.183 + 0.652*M$ and $Pr(D) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{(5.183 - 0.652M)}}$
