Your interaction is not significant. What the modprobe output is showing you are your simple slopes for the effect of rumination on aggression, at different levels of narcissism (-1 SD, average, and +1 SD). It's okay that all of your simple slopes are significant, and that your interaction is not. This is because all of your simple slopes are in the same direction and roughly the same magnitude: B = .49 (-1 SD narcissism), .42, (average narcissism), and .36 (+1 SD narcissism), respectively. For there to be a significant interaction, the association between X & Y (in this case, rumination and aggression) must change depending on the level of the moderating variable, and in this case, it very clearly doesn't.
