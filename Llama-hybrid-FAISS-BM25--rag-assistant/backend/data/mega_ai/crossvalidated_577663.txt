Ordinal Regression: Significant p-values and no colinearity, but very high misclassification error

I cannot show the R code, since it is about a confidential research project. I hope someone can still help me make sense of this. I conducted ordinal logistic regression with a few ordinal, discrete, and binary predictor variables and an ordinal response variable. I checked for collinearity and removed any variables with high pvalues from the formula. When I then use the model for prediction and check its misclassification error, I get values between 40-50% . How can that be? What contributes to this high value?
