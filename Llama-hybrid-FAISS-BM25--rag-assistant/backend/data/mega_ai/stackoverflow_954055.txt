provision file error in iPhone OS 2.2

I created an AppID "MyApp", DeviceID "MyDevice" in Program Portal and I downloaded the provision file and drag it to Organizer, downloaded the .cer file and install it on Mac. All these works fine, but when I build my app, an error pops up saying "CodeSign error: a valid provisioning profile is required for product type 'Application' in SDK 'Device-iPhone OS 2.2'". I tried to find PROVISIONING_PROFILE in project.pbxproj in myApp.xcodeproj, but it returns "Not Found". What might be the problem? Do I need to modifiy the info.plist and what should I modify?
