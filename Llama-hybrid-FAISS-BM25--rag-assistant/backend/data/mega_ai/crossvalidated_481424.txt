Variable selection for logistic regression with Firth's bias reduction method

I'm dealing with a sample of moderate size, and the binary outcome I try to predict suffers from quasi-complete separation. Thus, I apply logistic regression models using Firth's bias reduction method, as implemented for example in the R package brlgm2 or logistf . Both packages are very easy to use. However, brglm2 proposes no method at all for variable selection, and logistf only propose a simple stepwise method. As far as I know, it seems that "advanced" variable selection ( best subset regression , or something like that) does not really exist yet for bias-corrected logistic regression models. Is it possible to perform both Firth's bias-reduction and advanced variable selection for logistic regression? Thanks!
