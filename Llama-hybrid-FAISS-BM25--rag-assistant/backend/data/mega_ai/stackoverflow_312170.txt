Is VARCHAR like totally 1990s?

VARCHAR does not store Unicode characters. NVARCHAR does store Unicode characters. Today's applications should always be Unicode compatible. NVARCHAR takes twice the amount of space to store it. Point 4 doesn't matter because storage space is extremely inexpensive. Ergo: When designing SQL Server databases today, one should always use NVARCHAR. Is this sound reasoning? Does anyone disagree with any of the premises? Are there any reasons to choose VARCHAR over NVARCHAR today?
