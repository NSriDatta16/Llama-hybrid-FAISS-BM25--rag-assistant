It totally depends on the design of your site. If most paragraphs on the site should have margins, but a couple don’t, then the approach in A would require the least code, and would thus probably result in lower CSS weight and more maintainability. But if only paragraphs within your content and sidebar areas require margins (or there aren’t many outside them that do), then the approach in B is a better idea. As for the approach in C, my main worry with that would be how the HTML for the site is generated. If it’s generated by a back-end system, that system will have to know which paragraphs should be spaced, and which shouldn’t. That’s extra complexity for the system, or its users, to deal with. For the specific example of paragraphs, I’ve often ended up with something like B. It’s easy to assume that paragraphs should have some nice, decent styling that would make, say an article nice to read. But if you look at most modern websites, most of what’s on the page isn’t content like that: it’s menus and sidebars and special little things. Now, that may not be great, design-wise, but if you’re implementing a design like that, B is the way to do that with less code, and less code generally means lower weight, easier maintainability, and fewer defects.
