Thank you Matthew Gunn and Glen-b! Your responses led me to a YouTube video by Jalayer Academy titled "Time Series Forecasting with Google Sheets" which, to some extent, is a solution to my problem. It's not a complete solution, however, since it requires me to know what the interval will be, but I guess I can hardcode three-to-five of the most common intervals I've seen and have Excel brute force its way through the calculations, finding which of the five gives me the line of best fit. It's not a perfect solution, but it's a solution and appreciate you guys for leading me there.
