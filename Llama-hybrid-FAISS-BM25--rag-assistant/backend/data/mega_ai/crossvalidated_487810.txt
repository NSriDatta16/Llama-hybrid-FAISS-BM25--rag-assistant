Does $y=f(x)$ implies $X$ Granger-causes $Y$?

Factor in the information from the question "Does causation imply correlation?" , "Mathematical Definition of Causality" , and "How to formally tell is one time series affects another" . Let $y = f(x)$ , where $f$ is continuous and differentiable. Does this guarantee that $x$ will Granger-cause $y$ ? Given that $f$ can be horribly nonlinear, it seems that there are a limited number of tests and methods for conditioning the data in such a way that the granger causality test can be applied effectively. Even something like $y=e^x + \epsilon$ , where $\epsilon$ is white noise, can cause problems with estimating the order of integration (thus testing for cointegration, and then Granger-causality according to the Toda and Yamamoto method as described in Dave Giles' blog post ).
