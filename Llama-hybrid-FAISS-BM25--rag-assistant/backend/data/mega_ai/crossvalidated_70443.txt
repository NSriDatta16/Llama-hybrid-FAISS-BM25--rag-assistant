Blocks and other questions about logistic regression with SPSS

I am trying to use logistic regression in SPSS. I am wondering, do I have to tell SPSS that, for example Gender , is a categorical variable? Also, I am planning to add more explanatory variables in a step-by-step manner to predict a dependent variable, in total I will have 7 models. Do I have to use the blocks option in logistic regression? Or can I just do each module independently one at a time?
