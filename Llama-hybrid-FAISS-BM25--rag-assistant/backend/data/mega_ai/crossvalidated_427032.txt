In addition to the above, Q-Learning is a model-free algorithm,that means that our agent just know the states what the environment gives to it. In other words, if an agent selects and performs an action, next state is determined by the environment only and gives to the agent. For that reason, the agent do not think about the state-transition probabilities.
