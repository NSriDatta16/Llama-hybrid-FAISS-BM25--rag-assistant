Is there a clever way of getting the sortable target in jQueryUI

I'm using jQuery UI to link a number of lists, and allow items to be dragged and dropped between the different lists. In the receive event, I want to get the list that the item is dropped in. Is ui.item.parent() the correct way to do that, or is there a property of ui or event which will let me access this directly? item 1 item 2 $('ul').sortable({ connectWith: 'ul', receive: function(event, ui) { var targetList = ui.item.parent(); } });
