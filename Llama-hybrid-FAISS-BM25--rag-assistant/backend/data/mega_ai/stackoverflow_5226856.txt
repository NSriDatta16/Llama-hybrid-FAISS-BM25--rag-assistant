I suggest that rather than having a whole separate page (which interrupts navigation as you've noticed), just put a grid or usercontrol containing the EULA on the front page that isn't visible. When the user first opens the page, you show the grid/usercontrol, but on subsequent runs, you don't. .... Then in your code behind you can add your test to the loaded event private void MainPageLoaded() { IsolatedStorageFile isoStorage = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); if (!isoStorage.FileExists("DataBase/MyPhoneNumber.txt")) { EULA.Visibility = Visibility.Visible; MainGrid.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed; } } Then when the "I agree" button is clicked you can store the file and show the main grid private void AgreeClick(....) { // Create isolated storage file .... // Hide eula control EULA.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed; MainGrid.Visibility = Visibility.Visible; }
