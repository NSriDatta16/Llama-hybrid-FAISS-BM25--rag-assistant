UIImageView centering issue

To understand my problem let's follow this steps. Open - XCode -> New Project -> View based application. Open View Controller.xib file. Drag an image-view into viewController's view. Place that image view on center of viewController's view. Apply size of 125x125 to image-view. Take any image with dimension of 320 width & 460 height. Drag that image into your application resources directory. Now, Again back to .xib File & select image-view Set image (which is in your resources) to image-view Set Image-view Mode to - Center Ok. Let me explain the situation now. after performing all above steps - image-view has an image which is larger than image-view's size. However, Image-view places that image on center & in View controller image-view is looking proper ( not scaled ). But When you run your application, image-view will be displayed in size of 320x460. ( but it is not actually scaled. ) Now, I can't find the reason, why interface builder is displaying something else & simulator/iphone is displaying something else ? My Query. I want the image's center portion within image-view no matter what image size is.
