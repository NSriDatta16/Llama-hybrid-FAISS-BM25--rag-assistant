Fogbugz Duplicate Cases

I am using FogBugz free hosting to manage my project bugs, I also have several customers I create custom software for, been using FogBugz to keep everything organized. Question I have is, there are times where they send me an email with a bug, so I report it in my system and they create it as well, instead of having 2 cases of same bug, would like to merge or link them together, rather not just delete the duplicate. Is there a way to link them together, maybe like a cross reference or even merge them together?
