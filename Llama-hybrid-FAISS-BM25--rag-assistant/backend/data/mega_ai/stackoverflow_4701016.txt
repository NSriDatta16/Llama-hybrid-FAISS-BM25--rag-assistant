I have built a state wide Silverlight 4.0 application that runs in browser and out of browser. In my experience it runs very well on a Mac, however I would say that it's not exactly the same. It's very close, but there are small differences in the install experience, and I've received some errors in Isolated Storage that I don't get on a Windows machine. Overall I would definitely say Silverlight is the best cross platform development platform that I've ever used.
