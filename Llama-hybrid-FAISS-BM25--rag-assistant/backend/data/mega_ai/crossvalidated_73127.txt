One trick that often helps for logistic regression type problems is to realize that: $1 - h(x^{(i)}) = h(-x^{(i)})$ and that $h(-x^{(i)})$ is more numerically stable than $1 - h(x^{(i)})$. You can find a discussion of that here . This is an article in the Stata Journal so the examples are in Stata/Mata, but the problem has to do with the way computers store numbers and is thus more general. For example, I have been able to reproduce the first anomalous example exactly in R, i.e. not just the general pattern but the exact values.
