You'll have to do some feature engineering on your data. Beneficiary and Customer ID has no meaning for machine learning, so you first have to join all other data, taking care of date types (split hour, day of week, month) and should be ordereed by the ones you will not use for training (beneficiary, customerID). than you can create new features like for each transaction the time spent since the last one for each customer, count of transcactions by day/day of wee/month, min, max, median amout spent and son on. It'll be a binary classification (SVM, random forest, logistic regression, etc.).
