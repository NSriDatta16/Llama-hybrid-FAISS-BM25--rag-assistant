Actual, complete technical training program for our newest developer: Address and credentials for source code control system. Address and credentials for bug tracking system. Address and credentials for retrieving development tools. Lunch with development team. Deadline. In fairness, she's extremely bright, talented, outgoing, and experienced. I wouldn't recommend this method for the average trainee ... but this is definitely the sort of person I want on my team!
