c# and XML Deserialization : what about substitutiongroups used for handling globalization

I have the following schema: This allows me to successfully validate the following XML Fragments: In English and In French I'm afraid that the c# class generated by xsd and the corresponding XMLSerializer would work only with the first XML fragment. In my opinion, I have 2 options: Use XSLT to process the XML file before deserialization in order to promote element name to english ones. Write custom deserialization code. What do you think ? Samples would be much appreciated. TIA.
