wtpwebapps/myapp is empty when running Tomcat under Eclipse

I know that tomcat is running because when I type http://localhost , the tomcat page dispay. My problem is I can't figure out why the wtpwebapps/myapp is empty, is like the eclipse doesn't publish it and when i type http://localhost/myapp , I get 404 error. In the server overview : Server Location is set to "Use Tomcat installation" | server path: the servers's folder | deploy path : wtpwebapps Server Option : Publish module contexts to separate XML file Publishing : Automatically publish when ressource change I use eclipse Ganymede 3.4.2, tomcat 6.0, under Win7 Any help would be appreciated, thanks
