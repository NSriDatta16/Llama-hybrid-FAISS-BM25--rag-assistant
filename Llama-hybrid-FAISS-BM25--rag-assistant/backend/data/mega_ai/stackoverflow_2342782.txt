Visual Studio 2008 SP1 - Design View of page only shows the Master Page

I'm creating a app that uses a Master Page. But when i go to Design View of the page (for creating the events automatically or for drag/drop any new control from toolbox, I don't want to type everything) the design view only shows the master page! the page controls are complete ignored! the image: http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/7980/masterissue.jpg Does anybody know how to solve this issue??
