Logistic Regression with Moderation and Control Variable

I perform a Logistic Regression in R which looks the folllowing: logit I am mainly interested in the effect of Condition on result while controlling for Strength . So far the effect is significant. Furthermore I want to include another variable called Focus which I expect to be a Moderator for the effect of Condition on result . Can anyone tell me how to do this, while still controlling for Strength, as without this controlling variable the effect completely disappears?
