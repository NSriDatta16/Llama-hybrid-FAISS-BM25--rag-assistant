How should I transform a featureset (15000 variables) that is mostly presence/absence, but present values are lognormal distributed?

I am trying to learn machine learning and have a nice featureset with a binary classification. The dataset is 15000 variables and 2500 data rows. For every data row, almost all variables are 0, and roughly 20 are non-zero. The values of these 20 are lognormal distributed over the whole variable set (i.e. the 50000 non-zero values in the 15000*2500 matrix are lognormal distributed). The question is, what should I do with the featureset? The blunt way would be to transform it into purely presence/absence. However I wonder whether there is any information in the relative intensities within the values. I have considered "doubling" the dataset (copying the 15000 variables into 15000 presence/absence + 15000 logarithmized/NA variables). (For the record, even without any transformation, KNN and Random Forest models can predict halfway decently.)
