Statistical conclusions from incompatible measurement results

I assume that the following situation is not uncommon in scientific practice: Two research groups analyse two samples. The reported results concern the same physical quantity at the same location and at the same time. The analysis methodologies are different. The reported results are calculated differently from the raw data that were measured. But : The reported results are incompatible, i.e. the sum of their bell curves has two peaks, i.e. is bi-modal. As a specific example one may consider the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration at the south pole directly measured from atmosphere and measured by an ice core. These are for example the time series from atmospheric measurements at the south pole compared to ice core measurements at Law Dome : When the two samples are not identical (as in the example: one sample was gaseous, the other sample was solid) the first guess to explain the discrepancy is by the difference of the samples (1). To exclude this (for the sake of my argument/question) let me assume that the samples are identical. Discrepancies may occur nevertheless. The next guess then to explain the discrepancy is by the difference of measurement methodologies (3) and/or calculations (4). Let me assume that both seem sound for both research groups, so both measurements may have the same a priori credibility. For the sake of simplicity let me assume that both standard deviations are the same. Now I am at the heart of my question: Which conclusions can be drawn from the two incompatible results (bell curves)? How wrong must at least one of the results be (with respect to mean and standard deviation)? What can be assumed to be the "true" mean and the "true" standard deviation? Remember that two measurements (reported values) are supposed to be "incompatible" when the sum of their bell curves has two peaks, i.e. is bi-modal. I further suppose that a measurement (a reported value) is "wrong" when the true value falls outside the two standard deviation interval of the reported mean.
