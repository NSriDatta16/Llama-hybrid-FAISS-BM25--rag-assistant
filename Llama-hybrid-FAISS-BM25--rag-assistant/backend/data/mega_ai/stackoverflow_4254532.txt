Ordered Parallel code runs slower than single threading. Is there a solution?

#pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(x) private (y, z, f) ordered for (i = 0; i The above code runs slower than non SMP execution by about 20% on a dual core. Without the "#pragma omp ordered" it is about 50% faster than non SMP. The x[f++] sequence is assumed it has to remain in an ordered form since it's similarly reused later. Can ordered code be faster than single threading? Is there another method to achieve it? System is win32/mingw-w64.
