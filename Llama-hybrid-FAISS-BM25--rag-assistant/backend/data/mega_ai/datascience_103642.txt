One way to frame the problem is multi-class classification. Given a collection of features, predict one of four mutually exclusive outcomes. As far as modeling goes, it makes sense to simplify the modeling process to ignore time. This is similar to the bag-of-words assumption in natural language processing (NLP) which ignores word order. You can build a model the predicts one of four outcomes based on the current state of the machine. Later, you can try a more complex modeling process like time series or survival analysis.
