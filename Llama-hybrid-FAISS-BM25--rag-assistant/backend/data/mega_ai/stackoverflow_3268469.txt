I do not know a way to predraw a UIView. A view is only drawn, if it's on the screen. What you could do is to try to draw the contents of the cell to a CGBitmapContext, create a UIImage of that context, and in your actual cell only use an imageview which shows the image. In this case you would of cause need an external storage for the images. Could be array or dictionary.
