What does the activation of a neuron mean?

In a neural network, each neuron will have it's activation. But what the activation mean? Does it just mean nothing but a temporal value to produce the final result or it's has something to with our understanding to the problem? For example, considering a neural network to recognize a handwritten character from a picture, I wonder if it's possible that a neuron's activation represents the how the pixel matches the specific value in a small part of the picture?
