The Delphi IDE and (to a lesser extent) compiler are quite fragile. Many non-expected constructs will cause strange problems. So it's not easy to guess off-hand what's the trouble in your case. (The way you describe your unit, I suspect the IFDEF's may play a role though.) Can't you comment-out parts on the code until the problem disappears, to see whay may causes it ? If your unit is A B C D , try with (* A B *) C D and if that causes no error, try A B (* C D *) then perhaps (* A *) B (* C D *) etc. until only a small unreducible part of your unit remains. Since you're testing the IDE not the compiler, you probably don't need your commented-out unit to compile without error.
