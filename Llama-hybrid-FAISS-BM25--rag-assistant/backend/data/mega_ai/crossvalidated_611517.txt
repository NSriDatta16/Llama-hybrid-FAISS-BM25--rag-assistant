Normalization of time series data for classification

Explaining my dataset: I have a univariate timeseries dataset of energy consumption. Each row of the dataset are half-hourly records of the energy consumption of a consumer. So every 48 lines contain 1 full day of measurements of a single consumer. So, for example, the first 48 rows (rows 1 to 48 ) of the dataset contains measurements of Day 1 of Consumer 1 . The next 48 rows (rows 49 to 96 ) contains the measurements of Day 2 of Consumer 1 , the following 48 (rows 97 to 144 ) contains measurements of Day 3 of Consumer 1 and so on... after 534 days the measurements of Consumer 1 ends, and the measurements of Consumer 2 starts at Day 1 . The dataset contains around 6000 consumers, and following what has been stated before, it has 6000*48*534 ~= 154 millions of rows. I need to frame this timeseries as multiclass classification problem. Each sample/row of the supervised dataset will contain 48 columns (1 day of data of a single consumer, hence a consumer will appear more than once in the supervised dataset). Question: When should i normalize (let's say using MinMax Scaler from Sklearn) my data? Before framing it as supervised learning problem? Or after? And why? Any additional information or a link to a paper so i can back this up would be great!
