You need to create a generative model to do this. Conditional GAN will allow you to do that. You supply the sample to condition the output in that way. But, you will need paired data for that. So, given you have a text file, you have to generate handwritten samples for them (use this ). Finally, you have your paired data for cGAN and the sample you want to condition the generation on. All the best.
