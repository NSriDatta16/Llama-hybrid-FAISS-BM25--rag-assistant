Auto arima capital D

I've got time series 3 years long, there is seasonal uplift during December - but it's not so clear. Seasonal test fails. I train model twice without setting any parameter: auto.arima(tsData, trace = TRUE) ARIMA(2,1,2)(0,0,1)[52] : 2294.794 Best model: ARIMA(2,1,2)(0,0,1)[52] and with capital D set to one: auto.arima(tsData, D=1, trace = TRUE) ARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,0)[52] : 1710.966 Best model: ARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,0)[52] Model has much lower AIC, and it generally looks better - it reflects seasonal drop. What is explanation behind this results? Why doesn't auto.arima find this model? Is there any technique to use this effect besides always training two models and picking the one with smaller AIC?
