This really depends on what tools you use, and how you like to organize it. For example, I have seen people that use Eclipse but put every project in a single workspace, or use one single workspace for each project. The actual storage of projects can also vary. So, I don't think there is an accepted practice. I think you will need to figure out what works the best for you.
