Max S. is correct, the answers to your question are also given in the quote if the system has a few interactions with users , then the system can easily compute an embedding $v_{i_0}$ for this item without having to retrain the whole model [...] same can be done for a new user Adding to this, not only you can easier update the model, by finding the embeddings only for the new item, rather then the full model, but you can also initialize the embeddings in more clever way then zeros, or random values. Instead, you could start with a "prior" guess for the embeddings, e.g. when you are recommending movies and new sequel of Star Wars enters movie theatres, you can make an educated guess that the embeddings for this movie would be similar to other parts of Star Wars, so you could start at something like embedding for previous part, or average of the embeddings, etc. and then re-train when you have the data. It the movie is not a sequel, you can still do something similar, e.g. initialize the embeddings with something like "average embedding for romantic comedies" and use it as an educated guess before you gather the data. You can also check another question, asked by me, and answered by Max S. , on cold start in matrix factorization .
