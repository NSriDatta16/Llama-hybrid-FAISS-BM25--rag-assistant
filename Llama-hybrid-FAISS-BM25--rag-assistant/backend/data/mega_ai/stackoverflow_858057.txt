UNIONs implement some sort of polymorphism in a non-OOP world. Usually, you have a part which is common and depending on that part, you use the rest of the UNIONs. Therefore, in such cases where you do not have an OOP language and you want to avoid excessive pointer arithmetic, unions can be more elegant in some cases.
