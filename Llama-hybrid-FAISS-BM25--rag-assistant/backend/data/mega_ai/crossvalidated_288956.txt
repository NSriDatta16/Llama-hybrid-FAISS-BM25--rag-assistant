How to analyse categorical data (0/1) with structural zeros?

I have a categorical dependent variable (emerged/not emerged) and two predictors 1) treatment (continuous time, 28 to 35h) and 2) group (test/control). I want to know if test group emerges earlier than control group. I have a n=20 in each group+treatment, but I get structural zeros as control group never emerges before 32h (see data below). Thus I apparently cant use a simple logistic regression directly to compare my two groups. Here is the data, values are %emergence (calculated) : Treatment(h)___28___29___30___31___32___33___34___35 Control________0____0____0____0___59___70___100__100 Test__________50___70___90__100__100__100___100__100 Anybody can suggest a method to make this work? Note that I'm prety green in stats, I would appreciate a few details with the suggestions! :)
