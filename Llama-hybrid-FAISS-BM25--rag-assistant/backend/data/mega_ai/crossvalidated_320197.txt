You have created a basic nearest neighbor model and a predict() mechanism to find the closest "fit" to your model. I'd call that a simple machine learning algorithm. You might break out the code doing the modeling and prediction into a separate small method - both to make it more clear to yourself and to readers and also to allow to "override" the methods to use say a quadratic fit instead of a linear one. Snippet of your fit() : while(i Snippet of your predict() : for(int k=0; k
