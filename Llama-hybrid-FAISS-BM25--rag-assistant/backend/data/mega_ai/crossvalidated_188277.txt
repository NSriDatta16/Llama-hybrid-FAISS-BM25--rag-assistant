Activation Function for First Layer Nodes in an ANN

In an artificial neural network, neurons take inputs from their previous layer, transform this signal using an activation function (in my case, the sigmoid function), and send this transformed signal along weights to the neurons in the next layer. Do first layer neurons use an activation function to process the raw data they are fed, or do they send the raw signal along weights to the next layer without any activation function?
