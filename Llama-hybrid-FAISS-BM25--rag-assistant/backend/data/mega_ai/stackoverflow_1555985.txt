if you double-click just after the opening { of a function, you will select the all function body. You can then: Alt + Up : to move the function up one line Alt + Down : to move the function down one line Of course, that is the shortcut you describe in your question, and moving a function by just one line can result in an incorrect code (as the function can end up within another one). You have to repeat the shortcut the appropriate number of time to actually move the function before or after another one. So the answer is: No, not exactly like IDEA, but close enough. Actually, if the outline view is not sorted alphabetically, you can drag and drop a function in order to reorder them. But that is not a shortcut.
