Going from real to nominal will cause you to lose out on a lot of the legitimacy of your (probably intended) theory, because many of the changes in nominal gdp are not production-related, they are inflation-related. Note that GDP and other macro variables are likely cointegrated. This is going to represent a problem if you are trying to publish or draw seriously meaningful results. However, for .... messing around or student work, I encourage you both continue what you are doing and investigate the obstacles that you are ignoring away for now. Good luck! http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointegration
