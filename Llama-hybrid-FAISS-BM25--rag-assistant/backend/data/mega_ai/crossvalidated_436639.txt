Answer: There is a mistake in the formula for $\theta$ . The correct computation must align autocovariances of the MA components of two representations. The correct formula is $$ \theta = \frac{\sqrt{\xi^2-4} -\xi}{2}$$ where $\xi:= \phi + \frac{\sigma^2_v+\sigma^2_w}{\phi \sigma^2_v}$ . Substituting the chosen values for $\phi,\sigma_v,\sigma_w$ gives $\theta = -0.6004940561846299$ . Details: There is a mistake in the lecture notes you are referencing. Both these lecture notes and this post refer to An Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting , by Brockwell and Davis, where this subject is treated correctly. In fact, to obtain the new ARMA representation you have to choose MA weights and the variance of a white noise process entering this MA so that the autocovariances of the new process are the same as the autocovariances of $\eta_t = v_t+w_t- \phi v_{t-1}$ . We have \begin{equation} Cov(\eta_t,\eta_t) = (1+\phi^2)\sigma_v^2 + \sigma_w^2, \quad Cov(\eta_t,\eta_{t-1}) = -\phi \sigma_v^2, \quad Cov(\eta_t,\eta_{t-s}) = 0 \quad \forall s \geq 2. \end{equation} This means that we are seeking to construct an MA(1) process, and therefore we need to select parameters $\theta, \sigma^2$ so that for $\epsilon_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ the combination $\nu_t = \epsilon_t + \theta \epsilon_{t-1}$ had the same autocovariances, i.e. we have to solve the following system: \begin{equation} \begin{cases} Cov(\nu_t,\nu_t) &= Cov(\eta_t,\eta_t) \\ Cov(\nu_t,\nu_{t-1})&= Cov(\eta_t,\eta_{t-1}) \end{cases} \iff \begin{cases} (1+\theta^2)\sigma^2 &= (1+\phi^2)\sigma_v^2 + \sigma_w^2\\ \theta \sigma^2 &= -\phi \sigma_v^2 \end{cases} \end{equation} Dividing the first equation by the second and multiplying both sides by $\theta$ we get the following quadratic equation in $\theta$ : $$ 1 + \theta^2 = -\xi \theta,$$ where $\xi:= \phi + \frac{\sigma^2_v+\sigma^2_w}{\phi \sigma^2_v}$ . This equation has two real solutions $$ \theta = \frac{-\xi \pm \sqrt{\xi^2-4}}{2}$$ Of which only one produces an invertible MA (as $|\xi|>2$ one of the solutions has modulus bigger than 1). Substituting the calibration you chose into the obtained formula gives a result consistent with the simulations: $$ \xi = 2.265789473684211, \theta = -0.6004940561846299 $$
