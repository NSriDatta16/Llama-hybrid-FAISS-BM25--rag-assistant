What is the relationship between VAE and EM algorithm?

I know that the EM algorithm is used in latent variable models, specifically to do maximum likelihood estimation iteratively. Similarly, the VAE can be used for latent variable models and, although they are usually used for generative modeling or posterior inference, they can also be used for parameter inference. So I was wondering what's the relationship between them and when it's better to use one or the other.
