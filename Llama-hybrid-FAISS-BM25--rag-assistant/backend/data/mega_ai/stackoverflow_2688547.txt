Multiple foreground colors in PowerShell in one command

I want to output many different foreground colors with one statement. PS C:\> Write-Host "Red" -ForegroundColor Red Red This output is red. PS C:\> Write-Host "Blue" -ForegroundColor Blue Blue This output is blue. PS C:\> Write-Host "Red", "Blue" -ForegroundColor Red, Blue Red Blue This output is magenta, but I want the color to be red for the word red, and blue for the word blue via the one command. How can I do that?
