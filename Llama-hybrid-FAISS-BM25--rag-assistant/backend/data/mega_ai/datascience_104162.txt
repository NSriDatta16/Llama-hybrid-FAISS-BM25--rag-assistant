In general the choice between a single model and multiple independent models depends on the expected level of dependency between the variables. In your example, if two different machine ids implies two completely distinct machines with different characteristics, and therefore completely different relation between the recipe id and the duration, then it makes more sense to train a distinct model for each machine. On the other hand if a lot of information is common between different machines and recipes, for example if the time for recipe R on machine M can be deduced from the time of recipe R on some other machines, then a single model could leverage this kind of correlation. An important factor to decide is the number of instances: the case of multiple independent models requires that you have a sample large enough (and representative enough) for every model. In case there are enough instances for every model, it's likely that the independent models would provide more accurate predictions since the model wouldn't conflate all the data. At the end of the day, the only sure way to know which one is the best option is to run the experiments.
