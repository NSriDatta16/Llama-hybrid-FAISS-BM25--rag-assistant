Estimating two-parameter covariance matrix, with average variance and average covariance?

Which methods can I use if I want to estimate a highly-structured two-parameters covariance matrix, when I have few observations $N$ for many variables K? Motivation: given a dataset of K=3000 variables observed N=20 times, I am interested in obtaining the average variance, and average covariance of the data. In other words, I am ready to assume that my variance-covariance matrix has just two parameters. These parameters will be used for decomposing the variance of the mean into $var(\bar{x})=\frac {\sigma^2} {n} + \frac {n-1} {n} \rho \sigma^2$ , or eventually to serve as target matrix when doing covariance shrinkage. How can I estimate these parameters? Ideally, they should ensure that the covariance matrix is semi -positive definite, and that the variance of the sample mean decomposition holds? I can think of: Simple average variances and covariances. I am sure that refined estimators have been proposed? Use some covariance shrinkage methods, eventually averaging later on the parameters? This seems a little paradoxical though as such methods usually first use an estimator of average (co)variance towards which they shrink!?
