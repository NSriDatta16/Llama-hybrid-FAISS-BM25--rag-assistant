Using web2py on Eclipse

I am trying to use the steps I found on the net to make web2py work on Eclipse, but I must have something setup wrong because Eclipse gives me error on the imports. For instance the instructions say to do this at the top of controllers: if 0: from gluon.globals import * from gluon.html import * from gluon.http import * from gluon.tools import * from gluon.sql import * from gluon.validators import * from gluon.languages import translator as T from gluon.sqlhtml import SQLFORM, SQLTABLE, form_factory session = Session() request = Request() response = Response() crud = Crud() db = DAL(‘sqlite://storage.sqlite’) auth=Auth(globals(),None) Eclipse says T is an unresolved import. If I change it to translator (instead of translator as T) it says translator is in unresolved import. Also it says SQLFORM, SQLTable, form_factory, Session(), Request(), Response etc, are unresolved imports? Any ideas what I am doing wrong before I switch to Django.
