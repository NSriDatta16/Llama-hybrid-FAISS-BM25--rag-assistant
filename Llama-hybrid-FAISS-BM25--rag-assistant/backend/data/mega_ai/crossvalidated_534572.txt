For prediction problems, why cant we simply use softmax as activation for hidden layers and no activation function for output layer

I am a beginner who is learning how to use neural networks for prediction problems, and almost all tutorials I have found use relu for hidden layer and sigmoid function for output later. My question is, if we simply use softmax for hidden layer and no activation function for output layer, can we get the same result? My inspiration for this is a neural network tutorial by statquest that can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqOfi41LfDw&t=1s . Please keep it simple. I am neither a statistician nor a data scientist
