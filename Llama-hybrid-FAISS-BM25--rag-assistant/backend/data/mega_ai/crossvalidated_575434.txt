You can write your own Bayesian model with extreme flexibility, which you could probably do in quite a few frameworks such as Stan (e.g. via RStan or CmdStanR in R or pystan in Python or the various other interfaces including for Stata and Matlab). If you don't want to (and I think in this case you don't really need to) write your own Stan model code, then using a higher level package such as the brms R package is a good option. One cool feature is that you could get the Stan code it creates and then use that in other software (e.g. Stata or Matlab, if those are your favorites since you mention them). It offers categorical(link = "logit", refcat = NULL) and multinomial(link = "logit", refcat = NULL) as distribution families, but I believe your intended model is different in that you want to give the model information on all the choices including the non-chosen ones, right? I believe there's some discussion on how to do this here and especially here (but the particular solution at the moment is not a default family , yet, but can be used as described in that blogpost).
