Time series clustering

I have many time series in this format 1 column in which I have date (d/m/yr) format and many columns that represent different time series like here: DATE TS1 TS2 TS3 ... 24/03/2003 0.00 0.00 ... 17/04/2003 -0.05 1.46 11/05/2003 0.46 -3.86 04/06/2003 -2.21 -1.08 28/06/2003 -1.18 -2.16 22/07/2003 0.00 0.23 With R, how I can group the time series that show similar trends?
