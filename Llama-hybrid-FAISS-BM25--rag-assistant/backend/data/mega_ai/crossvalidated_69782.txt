Correct. You should handle the new input in the same way, so you need to remember the means and stds and apply the same normalization procedure. To put it differently, PCA does a basis transformation, you have to make sure that you start from the same basis so if you scaled/translated/transformed it in some way, you should apply that same scaling/translation/transformation before applying PCA again.
