Update: I found a much more elegant solution: class MyCompositeObject { DateTime CreatedDate; string SomeAttribute; Object Obj1; { class MyCompositeObjects : List { } I found that due to reflection, the specific type stored in Obj1 is resolved at runtime and the type specific DataTemplate is applied as expected!
