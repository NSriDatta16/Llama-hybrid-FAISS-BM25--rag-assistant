Identify source of linq to sql query

We are starting to have numerous linq to sql queries in our code. We have started to pay more attention to performance and are starting to see queries that we think are coming from linq. They have the t1, t2...tN values, so we are sure they are linq generated. However, we are having difficulty determining the location in code that is the source of the query. Obviously we have a general idea based on the tables and columns requested. Is there a way to "tag" or "name" a query so that is shows up in a trace to more easily identify the query?
