A basic idea of machine learning is that you learn to generalize from one dataset to another . Thus, if you get a good cross-validation results on one dataset, you should be able to use the model again and again on new datasets. That said, I would try to re-learn the model when new data arrives, automating the cross-validation process. Then, see if the model accuracy (on validation data) is increasing when adding new data. This will give you an answer: whether you need to re-learn the model when data accumulate or not.
