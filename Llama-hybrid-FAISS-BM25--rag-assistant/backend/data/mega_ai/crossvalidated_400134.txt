If you know the weights, and the weights are constant, then as you said I don't know that any analysis that attributes % change in index to one of its components will be useful. (are the weights constant, or will they vary with the values of the components?) Therefore I'd recommend that you do some standard exploratory data analysis on each time series. There are many resources you can find if you search for this. I'll give a few specific ideas here based on what you said: For volatility, calculate the coefficient of variation (Std Dev / Mean) If # of components is not too high (less than 100) plot and visually examine each one Perform decomposition to detect which ones have trends and/or seasonality
