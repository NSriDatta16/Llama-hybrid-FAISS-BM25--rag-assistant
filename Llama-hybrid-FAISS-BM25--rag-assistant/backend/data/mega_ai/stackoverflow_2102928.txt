storing is just that saving the data to the disk (or whatever) so that the database can retrieve it later on demand. indexing means creating some separate data structure to optimize the location and retrieval of that data in a faster way than simply reading the entire database (or the entire table) and looking at each and everyt record until the database searching algorithm finds what you asked it for... Generally databases use what is called a Balanced-Tree indices, which is an extension of the concept of a Binary-Tree. Look up Binary Tree on google/wikipedia to get a more indepth understanding of how this works...
