Are you looking for finding some algorithm that calculates the difference based on array sorted with A and array sorted with B as inputs? Or are you looking for a generic method of determining on average how off an array would be when sorted with B? If the first, then I suggest something as simple as the distance each item is from where it should be (an average would do better than a sum to remove length of array as an issue) If the second, then I think I'd need to see more about these algorithms.
