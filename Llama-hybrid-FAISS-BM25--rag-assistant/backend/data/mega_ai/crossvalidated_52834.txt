Using a Markov Chain to find the limiting probability?

Let's say a website makes available only one of three online quizzes A, B and C, daily. If the majority of visitors pass the quiz then the next day the website will randomly publish either quiz A, B, or C with equal probability $\frac{1}{3}$. If the majority of visitors fail the quiz then the next day the website will publish only quiz A (with probability one). The probability of passing a quiz is: $P(A) = \frac{3}{10}$, $P(B) = \frac{6}{10}$, $P(C) = \frac{9}{10}$ QUESTION: suppose that the testing procedure has been running for a large number of days without interruption. Let $\xi_A$ be the proportions of the total number of days in which quiz A was used. (This can be thought of as being the "limiting probability" that quiz A is used). HINT: Use the stationary distribution (G, B) = ($\frac{3}{7}$, $\frac{4}{7}$) and use this stationary distribution to work out $\xi_A$ (apply appropriate conditioning and limiting operations). My thoughts thus far: The bit where it says "limiting operations" is confusing me slightly on what it means? Is the following approach correct? I feel it is but I'm new to stochastic modelling.. I can model this as a Markov Chain with transition matrix (where rows sum to one): $\left[\begin{array}{ccc} 0.6 & 0.4 \\ 0.3 & 0.7 \\ \end{array}\right]$ i.e. A good day (G) follow by another G day = $(\frac{1}{3})(\frac{3}{10})+(\frac{1}{3})(\frac{6}{10})+(\frac{1}{3})(\frac{9}{10}) = \frac{6}{10}$ and a bad day (B) followed by a G day = $(\frac{1}{1})(\frac{3}{10})+ 0 + 0 = \frac{3}{10}$. Step 1: I worked out that the stationary distribution is $P(G)=\frac{3}{7}$ and $P(B)=\frac{4}{7}$. Step 2: using a bit of conditional probability, then the probability of quiz $A$ being used on day $n$ is: P(quiz A on day n) = P(quiz A and day n-1 is G) + P(quiz A and day n-1 is B) $= P(A|G)*P(G) + P(A|B)*P(B)$ $= (\frac{1}{3})(\frac{3}{7}) + (\frac{1}{1})(\frac{4}{7})$ $= \frac{5}{7}$ Step 3: Apply limiting operations? What does that mean?
