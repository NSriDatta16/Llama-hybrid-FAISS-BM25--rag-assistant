Your description is somewhat different from your initial question so it's a little confusing. I'll try my best to answer and give you a few tips ... As a project manager or leader , you should be trying to get the best out of everyone in your team. Each one of them will be good at something so try to find out what that is, and put them to work at that. When you do assign work, you should also assign some freedom and accountability / responsibility . They're the expert in that area so let them deal with it as best as they know how. Offer support, encouragement and guidance wherever you can, but listen to what they have to say. If you have some team members that are less skilled but willing to learn (or contribute), pair them up with someone else. Have them work together on a component allowing the more experienced person to 'mentor' the less experienced one. If there's a way you can make this part of the 'success criteria' for your project, then that's even better as it gives them some incentive to work well together. Then there's all the technical project management tasks . These are things like specs, gannt charts, schedules, reviews, etc. These are important but in my opinion are less important than the people management aspects. Have your team provide you with the data for these documents. For example, ask the developer of component A how long it will take to develop and test rather than trying to figure it out yourself. Hope this is some help and gives you some food for thought. Sorry I can't help with the more technical/architectural aspects of your assignment.
