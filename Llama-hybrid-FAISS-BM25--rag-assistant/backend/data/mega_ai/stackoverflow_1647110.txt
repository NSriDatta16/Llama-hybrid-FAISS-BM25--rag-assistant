OK, I figured it out. I just stored my answer in a SESSION variable so that I could call it in my other PHP files. Now I have one file processing the request, creating the session and the variable, and then redirecting the page. Then I have a PHP included in the page that grabs the SESSION variable and plugs it into my mysql_query to return the proper result! Not sure if this is the best way of doing it, but it's working.... If anyone knows of a more elegant solution I would love to know it. Thanks, Chris
