Configuring log4net to Use Isolated Storage in WPF App

I'd like to use log4net's RollingAppender to write to isolated storage, but I can't figure out how to configure log4net to do so. To be clear, I'm trying to do this in an installed WPF application so I don't have some of the issues that some of the Silverlight users have already posted. I thought my best chance was to dynamically set the file path as described in this answer, Best way to dynamically set an appender file path , but of course you don't have access to the isolated storage's file path. Can anyone confirm whether it's possible to setup a log4net RollingAppender to use the isolated storage, and if so how?
