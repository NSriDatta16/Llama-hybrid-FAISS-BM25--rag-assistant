I am developing a product that may be perfect for you. It's called "Transactor Code Agent". It's designed to automatically maintain local source code history. You point it at the folders where you keep your code, and it automatically makes a backup every time you change a file. You can diff versions, rollback changes, and can even create named "snapshots" (fixed bug 1234, implemented feature y, etc.) to make it easier to restore back to specific points in time. Because it's automatic, you don't have to worry about manually committing your local changes. Everything just works. I put some detailed information about it in this post: Simplest source control ever - what do you use? It should be releasing sometime in Feb. I'm looking for beta testers. The beta should be opening up sometime in January. If you are interested let me know.
