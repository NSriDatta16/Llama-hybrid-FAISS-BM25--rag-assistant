No simple way for this, except if you make sure you NEVER send credentials that way (there are many ways to send tokens instead of the actual credential). If you're passing these information only to log on to your service, you should use SSL anyway. If that's the case, your MessageInspector could check if the current binding uses SSL or transport security and if that's the case, does not log anything. As an aside, if you want to log messages in development, you'd be better off leveraging the WCF tracing infrastructure instead of doing the low level tracing yourself (that way you don't have to add inspectors in debug mode). See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms732023.aspx for more info about built-in WCF activity and message tracing.
