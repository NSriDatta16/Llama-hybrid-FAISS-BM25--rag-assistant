Code Coverage and Unit Testing of Python Code

I have already visited Preferred Python unit-testing framework . I am not just looking at Python Unit Testing Framework, but also code coverage with respect to unit tests. So far I have only come across coverage.py . Is there any better option? An interesting option for me is to integrate cpython , unit testing of Python code and code coverage of Python code with Visual Studio 2008 through plugins (something similar to IronPython Studio ). What can be done to achieve this? I look forward to suggestions.
