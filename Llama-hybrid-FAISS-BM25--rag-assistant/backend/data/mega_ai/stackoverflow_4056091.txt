Yeah, you're looking for the sc_logic and sc_lv types which are 4 state variables: 0, 1, X, and Z. Pay attention to how they interact when you resolve them together. There's a nice tables on the asic-world.com site taken directly from the SystemC User Manual. Note though that this doesn't work like in Verilog where X can also act as a wildcard. I had to build my own function to add that functionality.
