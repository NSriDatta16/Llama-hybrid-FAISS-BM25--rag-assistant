Formal justification of Bayesian inference as a model for belief

I remember a proof that Bayesian probability theory is the only valid method for representing beliefs, it went something like we represent belief by some non-negative function over some domain of outcomes beliefs are sub-additive ... Therefore, Bayesian probability theory is the only valid approach for representing beliefs. The idea is that under very basic, and general, assumptions for what constitutes a "belief function", you end up modeling "belief" with Bayesian probabilities. I've forgotten where I've seen it. Does anyone know this proof? or a reference to the original? Edit So far the best lead I've found is that it is presented in: Savage, L. J. (1954). The Foundation of Statistics, 2nd edn, Dover, New York. (which I don't have a copy of)
