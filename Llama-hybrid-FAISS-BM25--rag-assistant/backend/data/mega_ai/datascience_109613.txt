In my opinion OPENING_DATE - Now() is the right variable as it gives you idea about outcomes of case. A case open for long time may not give positive results. I think you need to think from production persepective rather than feature engineering. If you score a case only once you will face the problem what we discussed. But if you score your case every day or everyweek and calculate this variable evry time you can create a whole system which monitors tickets and highlights ticktes which may lead to unhappy customers. SO the solution may lie in how you score tickets in production rather that feature engineering in this case
