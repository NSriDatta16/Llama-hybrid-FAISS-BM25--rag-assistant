Can I use Silverlight 2.0 with ASP.NET 2.0?

I am working on an in-house tool for interfacing to a database. My current prototyping is written in C# using ASP.NET 2.0 with the intent to optimise some client-side operations using javascript. However, I was hoping to leverage Silverlight to simplify the user interface development. Do I need to have the server upgraded to ASP.NET 3.5 for this or can I create the necessary web services in ASP.NET 2.0 for integrating with the client-side Silverlight controls?
