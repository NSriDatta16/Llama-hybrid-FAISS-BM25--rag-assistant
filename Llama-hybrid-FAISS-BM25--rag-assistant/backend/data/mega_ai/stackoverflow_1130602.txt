AFAIK it's not possible in any supported way (there's no mention of it in Apple's documentation, Dashboard doesn't have AppleScript dictionary). However, since Widgets can have access to the filesystem and execute commands, it is possible to hack it: modify com.apple.dashboard.plist and restart Dashboard with killall Dock (obviously that's not elegant solution).
