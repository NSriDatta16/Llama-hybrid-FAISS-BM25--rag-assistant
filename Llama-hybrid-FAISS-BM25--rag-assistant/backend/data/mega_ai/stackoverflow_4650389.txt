Using malloc/free in Objective-C object

I have a class AudioManager with a member of type AudioBufferList * . (This is a struct declared in the CoreAudio framework). Since AudioBufferList is not a NSObject , I cannot retain it, so I have to alloc/free it (correct me if I'm wrong). My question is, where is the 'right' place to free it? Currently I am doing it in the dealloc method of AudioManager . If I understand correctly, this method is invoked automatically once the release message is sent to the instance of AudioManager --- is that true? Is there any other recommended practice regarding using alloc/free on non-objects members of Objective-C objects? Edit: From Apples documentation: Subclasses must implement their own versions of dealloc to allow the release of any additional memory consumed by the objectâ€”such as dynamically allocated storage for data or object instance variables owned by the deallocated object. After performing the class-specific deallocation, the subclass method should incorporate superclass versions of dealloc through a message to super: Which makes things a little bit clearer - but more insights are appreciated.
