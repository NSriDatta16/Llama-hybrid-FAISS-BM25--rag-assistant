adding class to mfc project

I am trying to add a class which holds the object of the gui. The file is COptimataModulDlg, and the new class I want to add is Manager. I've tried writing this and it didnt work: //Manager.h #pragma once class Manager { public: Manager(); ~Manager(); private: COptimataModulDlg omg; //the problem is with this line }; it works only when I move this line to manager.cpp and I don't understand why.
