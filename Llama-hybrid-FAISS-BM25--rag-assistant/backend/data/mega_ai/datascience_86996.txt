Time series prediction with Lstm on patients data

My data includes different time series length (depends on number of exams each patient did) as well the interval between exams is different. How can I run lstm on this kind of data? (Where the sequence length is different) How should I build the batch? Should each batch hold a patient time series data? Where do I put the target value?
