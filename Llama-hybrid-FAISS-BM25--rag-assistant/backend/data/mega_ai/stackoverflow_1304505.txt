How do you call these classes?

I'm trying to find a collective name for these non-"helper" classes which encapsulate method results (e.g. "SignupResult"), classes which hold multiple filter values (e.g. "ContactSearchFilter"), my SortDirection enum etc. -- I want to organize these correctly but can't find the correct name for these as a whole. Help?
