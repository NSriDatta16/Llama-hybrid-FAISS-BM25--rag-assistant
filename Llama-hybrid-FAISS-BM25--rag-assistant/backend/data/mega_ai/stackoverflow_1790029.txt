problem embedding flash in webpage

I am not sure whats going wrong but when I am using a flash file in the web page when I am setting size style="width: 445px; height: 386px" white strips are embedding sideways automaticaaly,, while using the same page with size width="450" height="440" no white strips appear. It might be the problem associated with the aspect ratio. Is there any way to set these white strps to transparent???? or to remove these strips?????
