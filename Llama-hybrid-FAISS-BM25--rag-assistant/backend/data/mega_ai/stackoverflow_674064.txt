Persisting Enums in database tables

I have an order which has a status (which in code is an Enum). The question is how to persist this. I could: Persist the string in a field and then map back to enum on data retrieval. Persist this as an integer and then map back to enum on data retrieval. Create separate table for enum value and do a join on data retrieval. Thoughts?
