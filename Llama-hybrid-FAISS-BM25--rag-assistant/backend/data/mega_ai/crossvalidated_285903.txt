There are no discriminative or generative tasks, but discriminative and generative models, for both regression and classification. There is a very nice paper that discusses this difference: On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers: A comprarison of logistic regression and naive Bayes . Basically, discriminative models attempt to estimate the conditional probability $P(y|x)$, where $y$ is the output conditioned on the input $x$. Generative models on the other hand estimate $P(x, y) = P(y|x)P(x)$. This allows you to sample from the generative model (and hence the name), because you also model how samples $x$ are generated.
