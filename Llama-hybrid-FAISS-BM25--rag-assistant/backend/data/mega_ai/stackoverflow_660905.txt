Best way to close service client in asynchronous event scheme of things

I have a WCF service client implemented using the asynchronous event (using /async and /tcv:Version35 in svcutil). What is the best way to manage the service client? I am creating a new service client on each request and closing the service client when the event delegate returns. Is it good practice to create a new service client on each request? If I try to use the same service client then I have to de-register the event handlers to every request once the request is furnished (which somehow does not look like an elegant way to achieve this).
