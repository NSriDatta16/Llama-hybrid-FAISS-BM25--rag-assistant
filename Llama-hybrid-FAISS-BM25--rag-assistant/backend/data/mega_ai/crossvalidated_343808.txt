Explain to my intuition: New axioms for rigorous Bayesian probability

I stumbled upon this very interesting article : New axioms for rigorous Bayesian probability https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba/1340369856 Whose aim is to provide new axioms for probability theory that allow for a trivial and rigorous proof of Cox's theorem. However, I really don't understand the motivation for theses 5 axioms, and what part of my "common sense" they should correspond to. Anyone could make the link between those and my intuition? Possibly using knowledge of existing probability theory, bayesian or frequentist concepts.
