Bishop is a great book. I hope these suggestions help with your study: The author himself has posted some slides for Chapters 1 , 2 , 3 & 8 , as well as many solutions . A reading group at INRIA have posted their own slides covering every chapter. Jo√£o Pedro Neto has posted some notes and workings in R here . (Scroll down to where it says "Bishop's Pattern Recognition and ML") Many introductory machine learning courses use Bishop as their textbook. Googling gives a few different ones; have a look and see which topics and focus you prefer.
