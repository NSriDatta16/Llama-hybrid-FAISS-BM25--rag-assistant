I don't believe there is a way to do it without jumping through hoops. C# is generally designed to discourage micro-management of memory resources, and tends to go to great pains to make difficult to treat the CLR's memory manager as anything but a black box. A large part of the reason for this is that the memory manager generally does what it does very well, and does it best when you stay out of its way. It's generally good enough that I wouldn't be surprised if there's no real performance benefit to be gained from putting a buffer in the stack instead of the heap, anyway.
