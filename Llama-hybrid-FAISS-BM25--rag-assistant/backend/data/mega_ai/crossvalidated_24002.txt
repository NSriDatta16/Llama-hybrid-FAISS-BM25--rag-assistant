Non-linear regularized SVM implementation

Just a general question. Are there any good non-linear SVM (kernelized) implementations that include a regularization component (e.g. $L_1$, SCAD etc)? I've been looking around but man there are a lot of different bits and pieces of code in various languages everywhere. I've seen some stuff on R, but it looks like most regularized SVM implementations use a linear kernel. Any suggestions thoughts welcome. Thanks all!
