Help with accuracy of measurements (maybe normalisation?)

So I have a large data set regarding honeybees. I have three measurements, activity count, internal temperature of a hive and external temperature outside a hive (also the time when measurements were taken, but that isn't important at this stage). Activity count is a pure count of bees. Data set looks like: Activity | 200, 500 , 1500, 2700, 4500, 3100, 2200, 1200 etc.. Ext Temp | 16°C, 19°C, 25°C, 28°C, 32°C, 29°C, 24°C, 19°C etc.. Int Temp | 34.4°C, 34.5°C, 34.4°C, 34.3°C, 34.5°C, 34.5°C etc.. There is a relationship between when bees exit the hive to forage and the temperature it is outside (the warmer it gets, the more they forage, up to a point). While this is already known, I want to "normalise" activity to temperature (normalise may not be the right word here, I am horrible at statistics but really wanting to get better). I want to be able to show that if there is a large deviation of activity (out of ordinary levels), it is not caused by a deviation in the temperature at the same time. The bees in my experiment have been exposed to pesticide, and we expect it to have an effect on activity rates. But before I can show a difference, I need to have a baseline for the levels of activity we would expect at certain temperatures before I can truly say a deviation of activity is apparent in the dataset. Hopefully this makes some sense? Can anyone put me on the right track or have I been too vague?
