OpenCV populating CvMat with data and verifying it

I have a vector of TrainingSets(struct below) called data class TrainingSet { public: int time; float input[2]; float output[3*NUM_TRACKING_POINTS]; TrainingSet(int t, float in[2], float out[3*NUM_TRACKING_POINTS]) { time = t; for (int i = 0; i And then I try to take the contents of this Vector, and put them into CvMats for the purpose of training a Neural Network. int datasize = data.size(); float** in = new float*[datasize]; float** out = new float*[datasize]; for (int i = 0; i That last forloop is to check to see if the matrices contents are the data I just fed it, but they don't match. The Matrices seem to have completely different data. Any thoughts on what is going wrong?
