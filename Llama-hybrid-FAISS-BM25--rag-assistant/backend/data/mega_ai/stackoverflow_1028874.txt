Given that storage and hardware are SOOO cheap these days (relatively speaking of course) this should not be a concern. Obviously if you need the data then you need the data! You can use replication to several locations so that the added data doesn't need to move over the wire as far (such as a server on the west coast and the east coast). You can manage your data by separating it by state to minimize the size of your tables (similar to what banks do, choose state as part of the login process so that they look to the right data store). You can use horizontal partitioning to minimize the number or records per table to keep your queries speedy. Lots of ways to keep large data optimized. Also check into Lucene if you plan to do lots of reads to this data.
