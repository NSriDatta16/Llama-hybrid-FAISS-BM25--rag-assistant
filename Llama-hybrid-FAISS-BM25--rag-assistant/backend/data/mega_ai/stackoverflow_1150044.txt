Just checking cnn.com, the article links have in them Year Location (US or WORLD/specificlocationid) Month Day Article name. All of this information together can be used to uniquely identify any article (even less of it is probably actually needed). The dynamic content loading page address could easily be hidden by some method of URL rewriting, and then the information in the requested URL is used to determine which article in the DB is to be served up.
