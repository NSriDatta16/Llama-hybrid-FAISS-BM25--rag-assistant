Using Doctype in Nhibernate

Hi I am trying to keep common properties of base class in one location and use XML ENTITY to refer in Nhibernate mapping file. Mapping file ]> &BasePropertyList; BasePropertyList.xml I am getting following exception System.Xml.XmlException : DTD is prohibited in this XML document. at NHibernate.Cfg.Configuration.LogAndThrow(Exception exception) Am I missing anything here? How DOCTYPE works in Nhibernate mapping file??
