Hyperbolic tangent and sigmoid transfer functions are usually implemented in the hiddens layers of the various neural network fitting tools in Matlab,R,ecc.. Their use is similar and you can try them very simply.They are both differentiable and continous.ReLU and similar are usually implemented in the convolutional neural networks but I don't think it is the first choice for your problem.
