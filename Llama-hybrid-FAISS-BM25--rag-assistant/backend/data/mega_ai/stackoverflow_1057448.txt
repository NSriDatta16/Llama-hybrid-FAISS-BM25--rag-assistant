This usage of 'this' is encouraged by Microsoft C# coding standards. It gives a good code clarity, and is intended to be a standard over the usage of m_ or _ or anything else in member variables. Honestly, I really dislike underscore in names anyway, I used to prefix all my members by a single 'm'.
