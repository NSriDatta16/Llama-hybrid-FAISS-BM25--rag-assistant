Distributions on subsets of $\{1, 2, ..., J\}$?

I'm wondering if there are any sorts of standard distributions on subsets of integers $\{1, 2, ..., J\}$. Equivalently, we could express this as a distribution on a $J$ length vector of binary outcomes, e.g. if $J = 5$ then $\{1, 3, 5\}$ corresponds to the vector $(1, 0, 1, 0, 1)$. Ideally what I'm looking for is some distribution $\nu_\theta (\cdot)$, coming from a family indexed by a finite dimensional parameter $\theta$, that would distribute its mass in such a way two binary vectors $r_1$ and $r_2$ will have similar probability if they are "close" together, i.e. $r_1 = (0, 0, 1, 0, 1)$ and $r_2 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$ have similar probabilities. Really, what I aim to do hopefully, is put a prior on $\theta$ such that if I know $\nu_\theta (r_1)$ is fairly large then $\nu_\theta (r_2)$ is probably large relative to vectors far away from $r_1$. One strategy that comes to mind would be to put a metric or some other measure of dispersion on $d_\theta$ on $\{0, 1\}^J$ and then take $\nu_\theta (r) \propto \exp (-d_\theta (r, \mu))$, or something similar. An explicit example would be $\exp\left\{-\|r - \mu\|^2 / (2 \sigma^2)\right\}$ in analogy with the normal distribution. That's fine, but I'm hoping there is something standard and amenable to Bayesian analysis; with this I can't write down the normalizing constant.
