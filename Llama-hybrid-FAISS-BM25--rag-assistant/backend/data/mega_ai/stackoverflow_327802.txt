What is the difference between many tables in one database or many databases with same tables? Is it for better security or for different types of backups? I m not sure about mySQL but in MSSQL it is like this: If you need to backup databases in different way you need to consider keeping tables in different data files. By default they all are in PRIMARY file. You can specify different storage. All transactions are hold in tempdb. This is not very good because if it transaction log becomes full then all databases stop functioning. Then you can end up with separate SQL servers for each user. Which is sort of nonsense if you are talking about thousands of clients.
