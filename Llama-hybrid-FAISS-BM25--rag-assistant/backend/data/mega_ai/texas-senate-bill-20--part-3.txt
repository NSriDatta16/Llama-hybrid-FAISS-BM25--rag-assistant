yle Edmundson, called for anime fans to step up and prevent the law's enactment "for the good of artists and fans everywhere", saying that the legislation was "draconian" and claimed it was the most extreme case of anime and manga censorship in U.S. history. Nick Valdez of ComicBook.com said that the legislation could lead to censorship of "many anime and manga projects," like Kill la Kill and The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You, becoming a crime, and said that even if the law is enforced in a case-by-case basis, it could lead to a "much larger ban of materials in the state" itself due to the content of certain manga and anime. Vanessa Esguerra of The Mary Sue argued that possession of manga like Berserk and Vagabond, or viewing Dandadan, could be deemed illegal under the law, due to various parts of each of these media, and asserted that viewing and owning certain anime and other media, falling under the law's provisions, within Texas, might put "people behind the slammer". Victoria Luxford of NME said that the law's provisions could put various comics, games, and anime series at risk because many stories depict "underage characters in situations considered violent or otherwise inappropriate from a certain perspective". Zenko Kurishita, a Japanese free speech activist and politician, who served two terms as a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, criticized the law on social media, saying that it was "nonsensical" to judge a character on "looking like" they were a minor. He also said there was "no guarantee that this censorship will reduce the number of real-life criminals", stated that it could have a chilling effect, with someone arrested, recommended not proposing similar laws elsewhere in the world, and said he would continue focusing on this issue with fans of Japanese media. Other critics argued that the law's broad wording could inadvertently "criminalize certain forms" of anime, manga, video games, and artistic expression, leading to censorship of creative works. For instance, legal expert and Comic Book Legal Defense Fund Interim Executive Director Jeff Trexler was also critical of the law. He expressed worry that the legislation "may discourage people from engaging with specific titles, leading to unspoken censorship", guessed that the law may be aiming to "instill fear" rather than enforce it, and argued that the law allows for the "unconstitutional prosecution for possessing certain cartoons or animation". After the bill's passage, the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund noted, on social media, that the organization tried to make the bill "align with constitutional standards and to remove the comics reference" while working behind closed doors but that these amendments did not "work out." Impact Prior to the law's enactment, it was reported in CBR that on August 30th, JAST USA, a publisher of English-language versions of Japanese video games, specifically bish≈çjo games, dating sims, visual novels and Japanese RPGs, and J18 Publishing, the manga subdivision, were banned from the San Japan convention, on the convention's second day. Their products were said to be "too provocative" for the new "legal climate" in Texas. The official accounts of J18 Publishing and JAST USA confirmed this report, asserting that their literature was "too incisive" for Texas, ahead of "the anti-anime SB20 law going into effect on Monday." Jack Morgan of Texas Public Radio, at the convention, said there was a happy mood, but "chill in the air" because of the law, with mixed feelings of participants toward the new legislation. On September 9th, ValleyCentral reported that early issues of Dragon Ball Z had been pulled from the shelves of Kaboom Comics in Weslaco, Texas, by story manager Andrew Balderas because one of the protagonists, Goku, had been "shown naked as a child". Balderas told the publication that while this nudity was rare and done for "comedic effect," he was removing the issues as a precautio
