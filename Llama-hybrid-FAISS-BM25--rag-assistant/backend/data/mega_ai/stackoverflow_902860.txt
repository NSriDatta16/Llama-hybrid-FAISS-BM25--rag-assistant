Google App Engine + GWT + Eclipse: where do your unit tests live?

I'm just getting started with a project that combines GWT, Google App Engine and the Google Eclipse plugin. Where is the best place to store my tests? I normally keep my code organized Maven-style, with src/main/java , and tests in src/test/java . The default setup I get from the plugin dumped my source directly into src , which I'm not too fond of, but I'd prefer not to fight against the tools. What's the "standard" place to put unit tests in such a project? Solution : create src/main/java , move the existing code under there create src/test/java , add your tests here go to Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path, add the new locations as Source Folders.
