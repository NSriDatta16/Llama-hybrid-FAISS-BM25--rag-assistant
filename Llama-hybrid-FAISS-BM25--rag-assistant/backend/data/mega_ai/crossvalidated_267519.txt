If I understand your problem correctly, the choice would be multinomial logistic regression , also known as the "conditional maximum entropy model". Concerning your second question I guess that two different concerns can be emphasized: the accuracy of the confidence interval or the statistical power of the inference. I would especially be concerned with correcting for multiple testing, for example using the Holm-Bonferroni correction of the alpha values or something more contemporary. For the final question, a method that takes prior probabilities into account would be a Bayesian method. Although I don't have a concrete suggestion here, the problem reminds me of random forests and naive Bayes classifiers. However, these models not only involve dependence, but training, so I am not sure if those topics would be relevant to the problem at hand.
