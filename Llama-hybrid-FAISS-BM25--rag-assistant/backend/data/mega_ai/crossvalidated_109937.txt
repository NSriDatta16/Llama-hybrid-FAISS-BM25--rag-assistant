Logistic Regression - Adding interactions makes Independent variable statistically insignificant

My name is Abhi & I am trying to better understand logistic regression by solving a few practice problem. I am using R and RStudio as the development environment Problem Statement Given the age, sex and class(first,second,third) for each passenger can you predict if he survived or died when the titanic sank Attempt1 Simple Logistic Regression. Use age,sex and passenger class directly. The formula (in R) Survived~Pclass+Sex+Age This gives fairly decent results - accuracy of 79% and all of independent variables are statistically significant Attempt2 Add interactions between age,sex and passenger class. Accuracy has improved to 80% but age is no longer significant. Also none of the new terms(age-sex,age-class,sex-class,age-sex-class) are statistically significant. The formula (in R) Survived~Pclass*Sex*Age Can some one explain why this is happening? I can accept that the new terms may not be significant but why is age no longer significant? Any help would be much appreciated
