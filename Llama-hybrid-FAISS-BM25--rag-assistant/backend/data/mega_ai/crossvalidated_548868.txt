covariates are almost always correlated. if you do experimental research then it's not a problem at all. in observational studies if they're highly correlated you may run into some issues, of course. in this case you can try PCA, so that if you get PC1 it will represent all the variables in the cluster, which may alleviate your concern about using only one variable.
