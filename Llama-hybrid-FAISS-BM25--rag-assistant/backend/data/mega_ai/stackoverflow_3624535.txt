Simply put, the HTML spec does not specify what the browser behavior for setting the title attribute on the a element should be. The makers of IE decided to display a tooltip, the makers of Firefox didn't, in early versions. You can see that in a current version of Firefox, tooltips work as you expect if you hover over the names in the comments on this site. From the spec: This attribute offers advisory information about the element for which it is set. And: Values of the title attribute may be rendered by user agents in a variety of ways. For instance, visual browsers frequently display the title as a "tool tip" As you can see, the tooltip is not mandated, only suggested as an example.
