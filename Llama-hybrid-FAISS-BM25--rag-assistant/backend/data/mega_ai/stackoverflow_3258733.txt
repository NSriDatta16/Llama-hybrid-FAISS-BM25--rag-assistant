New to unit testing, how to write great tests?

I'm fairly new to the unit testing world, and I just decided to add test coverage for my existing app this week. This is a huge task, mostly because of the number of classes to test but also because writing tests is all new to me. I've already written tests for a bunch of classes, but now I'm wondering if I'm doing it right. When I'm writing tests for a method, I have the feeling of rewriting a second time what I already wrote in the method itself. My tests just seems so tightly bound to the method (testing all codepath, expecting some inner methods to be called a number of times, with certain arguments), that it seems that if I ever refactor the method, the tests will fail even if the final behavior of the method did not change. This is just a feeling, and as said earlier, I have no experience of testing. If some more experienced testers out there could give me advices on how to write great tests for an existing app, that would be greatly appreciated. Edit : I would love to thank Stack Overflow, I had great inputs in less that 15 minutes that answered more of the hours of online reading I just did.
