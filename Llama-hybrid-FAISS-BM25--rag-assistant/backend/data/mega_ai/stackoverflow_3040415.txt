Drag and drop to Desktop / Explorer

Following my scenario. I got an Application which loads a Filestructure (Folders, Files) from a Database into a WPF ListView. Now I'd like to grab a file from this ListView, drag it over my Desktop (or some open explorer window) and drop it there. Basic Drag and Drop, nothing fancy. This sounds like a "standard" function for a windows application - but google won't help. So how can I achieve this? Interops? Thanks Edit : Thanks for the solution, I still had to do some googling. Here's my complete solution .
