I'll start by admitting my bias that I lead the MOXy JAXB implementation, which leads me into my first point. 1. There are multiple JAXB implementations Since JAXB is a standard ( JSR-222 ), there are multiple implementations: Metro (the reference implementation), EclipseLink MOXy , Apache JaxMe , etc. If you hit a show stopper bug in one implementation you can try another. 2. JAXB is the default binding layer for both JAX-RS (RESTful Web Services) and JAX-WS (SOAP Web Services) JAXB was designed in conjunction with JAX-WS, and JAX-RS was written to leverage JAXB. JAXB is supported on all Java EE 5 and Java EE 6 application servers. 3. JAXB supports Java 5 features such as generics and enums This may or not be a big deal for you, but JAXB supports generics and enums while XML Beans does not. 4. Individual Implementations have very useful extensions For example MOXy has extensions for XPath based mapping, XML metadata file, and extensions for mapping JPA entities: http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/09/xpath-based-mapping-geocode-example.html http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/12/extending-jaxb-representing-annotations.html http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/07/jpa-entities-to-xml-bidirectional.html
