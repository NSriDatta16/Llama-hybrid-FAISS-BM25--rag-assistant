Temporal Extraction (i.e. Extract date/time entities from free form text) - How?

Has anyone found a simple, but effective way to extract date references from text? I've done a fair amount of searching for temporal extraction tools, but there isn't a lot out there. There are a few white papers, but it seems to fall into a subset of the whole semantic web thingy but not given much attention. I'm just looking for something that is 80% effective. There is no need to capture things like "the month after Jan 2009", but basic common dates entities would be nice. I'm open to all suggestions, even fancy regex expressions. Fire away! (and thanks - Henry)
