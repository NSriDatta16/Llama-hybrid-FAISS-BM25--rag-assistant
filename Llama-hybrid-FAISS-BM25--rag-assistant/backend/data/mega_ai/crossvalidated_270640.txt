Scikit-Learn - Adding Weights to Features

I'm pretty new to machine learning and I have a question regarding weighting features. I was able to get code running with scikit-learn and random forest. Now I would like to weight certain features higher to give them more importance. The data ranges anywhere from T/F to dollar amounts. Can someone point me in a good direction for this? I haven't been very successful finding examples to use.
