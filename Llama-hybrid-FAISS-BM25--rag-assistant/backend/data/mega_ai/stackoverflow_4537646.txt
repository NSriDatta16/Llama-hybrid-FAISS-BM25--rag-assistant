More than likely, you were using Spy++. It gives you a graphical view of all the processes, threads, windows, and window messages on your computer. And as you described, you can drag a target to any window object and show its properties. It comes with most versions of Visual Studio. However, if you don't have Visual Studio, I'm not sure if it's legally available for download. Instead, try WinSpy++ . It is based around the Spy++ utility, but is freely available (including the source).
