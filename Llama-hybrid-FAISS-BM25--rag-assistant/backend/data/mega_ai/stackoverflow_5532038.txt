End user wants to add languages dynamically to his website

We have to build an event registration website for our client in ASP.NET using C#. One of the requirements is that the client wants to add new foreign languages to his website himself using en excel file. I know how to make a website multilingual in Visual Studio, but I have no idea how to generate a resource file based on an excel file in code. I also noticed VS generates a second file called Resource.en.designer.cs but I can't find any documentation how to generate that file either. btw, the enduser is anything but IT-related. He knows his way around excel though (obviously). Any help is appreciated! Yoeri EDIT: !Robert Levy Provided a good method! HOW TO: STEP 1: Read the excel file (using an OleDBAdapter was the best method for me, as you can use column headers etc) Write the language to a txt file in this format: KEY=TRANSLATION no spaces or anything else STEP 2: Locate ResGen.exe on your computer (it comes with Visual Studio, so look somewhere like c:\program files\visual studio\sdk... however I found it @ C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bin\ResGen.exe) STEP 3: Invoke the exe with Process.Start("resgen.exe") hint: use ProcesStartInfo for easy argument and preferences settings (STEP 4:) Move the file to your desired location (I find the App_GlobalResources works perfectly) STEP 5: Set the user currentUIculture to your desired culture!
