In practical terms, linear regression is useful even if you are also using a more complex model for your work. The key is that linear regression is easy to understand and therefore easy to use to conceptually understand what is happening in more complex models. I can offer you a practical application example from my real live job as a statistical analyst. If you find yourself out in the wild, unsupervised, with a large dataset, and your boss asks you to run some analysis on it, where do you start? Well, if you are unfamiliar with the dataset and don't have a good idea of how the various features are expected to relate to each other, then a complex model like the ones you suggested is a bad place to start investigating. Instead, the best place to start is simple old linear regression. Perform a regression analysis, look at coefficients and graph the residuals. Once you start to see what is going on with the data, then you can make some decisions as to what advanced methods you are going to try to apply. I assert that if you just plugged your data into some advanced model black box like sklearn.svm (if you are into Python), then you will have very low confidence that your results will be meaningful.
