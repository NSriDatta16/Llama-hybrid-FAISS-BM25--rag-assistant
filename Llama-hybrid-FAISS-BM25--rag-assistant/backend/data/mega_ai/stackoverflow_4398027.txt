I'm not an expert in embedding other JS libs into qooxdoo apps, but there are several successfull attempts of doing so, so it shouldn't be too hard. E.g. have a look at qxJqPlot which wraps jqPlot for use in qooxdoo. You might want to look at the code that wraps jqPlot. If that is not close enough to your use case, have a look at the other contributions , I'm sure you'll find one that uses a DOM element to embed library functionality.
