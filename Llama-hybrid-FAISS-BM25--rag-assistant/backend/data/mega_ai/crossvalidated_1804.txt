Just a thought: you might not need the full SVD for your problem. Let M = U S V* be the SVD of your d by n matrix ( i.e. , the time series are the columns). To achieve the dimension reduction you'll be using the matrices V and S . You can find them by diagonalizing M* M = V (S*S) V* . However, because you are missing some values, you cannot compute M* M . Nevertheless, you can estimate it. Its entries are sums of products of columns of M . When computing any of the SSPs, ignore pairs involving missing values. Rescale each product to account for the missing values: that is, whenever a SSP involves n-k pairs, rescale it by n/(n-k). This procedure is a "reasonable" estimator of M* M and you can proceed from there. If you want to get fancier, maybe multiple imputation techniques or Matrix Completion will help. (This can be carried out in many statistical packages by computing a pairwise covariance matrix of the transposed dataset and applying PCA or factor analysis to it.)
