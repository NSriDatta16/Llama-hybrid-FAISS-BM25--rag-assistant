htaccess redirect vs php redirect

I have decided to change all my /dyanmic.php?UID=... pages to /static/Name-From-DB . I have read that the best way to do redirection, SEO wise, is to implement a 301 .htacess redirection: (http://www.tamingthebeast.net)- The right way - a htaccess 301 Redirect: A 301 redirect is the most efficient and spider/visitor friendly strategy around for web sites that are hosted on servers running Apache. However, since I have thousands of pages I need to use redirection for, it seems pretty inefficient to have thousands of entries in the .htacess file: redirect 301 /dynamid.php?UID=1 http://www.domain.com/static/Name-From-DB redirect 301 /dynamid.php?UID=2 http://www.domain.com/static/Another-Name-From-DB and so on... Therefore it seems like the efficient way to do it is via the PHP page, setting the header to 301 redirection according to the UID: My question is if this method will effect in a negative way on my pages' rankings, considering the paragraph I quoted above that the best way to do a redirection is through the .htaccess. Thanks!
