I don't like doctests for these reasons: You can't run a subset of the tests. When a test fails, it's useful to run just one test. Doctest provides no way to do that. If a failure happens in the middle of the doctest, the whole thing stops. I'd rather see all the results to decide how to tackle a breakage. The coding style is stylized, and has to have printable results. Your code is executed in a special way, so it's harder to reason about how it will be executed, harder to add helpers, and harder to program around the tests. This list was taken from my blog post Things I don't like about doctest , where there's more, and a long thread of comments debating the points. About coverage: I don't believe there's a coverage tool for Python that will measure coverage within doctests. But since they are simply long lists of statements with no branches or loops, is that a problem?
