Since I have a clinical aversion to static methods :P and a thing for organizing code (Also noticed you didn't handle any exceptions coming out of send method) public class MultiClient { private long[] responseTimes = null; private Throwable[] errors = null; public MultiClient(int count) { responseTimes = new long[count]; errors = new Throwable[count]; } protected void sendRequestWrapper(int index) { long startTime = System.nanoTime(); try { //original send request sendRequest(); } // optionally you may put a catch() here to process errors catch(Throwable t) { errors[index] = t; } finally { //this will guarantee response times filled up even in case of //sendRequest raising an exception responseTimes[index] = System.nanoTime() - startTime; } } public void doStuff() { Thread[] threads = new Thread[count]; //separete create thread calls for(int i = 0; i
