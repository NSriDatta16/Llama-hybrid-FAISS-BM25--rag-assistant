You won't like this - in Windows, you have to create a window, then override WM_PAINT message, then draw what you have to draw when you are called from the system. That's old-school way of doing things, and it isn't so bad. Some interesting and relevant links: http://www.winprog.org/tutorial/bitmaps.html http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/66250/BeginPaint-EndPaint-or-GetDC-ReleaseDC.aspx If you are really into avoiding all that, try popcap . Learning curve involved there maybe steeper, so you probably really want to stick with GDI and HWND no matter how hard and confusing it might look in the beginning.
