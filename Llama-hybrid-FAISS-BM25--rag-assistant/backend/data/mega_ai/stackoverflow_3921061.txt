Whenever you notice that a superclass's implementation of mouseDragged: or mouseUp: is not getting called, it's most likely because the class's implementation of mouseDown: enters a tracking loop. This is certainly true of many NSControl subclasses including NSSlider . A better way to detect a mouse up is to subclass the cell and override the appropriate tracking method. In this case, you probably want - (void)stopTracking:(NSPoint)lastPoint at:(NSPoint)stopPoint inView:(NSView *)controlView mouseIsUp:(BOOL)flag , but the startTracking: and continueTracking: variants might prove useful as well for what you're trying to do.
