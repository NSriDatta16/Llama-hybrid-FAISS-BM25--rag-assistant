how to combine a template from other processed templates?

I have a django project pro1 with several apps: app1, app2, app3 and so on. I want to display some top level template that contains blocks from each and every app: example_base_template.html: [header /] [left nav bar]{{ app1 rendered template }}[/left nav bar] [right nav bar]{{ app2 rendered template }}[/right nav bar] [center section]{{ app1 main functionality template }}[/center section] [footer]{{ app3 rendered template }}{{ app4 rendered template }}[/footer] All those app templates are dynamic, that use DB. How to do that in the most proper and elegant way? Or maybe the question is how to connect 4 different views to one URL?
