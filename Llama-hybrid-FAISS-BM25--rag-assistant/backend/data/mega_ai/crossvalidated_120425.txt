You have several ways of detrending a time-series with the aim of making it stationary: The linear detrending is what you copied. It may not give you what you desire as you arbitrarily fix a deterministic linear trend. The quadratic detrending is in some ways similar to the linear detrending, except that you add a "time^2" and supposes a exponential-type behavior. The HP-filter from Hodrick and Prescott (1980) allows you to extract the non-deterministic long-term component of the series. The residual series is thus the cyclical component. Be aware that, as it is an optimal weighted average, it suffers from endpoint bias (the first and last 4 observations are wrongly estimated.) The Bandpass filter of Baxter and King (1995) which is essentialy a Moving Average filter where you exclude high and low frequencies. The Christiano-Fitzgerald filter. To sum up, it depends on what your intention is and some filters may be better suited to your needs than others.
