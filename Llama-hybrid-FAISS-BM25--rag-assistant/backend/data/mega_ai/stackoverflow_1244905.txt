Renaming files with Visual Studio and TortoiseSVN

I am using Visual Studio for editing source code and once a while I switch to Windows Explorer to commit changes with TortoiseSVN. This procedure works well for me and I am quite happy with it. However, recently I started to rename classes and reorganize namespaces a lot. I like to rename and move files in Visual Studio because it automatically update the project file for me. When I commit changes, however, I have to tell TortoiseSVN that old files were deleted and new files were added, which isn't quite true and it breaks the history of the particular code. So my question is: When I rename file in Visual Studio, is there any way to tell TortoiseSVN that I did that to preserve file history? Update (16:30): Ankhsvn seems to be obvious answer but I like thing as they are now. It sounds weird but I like TortoiseSVN not being integrated in Visual Studio. This is maybe because of my two monitor setup when I have always opened file manager on my secondary monitor. Maybe because I found Solution Explorer a little clunky. Maybe because I like to think about code editing and revision control as separate steps of software development. I don't know.
