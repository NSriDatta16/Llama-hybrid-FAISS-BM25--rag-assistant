Need guidance in image classification

I'm new to machine learning and need some help. I need image classification to tell if an image is a car or not. Is there any working example or guidance or a book for this particular question? preferably in Java. My problem is that those cars are in various orientations, have various sizes on pictures and are not always in center. Thank you
