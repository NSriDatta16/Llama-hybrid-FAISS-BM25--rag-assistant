Most search engines follow robots.txt . I've heard Yahoo Slurp! does not. You could scan user agent for well known bots, such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Internet Archive, etc and produce blank output. You will be penalised for giving alternate content to Google, but since you are blocking them, it won't be a problem. The most important thing is whatever you publish publically can and will be accessed by bots such as search engine spiders. Don't forget bots have a nasty habit of being where you don't want them to be (mixed with bad coding practices, can be quite disastrous).
