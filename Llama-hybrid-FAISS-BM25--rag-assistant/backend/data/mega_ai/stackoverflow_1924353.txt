THC4k mentions 2to3 , and I just wanted to point out that there's also a 3to2 package . I've never used either package, but I've heard that 3to2 is more forgiving than 2to3. Edit: just wanted to emphasize what others have suggested: If you choose to use one of these converters to release your software for either 2.6 or 3.0, you'll probably want to have a solid testing system in place (unittest, doctest, etc) with decent test coverage to sleep soundly at night!
