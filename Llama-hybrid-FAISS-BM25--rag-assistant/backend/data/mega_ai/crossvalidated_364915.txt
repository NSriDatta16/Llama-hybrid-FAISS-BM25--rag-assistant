Are the assumptions of subset selection violated of all the data comes from a single person?

I’m interested in using machine learning techniques such as subset selection, lasso and ridge regression to predict which words an individual kid will get wrong. I have about 300 predictors and all my data is from within one child. I want to find a model that works well for that child (and perhaps other models with other children). But I’m worried that key assumptions of the model might be violated since all the data is from a single person. Basically, does it make sense (and not violate the assumptions of the models) to create separate models one for each student if the end goal is accurate prediction?
