Clustering on imbalanced data that has high correlation

I am clustering images of two categories, but for the purposes of the experiment, I do not know the labels i.e. this is an unsupervised problem. Via correlation heatmaps and other experiments, I am confident that my images are highly correlated, at least via a Pearson correlation coefficient . However, I face very large imbalanced datasets in my problem, and as a result, my hierarchical agglomerative clustering fails when the imbalance passes a ratio of around $10:1$ . I have no idea of alternative solutions. I have tried reducing dimensionality via PCA , but this does not help.
