Suppose we have a Bayesian Model on the data $Y_i = \alpha \beta^2 X_i^3$. What priors cause the model to not be identifiable?

Suppose $$ Y_i = \alpha \beta^2 X_i^3 \ \ \text{for $i$ in $1, \ldots, N$} $$ Both $Y_i$ and $X_i$ are positive real numbers. If we were to put a uniform prior on $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , why would the model be non-identifiable? Thanks.
