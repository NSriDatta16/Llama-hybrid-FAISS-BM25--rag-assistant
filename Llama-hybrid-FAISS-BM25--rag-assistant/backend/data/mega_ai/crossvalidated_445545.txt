I have now found Van Buuren's Flexible Imputation of Missing Data (2018). Section 2.8 explains that in cases such as mine, where there is a large number of variables, it may not after all make sense to use the percentage of complete cases to guide the number of imputations. Instead, we can consider using the average missing data rate as a less conservative estimate. For me this is 3.4%, meaning that 5 imputations are, at least on this reasoning, adequate.
