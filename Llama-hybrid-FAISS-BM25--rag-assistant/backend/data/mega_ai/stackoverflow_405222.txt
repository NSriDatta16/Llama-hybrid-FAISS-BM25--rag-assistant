Maybe just maybe, you need badly some "features" that do not exist yet in the existing solutions. Maybe you need something simpler also. 1.5$ for Subsonic is simply outrageous. Maybe you want to use POCO. Maybe you want to use the stuff easily in a 3 tier scenario. Maybe you don't want to support ALL RDBMS on the planet, so you can hardcode and optimize the code just for your target. Maybe you want to implement smarter object tracking. Maybe some design decisions made by the existing orms drive you crazy.... I myself am using a custom orm developed by me myself and i, and i am satisfied that i did it. There is no hidden dragon under the carpet, no surprise scenario. My orm does exacty what i want it to do, nothing less, nothing more.
