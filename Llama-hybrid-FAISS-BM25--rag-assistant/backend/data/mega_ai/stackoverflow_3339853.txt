It's a common problem. All modern computers have a temporary files directory. On Linux/Unix it's /tmp , on Windows it's usually c:\temp . The OS install will have set permissions on that directory so that anyone can write files there but only privileged users can delete files that don't belong to them. This is where PHP will want to put an uploaded file; your application then has to move it elsewhere (this is the purpose of the move_uploaded_file() function). PHP under Windows may need upload_tmp_dir actually set in the php.ini file. Once you have an uploaded file, you can shift it whereever you like, including to where the webserver can read it to serve it. The biggest problem with that it is awfully easy to put this directory inside your codebase. Don't do that . As soon as you do anything beyond editing the files inside the directory they are served from, it will be problematic. Trust me: I've dealt with a few times this in code I've inherited. It's easy to let your webserver load files from a location outside your codebase. The other alternative is to produce a download script. That way the file need not be servable by the webserver at all. One disadvantage is that you don't get to leverage the web server's MIME translation, but then, that lets you control which types of image files are permitted.
