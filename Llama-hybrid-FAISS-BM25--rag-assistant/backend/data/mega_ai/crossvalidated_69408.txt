Optimal weights for a linear combination

I am trying to find optimal weights for a linear combination. I already know the signs of the weights (+/-). Specifically I have gene expression data where 100 genes belong to a certain pathway. I know which genes are regulators or not (signs) for those 100 genes. I am trying to compute a pathway score for each sample using appropriate weights. Is there any Bayesian type (so that I can use prior information +/-) approach that can be used to obtain weights?
