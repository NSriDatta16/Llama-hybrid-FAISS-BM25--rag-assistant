Eclipse PDT (helios) autocompletion

I've just completed a new eclipse helios install and I am wondering why the autocompletion is not working properly; in my older versions (ganymede/galileo) it was. It's working for simple functions and class-methods but: It doesn't know methods which have been inherited from other classes It won't show autocompletion for chained methods which return $this . For instance: class y { protected $_a; public function setA($a) { $this->_a = $a; return $this; } } class x extends y { protected $_b; public function setB($b) { $this->_b = $b; return $this; } } $x = new x; $x->[AUTOCOMPLETION] Here [AUTOCOMPLETION] only shows the methods directly implemented in x , but not the methods of y . When I do: $x->setB(123) ->[AUTOCOMPLETION] ...the autocompletion doesn't work at all. Both of these cases worked great in my previous versions. So what's wrong? Did I mis-configure something?
