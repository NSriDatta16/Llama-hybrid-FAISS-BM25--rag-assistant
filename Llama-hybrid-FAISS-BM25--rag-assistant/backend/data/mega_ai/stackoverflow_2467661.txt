There is very likely a way to do this with a build task (particularly if you are willing to roll your own). Hopefully someone will post some sample code for you. If not, I have been impressed with NDepend for this type of task. You can write in a very self-explanatory, SQL-like syntax to determine all sorts of metrics about your code and warn or fail a build based on thresholds. Examples: WARN IF Count > 0 IN SELECT METHODS WHERE CodeWasChanged AND PercentageCoverage 0 IN SELECT METHODS WHERE IsPublic AND IsInOlderBuild AND WasRemoved
