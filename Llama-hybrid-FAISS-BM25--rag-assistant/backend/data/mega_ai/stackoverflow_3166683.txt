Note the mismatch between this: int xstrlen(char string); and this: int xstrlen(char string[]) They should match (and the latter is the correct one). If you want to get really accurate, it should probably be char const *string , signifying that this function won't modify what's passed to it. When you're done with that, carry out an exorcism on your code, eliminating its use of gets , then banish that filth from your vocabulary forever, lest ye become an agent of evil! :-)
