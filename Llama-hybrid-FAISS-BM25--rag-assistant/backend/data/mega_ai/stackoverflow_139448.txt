Micromanaging software development projects using MS Project is one of the more stupid things someone can do, especially in an agile environment. Too many things that take 1/10th or 10x the time that you predicted, too many things that overrun, and too many project planning meetings eating up useful work time. In addition being a slave to the Gantt chart is a very common thing you see, especially with project managers that come from different disciplines. However they are useful for ensuring that actions (get account with XYZ set up, get compliance to check wording on website, etc) are completed by certain deadlines. Coarse grained deadlines for programming tasks as well are fine. All in my opinion, I'm certain that there are people who have had successful results from micromanaging programming teeams.
