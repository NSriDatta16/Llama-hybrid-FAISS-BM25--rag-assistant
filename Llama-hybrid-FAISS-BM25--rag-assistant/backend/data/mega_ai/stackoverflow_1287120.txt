To leverage .Net remoting IIS is not mandatory, over config file (or even programmaticaly ) you can specify tcp:// to start listen/response over any IP port. In this case you just need to resolve issue how server will available for clients. Create windows service create console with infinite loop to handle incoming request. IIS in case of remoting just works as service to host your dll, that is why you can replace it.
