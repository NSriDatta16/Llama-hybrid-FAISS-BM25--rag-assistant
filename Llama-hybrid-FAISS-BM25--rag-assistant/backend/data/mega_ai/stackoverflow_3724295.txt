How do I use Perl's smart matching to match many patterns at once?

I was trying to follow some examples to use smart matching in the following piece of code, but failed (nothing was filtered out). How can I use smart matching here to match against multiple regexes at once? my $regexes_to_filter_a = ("tmp", "temp", "del") my @organism_dirs = (); # this will hold final list of dirs to processs my @subdirs = File::Find::Rule->directory->maxdepth(1)->in($root_dir); foreach my $subdir (@subdirs) { my $filter = 0; # IMPROVE: can do smart matching here foreach my $regex ( @{$regexes_to_filter_a} ) { if ( basename($subdir) =~ $regex ) { $filter = 1; # filter out this dir last; } } unless ($filter) { push @organism_dirs, $subdir; } }
