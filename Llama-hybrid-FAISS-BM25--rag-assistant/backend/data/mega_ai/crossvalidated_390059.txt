We can always stratify our sample so that the distribution of the underlying variables is similar between the two sets; stratified sampling is quite standard approach to ensure random subgroups have similar statistical properties. If we are using R they are multiple packages offering stratified sampling; e.g. the packages splitstackshape and stratification have a lot of readily available functionality. Most of stratified sampling methodology originates from survey statistics and ecology, so one might want to see a paper like Shao's (2003) " Impact of the Bootstrap on Sample Surveys " , to get a better idea about potential implications of bootstrapping a (survey) sample. I have also found the UN's FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations) Fisheries Technical Paper 434 on Sampling methods applied to fisheries science: a manual extremely readible and to the point (see in particular section 4 " Stratified random sampling ") There are techniques that allows precise covariate balancing between control and treatment groups that could also be applicable but they are almost certainly an over-kill to use for picking a hold-out set. They might be useful as diagnostic tools nevertheless.
