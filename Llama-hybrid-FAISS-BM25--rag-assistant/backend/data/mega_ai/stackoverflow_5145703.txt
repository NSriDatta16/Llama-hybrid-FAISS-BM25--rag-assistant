I would say: DO IT RIGHT! Have a class dedicated to it, trace down all USER_AGENTS of all browsers and devices out there, create a database of them and integrate it to your working Session routine. Everytime user comes in, determine his User-agent information [type, name and version] and then pass the data to your Display routines which should determine what content and design templates to print. This way, you can build a web site which is SEO-friendly, user-friendly, tidy and easy to organize [=developer-friendly] - ALL IN ONE, which is a VERY RARE THING to stumble upon in todays Internet... So, DO IT RIGHT!
