I think the problem is that you're trying to load a file result INTO #downloadmsg, which isn't going to work because .load() is only going to load results as HTML...NOT binary data or other encoding. One approach that might work is creating a hidden iframe in HTML, like this: Then, set the attr of the iframe to your querystring: $("#secretIFrame").attr("src","myphpscript.php?option1=apple&option2=orange"); and then using PHP headers to force the download when the source is set (here's an example of an exporter header set from one of my scripts that uses an octet stream): header("Pragma: public"); header("Expires: 0"); header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); header("Content-Type: application/force-download"); header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream"); header("Content-Type: application/download"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=data.xls "); header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary "); Hope this helps!
