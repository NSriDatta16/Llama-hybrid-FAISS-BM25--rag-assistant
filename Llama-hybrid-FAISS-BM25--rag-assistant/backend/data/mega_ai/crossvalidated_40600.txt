In R you can use neuralnet and RSNNS (which provides an interface to the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator ) to fit standard multilayer neural networks, but there are differences to RBM. Regarding implementing deep neural nets in R, I think the only worthwhile strategy would be to interface existing FOSS implementations, which is usually a much better solution than just reimplementing things on your own (I never quite understood why everyone needs to reinvent the wheel). R offers a lot of functionality to do this and you can leverage the data handling of R with the speed and ready-to-use aspects of existing solutions. For example, one might interface MDP with the Python/R interfacing capabilities, see e.g., this paper . Edit: Andrew Landgraf from Statistically Significant provides some R Code for RBM .
