Your question is very vauge, so I will answer it based on what you asked. ssh -f -T ${USAGE_2_USER}@${USAGE_2_HOST} ${CMD} this would ssh as the user assigned to ${USAGE_2_USER} to the host assigned to ${USAGE_2_HOST} and then run whatever you have assigned to ${CMD} and then return the output and then exit. risk@DockMaster:~$ ssh oracle@orc017a uptime 13:17:41 up 9 days, 13:54, 7 users, load average: 1.67, 2.19, 2.11 risk@DockMaster:~$ As a side note is the -f -T needed?
