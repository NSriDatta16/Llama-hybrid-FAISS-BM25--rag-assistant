Negative coefficient in ordered logistic regression

Suppose we have the ordinal response $y:\{\text{Bad, Neutral, Good}\} \rightarrow \{1,2,3\}$ and a set of variables $X:=[x_1,x_2,x_3]$ that we think will explain $y$. We then do an ordered logistic regression of $X$ (design matrix) on $y$ (response). Suppose the estimated coefficient of $x_1$, call it $\hat{\beta}_1$, in the ordered logistic regression is $-0.5$. How do I interpret the odds ratio (OR) of $e^{-0.5} = 0.607$? Do I say "for a 1 unit increase in $x_1$, ceteris paribus, the odds of observing $\text{Good}$ are $0.607$ times the odds of observing $\text{Bad}\cup \text{Neutral}$, and for the same change in $x_1$, the odds of observing $\text{Neutral} \cup \text{Good}$ are $0.607$ times the odds of observing $\text{Bad}$"? I can't find any examples of negative coefficient interpretation in my textbook or Google.
