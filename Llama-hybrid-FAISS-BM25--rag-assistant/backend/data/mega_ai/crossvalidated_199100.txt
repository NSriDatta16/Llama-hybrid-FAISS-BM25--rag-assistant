The paper you quote says Suppose $Y(s,t)$ denotes the value of the process of interest at location $s$ and time $t$ ... there are $S$ sites and $T$ time points, and hence the number of grid points is $S \times T$ ... Depending on the modelling strategy, it may be helpful to `arrange' the process in different ways. To that end, let $\boldsymbol{Y}(s,)$ be the $T$-vector of time series values at site $s$. Let $\boldsymbol{Y}(,t)$ be the matrix of spatially gridded values of the process at time $t$. Let $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{Y}}_t$ denote a vectorization of the matrix $\boldsymbol{Y}(,t)$. So $\boldsymbol{Y}$ is a $S \times T$ matrix where authors use $Y(s,t)$ as $\boldsymbol{Y}_{s,t}$ i.e. value at $s$-th row and $t$-th column of $\boldsymbol{Y}$. By $Y(,t)$ they mean vector $\boldsymbol{Y}_{\cdot,t}$, i.e. vector of all values of $s$ at column fixed to $t$ -- they say "take the whole $t$-th column". So by $T$- or $S$-vector they mean "vector of all $t$'s" or of all $s$'s for some fixed value of $s$ or $t$.
