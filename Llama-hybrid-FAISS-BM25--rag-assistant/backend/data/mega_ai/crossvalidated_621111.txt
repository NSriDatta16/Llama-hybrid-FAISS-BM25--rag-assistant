Comparison of 1 outcome between 2 groups

I have a question about logistic regression. I have 2 groups in my database defined by a variable named "ttt". I want to compare one variable named "w36_oxy" between the 2 groups, with an adjustment with 2 variables "pre_ste" and "g_age". I tried this but I am not sure it is the result I want : summary(glm(as.factor(w36_oxy) ~ ttt + g_age + pre_ste, data=data_dysplasie2, family=binomial)) I think the solution might be but I'm not sure : summary(glm(as.factor(ttt) ~ w36_oxy + g_age + pre_ste, data=data_dysplasie2, family=binomial))
