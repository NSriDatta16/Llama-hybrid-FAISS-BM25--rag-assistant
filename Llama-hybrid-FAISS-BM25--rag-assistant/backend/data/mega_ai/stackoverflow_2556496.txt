Imagine the media server as an S3 bucket, would probably make your life easier to understand what should happen where. Install lighthttpd on the media server and serve the images directly from there. For storage, process the image on the main server, upload the image to the media server, store all the info related to the image in the database, so that when you want to serve it, you already have all the info available and you assume for all the right reasons that the image is still there :) As for the way you want to do it, i think it would cause a serious bottleneck and raise alot of network traffic, you are kind of trying to implement "messages" found in distributed systems and we all know the pitfalls involved there. I say keep it simple!
