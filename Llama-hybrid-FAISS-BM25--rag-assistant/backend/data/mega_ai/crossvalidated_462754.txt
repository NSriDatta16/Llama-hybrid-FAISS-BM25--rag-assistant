The value $0.80$ is such a high correlation that it’s basically impossible to get that kind of value from independent variables. You can (more or less) quantify this unlikeliness with a p-value, but you know going into the test that you’re going to reject a null hypothesis of zero correlation. Do note that correlation is not necessary for dependence, as a post on Data Science discusses: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/72824/what-is-the-meaning-of-a-quadratic-relation-when-r-0/72826#72826 .
