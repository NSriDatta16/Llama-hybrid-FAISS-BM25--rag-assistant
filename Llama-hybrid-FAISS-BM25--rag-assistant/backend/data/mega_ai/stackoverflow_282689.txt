You can't do this with the strict pragma enabled, and the strict pragma should usually always be enabled. You can do it with the pragma off though, take a look at this one liner: perl -le 'my $vname = "phone"; ${ $vname } = "555-1234"; print $phone' That will work, but this will not: perl -Mstrict -le 'my $vname = "phone"; ${ $vname } = "555-1234"; print $phone' "-Mstrict" tells it to "use strict". It is almost always better to use a hash for something like this, which is about the same as an associative array in PHP.
