An n-bit Maximal Period Linear Shift Feedback Register (LFSR) will cycle through all of its (2^n -1) internal states before an internal state is repeated. A LFSR is a Maximal Period LFSR if and only if the polynomial formed from a tap sequence plus 1 is a primitive polynomial mod 2. Thus, an n-bit Maximal Period LFSR will provide you with a sequence of (2^n - 1) unique random numbers, each one of them is n-bit long. A LFSR is very elegant.
