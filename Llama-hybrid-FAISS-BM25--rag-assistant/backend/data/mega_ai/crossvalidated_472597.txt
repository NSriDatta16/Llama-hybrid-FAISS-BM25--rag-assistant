Why people prefer neural network to kernel methods?

I am learning Kernel methods. Kernel methods are less a "black box" than neural networks. Nowadays, it seems neural networks gain more popularity and show more powerful in various applications, such as image, RL. Can anyone give some ideas or literature on the advantage of the networks over kernel? Or are there any deficits of kernel methods? I guess the easy implementation and intuitive of the network may be an advantage.
