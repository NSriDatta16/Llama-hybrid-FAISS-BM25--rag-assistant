Yes, if you cast to LinkedList : ((LinkedList) col).addFirst(..) But this is discouraged, because you don't always know the concrete type of the collection. You can check with instanceof , but that is not good object oriented code. If you really require a LinkedList , require a LinkedList (rather than Collection )
