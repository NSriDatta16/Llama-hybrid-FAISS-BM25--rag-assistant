Have you looked into Tesseract (and its Python wrapper/interface: pytesseract )? I don't guarantee that it will solve your problems entirely, but it offers bounding box and OCR features. On this Tesseract site it lists possible page segmentation modes that you could play around with. There is also this page that provides some quality improvement suggestions. There are many questions/answers on Stack Overflow about specific usage cases. In this answer, for example, there is a recommendation to use OSM mode to detect multiple columns. And there is this SO answer that offers a way to break text into paragraphs.
