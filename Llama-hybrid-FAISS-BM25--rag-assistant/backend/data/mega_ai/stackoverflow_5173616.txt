JavaScript error only in IE8 compatability mode and IE7

I am getting an annoying error only in IE7 and IE8's compatibility mode. FireFox and other browsers work fine. The site is here: http://174.136.92.214/test/test.html Looking at the error and the code seems to show that something is wrong inside the SuperFish/jQuery code which seems surprising. Any help would be appreciated.
