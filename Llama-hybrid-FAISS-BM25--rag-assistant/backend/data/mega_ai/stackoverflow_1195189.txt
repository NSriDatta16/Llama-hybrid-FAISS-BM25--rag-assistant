You want to order by the "return value" of your custom function? Then the database server can't use an index for that. The score has to be calculated for each record in the table (that hasn't been excluded with a WHERE clause) and stored in some temporary storage/table. Then the order by is performed on that temporary table. So this easily can get slower than your union queries (depending on your union statements of course).
