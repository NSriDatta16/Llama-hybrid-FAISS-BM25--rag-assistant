From wikipedia : In the C programming language and its descendants, the term static variable has at least two specific and essentially unrelated meanings, each related to the semantics of C's static keyword: static local variables, which are scoped normally, but have static storage duration (as opposed to automatic local variables declared with the auto keyword) static global variables, which have the usual static storage duration, but are scoped to the file in which they are defined (as opposed to external variables declared with the extern keyword) So. The static variables you are declaring are scoped normally - their scope is still within their respective functions, and are not available outside of those functions. You can still return the pointers, but they don't really mean anything. Edit: Also from this page : Static locals in global functions can be thought of as global variables, because their value remains in memory for the life of the program. 1 The only difference is that they are only accessible (i.e., scoped) to one function.
