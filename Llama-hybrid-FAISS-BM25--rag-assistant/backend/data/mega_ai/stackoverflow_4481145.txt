MovieClips do not keep their class if childed to a movieclip that's added dynamically

I have a holder movieclip, its base class is foo. package { import flash.display.MovieClip; public class Foo extends MovieClip { public function Foo() { trace("foo"); } } } Within foo are a number of other movieclips, with a base class of bar. package { import flash.display.MovieClip; public class Bar extends MovieClip { public function Bar() { trace("bar"); } } } I put a trace in the constructor of bar so I can tell if it's being loaded properly, and when I drag out foo onto the scene and run the clip, all the little bars within it fire off correctly. However, when I add it to the scene dynamically, such as like this in the Main class: package { import flash.display.MovieClip; public class Main extends MovieClip { public function Main() { this.addChild(new Foo()); } } } Suddenly, all the little bar movieclips within foo revert to regular old movieclips and don't fire. Is there any way to fix this?
