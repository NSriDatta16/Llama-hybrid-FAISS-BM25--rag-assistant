in theory, this seems like a good idea. however, i could see some situations where you might not want to do this. for instance, some of the xml related technologies have some non-trivial setup costs (like setting up DocumentBuilders and Transformers). if you are doing a lot of that in your webapp, it may make sense to cache these instances in ThreadLocals (as the utilities are generally not thread-safe). in this case, you probably don't want to clean these between requests.
