The controller codes are not very elegant. You should be following everything codescape has said here. However a simple fix to problem would be the following: Instead of returning a new PersonController() or new EventController(), you can return a bean instance of the same which have been injected into the BaseController(). This will return a proxy object on which the @Transactional can be intercepted by spring. However, as I said the controllers defined by are not good codes.
