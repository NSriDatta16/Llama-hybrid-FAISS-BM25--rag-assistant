Implementing Pearson Correlation as custom objective in XGBoost

I want to try if using Pearson Correlation as custom objective in the XGBoost R package gives me better results than the MSE. The idea was already referenced here and here , and that it might or might not be helpful when modelling on a highly noisy output. What would the custom objective function look like for correlation, and especially what would the gradient and hessian be?
