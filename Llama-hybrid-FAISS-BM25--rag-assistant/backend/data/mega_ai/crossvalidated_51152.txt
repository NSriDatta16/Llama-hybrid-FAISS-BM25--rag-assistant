fastbw with rule="p" in R's rms package: why do results depend on number of covariates?

I've been trying to use the fastbw function from the rms package in R to perform logistic regression with backward selection, with p-values as exclusion criterion (I am well aware of the arguments against using p-values for this as opposed to e.g. AIC). However, the results are not in agreement with what I would get if I perform the backward selection manually, as fastbw often drops more factors in comparison. The results also seem to depend on the number of factors considered, even with the option type="individual". I created some simple example data in order to prove my point, which give the following result: > fastbw(lrm(y~x1+x2+x3+x4),rule="p",type="individual") Deleted Chi-Sq d.f. P Residual d.f. P AIC x3 0.37 1 0.5412 0.37 1 0.5412 -1.63 x1 1.82 1 0.1771 2.20 2 0.3336 -1.80 x4 2.58 1 0.1082 4.78 3 0.1889 -1.22 x2 3.56 1 0.0591 8.34 4 0.0799 0.34 [...] Factors in Final Model None I.e., x2 is dropped as the last of the factors considered, resulting in a model without factors. However, if I consider x2 only, I get the following result. > fastbw(lrm(y~x2),rule="p",type="individual") No Factors Deleted Factors in Final Model [1] x2 The same is true if I do the backward selection manually, as x2 considered separately has a p-value of 0.045. What might cause this behavior? Since x2 is the last remaining variable in the backward selection, the results shouldn't depend on associations with other model covariates.
