Unfortunally, there are not much info on that... What I did myself, was study regular books about interface, or user interaction. But you need to remember something: Altough the player should not ever be "challenged" by the interface, the interface must NOT make the challenge of of the game easier. Several Game Design books, has some chapters dedicated to interface (I know that this is too little, but is the best we have for now). I can recommend those: Francois Dominic Laramee, Game Design Perspectives. Charles River Media, 2002. ISBN 1584500905. Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams, Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams on Game Design. "Creating the User Experience" and each of the genre-specific chapters: New Riders, 2003. ISBN 1592730019. Editor: Marc Saltzman, Game Design: Secrets of the Sages. "Chapter 12, The All-Important User Interface (UI) and Game Control," and "Chapter 15: Testing." 2 ed. Bradygames, USA, 2000. ISBN 1566869870 Some generic user interface books: Wilbert O. Galitz, The Essential Guide to User Interface Design. 2 ed. Wiley 2002. ISBN 0471084646. Doug A. Bowman, Ernst Kruijff, Joseph J. LaViola, Ivan Poupyrev. 3D User Interfaces: Theory and Practice. Addison-Wesley Professional, 2004. ISBN 0201758679. Game Development Essentials: Game Interface Design: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1418016209/acmorg-20 Cool links: David Krieger, "Designing a Good Interface." http://www.gamespy.com/articles/491/491801p1.html Zhan Ye. "Designing User Interfaces for Games" http://www.ye-brothers.com/documents/gameui.pdf Note: I did not read all those stuff completly, I used parts of them to study at university.... Hum... I think that this is it.
