To all Repondents, I tried to make it clear that I was not interested in measuring an elapsed time yet most of the responses pertained to exactly that. Apparently I did not adequately convey my point so I'll give it another try. I want to create an events that occurs 100,000 times in a time period of 1 second with a CPU cost of approximately 12%. The program that I referenced, Mach 3, generates a frequency of 108,000 when the user had selected 100,000, but the frequency is very stable. I mention that to illustrate that the accuracy of the actually time interval is not critical just as long as the error in the interval time is consistent. I will mention again that Mach 3 operates with a CPU cost of around 12%. The 108,000 frequency is emitted on a parallel port pin where it can be verified with a scope, which I have done. Other respondents somewhat understood what I wanted to accomplish but their example was to measure the number of Loops that could occur in a time period of 1 Second while admitting that the CPU cost would be unacceptable. The general consensus was that what I'm wanting to do is not possible. For those that align with that opinion I would encourage you to Google Mach 3 CNC , download a free copy of the program and then install it. Run the program, use the tabs to navigate to the diagnostics page you will be able to see for yourself that it is in fact possible. The program will initially open operating at the default frequency of 25kHz. The frequency can be changed by opening the menu selection 'Config' / 'Ports and Pins' / followed by selecting the new frequency and reopening the program. Forums like this have a large number of post pertaining to this subject matter and the responses are, for the better part, the same as what I received. I have provided an example that clearly shows that it is POSSIBLE so let's figure out how Mach 3 is accomplishing this task. C4C
