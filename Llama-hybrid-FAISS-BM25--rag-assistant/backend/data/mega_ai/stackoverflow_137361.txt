What should I do to keep a tiny Open Source project active and sustainable?

A couple of months ago I've coded a tiny tool that we needed at work for a specific task, and I've decided to share it on CodePlex. It's written in C# and honestly it's not big deal but since it's the first project I've ever built from scratch in that language and with the goal of opening it from the very beginning, one ends getting sort of emotionally attached to it, I mean you'd wish that the people will actually participate, be it criticism, bug reporting, or what have you. So my question is, what can I do to actually encourage participation, stimulate curiosity or just recieve more feedback about it? By the way this is the project I'm talking about: http://www.codeplex.com/winxmlcook/
