1. The simplest idea would be to copy the tags several times with different orderings, to make the data (sort of) invariant to permuting tags. In computer vision people do something similar to achieve translation invariance. You could also use node2vec if you have a meaningful graph structure on your tags (for example a graph where the two tags are adjacent if at least N documents are tagged with both of them). 2. As mentioned in comments, it makes more sense to average these word vectors. Also, maybe this article can help.
