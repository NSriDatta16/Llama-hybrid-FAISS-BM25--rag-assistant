Time Series Forecasting in R

I have a dataset composed by: Date , Cash , NumberOfAccountsperMonth . The frequency of the data is monthly. I'd like to forecast Cash for the next 6 months with R, and so far I don't know which method is the best to go with. On one hand, I just create a TimeSeries for Cash with the ts() formula, then proceed with the auto.arima() formula and get a forecast from ARIMA(0,1,1)(1,0,0)[12] since data has seasonality and trend. On the other hand, I know that NumberofAccounts does influence Cash , so I've built a linear regression model for my time series with the tslm() formula and then I proceeded with the forecast. The problem is that I'm getting very different results. Could anyone tell me which way to go? Here's my code and the results tsIncassi TS Regression code: fit.tsreg |t|) (Intercept) -3.376e+05 3.752e+04 -8.998 1.16e-14 *** NumberAccou 4.482e-01 6.249e-02 7.171 1.12e-10 *** trend 7.786e+03 2.682e+02 29.026 Here you can see the accuracy() results for both procedures accuracy(fcast.arima) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set 1886.528 48855.13 32553.28 -36.81754 55.17642 0.4766057 0.1147092 accuracy(fcast.tsreg) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set 3.183231e-12 48007.12 37345.96 10.32393 130.0177 0.5467744 0.07845181 If the ARIMA forecast seems to be more accurate, why is that? Since I taking in consideration an independent variable that I know for sure that influences my dependent variable, shouldn't the forecast on the regression be more accurate?
