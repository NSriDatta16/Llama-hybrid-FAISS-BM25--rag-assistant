In principle, this is correct. One can quibble about the phrasing, because it might sound as if increasing the percentage of females by one percentage point within a study can be expected to lead to an increase in the odds by 3%, while the results only show that when comparing studies that differ from each other by one percentage point, the one with the higher percentage is expected to have a 3% higher odds on average. This might sound like the same thing, but I am trying to draw a distinction here between an association that might exist within a study versus the cross-sectional relationship you actually find. In other words, studies that differ in terms of the percentage of females might also differ in many other ways, so it is unknown whether the 3% higher odds is really due to the difference in the percentage of females. As was also mentioned in the comments to your previous question, finding such an association does NOT imply that females have a higher probability (or odds) of an asymptomatic disease than males. That would be drawing an inference about individuals from an association found at the study level. Some call this the ecological fallacy, but to not anger ecologists, I have been advised to call it something different, like the aggregation fallacy or the population fallacy and I am happy to oblige. Finally, exponentiation is a non-linear transformation. Therefore, strictly speaking, the 1.03 is not an estimate of the average odds (since $f(E[x]) \ne E[f(x)]$ for a non-linear transformation $f()$ ), but an estimate of the median odds (since $f(\mbox{Median}[x]) = \mbox{Median}[f(x)]$ ). This is a distinction that is almost always ignored in practice. If you really want an estimate of the average odds, then you can use a different type of transformation. So, instead of using predict(m3, newmods = 1, intercept = FALSE, transf=exp, digits=2) (which is what you did), you can use predict(m3, newmods = 1, intercept = FALSE, transf=transf.exp.int, targs=list(tau2=m3$tau2), digits=2) which gives a value of 1.06, and hence a 6% higher odds on average. The latter is in essence just round(exp(coef(m3)[2] + m3$tau2/2), digits=2) , which gives you the mean of a log-normal distribution .
