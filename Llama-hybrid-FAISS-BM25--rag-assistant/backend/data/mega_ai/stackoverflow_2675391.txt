There is no functional difference; properties are simply pairs of get and set methods from a behavior perspective. However , properties are, in general, intended to be lightweight. If your property's getter or setter are performing substantial calculations, then moving them to a method is generally encouraged. There are obvious exceptions to this (namely lazy loading in the ORM realm, where a get could trigger a database call).
