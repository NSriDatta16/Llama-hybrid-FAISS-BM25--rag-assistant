Does Twitter support the 2-legged oAuth protocol?

The oAuth protocol comes in two flavors, 3-legged and 2-legged protocols. The 3-legged one is about delegating user access rights to an application and is the one that gets the most attention on the web. The 2-legged version is used to authenticate an application against a service provider (Twitter in my case) with no specific user involved. In my application I need read only access to publicly available information, but at higher rate than the one available to unauthenticated request. There is no need for me to authenticate as a specific Twitter user. Does Twitter support the 2-legged version of oAuth? Boaz PS. The whitelisting alternative is an overkill for me and I rather not wait for the approval process.
