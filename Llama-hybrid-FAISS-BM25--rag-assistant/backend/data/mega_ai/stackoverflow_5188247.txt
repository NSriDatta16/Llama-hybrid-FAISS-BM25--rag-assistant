How different installs of the same version of Internet Explorer 7 produce different render results

Situation: Client is a government organization who is using Internet Explorer v7.0.5730.13. On the developer side there is same version of Internet Explorer and the same OS. Client cannot install any other browser or change any settings in IE. Question: What other variables are there which could influence this kind of odd render behavior?
