parametric survival regression and discrete time survival regression

I would greatly appreciate if you could let me know how to choose among different parametric distributions including gama, Weibull, lognormal, loglogistic and etc for panel (time series cross sectional data) survival analysis or discrete time survival analysis in STATA 14. I read these materials but they are about continuous time survival analysis: http://spia.uga.edu/faculty_pages/rbakker/pols8501/OxfordTwoNotes.pdf Then, I tried to calculate LR test, which is explained on page 22 of the second note, in order to calculate p_value . However, I am not sure or I don't know what to do. Survival Distribution AIC BIC Log-Likelihood df Exponential-Proportional Hazard: 433.663 471.1031 -209.83151 7 Exponential-Accelerated Failure Time: 433.663 471.1031 -209.83151 7 Lognormal-Proportional Hazard: 377.6502 420.4389 -180.82508 8 Loglogistic-Proportional Hazard: 377.874 420.6627 -180.93701 8 Gama-Proportional Hazard: cannot compute an improvement -- discontinuous region encountered Weibull-Proportional Hazard: cannot compute an improvement -- discontinuous region encountered Weibull-Accelerated Failure Time: 205.8869 248.6756 -94.943472 8 Besides, I just could test PH assumption for cox model, which is not a kind of panel data. What's more, I couldn't do what is instructed on pages 24 and 25 of Oxford second note. In fact, when I use the "predict" command, it gives me an array of continuous values even though my dependent variable is discrete. My data set is as follows: ID represents different companies in my sample. Event shows that if the company went bankrupt or not. X1 to X5 are my independent variables.
