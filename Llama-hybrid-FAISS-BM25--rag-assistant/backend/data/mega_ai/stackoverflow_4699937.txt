The problem is file fragmentation. Physical memory (RAM) has nothing to do with anything here. In a virtual memory system, 'memory' is allocated from the file system. Physical memory is just an optimization to speed access to memory. When you request a memory-mapped file with write access, the system must have a file with contiguous pages free. The system swap file is often fragmented. If your disk drive is nicely defragmented, you should be able to create a large memory-mapped file using a file of your choice (not the system page file). So if you really have to have a 2GB memory-mapped file, you need to create one on the drive at installation. This shifts the problem of creating a contiguous 2GB file to installation, but once created, you should be ok.
