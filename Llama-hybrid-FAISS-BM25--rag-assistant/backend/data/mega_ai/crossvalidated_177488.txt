Proof of the Derivation of the marginal and conditional Gaussian

Given a marginal Gaussian distribution for x and a conditional Gaussian distribution for y given x in the form $$p(x) = N(x|\mu, \Lambda^{-1})$$ $$p(y|x) = N(y|Ax + b, L^{-1})$$ the marginal distribution of y and the conditional distribution of x given y are given by $$p(y) = N(y|A\mu +b, L^{-1} + A\Lambda^{-1}A^T)$$ $$p(x|y) = N(x|\Sigma{A^TL(y-b) + \Lambda \mu}, \Sigma)$$ where $\Sigma = (\Lambda + A^TLA)^{-1}$. This is taken from the textbook Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. The textbook has a proof but it is very brief and I could not fully understand the proof. Does anyone have a simple and detailed proof that can help me understand this fact? Thanks.
