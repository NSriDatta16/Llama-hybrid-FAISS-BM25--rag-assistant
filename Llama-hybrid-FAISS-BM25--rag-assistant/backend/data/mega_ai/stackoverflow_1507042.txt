a. I am currently using my mainLogger to log events from all classes of my app. Is that a good practice? Or should i use X logger instances for X classes? It is generally a better idea to create and use multiple Logger. This gives you (or someone coming later) finer control over logging levels, etc via the logging configuration. But I wouldn't necessarily recommend creating a (static) Logger instance in every class. b. What can I do to be able to log errors already caught in my imports? There is very little that you can do about this ... except overhaul the imported codebase to improve its internal error reporting and logging. The flip side is that if you are creating library code that might be reused elsewhere you should pay attention to getting the error reporting and logging right. In particular, clean out inappropriate use System.err , printStackTrace() , etcetera. It is also a good idea to use a logging abstraction layer so that you don't cause problems for people integrating your library.
