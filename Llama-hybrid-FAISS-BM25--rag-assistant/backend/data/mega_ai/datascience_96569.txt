Ideally you should have the historical data for your model to gain trust. However, since you don't have data you should atleast add the tenant/region feature to your model and train again. Also keep on retraining the model, as and when failures are detected in prediction. If different tenant users show very different behaviour then you should have different models for different tenants, as this is linear regression. Being this regression model and not deep learning, you need to do this feature engineering manually.
