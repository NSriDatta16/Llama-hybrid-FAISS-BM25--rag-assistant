There must be a more elegant way to write this, so feel free to suggest improvements. The point is that you have to check first that project is not nil before you can do something with project.role . def team_member?(project_id, current_user) project = current_user.permissions.find_by_project_id(project_id) if !project.nil? && !project.role.nil? # your code else # return false? end end
