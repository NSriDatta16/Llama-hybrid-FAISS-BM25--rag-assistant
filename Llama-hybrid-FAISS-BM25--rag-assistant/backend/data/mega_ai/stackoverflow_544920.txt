We use code coverage to verify that we aren't missing big parts in our testing efforts. Once a milestone or so we run a full coverage report and spend a few days analyzing the results, adding test coverage for areas we missed. We don't run it every build because I don't know that we would analyze it on a regular enough basis to justify that. We analyze the reports for large blocks of unhit code. We've found this to be the most efficient use. In the past we would try to hit a particular code coverage target but after some point, the returns become very diminishing. Instead, it's better to use code coverage as a tool to make sure you didn't forget anything.
