Result from scaled chi-square difference test and AIC/BIC are inconsistent for comparison of nested models

I am trying to compare the fit of two nested multiple-group path analysis models (Models A & B). Model A is the model that does not have any equality constraints across genders (i.e., path coefficients and correlations are freely estimated separately for males and females). Model B differs from Model A only by placing equality constraints for genders for the path coefficients and correlations. I am using Mplus with the MLR estimator. So, to compare these nested models, I conducted scaled chi-square difference testing using the models' loglikelihood values. The result from that test is statistically significant, which suggests the unconstrained model fits better than the constrained model. (Chi-square = 33.79, df = 21, p I calculated cd to be 1.015 and TRd to be 33.78 based on the following from the two models: Model A Number of Free Parameters 70 Loglikelihood H0 Value -15820.276 H0 Scaling Correction Factor 1.0020 for MLR H1 Value -15820.276 H1 Scaling Correction Factor 1.0020 for MLR Information Criteria Akaike (AIC) 31780.551 Bayesian (BIC) 32131.462 Sample-Size Adjusted BIC 31909.125 (n* = (n + 2) / 24) Model B Number of Free Parameters 49 Loglikelihood H0 Value -15837.415 H0 Scaling Correction Factor 0.9966 for MLR H1 Value -15820.276 H1 Scaling Correction Factor 1.0019 for MLR Information Criteria Akaike (AIC) 31772.830 Bayesian (BIC) 32018.468 Sample-Size Adjusted BIC 31862.831 (n* = (n + 2) / 24) Although the scaled chi-square difference test says the unconstrained model fits better, the values for AIC, BIC, and sample-size adjusted BIC from the constrained model are smaller compared to their values for the unconstrained model, respectively. In summary, the result (and following decision) using the scaled chi-square difference test is inconsistent with the result (and following decision) using AIC, BIC, and sample-size adjusted BIC. Can someone please explain why the scaled chi-square difference test favors the model with more parameters (i.e., Model A) while the AIC, BIC, and Sample-Size adjusted BIC favor the model with fewer parameters (i.e., Model B)? Which fit statistic(s) should I rely on and report in this situation? Is it misplaced to use AIC, BIC, and sample-size adjusted BIC for nested multiple-group models when the goal is to freely estimate many more parameters in one model compared to the other model? Is the penalty correction for AIC, BIC, and sample-size BIC in this context too harsh? Which model is better to use (i.e., Model A based on the statistical test or Model B based on parsimony)? Thank you and Regards, Aaron
