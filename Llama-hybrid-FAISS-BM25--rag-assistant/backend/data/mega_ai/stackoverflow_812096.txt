Use of source control would be first on my list as very few schools need or rely on this. Really sit down and explain how to use the product you use and why it is necessary. Then for at least the first month, make sure to frequently check to make sure they are using it. Next would be basic database skills. I've yet to see anyone come out of school really understanding how to query a database. Third would be an introduction to your database and code base, explaining how things are done and organized and why. Fourth, testing procedures and policies including how to do a code review, unit testing, QA etc. Tesing is not something that most students need to worry about either. Fifth, assign a mentor if at all possible, someone the new person can go to for advice, to ask questions about company basics. You probably need someone to give them the basics of professional behavior as well. What is acceptable in terms of dress, attendance, etc.
