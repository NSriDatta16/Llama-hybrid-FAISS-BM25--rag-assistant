It's not always the case that the mean is more relevant than the mode. That is part of the value of representing the full distribution within the Bayesian approach, if you have the full distribution you can extract whatever statistical information is required. The average of the distribution, will often be useful for describing the net (summed or averaged) result of multiple trials due to the central limit theorem; which indicates that the average of a large number of trials converges to the mean of the underlying distribution. However, in other cases, knowing the mode, or a description of the distribution near the mode, can also be useful, e.g. using the method of steepest descent approximation.
