Replacing the nonresponding units is indeed a common practice in survey statistics. (Mind you, the practice of survey statistics is about as remote from sampling books and classes as the practice of software development is from printf("Hello world!\n") programs.) Even though they seem like data cleaning procedures, the substitution procedures have to be a part of the design, as survey inference is with respect to randomness in who's in the sample, not with respect to the observed values (which is what frequentist statistics $x_i \sim \mbox{i.i.d.} f(x,\theta)$ teaches you). Some references include: Rubin and Zanutto, "Using Matched Substitutes" Chapter 26 in Groves et al (2002), Survey Nonresponse Nishimura's 2015 Ph.D. dissertation at Michigan , with additional references therein. The topic is more of an art than science; several other books I was honestly expecting to at least mention it ( Longford's Missing Data and SAE ; Kim and Shao's Methods for Handling Incomplete Data ; Handbook of Missing Data Methodology ) have zero coverage. My gut feeling is that substitution works best by combining design procedures with some sort of modeling of nonresponse propensities, but probably Nishimura's dissertation gives a better reasoned set of recommendations than my guts do.
