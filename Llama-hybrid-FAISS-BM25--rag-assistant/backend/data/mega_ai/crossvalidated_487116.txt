No, they aren't interchangeable. It may help you to read my answer to: What is the difference between linear regression on y with x and x with y? For an overview of the case with logistic regression, it might be worth reading my answer to: Relationship between regressing Y on X, and X on Y in logistic regression . In the linear regression case, the slopes will differ, but the p-value for the relationship will be the same when there is only one X and only one Y. However, when you include covariates, the $X\rightarrow Y$ and $Y\rightarrow X$ p-values won't be the same unless the covariates are all perfectly orthogonal to both X and Y. So which model should you use? The simplest way to think about this (although not generally correct) is to assume a causal relationship. That is, are you thinking that disease type causes mutation burden, or that the mutation burden causes the disease to be of a certain type? This is a useful heuristic, but note that your data appear to be observational (you didn't independently manipulate the disease types or the mutation burdens), so you aren't necessarily licensed to infer causality from these models. In a predictive context, you can say to yourself, 'in the future I will have data on but not on and I will want to use this model to make an educated guess about the true value of '. In which case, you use the future unknown as the response here. More generally, regression models assume the X values are fixed and known , and that the uncertainty about the relationship is due to sampling error in Y. Thus, ask yourself whether you think the noise in the system primarily lives in X or Y and put that as the response.
