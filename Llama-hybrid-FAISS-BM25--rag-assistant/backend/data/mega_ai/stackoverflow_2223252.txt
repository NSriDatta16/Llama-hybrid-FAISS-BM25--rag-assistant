you are looking for imo method chaining. Method chaining - why is it a good practice, or not? a dictionary object is a collection (uses list) of key value pairs that also implements a hash table for access. It is almost n(1) in terms of its access speed. public class Dictionary : IDictionary , ICollection >, IEnumerable >, IDictionary, ICollection, IEnumerable, ISerializable, IDeserializationCallback taken from ms-help://MS.VSCC.v90/MS.MSDNQTR.v90.en/fxref_mscorlib/html/589059d3-d7f8-e09b-705d-91a461971cc2.htm In fact the retrieval algorithm changes as it gets larger as a hash table is less efficient for small numbers of items. The linq approach would work also - no need to use anonymous types though moodyPerson p = new moodyPerson{mood = "good", name="jim"}; however this does not force you to set all the properties of a moody person and will use its empty constructor. you cant use intellisense if you want to access properties by strings. You would need to use reflection to implement this.
