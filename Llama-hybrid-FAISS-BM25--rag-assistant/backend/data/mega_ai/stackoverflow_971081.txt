Star schema is a logical data model for relational databases that fits the regular data warehousing needs; if the relational environment is given, a star or a snowflake schema will be a good design pattern, hard-wired in lots of DW design methodologies. There are however other than relational database engines too, and they can be used for efficient data warehousing. Multidimensional storage engines might be very fast for OLAP tasks (TM1 eg.); we can not apply star schema design in this case. Other examples requiring special logical models include XML databases or column-oriented databases (eg. the experimental C-store) ).
