This is a typical application for a quadtree . The quadtree facilitates lookup of the m points lying in your rectangle in O(log(n) + m), where n is the total number of points. Edit: Your approach using the map is not nearly as efficient. For randomly distributed points, it would have an O(sqrt(n)) average complexity, and O(n) worst-case.
