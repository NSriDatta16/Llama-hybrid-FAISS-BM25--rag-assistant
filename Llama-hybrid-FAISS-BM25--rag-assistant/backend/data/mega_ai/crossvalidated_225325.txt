statistics metrics or machine learning methods to quantify the relationship between a point and a group

There are several data groups: A1 = { A11, A12, A13, …, A1n} A2 = {A21, A22, A23, …, A2n} .. … … Am = {Am1, Am2, Am3, …, Amn} Here { Aij, i = 1:m} shares the same types of attribute j. I would like to quantify the “position” of Aij in the group of Ai. Naturally, I can use rank to measure it. For instance, A1j ranks as top one in group A1; A2j ranks as third in group A2; Amj ranks as third in group Am. Then I can say A1j seems abnormal in terms of its relationship with its group Aj. I would like to know are there any more systematic statistical/machine learning methods to handle this kind of scenario?
