Building a custom blogging system - design suggestions

I am going to build a very simple blogging system in PHP. It should be SEO optimized. I want to ask you some suggestions to get it right the first time. I have also some specific questions: 1) Do you think embedding the timestamp in the URL ( /2011/03/25/how-to-build-a-blog) has got any real benefit? 2) Where is the best place to insert social widgets (facebook like button and tweet button). 3) Is there any reliable way to notify your new post automatically to major services (Digg, Google, Technorati)? Thanks, Dan
