I am a little confused when I first read your question. I didn't figure out whether it's a multi-label or a multi-target problem. But after your explanation, I assume your goal is to predict multiple properties like homicide and robbery gave unemployment rate, avg assessment value, and some other features. As you mention, the neural network is not included in possible solutions. But actually, traditional machine learning methods like Support Machine Learning (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are suitable in this case. 'sklearn' is a very easily handled toolkit in Python for you to build such a model. There are tremendous tutorials you can find online to teach you how to train and fit the dataset. What I want to add and remind is that you need to modify their single-task model to multi-task model using MultiOutputClassifier, which can be imported by from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputClassifier . For further reference, just read the following official documents of sklearn. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html
