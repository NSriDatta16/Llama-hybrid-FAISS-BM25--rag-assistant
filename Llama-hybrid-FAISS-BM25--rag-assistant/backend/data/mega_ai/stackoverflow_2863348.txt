If it's the font I'm thinking of: I'm no lawyer & this isn't Copyright Overflow, but the font isn't free and the license seems pretty clear that @font-face embedding is not okay. In that case, either 1) buy the font and make images with it (if it's just for a logo / heading); or 2) tell the client that the font isn't suitable for web use and ask them to pick something more common (or at least legally embeddable) instead.
