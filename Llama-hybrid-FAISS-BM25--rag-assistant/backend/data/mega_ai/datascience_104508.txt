Shuffling should be false in time series models because otherwise, you will be training the model on patterns it does not yet have access to. At each timestep, the model should only be trained up to the point of data visibility. e.g. at timestep 10, model should only be trained with data from 0 to 10 without visibality of data from 11 to 40. Otherwise you will get great model results now but when you implement the model today (2021), you get poor actual performance because you dont get to train the model with future 2023 patterns/data.
