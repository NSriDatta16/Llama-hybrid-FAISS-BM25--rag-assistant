Domain-specific data science programs

I am looking for domain-specific data science programs (as a major, not a minor or specialization). I found programs in bio-statistics (and other disciplines in public health), MS in marketing analytics, MS in learning analytics and MS in urban informatics. Does anyone know any other domain-specific data science field of study?
