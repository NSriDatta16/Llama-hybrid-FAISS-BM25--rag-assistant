Try chi-square or enthropy based classification, i.e. anything non-linear. They are more robust, precise and humanly relevant than linear models (regressions or SVM). You can also clusterize your base of documents and/or features (words, terms, vectors). Another idea is to go through topic discovery so you can identify closely related in significance manner terms.
