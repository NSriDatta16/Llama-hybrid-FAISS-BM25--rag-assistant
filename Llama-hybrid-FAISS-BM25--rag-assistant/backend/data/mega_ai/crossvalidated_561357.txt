How to identify overfitting from LSTM plot, from the prediction on trained+unseen data

I am currently learning LSTM-RNN models and I have done some tests to see how they work. As in the most NN, overfitting and underfitting is a problem in ML. I have read articles such as this guy here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/learning-curves-for-diagnosing-machine-learning-model-performance/ this: https://towardsdatascience.com/learning-curve-to-identify-overfitting-underfitting-problems-133177f38df5 and this: Dealing with LSTM overfitting All of them are talking about detecting overfitting and underfitting using loss functions: train loss function and test/validation loss function. In papers around the google I see they are depicting plots of real datasets + prediction on trained datasets + prediction on unseen datasets. I haven't seen someone depicting loss functions. So, my question is how can I understand if a LSTM-RNN model works well and doesn't overfit/underfit from the plot of (real dataset + prediction on trained dataset + prediction on unseen dataset)?? Is it possible?
