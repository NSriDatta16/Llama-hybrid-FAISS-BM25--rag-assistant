How to sample from a joint probability distribution of two variables?

I want to randomly sample from a joint probability distribution characterized by two variables x and y . So, basically, I have the information of the joint PDF which has the dimension 100x50. As per my literature study, the only way to efficiently sample from such a distribution is by employing MCMC algorithms (correct me if I'm wrong). However, I do not know yet where to start from. My knowledge in statistics is quite limited and I have just started learning about sampling techniques. Perhaps, Metropolis-Hastings seems like a good starting point. Any leads on the same would be highly appreciated. Thanks. :)
