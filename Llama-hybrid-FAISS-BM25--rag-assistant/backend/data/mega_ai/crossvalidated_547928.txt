Suppose your prior distribution is that a coin may be biased so it has success probability $\theta$ near $1/3.$ Specifically, you consider that $\theta\sim\mathsf{Beta}(2,4),$ so that $E(\theta)=1/3,$ $P(\theta $P(0.0527 and $\theta$ has density function $f(\theta) = K\theta^{2-1}(1-\theta)^{4-1},$ where $K$ is the norming constant. [Computations in R.] pbeta(.5, 2,4) [1] 0.8125 qbeta(c(.025,.975),2,4) [1] 0.05274495 0.71641794 Then you are allowed to toss the coin $n = 30$ times, obtaining $x = 9$ heads. Thus, your likelihood function is $g(x|\theta) \propto \theta^9(1-\theta)^{21},$ where the symbol $\propto$ indicates that the norming constant has been omitted. Finally, by Bayes' Theorem, the posterior distribution is $$g(\theta|x) \propto f(\theta)\times g(x|\theta)\\ \propto \theta^{2-1}(1-\theta)^{4-1} \times \theta^9(1-\theta)^{21}\\ \propto \theta^{11-1}(1-\theta)^{25-1}.$$ where we recognize the last line as the kernel (density without norming constant) of $\mathsf{Beta}(11,25).$ Thus the posterior mean of $\theta$ is $E(\theta|x)=11/36= 0.3056,$ slightly smaller than the prior $E(\theta) = 0.333$ because you have information from your 30 tosses. Also, a 95% posterior credible interval for $\theta$ is $(0.169, 0.463).$ qbeta(c(.025,.975),11,25) [1] 0.1685172 0.4630446 The posterior distribution has information from your initial hunch that the coin may be biased towards Tails and also the results of your thirty-toss experiment with the coin. The interpretation of this Bayesian interval estimate differs from the 'long run' interpretation of a frequentist confidence interval. Because the prior and likelihood both describe the particular coin at hand, we can say that the interval $(0.169, 0.463)$ also applies to the coin at hand. In particular we are pretty sure the coin is not fair.
