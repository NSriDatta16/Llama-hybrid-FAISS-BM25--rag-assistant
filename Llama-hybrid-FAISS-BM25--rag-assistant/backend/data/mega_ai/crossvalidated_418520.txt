Well, there are many techniques aimed at solving few-shot learning problems, especially in the realm of computer vision. CNNs, by themselves, are not designed to solve such problems. However, their design is suitable to be used in techniques aimed at solving few-shot learning problems. For example, they can be used as part of an unsupervised model that learns good representations of the data, i.e, pre-training as you stated. Hopefully the model learns how to represent objects somewhat generally, and it doesn't just learn how to represent objects of very similar classes to those seen in the data. Now, in some ways, pre-training can be considered meta-learning. And in the realm of meta-learning, a very promising avenue for the few-shot learning problem is model agnostic meta-learning. To me, the performance of MAML techniques (among many others) show that there may not be that much missing from solving one-shot and few-shot learning problems to begin with, at least when it comes to computer vision. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf
