Declaritive authorization is completely different thing from how you organize your admin situation. These are not different alternatives for the same problem. How you authorize actions or perform access control has nothing to do with whether your admin interface uses nested controllers and a different interface or uses the same interface as regular users with a few more buttons. That said I'll take a stab at what I think you want to ask: Should your admin interface be the same as your user interface but with a few more buttons for admin actions? My answer would be no even for the simplest of sites. Imagine having to clean spam from each and every post on your blog by having to visit each and every post. Now imagine if you had a table of comments by date. Which would you prefer? Now if you decide your admins deserve a custom interface that suits their needs then you need to ask if it should be nested.
