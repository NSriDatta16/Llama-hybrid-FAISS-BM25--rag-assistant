You can use the setBoost method to set the "boost" for a particular document in the index at index time. Since the default boost value is 1.0, setting a value less than 1.0 will make the document "less relevant" in search results. By tying the boost value of a document to its age (lower boost the older the document gets), you can make newer content seem more relevant in search results. Note in the documentation for setBoost that the boost value set at indexing time is not available for retrieved documents (boost works, you just can't read the value back at retrieval time to see if you applied the correct value at index time).
