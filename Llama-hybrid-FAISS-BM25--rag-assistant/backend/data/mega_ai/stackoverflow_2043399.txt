Visual Studio Resource Generation - Custom Tool Namespace

I have a C# class library that contains several resources files organized in folders. Since I want the generated classes to be all in the same namespace I'm setting the CustomToolNamespace property of each resource file. However I discovered through Reflector that although the classes are all being generated in the same namespace the path to the embedded resources contains the directory name in which the resource file is placed. For example in a project where FolderCustomNamespaceRes.resx is placed inside a directory named Folder . removed dead ImageShack link And where CustomToolNamespace for FolderCustomNamespaceRes.resx is set to PublicResourcesTest, Reflector shows that the path to the embedded resource assembly is PublicResourcesTest. Folder .FolderCustomNamespaceRes.resources removed dead ImageShack link Is this a bug or am I missing something?
