Clustering On Labelled Dataset

I've seen posts discussing clustering on labelled datasets. Below is an approach I'm considering. IN short, I would be clustering "base data" vs. "XAI-calculated" data to see how the XAI-calculated data discriminates better. Do the steps below make sense? Note: raw dataset is labelled, i.e., includes a binary target outcome variable Apply predictive machine learning model, e.g., random forest, XGBoost, or some other ensemble algorithm Apply PCA (principal component analysis) - on model or raw data? - to determine top features for clustering later Calculate an XAI (explainable AI) metric on predictive model Cluster (k-means) the XAI metrics - is this OK even though the raw dataset is labelled ? Cluster the raw data values from the PCA step #2 above Compare the clustering results between #4, #5 through clustering metrics (completeness, homogeneity, etc) Apply a statistical inference test like t-test to see whether differences are significant between XAI-generated results vs. base data results - this part is a bit foggy to me , not sure if it can be done here? Thanks for any tips!
