Just don't use checked exceptions. The example you showed is one of the reasons checked exceptions are bad. The main reason though is that the user of your cupcake reader will have to handle your exception regardless of whether he is interested in it or not. So instead of: Value value = reader.read(); You are forcing him to do this: Value value = null; try { value = reader.read(); } catch (Exception e) { // now what?? } value.doSomething(); // potential NPE here Think which one is better, more readable and less error prone and just stop using checked exceptions. EDIT: I am surprised with the negative rating. Are there people who still think that checked exceptions are great? If so here are some references why you shouldn't use checked exceptions: No modern framework uses checked exceptions (Spring, EJB3 etc) Article with code examples here StackOverflow topic Effective Java (sections 58 and 59) - here
