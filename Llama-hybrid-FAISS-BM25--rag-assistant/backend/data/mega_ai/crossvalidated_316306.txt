Ridge regression can be calculated via ordinary least squares (OLS) calculated with the data matrix $X$ extended with some surrogate data, taken as corresponding to the surrogate observations $Y_0=0$. Write the model, extended with the surrogate data, as $$ \begin{pmatrix} Y \\ Y_0=0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} X\beta \\ X_0 \beta \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} \epsilon \\ \epsilon_0 \end{pmatrix} $$ Using this surrogate formulation, we can calculate the USUAL OLS estimator as $$ ( X^TX + X_0^T X_0)^{-1} (X^T Y + X_0^T 0) = (X^T X + X_0^T X_0)^{-1}X^TY $$ and comparing that with your expression for the ridge estimator, shows that you need to solve $$ \Gamma = X_0^T X_0 $$ for $X_0$, any matrix square root will do, for instance the Cholesky decomposition. Then you can use the usual formulas for leverage with the extended data matrix $$ \begin{pmatrix} X \\ X_0 \end{pmatrix} $$ which is an $(n+p)\times p$-matrix, so the $n$ first leverage values correspond to the data. As a bonus you get, from the $p$ last leverage values, leverage information on the surrogate data, so you get information on how much influence there is from the surrogate data. You ask also about cluster robust versions. I don't know about those, but guess the same approach can be used.
