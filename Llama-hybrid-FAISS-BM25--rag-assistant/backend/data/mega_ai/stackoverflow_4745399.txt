Sharepoint 2007 to use Sql Server database, Pros and Cons

Our IT manager is asking my help on deciding on which would be the best to save the data. Is it in sharepoint or sql server. On my side I don't know much about saving data on sharepoint server, how does it work, how fast, how secured, etc. I even have a doubt if sharepoint is capable of complex database design. As far as I know, sharepoint is not a database server that's why I have this doubts. So obviously I would say Sql Server would be my prefered storage and also because Sql server is known to me for a long time already. Considering my 3 weeks exposure on sharepoint vs. 7 years on Sql Server. I don't have the enough experience to witness the strength of Sharepoint for me to decide on what to do. So to be fair on sharepoint I would like to ask you guys out there who are more experienced on this. My questions: 1.) Does sharepoint have the ability to store data? 2.) If sharepoint can store data, what are the pros and cons? 3.) Can it cover a complex design such as relational database design like sql server does? 4.) If you where to develop a sharepoint project, would you choose sql server as the backend? Thanks in advance!
