tr, td does not get mapped to HtmlGenericControl but rather to HtmlTableRow and HtmlTableCell . I would prefer a cast to base control - HtmlControl . In short, change below code fragment as shown: ArrowAll = e.Item.FindControl("AllArrow") as HtmlControl; TextAll = e.Item.FindControl("AllText") as HtmlControl;
