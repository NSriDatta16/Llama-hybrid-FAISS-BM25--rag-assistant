Classify big changes in target variable

I am using a CNN to predict large changes in my target variable X. I am classifying several "set-up" states visually from my images. I am only interested in big changes, or maybe no change. So, I can classify in 3 ways: x is future period absolute change in X Label BigChange when x > A%. Label Flat when x Label BigChange when x > A%. Label Flat when x Label BigChange when x > A%. Label Flat when x B && x Which of these approaches is likely to give me the best predictive accuracy for BigChange? EDIT 1: Additional clarification Input data is a set of images (60x60) with connection to Target variable (Float) X. x is the delta between X values, and a big value might be 2-3% change. I am interested when the next x > some A (maybe 2%) i.e. there is a BigChange, but if x 0.25% but So, I am asking whether I should just classify and train on images that I have previously labelled BigChange or Flat. BUT this means when I run model on new data it will received lots of images that represent changes in x that are NOT Big or Flat. Is this problematic? Should I label things I am not interested in aswell for completeness?
