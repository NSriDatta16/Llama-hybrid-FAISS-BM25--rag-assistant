We found that the best solution for dependency management and packaging is to use Maven with the Assembly plugin. This provides a very elegant means to packaging you projects, along with all the runtime dependencies and supporting scripts into a binary distribution. One of the greatest advantages of using assemblies is that it is possible to split your projects into distinct components according to necessity. If you're using Spring Integration its quite common you would have separate components to be split over multiple machines. The assembly plugin allows you to configure this to your requirements.
