I would simply create your own data type that doesn't initialize ANY values. If you want to read an index position that has NOT been initialized, you return zeroes. Still, do not initialize any storage. If you want to read an index position that HAS been initialized, simply return the value. If you want to write to an index position that has NOT been initialized, initialize it, and store the input.
