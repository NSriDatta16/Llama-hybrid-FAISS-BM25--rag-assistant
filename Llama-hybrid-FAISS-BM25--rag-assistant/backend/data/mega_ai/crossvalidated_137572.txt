How to test one variable in a panel for cross-section dependence?

The plm::pcdtest function implements Pesaran, (2004) General Diagnostic Tests for Cross Section Dependence in Panels. For example a test for a panel model works as such: data(Grunfeld, package = "plm") ## test on heterogeneous model (separate time series regressions) pcdtest(inv ~ value + capital, data=Grunfeld, index = c("firm","year")) But if I want to test the cross-section dependance of only one variable in the panel for example inv in the example above, how can I do it in R?
