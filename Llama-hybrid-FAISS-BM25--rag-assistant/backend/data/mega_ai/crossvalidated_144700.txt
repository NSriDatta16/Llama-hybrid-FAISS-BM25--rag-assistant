Negative $R^2$ at random regression forest

I am currently writing my master's thesis about random forests and just started to work with the R software. When I am running my model the output looks like this: Mean of squared residuals: 0.0002441535 % Var explained: -8.82 Can anyone explain me why I get a negative $R^2$? I always thought that a negative $R^2$ is not possible.
