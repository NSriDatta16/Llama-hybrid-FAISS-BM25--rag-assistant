Are my Magento permissions correct?

I have a fresh install of Magento 1.4.1.1 using MAMP 1.8.4 on OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.4. I'm unable to load magento/downloader (the Magento Connect Manager) successfully. My browser displays a blank white page. Safari's Activity window tells me it's an Internal Server Error, which tells me my permissions may be incorrect. I have changed all file permissions for the entire magento directory to 777 to test whether the directories/files had sufficient privileges. I'm still unable to load Magento connect (magento/downloader/). Would setting all files to 777 be a sufficient way to test correct permissions? Anyone encountered this problem before?
