I don't think you'd have any additional problems using QSet over another sort of container, such as std::set, a map, or a vector. If you are wondering about running out of memory, that probably depends on how many thousands of the strings you need to store, and if there was a way to encode them more concisely. (For example, if the characters always occur in the same order but vary in relative lengths, store the length for each character rather than all of the characters.) However, even 50,000 of these strings is only around 5 MB, and 500,000 of them is only 50 MB to store, discounting storage overhead, which is a moderate amount of memory on modern machines.
