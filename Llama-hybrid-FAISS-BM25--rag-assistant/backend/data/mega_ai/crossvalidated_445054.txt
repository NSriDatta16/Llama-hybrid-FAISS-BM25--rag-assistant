The basic option, as in the effects package is to plot fitted values against one of the interacting regressors while fixing the other regressor at a representative value (say, mean, median or any "interesting" value). For effects package syntax and examples, see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sjPlot/vignettes/plot_interactions.html Alternatively, you may want to calculate the average partial effects (APE), or produce a 3D plot with both interacting regressors at the base. This may be produced using the margins package in R: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/margins/vignettes/TechnicalDetails.pdf
