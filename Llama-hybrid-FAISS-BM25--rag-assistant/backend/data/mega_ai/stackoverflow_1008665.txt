In addition to Andrew's WebSVN suggestion, I would also recommend ViewVC . I explain to people that WebSVN is more of a bean counter's tool while ViewVC is better suited to developers seeking more detailed information in a more efficient manner. That's rather tongue-in-cheek, of course, but you'll see what I mean if you compare the two products. I have deployed both in my organization.
