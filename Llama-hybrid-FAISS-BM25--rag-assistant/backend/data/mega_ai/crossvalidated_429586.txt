Is my Data stationary? KPSS, ADF Tests and ACF discusses the applicability of the ADF and what the alternative hypothesis is . A time series can be said to be stationary when the mean , standard deviation and auto-correlation is the same for all sub-intervals of time. If you have Pulses,Seasonal Pulses, Level Shifts or Local Time Trends this would be a violation of the stationarity of the mean. If the standard deviation changes over time for example dependent on the mean then this would be a violation of the assumption of a constant standard deviation. If the auto-correlation function changes over time then this might be an indication of time varying parameters BUT it could have other causes. You assert that the second series is white noise (random series) ...only the data knows for sure . Post the actual data and we will have a closer look. Also see @davo.bianilli's answer in the aforementioned reference. EDITED AFTER RECEIPT OF 100 VALUES: With ACF here No apparent autoregressive structure other than a slightly non-normal histogram. It seems there is no need to difference or de-trend this series to obtain stationarity OR to transform it any way . The lack of normality might be triggering the false ADF which might could suggest two or more distributions with different means. I am personally displeased by your simulation results ...Perhaps a larger sample might cure the false ADF by having "more normal data".
