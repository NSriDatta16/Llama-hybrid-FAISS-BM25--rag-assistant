Of course you can delete them - however, there are other ways to limit the output when listing them. Check out git-flow. You should be able to use merges into the trunk to show what was deployed without relying on a tag. Pay attention to what the 1st parent is in a merge commmit - that's the side you merged from. For recent history inspection/manipulation, tags help. Remember the difference between SVN and Git. Git is snapshot based - not URL-like like SVN is.
