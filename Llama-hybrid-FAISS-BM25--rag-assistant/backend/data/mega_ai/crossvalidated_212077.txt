Yes it is a Bayesian update. When in the context of a time series of observations $y_t \sim p_y(\theta_t)$ and $\theta_t \sim p_\theta(\theta_{t-1})$, the filtered distributions $p(\theta_t|y_1,\ldots,y_t)$ can be called a Bayes filter. The Kalman filter is a Bayes filter when $p_y(\cdot)$ and $p_\theta(\cdot)$ are linear and normal, as in the example you gave.
