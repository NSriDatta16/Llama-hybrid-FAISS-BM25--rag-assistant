Can distribution values of a target variable be used as features in cross-validation?

I came across an SVM predictive model where the author used the probabilistic distribution value of the target variable as a feature in the feature set. For example: The author built a model for each gesture of each player to guess which gesture would be played next. Calculating over 1000 games played the distribution may look like (20%, 10%, 70%). These numbers were then used as feature variables to predict the target variable for cross-fold validation. Is that legitimate? That seems like cheating. I would think you would have to exclude the target variables from your test set when calculating features in order to not "cheat".
