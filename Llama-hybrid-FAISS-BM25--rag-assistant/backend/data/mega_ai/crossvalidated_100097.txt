Evaluating an integral using MCMC algorithm

Consider the problem of evaluating the following integral $$ \int_T f(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3| D) d\Theta$$ where $f$ is a posterior density and the values of $D = (d_1, ..., d_n)$, given $\Theta$ are $i.i.d$ with a given distribution and $T$ has the following form: $$T = \{(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3) \in M | f(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3|D) > k \} $$ for $k$ a known constant bigger than zero and $M=(0,\infty)$x$(1,\infty)$x$(0,\infty)$ I don't know how to apply $MC$ integration method to solve this integral, since I can't see how is this region $T$ or even how to write its volume. I thought we could use the distribution of $d|\Theta$, but I don't know how to. I would be glad if I could have some help understanding better how to calculate this integral Thanks! (P.S: I will use the metropolis hastings to sample from $f$, thats why I wrote MCMC)
