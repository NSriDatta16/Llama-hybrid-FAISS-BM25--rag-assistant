The visualization of high dimensional data is generally difficult. Most of the methods rely on projection the data onto low dimensions (at most three). For example, Principal component analysis (PCA) explores linear combinations of the original data, so that you can pick the first two principal components to visualize. There has been extensive studies on visualization methods, and in the case of SVM, I think this paper, Support vector machines for visualization and dimensionality reduction , is a good start.
