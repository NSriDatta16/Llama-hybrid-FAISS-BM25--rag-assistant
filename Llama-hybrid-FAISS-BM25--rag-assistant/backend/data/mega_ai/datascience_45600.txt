Train LSTM model with multiple time series

I am predicting energy usage for a bedroom within a school residential building with date, temperature, and humidity as input features, using 7 time-steps and predicting for one-day ( one-timestep ). I am able to predict for one bedroom. The building has about 100 bedrooms, all more or less the same layout and occupancy, so the data for all these 100 bedrooms have the same date range as the first bedroom and same humidity and temperature levels on the same day. Now I want to train my model with all the 100 bedroom's energy data so that the model captures all 100 rooms energy patterns. Then, I want to predict what the energy usage is for any given bedroom (not a specific bedroom), using this model that has been trained with all 100 bedrooms. In other words, the business question is " What is the expected energy usage for a bedroom within this residential school building? " I would like to know how I can train all these 100 rooms into one LSTM model, given that LSTM is a time series model, and 100 rooms mean I have 100 times series. I cannot simply concatenate the datasets of all rooms. How would I structure my data and run it in the LSTM model? I would appreciate if someone could show me an example of how it could be done.
