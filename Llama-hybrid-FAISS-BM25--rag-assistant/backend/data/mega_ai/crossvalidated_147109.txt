In theory you could use any kind of loss function. The absolute and the squared loss functions just happen to be the most popular and the most intuitive loss functions. According to this wikipedia entry, A common example involves estimating "location." Under typical statistical assumptions, the mean or average is the statistic for estimating location that minimizes the expected loss experienced under the squared-error loss function, while the median is the estimator that minimizes expected loss experienced under the absolute-difference loss function. Still different estimators would be optimal under other, less common circumstances. As also explained in the wikipedia entry, the choice of the loss functions depends on how do you value deviations from your targeted object. If all deviations are equally bad for you no matter their sign, then you could use the absolute loss function. If deviations become worse for you the farther away you are from the optimum and you don't care about whether the deviation is positive or negative, then the squared loss function is your easiest choice. But if none of the above definitions of loss fit your problem at hand, because e.g. small deviations are worse for you than big deviations, then you can choose a different loss function and try to solve the minimizing problem. However the statistical properties of your solution might be hard to assess.
