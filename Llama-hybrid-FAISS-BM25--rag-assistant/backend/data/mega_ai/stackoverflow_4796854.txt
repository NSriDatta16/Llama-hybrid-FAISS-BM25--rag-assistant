Magento - Display payment fee on the order page (admin backend)

During the checkout process I can use the addTotal method on the address object to add a payment fee to be displayed for the user. $address->addTotal(array ( 'code' => $this->getCode(), 'title' => Mage::helper('payment')->__('Invoice fee'), 'value' => $fee )); Is there any equivilent on the order/invoice object in the administration backend? If not, how can I display my payment fee on the order page (backend)? I've got the payment fee in the sales_flat_order table.
