I just had a quick play around with a similar situation and came up with a hacky solution: onDragStart: Make the item absolutely positioned and a child of the body element. It then moves over the top of everything else. onDragEnd: Add the item back to the correct parent and make it relatively positioned again. Not sure if this helps in your situation but it works in Safari for me.
