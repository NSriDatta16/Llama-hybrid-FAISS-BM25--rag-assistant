Your example of 'bicycles' and 'cycling' could be addressed by a take on the Levenshtein edit-distance algorithm since the two words are somewhat related.

Have you considered hosting the dictionary as a web service and accessing the data as needed? The drawback of course is that your app would only work while in network coverage.
