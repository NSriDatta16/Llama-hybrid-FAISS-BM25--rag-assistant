You only want to use DataAdapters when you use DataSets. An Adapter has the 2 main methods Fill() and Updater() to read a Dataset from and write it to the Database. Note that Fill() will open a Connnection, use a DataReader to get all records and then close the Connetion. Without Datasets and DataTables you don't have a use for DataAdapters. So the real question is: What kind of storage classes do you want to use in your DAL? DataSets are viable and simple but it's an aging technology (no longer improved). Maybe you should look around for an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library. But that will replace your DataReader/Adapter question with a much more complicated choice.
