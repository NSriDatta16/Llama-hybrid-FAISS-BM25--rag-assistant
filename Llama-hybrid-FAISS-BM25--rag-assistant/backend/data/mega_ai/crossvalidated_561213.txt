The reason that conditioning on the parents of $X$ , irrespective of what the DAG looks like, always satisfies the backdoor criterion relative to $(X,Y)$ is that there is a parent of $X$ on each backdoor path and parents of $X$ cannot be colliders, by definition of parents of $X$ (which implies an arrow from the parent to $X$ ), hence conditioning on the the set of parents of $X$ will block all the backdoor paths, not open any spurious paths, and leave all directed paths untouched. With regards to your specific question on this DAG: $Z \rightarrow X \rightarrow Y$ : $Z$ , the parent of $X$ , does satisfy the backdoor criterion, albeit trivially. There is no backdoor path that remains open once we condition on $Z$ ; all directed paths from $X$ to $Y$ remain unperturbed; no new spurious paths are created. But, of course, the empty set also satisfies the backdoor criterion in this case. However, there are at least 3 reasons why when interested in the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ , we would prefer to reduce the DAG you brought up $Z \rightarrow X \rightarrow Y$ to the following $X \rightarrow Y$ instead. $Y$ and $Z$ are independent conditional on X: $P(Y|X,Z)=P(Y|X)$ . We gain nothing by conditioning on $Z$ , once we've already conditioned on $X$ . Put differently, $Z$ here is neutral in terms of bias reduction. Controlling for $Z$ will reduce the variation in $X$ and hence will reduce the precision of the estimate of the average causal effect. To the extent that there are unobserved common causes of $X$ and $Y$ , controlling for Z will amplify the bias (due to the association via U). See here for more on this.
