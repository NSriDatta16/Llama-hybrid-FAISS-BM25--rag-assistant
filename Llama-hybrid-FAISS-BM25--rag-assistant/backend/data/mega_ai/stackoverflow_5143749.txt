UI issue in TFS custom work item

We created new TFS work item. After some time, we began to have issues with controls UI layout. (Screen shot is attached as an example). Spaces between controls are VERY big. If we re-run the query - everything becomes good. After another re-run, the layout again becomes corrupted. The UI Layout is modified in the way as suggested with this answer: Is it possible to customize "History" tab for Bug/Task work item types? . What is a reason of that and how to fix it?! EDITED: layout was added
