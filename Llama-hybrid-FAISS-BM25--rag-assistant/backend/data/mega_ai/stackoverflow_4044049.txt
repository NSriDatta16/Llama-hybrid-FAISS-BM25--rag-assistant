authenticate silverlight app from third party software

I need your help. I have a requirement to perform secure log in for my silverlight application(using wcf). I am launching this app from old call center software. From here, I need to pass some information to silverlight app in a secured manner (currently passing as url parameters). I doesn't want to provide log in screen again, because the user is already authenticated by call center s/w. Please provide me your valuble suggestions. Thanks in advance, Raghavendra K.
