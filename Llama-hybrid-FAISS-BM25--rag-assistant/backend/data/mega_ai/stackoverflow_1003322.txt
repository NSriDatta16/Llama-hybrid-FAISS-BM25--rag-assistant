There are very few good reasons for creating yet another DSL. The world is fat with special-purpose languages. Think along with these lines. Solve the problem with a general-purpose language such as Python, Java, C++.. whatever. Optimize that solution to factor out the common features and build a really nice, really elegant, really extensible class library. Optimize that class library to emphasize "orthogonality". Make sure all features work well together, without any problems. If you need simplification of the syntax only, create a scripting wrapper around your nice class library. This is your DSL. For Python, this is easy -- it's already a dynamic language. For Java, there are things you can leverage. For C++ it can be a bit of work to build this flexible scripting environment. If you still need further optimization, consider writing a compiler for your DSL.
