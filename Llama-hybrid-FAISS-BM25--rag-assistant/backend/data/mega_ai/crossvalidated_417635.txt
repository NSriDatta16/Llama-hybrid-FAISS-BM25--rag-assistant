MSE Intuition and Interpretation

I've got a very small question. Say I'm making a linear regression model. When I test the model with a testing set, I get an MSE of 4.31 (arbitrary). What do I interpret from this? As in, what does this '4.31' represent, or rather mean? Until now, I was thinking of it as the average squared difference between target and predicted values. Thus, I thought it showed that the average prediction differed by sqrt(4.31) from the average actual value, but I'm not sure.
