It depends if you're dealing with one or many files. At the risk of being pilloried, I'm assuming you're using Windows because you didn't specify a platform. For one file at a time, Notepad2 does the trick and is extremely fast, lightweight and portable. For search/replace over multiple files at once, try Agent Ransack .
