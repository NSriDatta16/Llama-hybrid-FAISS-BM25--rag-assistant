A lot depends on how you've crafted your UI. We write windows apps and use Crystal Reports: http://www.crystalreports.com/ and ActiveReports http://www.datadynamics.com/ Neither are free, and both come with their own form designer and programming objects (for printing from your UI). We prefer Crystal over Active, mostly because we have more years of experience with Crystal. Filling out the forms with data involves: Write the data to some standard data store, usually a database record. Create a form and attach the data store - there are menu items to pick a database, tables, views, etc. Insert the data fields on the form - there are menu and toolbar items to list the fields and just drag & drop the field you want to wherever it needs to print. In the program that contains your UI, include an object that prints the form.
