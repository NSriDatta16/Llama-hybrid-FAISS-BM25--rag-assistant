Your second approach is a good one assuming that there are no true zeroes in the data. What matters is to give the missing values a number more extreme than exists in the dataset; whether that is zero, negative, or positive, all that matters is that it falls outside the data range. (Edit: Actually, you can even skip the dummy variable here, it's not actually contributing additional information. The first approach is inferior in that it needlessly bins the data and thereby throws away potentially useful information. A third option is imputation (h/t to rolando2 for the suggestion), which some implementations of random forests can do for you automatically. How useful this is will partly depend on how well wage can be predicted by the other variables in your dataset.
