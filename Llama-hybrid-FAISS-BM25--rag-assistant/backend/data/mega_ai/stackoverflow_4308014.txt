You need to set the CahcePolicy on the WebClient: WebClient wc = new WebClient(); wc.CachePolicy = new System.Net.Cache.RequestCachePolicy(System.Net.Cache.RequestCacheLevel.CacheIfAvailable); This will use Microsoft.Win32.WinInetCache by default which is IE's cache manager. UPDATE OK, I did not realise it is SL. In that case, if the image is small I think it is easier to simplify things by retrieving from the server anyway. If the file is large, expose a method to return the date it was last changed and implement a local caching using Isolated Storage.
