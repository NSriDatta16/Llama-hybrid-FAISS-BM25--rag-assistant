High t-val for one explanatory variable, while the other has a significant coefficient. How to interpret???

I have question with some results I'm working with. Model: avg_score = β0 + β1(nonwhite) + β2(hhold_avginc) + u For some background, I'm seeing if average income and race influence state standardized test scores. And I got the results displayed in the attached tables. There are two different tables for each test type (math and language arts). Also should point out that in the tables, subgroupid stands for the explanatory variable 'nonwhite'. So, my understanding is that in both cases, hold_avginc shows insignificant coefficients, but has high t-values. So it shows that the error terms are correlated with the independent variables. Right? So should I go ahead a do a two-stage least squares regression analysis? But I guess since the nonwhite variable is significant, I'm not completely sure if that's what I should do. Initially I was going to just point out the significance I found in the nonwhite variable, but that was before I noticed the high t-values. Thank you in advance. I really just need guidance in what comes next...and how.
