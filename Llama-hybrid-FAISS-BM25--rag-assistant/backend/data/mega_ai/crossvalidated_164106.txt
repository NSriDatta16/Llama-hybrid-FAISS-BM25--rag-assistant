Logistic regression: Include a specific time variable to account for unexplained changes over time?

I am measuring the effect of specific marketing activities on the likelihood to buy a product. The Marketing activities start on a specific date. All the products sold before this date a marked with a 0 - all the following ones consequently with a 1. Do I need to include a separate variable due to the fact that the activity was introduced at a certain point of time (suddenly)? I heard that "event analysis" might help here but I did not find anything which helped me. Do I need to control for other things my variables can`t capture (e.g. customer mindset) by including an extra variable over time in order to improve my results (something like a time trend)? If yes, how would this work?
