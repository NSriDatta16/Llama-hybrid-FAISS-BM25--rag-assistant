In order to make a reasonable choice about which account a service should use one must be able to determine the needs of the service with respect to what Windows permissions are required for the service to operate successfully. Once you know this, you can then determine which of the service accounts has a permission set that meets these requirements. Rather than provide you with a broad blanket answer, I will provide you with some information that may be helpful in making your decision This page contains a description of the role and permissions associated with each account This page describes the SQL Server Agent Service and the Windows permissions it requires None of the above deals with how best to handle the installation of SQL Server on domain controllers. Unfortunately that's not an area I know a lot about so I'll not attempt to address it at the risk of spreading misinformation. As an aside, the purpose of the SQL Server Agent service is to run scheduled jobs on behalf of SQL Server. If your application isn't using any of the features supported by SQL Server Agent you might consider disabling the service to reduce the surface area of SQL Server I realize this is not a complete answer to the question posed but I hope it is somewhat helpful
