TinyMCE inside hidden div are not displayed as enabled when we put the div visible

I am having an issue with tinyMCE (WYSIWYG editor). I am actually adding the textarea inside a HTML element like a DIV which is currently having the style attribute "display:none". When I am changing the DIV display style to visible the tinyMCE editor is shown as disabled. Important Note: The setting which is causing the issue is the "auto_resize" option. This is the only option that I turn on/off that make the tinyMCE editor goes in edit or read-only mode. Here's my code: tinyMCE.init({ mode: "specific_textareas", editor_selector: /(RichTextArea)/, theme: "advanced", auto_reset_designmode: true, auto_resize:true, theme_advanced_buttons1: "bold,italic,underline,strikethrough,|,fontselect,fontsizeselect,|,forecolor,backcolor,|,bullist,numlist,|,justifyleft,justifycenter,justifyright,justifyfull", theme_advanced_buttons2: "", theme_advanced_buttons3: "", theme_advanced_buttons4: "", theme_advanced_more_colors: 0, theme_advanced_toolbar_location: "external", theme_advanced_toolbar_align: "left" }); ... Show WYSIWYG &lt;p&gt;This is the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the second paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the third paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; I would like to know if anyone has an idea of how to fix that issue?
