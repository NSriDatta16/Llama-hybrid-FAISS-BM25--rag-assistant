Why do I get a TypeError if I try to call a method directly from the class, supplying all arguments?

When I try this code: class MyStuff: def average(a, b, c): # Get the average of three numbers result = a + b + c result = result / 3 return result # Now use the function `average` from the `MyStuff` class print(MyStuff.average(9, 18, 27)) I get an error that says: File "class.py", line 7, in print(MyStuff.average(9, 18, 27)) TypeError: unbound method average() must be called with MyStuff instance as first argument (got int instance instead) What does this mean? Why can't I call average this way?
