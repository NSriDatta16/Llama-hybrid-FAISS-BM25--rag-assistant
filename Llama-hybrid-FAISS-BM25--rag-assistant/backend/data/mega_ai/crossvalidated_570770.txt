The standard approach in this situation is to smooth the time series and then consider the difference between the real value of the time series and the smoothed one. If this is larger than some configured threshold $t$ , you have an outlier. You can configure the amount of smoothing and the threshold $t$ yourself, i.e. you can tune them to your needs so that the above procedure will mainly detect those points as outliers that you consider as such. For example, you would tune the smoothing and threshold such that in the example you described only one spike would be detected. There is a lot of software available that can help you with this task, e.g. in R here or here .
