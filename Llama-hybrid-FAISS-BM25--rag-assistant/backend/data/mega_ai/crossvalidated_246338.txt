How can I get each Decision Tree from Random Forest as independent prediction model?

I am using R package randomForest in my research. My question is how can I get each Tree as a real model for predict/plot etc. from a Random Forest model? I tried the function getTree() which could generate a data frame of one specific tree, but one cannot use it as a model to predict new data. I know RF is an ensemble learning algorithm, however, for my purpose, I need each decision tree as a practical model for other usages. Thanks.
