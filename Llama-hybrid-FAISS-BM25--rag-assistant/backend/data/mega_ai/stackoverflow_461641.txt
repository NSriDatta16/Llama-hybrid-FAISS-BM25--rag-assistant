SQL selection criteria on grouped aggregate

I'm trying to find a simple MySQL statement for the following two problems: I have 4 tables: Employees, Customers, Orders, Products (Each entry in Orders contains a date, a reference one product, a quantity and a reference to a customer, and a reference to an Employee). Now I'm trying to get all customers where the volume of sale (quantity * product.price) is bigger in 1996 than in 1995. And: I want to list all Employees whose volume of sale is below the average volume of sale. Any help would really be appreciated. I've managed to get the information using a php script but I think this can be done with some clever SQL Statements. Can anybody help me? Employee Table: ID# Name Products Table: ID# NAME# PRICE Orders Table: ODERID# CUSTOMERID # DATE # EMPLOYEE# PRODUCTID# QUANTITY
