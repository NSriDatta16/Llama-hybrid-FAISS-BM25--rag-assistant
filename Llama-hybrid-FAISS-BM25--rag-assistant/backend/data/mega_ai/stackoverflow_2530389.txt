IMO, aside from monitoring the WSDL for changes (which is really only necessary if you have a willy-nilly implementation ("promote-to-production") strategy), the only way to really ensure that everythign is operational and stable, is to perform continuous, automated, periodic, functional testing with a test suite that provides complete coverage of both the WSDL and the underlying application functionality, including edge cases. The test cases should be version controlled just like the app and WSDL, and should be developed in parallel to new versions of the app (not afterward, as a reaction). This can all be automated with SoapUI. Ideally, logging results somewhere that can be accumulated and reported on some dashboard, so that if somethign breaks, you know when it broke, and hopefully correlate that to an event such as an application update, or something more benign such as a service pack being pushed, electrical work being performed, etc.. However... do as I say, not as I do. I have been unsuccessful in pushing this strategy at work. Your votes will tell me whether I should push harder or do something else!
