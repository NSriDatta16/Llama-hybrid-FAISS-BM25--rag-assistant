C# Parameter Attributes RegEx

I was just reading The Pragmatic Programmer and the Design By Contract chapter. It occurred to me that when we make a function maybe in a common library, specifying attributes of parameters would be a useful thing. I'm wondering if anyone has come across such an idea, I don't believe it exists in C# quite how I'm thinking which is something like this; public String SendEmail(String ToAddress [RegExMatch(@"\b[A-Z0-9._%-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b")], FromAddress, Body) For readability it would make more sense to put it above the function declaration I think. I can't imagine it would be a bad idea as the function could automatically throw an exception for invalid parameters. But it would just give a bit more definition than String or Int32. More of a discussion than looking for an answer. Cheers, Mike
