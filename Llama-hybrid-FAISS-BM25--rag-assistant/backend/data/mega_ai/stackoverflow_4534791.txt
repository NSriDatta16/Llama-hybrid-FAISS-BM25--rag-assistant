Why does gcc use movl instead of push to pass function args?

pay attention to this code : #include void a(int a, int b, int c) { char buffer1[5]; char buffer2[10]; } int main() { a(1,2,3); } after that : gcc -S a.c that command shows our source code in assembly. now we can see in the main function, we never use "push" command to push the arguments of the a function into the stack. and it used "movel" instead of that main: pushl %ebp movl %esp, %ebp andl $-16, %esp subl $16, %esp movl $3, 8(%esp) movl $2, 4(%esp) movl $1, (%esp) call a leave why does it happen? what's difference between them?
