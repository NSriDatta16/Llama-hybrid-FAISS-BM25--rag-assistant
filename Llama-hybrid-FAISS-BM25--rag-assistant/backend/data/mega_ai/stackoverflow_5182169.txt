The way I compile my programs is usually to supply exactly the same switches to the compiler for ALL modules, so, no, I don't know if its possible to get gcov working when the executable was not compiled with the coverage switches. However, what I then do is to post-process the output files from gcov, ignoring files relating to test code only, but keeping all files relating to code directly called by test code as well as library code called by itself.
