If I understand your question correctly - the short answer is no - you can't turn a web service into a dll. An .asmx file is essentially a page that has to be served by IIS in order to work. Although you might experiment with embedding it as a resource and using HttpHandlers to route the request. But in the end that wouldn't really be an asmx service (see this link ). Now, your .dll can CALL a webservice and can have the url configured for the calling of that service in the web.config or app.config whichever you need, but the service itself can't be wrapped up in a dll. What WCF does is allow you to create a service library, but it still has to be hosted to be publicly available however you can access it as if it were a dll locally by self hosting it.
