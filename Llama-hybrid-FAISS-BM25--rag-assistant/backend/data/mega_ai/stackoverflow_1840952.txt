Storage space shouldn't be your concern with this. Instead you should be concerned with the semantics of NULL. Let's say I had a glass at my house that you have never seen before in your life. If I ask you how much water is in that glass, you cannot give a valid answer. The truth is that you don't know. Now if I got the glass and showed you there was no water in it, the answer you would give me is "none". NULL is "I don't know the answer" and the empty string is "I do know and the answer is the empty string".
