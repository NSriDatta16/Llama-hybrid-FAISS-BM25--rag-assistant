Both A and B have the same denominator in each fraction you mention. Is that true for every term in the list? If that's so, why don't you factor that out when you calculate the product? The denominator will simply be X^n, when X is the value and n is the number of terms in the list. If you do that, you'll have the opposite problem: overflow in the numerator. You know that it can't be smaller than max(X)^n, where max(X) is the maximum value in the numerator and n is the number of terms in the list. If you can calculate that, you can see if your computer will have a problem. You can't put 10 pounds of anything in a 5 pound bag. Unfortunately, the properties of logarithms limit you to the following simplifications: (source: equationsheet.com ) and (source: equationsheet.com ) So you're stuck with: (source: equationsheet.com ) If you're using a language that supports infinite precision numbers (e.g., Java BigDecimal) it might make your life a little easier. But there's still a good argument for doing some thinking before you compute. Why use brute force when you can be elegant?
