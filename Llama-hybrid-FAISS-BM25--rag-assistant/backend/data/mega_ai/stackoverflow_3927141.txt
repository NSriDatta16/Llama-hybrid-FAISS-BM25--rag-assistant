TFS 2010 and creating a package

I am running the build with the flags /p:CreatePackageOnPublish=true /p:DeployOnBuild=True The agent creates a the folder: C:\Builds\99\MyWebProject\Sources\WebProj\Web\obj\Debug\Package\PackageTmp that is used when the package is deployed. However, this folder does NOT have the files that are not in source control but are created during the post build event. I'd like these files to be included in the package as well (but can't add them to the source control as they are created later). How do I take care of this issue?
