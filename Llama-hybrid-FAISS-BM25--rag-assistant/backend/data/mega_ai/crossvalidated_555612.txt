How to deal with "negligible" coefficients from averaged linear regression?

I have an apparently simple (and maybe stupid) question. I have a data set dT with 168 subjects. I ran a linear regression in R to give the model m1 assessing the relationship between response "Age" and a set of seven chosen factor variables. I also included three two-way interactions between some of those variables. m1 Then I generated a model selection table with all combinations of effects using dredge (default settings) and averaged (full) over the subset with deltaAIC , which gives me a subset of 6 models. dm The coefficient and 95% CI output looks like this: cbind(coefTable(m2, full=T),confint(m2, full=T)) Estimate Std. Error df 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) 37.6284217 9.239456 NA 19.519420 55.737424 SprLigLesionComplete 2.8663869 2.745389 NA -2.514476 8.247250 SprLigLocationIntermedial -13.5599463 6.371489 NA -26.047835 -1.072058 TPTLesionPartial 10.7908223 4.193205 NA 2.572292 19.009353 TPTLesionDistal 21.5392665 8.805364 NA 4.281070 38.797463 TPTLesionDistal+Bone 3.8884638 9.610411 NA -14.947595 22.724523 TraumaYes -6.4792438 2.576627 NA -11.529340 -1.429147 Type3A 25.0419915 10.706594 NA 4.057453 46.026530 Type3B 0.0000000 0.000000 NA 0.000000 0.000000 SexM 4.0068936 5.532559 NA -6.836722 14.850509 SexM:Type3A -3.3116556 5.604008 NA -14.295310 7.671999 SexM:Type3B -7.1260396 8.862440 NA -24.496103 10.244023 DelLigLesionYes -0.5295235 1.640540 NA -3.744922 2.685875 Ignoring the apparently not estimated coefficient of Type3B , I am wondering how to deal with very small association such as in this case with DelLigLesionYes with an estimate of -0.53 years and a 95%CI of -3.74 to 2.69. To me it seems irrelevant and of little importance to report a difference of 0.53 years especially with a 95% CI this wide. How would more experienced modelers treat this variable/model? Should I reduce the subset of models to average on (e.g., reducing deltaAIC to 1, or using BIC instead of AICc)? Or can I just ignore this effect and not mention it in a publication? This community has already been of incredible help to me, and I very much appreciate your help.
