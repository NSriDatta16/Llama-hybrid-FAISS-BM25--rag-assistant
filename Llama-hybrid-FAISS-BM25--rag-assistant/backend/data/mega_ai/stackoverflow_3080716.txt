How to get coordinates from a image for CGRectMake

Is there a program, that you can drag a box around a specific area of an image, and it will give you the coordinates you need to input into CGRectMake ? //The numbers in here CCSprite *sprite = [CCSprite spriteWithSpriteSheet:spriteSheet rect:CGRectMake(608,6,44,45)]; The way i do it know, is by guessing, and recompiling every time till i get it right... there has to be a better way.
