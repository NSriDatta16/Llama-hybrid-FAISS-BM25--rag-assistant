Feature selection for gene expression dataset

I am searching for a feature selection algorithm which selects features that are: relevant to discriminate groups of samples (for each sample a group label is provided) endowed with high variance across all the samples This should be applied to gene expression dataset, in which each sample has a group label, therefore it should be possible to select for each group a set of features to be checked against. I have now two candidates: selecting features by the feature importance result of a Random Forest classifier using the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) algorithm However, I am unsure of which may be the best or if there are better candidates for this purpose. If the algorithm is implemented in Python scikit-learn it would be a plus.
