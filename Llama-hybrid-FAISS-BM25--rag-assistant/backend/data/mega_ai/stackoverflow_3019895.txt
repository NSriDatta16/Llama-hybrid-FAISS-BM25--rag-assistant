I think it might be impossible in a verbatim environment -- at least, that's what Lamport says in the LaTeX book (first paragraph on pg. 64). However, you can do it with the \verb command: \verb+\end{verbatim}+ works just fine (and in fact, you can use any character instead of + as long as you make them match). That said, the listings package is smart enough to have an escape character. For example, \begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=+] +\verb!\end{lstlisting}!+ \end{lstlisting} does exactly what you're looking for. (Again, pick a different character than + if you're already using that for something else.)
