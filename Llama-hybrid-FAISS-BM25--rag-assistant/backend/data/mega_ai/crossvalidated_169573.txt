Prediction intervals are based on residual variance as estimated by the maximum likelihood optimization. I like forecast function from the forecast package: fc which gives me the following predictions: Point Forecast Lo 80 Hi 80 Lo 95 Hi 95 Jun 2005 17.61393 17.47222 17.75565 17.39720 17.83067 Jul 2005 17.51725 17.35753 17.67697 17.27299 17.76152 Aug 2005 17.51725 17.35753 17.67697 17.27299 17.76152 Sep 2005 17.51725 17.35753 17.67697 17.27299 17.76152 Oct 2005 17.51725 17.35753 17.67697 17.27299 17.76152 the way prediction interval works is by following formula: $y_t \pm z\sigma$ where $z$ is a multiplier which takes values such as 1.96 for 95% prediction interval and 1.28 for 80% prediction interval $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the residual also forecast distribution which is also the square root of sigma^2 in the maximum likelihood estimate. As you show sigma^2 ( 0.01223) is identical in both your models, prediction intervals will also be same and will match. If you want to check it, Upper Limits: > fc$mean[1]+sqrt(forecast.arima$sigma2)*1.96 [1] 17.83068 Lower Limits: > fc$mean[1]-sqrt(forecast.arima$sigma2)*1.96 [1] 17.39719 which matches the prediction interval provided by the forecast function. To answer your question, yes leveraging forecast package will work in this case and the prediction intervals will be correct.
