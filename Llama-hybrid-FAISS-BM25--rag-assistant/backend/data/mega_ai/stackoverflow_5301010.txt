This may not be exactly what you are looking for because I'm not all that familiar with UIPopOverController but I think you can accomplish something similar using a Toast with a customized layout. I would take a look at Creating Toast Notifications and see if it works for you. Depending on the functionality needed it might work, otherwise you might need to look into trying to generate a modeless dialog with a custom layout. As for your other question, yes options are generally stored in a separate activity within your application and following Honeycomb design the options activity would be accessible from the Action Bar and the options itself could be a fragment.
