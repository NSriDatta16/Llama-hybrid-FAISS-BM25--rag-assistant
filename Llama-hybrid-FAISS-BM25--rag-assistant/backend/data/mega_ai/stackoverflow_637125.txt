Unless you're doing this a trillion times, it doesn't matter. Go with the one that is more readable and maintainable to you and/or your organization. The productivity gains you will get from writing clean, simple code matters way more than shaving a tenth of a microsecond off your JS execution time. You should only even start thinking about what performs better when and only when you've written code and it is unacceptably slow. Then you should start tracking down the bottleneck, which will never be something like this. You will never get a measurable performance gain out of switching from one to the other here.
