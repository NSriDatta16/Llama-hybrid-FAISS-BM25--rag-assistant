Diagnosing and improving performance of a java jnlp compared to jar file

Customer X has asked for ways to improve the startup time of a Java process he uses. The problem is, it is not run through a jar file, but rather 'jnlp' (which I am assuming indicates it is a java webstart application) StartUserWorx.jnlp Is there a way to convert this to a JAR file and then have the user invoke the application locally, and include a startup flag to the JRE to allocate more ram to the process? The user is getting a bit frustrated, because other workers in the same office use the same application on almost identical machines, and yet his process seems to always take a much longer time to load (a few minutes rather than a few seconds).
