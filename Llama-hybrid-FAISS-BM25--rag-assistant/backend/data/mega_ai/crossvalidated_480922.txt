Using a beta-binomial model to estimate the average for a uniform prior

Say we had a sample of 100 people who were asked how many days during the last week they drove their car. Let's say the resulting frequency table is as follows: Days, frequency 0, 1 1, 5 2, 3 3, 15 4, 20 5, 25 6, 31 7, 0 How do I go about using a beta-binomial model for estimating the average number of car-driven days a week for a uniform prior ? The data is binomial, with 7 Bernoulli trials each with a success probability of p. I don't know how to proceed from here in terms of figuring out the average? Thank you!
