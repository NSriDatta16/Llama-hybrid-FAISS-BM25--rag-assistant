Drag and drop from outlook to webpage

I'm looking for the following functionality and a push in the right direction if it is possible. I would like to be able to drag an email that I have in Microsoft Outlook over to a webpage and have the webpage parse out details within that email. Is this possible? The intent is to take that data and interface with our help desk software API to automatically log work orders from emails that are recieved almost daily from an outside system.
