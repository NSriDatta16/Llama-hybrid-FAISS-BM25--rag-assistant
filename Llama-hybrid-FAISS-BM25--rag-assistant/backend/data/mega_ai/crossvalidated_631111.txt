Would the distribution of the average number of correct answers for a five-question game constitute an application of the central limit theorem?

Say you have a game in which users answer five questions daily. Would the distribution of average scores for a single user among all of their games meet the criterium for the central limit theorem? I wouldn't think so but in practice it seems to be roughly normal. This could be a coincidence but I cannot think of a reason why it would not. Thanks.
