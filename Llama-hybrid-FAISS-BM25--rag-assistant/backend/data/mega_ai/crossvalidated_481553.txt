Average Point Estimates but also considering confidence intervals

I'm looking at feature importance. I have a set of point estimates for features I would like to rank from two different models. I also have their confidence intervals. What is the best way to rank these point estimates while also accounting for the confidence intervals? I don't think it makes sense to rank point estimates by averaging their magnitude without accounting for the confidence intervals. EDIT: Following something similar to this (in the feature importance section where they compare different model feature importance outputs): https://www.r-bloggers.com/iml-and-h2o-machine-learning-model-interpretability-and-feature-explanation/
