jQuery drop-down menu issue :)

I'm working on my own drop-down menu, here's the code displaying hidden sub-menus: jQuery('ul li').hover(function(){ jQuery(this).children('ul').stop().show().animate({ opacity: 1 }); }, function() { jQuery(this).children('ul').stop().animate({ opacity: 0,}); }); Everything works fine, but sub-menus are being displayed not only when user hovers parent-link but also when hovers area the invisible sub-menus take. I believe the ul is hidden, but li's no, so ('ul li').hover triggers them. How to avoid that? That's evil especially with multileveled sub-menus. Example: http://jsfiddle.net/6t523/ (try to hover the red square). [edit] Oh my God, I've noticed that nothing happens when you hover the red square at first. I'm not HIDING the items but only taking opacity to 0 with jQuery. Aaafffff! :) The question is then - how to hide them elegantly? Will my code work in IE6/IE7/IE8?
