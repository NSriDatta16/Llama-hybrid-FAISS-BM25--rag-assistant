ASIHTTPRequest equivalent for Android or any HTTP request manager/wrapper?

I'm developing an app that will make extensive HTTP requests. I know for a fact that iOS has a third-party library called ASIHTTPRequest to manage and organize all these requests, making it much easier and less tedious. Is there a similar library available for Android?
