Can a moving average value result be higher than the highest constituent value on which the moving average is based?

Can a moving average value result be higher than the highest constituent value on which the moving average is based? I realize that somewhere here there maybe an answer, but I have been unable to find one specific to this question. I do not believe that a "moving average value result" based on a set of values over the moving time period specified (such as the previous 4 weeks sales) can be higher than the individual highest constituent sales total that is one of the values considered in the moving average calculation. Am I right here? Thank you.
