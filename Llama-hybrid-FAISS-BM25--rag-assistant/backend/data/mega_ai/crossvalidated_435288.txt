Learning problem when we have data from distributions $(p_i)$ when we care about (known) distribution $p^*$?

Suppose we have a dataset $D$ or multiple datasets $(D_i)$ , with distributions $p_i:X\to \mathbb R$ . Suppose there is another distribution $p^*$ . All distributions are known, including $p^*$ , but the $p_i$ are different from $p^*$ , with different support . Suppose also there is a function $f:X\to Y$ , and we are interested in the distribution of $f(X)$ according to $p^*$ , or some statistics of this distribution, e.g. the expectation of $f(X)$ . I would like to learn more about this type of problem. What keywords/references should I look for? Does this problem, or a similar or more general version of the problem, have a name , so I can look it up? Are there algorithms for making estimates that are appropriate for this (what are their names)? Is there learning theory about this (that I can look up)? How does Bayesian statistics deal with this? ps. I'm not necessarily asking for an explanation, just for the terminology/general direction so I can look it up. EDIT : To clarify, we know the distribution on X but we don’t know f. E.g. suppose X is a set of variables, $X=(X_1,...,X_n)$ , where for a given individual $x_1$ is their height, $x_2$ is their age, etc. Now suppose $f(x)$ measures the life expectancy. Suppose that we have datasets from people in various European countries, the US, etc, but we don’t have data about Japan. In this case $p^∗$ is the distribution of personal characteristics in japan, and the pi from Germany, the US, etc. But we can only measure the $f(X)$ from the datasets in Europe and the US. Then we want to estimate the life expectancy of someone from Japan. However, we cannot just blindly estimate a function f on the data from Europe and the US, and confidently generalize to Japan, because (1) the distribution of $X$ is different for Japan (different support even), and different areas of the domain of $X$ may have different effects on life expectancy (e.g. old age+exercise may be bad for life expectancy even if young age + exercise is good)
