To my surprise, Peter Kellner's solution I mentioned works just fine. Here are the steps to follow: Add AspProviders (from WCF Azure Samples ) to your solution. Create Azure ASP.NET Web Role (let's call it MembershipAdmin), reference AspProviders from it. Add Membership.aspx and other aspx/cs files from Peter Kellner's solution , mark Membership.aspx as "Set As Start Page". In MembershipAdmin's Web.config, find and replace sections "membership" and "roleManager", and add section "appSettings" (the latter goes directly under root configuration). Examples of these sections are below, just change "YourTargetService" to what your real service name is. Actually it's going to mirror Web.config of your real service, regarding these sections (well, you need a few more tricks there, too - as a matter of completeness I'd like to mention I got help from here and here ). Then just run, and appearing Membership.aspx is quite self explaining. Of course securing that page will be obviously your next worry, but at least now roles/users can be managed, and they appear nicely into Azure Table Storage.
