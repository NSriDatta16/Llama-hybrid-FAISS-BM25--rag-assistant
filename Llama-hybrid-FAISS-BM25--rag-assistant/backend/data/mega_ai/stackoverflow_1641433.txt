Not really an answer, but since nobody else answered... When I load this page in IE8 (its all I have) the links work at first and then the text changes (literally, the font changes) and the links deactivate. So in my opinion something is interfering with your CSS. Maybe it is the JS or another element overlapping and causing issues. I would suggest the following troubleshooting steps. Use a new page on your dev environment. Work with only that link, its container and the JS/CSS associated with those two elements. Narrow down what you are working with. Pay attention to position, z-index and floats. Try to remove those if possible as they are the only suspicions I currently have. If you confirm CSS is not the problem then your issue is probably JS interference. I would suggest posting another question to address that.
