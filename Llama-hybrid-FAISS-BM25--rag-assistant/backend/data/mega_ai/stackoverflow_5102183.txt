best way to implement this on database level is to create 4 tables: USERS (you probably have this one) SKILLS PROFICIENCIES SKILLS_PROFICIENCIES (fk_userid, fk_proficiencyid,fk_skill_id) This way you won't waste space and your architecture will be more scalable and maintanable. You addressed problem of front end implementation. The best way remedy this is create database View (which DB engine u use?) with more "front end friendly" view of data. It's not a good idea to denormalize your schema to ease up front end development, mainly because data manipulations are the most fragile operations in information systems. Keep your schema clean and you will save yourself a lot of trouble in the future when scaling up and adding new features.
