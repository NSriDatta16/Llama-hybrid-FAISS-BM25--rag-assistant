Comparing lists of names in Excel, accounting for duplicate last names

I have two lists of names in Excel '07. Two columns in each file: first name and last name. I'd like to be able to tell which names in each list (name = first, last) appear in the other list. None of the methods I can think of account for more than one column at a time -- e.g., I can see how many "Smith"s there are, or how many "Albert"s, but I can't tell how many "Albert Smith"s there are. Thoughts? Edit: Obviously I can concatenate, but I'd like this approach to be generalizable to more than two columns of data.
