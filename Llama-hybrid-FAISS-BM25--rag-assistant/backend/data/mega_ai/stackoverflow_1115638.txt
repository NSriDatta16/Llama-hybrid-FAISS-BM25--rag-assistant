PHP cURL not returning XML

I'm trying to get character data from www.wowarmory.com using PHP and cURL. The code I have so far is: ... $browser = "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070319 Firefox/2.0.0.3"; $url = "http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Ner'zhul&n=Visar"; $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 15); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, $browser); $result = curl_exec($ch); The var_dump($result) is false, and if I try to parse the $result into an XML the $result is blank. What I'm trying to get is a characters XML file. ( http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Ner%27zhul&n=Visar ), but without the XSL attached. Then parse this, and extract info from the file, but I just need to get the file first.
