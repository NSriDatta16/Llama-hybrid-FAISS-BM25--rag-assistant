jQuery Plugin for multiple line-item forms

I have a form that acts as a frontend to entities in a 1:many relationship. The form lets the user edit the properties for the parent entity, as well as add, edit, and delete properties for the child entities. This is such a common scenario that I expect someone has already come up with an elegant jQuery plugin to help make a user-friendly form. However, I haven't found one yet (I don't think I'm hitting quite the right combination of Google keywords). Can anyone suggest a jQuery plugin that helps create forms for editing child entitites/line items?
