How can I upload my files to my static server from a production server?

I have django and django's admin setup on my production box. This means that all file uploads are stored on the production box, all the media is stored there. I have a separate server for files now ( different box, ip ). I want to upload my files there. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these methods I've thought about, and are there "better" methods you can suggest? Setting up a script to do an rsync on the production box after a file is uploaded to the static server. Setting up a permanent mount on the production box, by using a fileserver on the static media box such as nfs/samba/ssh-fs and then using the location of the mount as the upload_to path on the production box Information: Both servers run debian. EDIT : Prometheus from #django suggested http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-file-storage/
