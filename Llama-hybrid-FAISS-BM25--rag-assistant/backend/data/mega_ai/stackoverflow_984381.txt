A note about calculating CountDwn : Your "subtract 1 to reconcile" will, depending on how exactly the For loop works in the implementation language, (a) generate an "undeclared variable"-type error, (b) generate an "index out of range" error, or (c) subtract one IFF the last salary was exactly equal to the average. (Also, your code doesn't include an End For in Calculation , but I assume it should be immediately after the first End If in that function.) Instead of calculating CountDwn from CountUp (after all, every single salary could be equal to the average), I'd suggest including it in the loop: Calculation //Here Mean is found Set Mean = Sum / CountM For K = Step 1 to CountM //Here Number of Employees making more than the mean is found If Salary(K) > Mean Then Set CountUp = CountUp + 1 End If //Here Number of Employees making less than the mean is found If Salary(K) Note that CountUp + CountDwn is not necessarily equal to CountM .
