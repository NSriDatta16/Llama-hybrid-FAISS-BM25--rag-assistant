Structure of Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM, GRU)

I am trying to understand the architecture of RNNs. I have found this tutorial which has been very helpful: http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/ Especially this image: How does this fit into a feed-forward network? Is this image just another node in each layer?
