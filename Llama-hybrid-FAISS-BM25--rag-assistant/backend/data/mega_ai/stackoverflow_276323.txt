You can't. 301 is an HTTP return code that is directly acted upon by the browser. Many sites handle these two issues by first sending the user to a redirect-er page that tells the user about the change and then X seconds later sends them to the new page. But the redirect-er page must have a 200 code. One small variant is to detect search engine spiders (by IP and/or user agent) and give them the 301. That way the search results point to your new page.
