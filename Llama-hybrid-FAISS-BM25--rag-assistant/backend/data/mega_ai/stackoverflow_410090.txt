Yeah security. Using OpenId puts you at the mercy of them administrating their accounts. You have no control over password security and user ids. You are trusting some other organization to verify that the people coming to your site are who they say they are. If you need to really verify that someone is who they say they are. You won't get that with open id without doing some sort of secondary verification yourself. in which case you might as well just not use OpenId. http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9179224/Researchers_Password_crack_could_affect_millions
