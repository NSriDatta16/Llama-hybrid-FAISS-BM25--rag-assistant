Is it possible to use Cocoa Touch gesture recognizers with layers / CALayer objects?

Is it possible to use gesture recognizers with layers? Let's say I want to add several sublayers to my view and implement drag&drop as well as tapping on single element. Is it possible at all ? What is the best pattern?
