The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup is a must read. Effective C++ (Scott Meyers) is another book I found helpful. And to balance all this, read the C++ FQA ( http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/ ) - while not a book, it's a valuable resource, and I wish I had access to it when I was getting started with C++. Just don't let it discourage you.
