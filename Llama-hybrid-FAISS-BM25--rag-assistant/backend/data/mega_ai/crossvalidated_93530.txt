Which test is better suited to compare averaged versus single data sets

I have a light curve, that is photon count rate versus time, of an astronomical object. These data are periodic since the source signal is periodic. I can fold the data with the period and obtain an average profile. At this point, I want to check whether the single profiles are statistically different from the averaged one. Then, I was thinking to do a test between the average profile and the single profiles. This test could be a 2sets KS test, or a Chi-squared test, or others. I don't know which one is better suited for my purpose. Could you suggest/address me in this, please? [EDIT]: Here is a figure where the folded profile is shown in blue points, and the red line a tentative of smoothing the profile (not too relevant for this discussion) Also, here a small collection of "single-profiles" compared with the model from the red line in the previous figure http: fig1 , fig2 , fgi3 . EDIT 2: here is a cumulative plot (very preliminary).
