What are the contours lines on the Cook's list vs Leverage h_ii / (1-h_ii) plot?

According to the documentation, plot #6 of plot.lm in R: "In the Cook's distance vs leverage/(1-leverage) plot, contours of standardized residuals that are equal in magnitude are lines through the origin. The contour lines are labeled with the magnitudes." What exactly are these dotted lines? Source: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/plot.lm
