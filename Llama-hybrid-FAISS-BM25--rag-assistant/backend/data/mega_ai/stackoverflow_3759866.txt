When should I use -sreg in WiX' HEAT.EXE?

I'm using HEAT to autogenerate WiX fragments for a directory of files. The project I'm deploying is an ASP.NET project. When I tried to harvest a directory, HEAT generates RegistryValue entries that writes InProcServer32 entries for .NET DLLs. Using -sreg removes said entries. Questions: Should I even be using HEAT to autogenerate fragments? I've read everywhere that I should not be doing this. When should I use HEAT? Should I always use -sreg? What if I'm deploying COM objects? What is the downside of using -sreg when distributing .NET assemblies? *Sorry, new to WiX and deployment as a whole. :)
