What is the difference between SGD classifier and the Logisitc regression?

To my understanding, the SGD classifier, and Logistic regression seems similar. An SGD classifier with loss = 'log' implements Logistic regression and loss = 'hinge' implements Linear SVM. I also understand that logistic regression uses gradient descent as the optimization function and SGD uses Stochastic gradient descent which converges much faster. But which of the two algorithms to use in which scenarios? Also, how are SGD and Logistic regression similar and how are they different?
