Bootstrapping confidence interval for regression prediction

I want to use the regularized regression technique such as partial least squares (PLS), Lasso, and the elastic-net. However, as far as I know, there is no "standard" way of calculating the prediction interval for those methods. So can I use bootstrap (resample the training data, calculate the prediction) as a way to estimate the prediction interval? Will this method result in accurate coverage of the true mean response?
