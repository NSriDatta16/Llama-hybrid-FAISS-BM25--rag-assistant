Finding the highest, lowest, total, average and median from an array in Ruby

I am creating a boxplot generator in Ruby, and I need to calculate some things. Let's say I have this array: arr = [1, 5, 7, 2, 53, 65, 24] How can I find the lowest value (1), highest value (65), total (157), average (22.43) and median (7) from the above array? Thanks
