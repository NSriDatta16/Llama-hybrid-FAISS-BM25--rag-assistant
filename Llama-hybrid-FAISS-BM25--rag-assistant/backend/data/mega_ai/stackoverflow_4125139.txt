Picker in a ScrollView doesn't scroll

I have a UIScrollView, inside it, a small UIView containing a UIPickerView. I'm able to scroll the view up and down but whenever I try to scroll the picker, it scrolls the view instead. I can change the picker's value by clicking it but not scrolling. Any ideas? EDIT: I just tried scrollView.canCancelContentTouches = NO; but it only works when I first Touch and then Drag, as in the TouchesBegan event. The scrollView still scrolls if I touch-move the Picker as in the TouchesMoved event. What can I do to give my Picker its natural behavior in a ScrollView?
