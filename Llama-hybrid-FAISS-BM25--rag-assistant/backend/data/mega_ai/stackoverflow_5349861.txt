IE: CSS Misalignment issue in UL/LI

Im encountering a misalignment issue with IE. Below is a sample output. When IE creates a second line due to the long text, the whole paragraph gets mis aligned. Making the 2nd line pulled to the left. I want the first and second line to be aligned to the left. Just like a normal text-align: left will do. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v682/markeeh/alignment_tissue.jpg Below is the code: .ul_content-l { width:330px; list-style:square inside; margin-left: 295px; padding-left:1em; text-indent:-1em; line-height:16px; } Modular carpet offers hospitals and care homes a calming environment to speed patient recovery Hygienic guarding against bacteria through Intersept&reg; antimicrobial protection Improved patient comfort and well-being Therapeutic surroundings with less noise and less stress Use of colour and design for more cheerful facilities Hope someone other there is willing to help. Thanks. :)
