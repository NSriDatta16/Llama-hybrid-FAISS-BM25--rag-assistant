I'm not sure why you would not simply run a multiple regression with a GAM in your case (which should take care of the confounding), but if you want to do it in a 2-step process, it's possible and you should look of "double machine learning" for references and justification. Edit: for parametric models, a multiple regression is to be preferred also because it's not trivial to correctly forward the uncertainty of model 1 to model 2.
