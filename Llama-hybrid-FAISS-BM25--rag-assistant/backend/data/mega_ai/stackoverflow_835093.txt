Sql Server 2005 SSIS/Agent - Query status of a job

Is there a way to query the current status (executing, idle, etc) and the last result (successfull, failed, etc), and the last run time for a specific job name? The end result I am looking for is being able to display this information in an internal web application for various SSIS packages.
