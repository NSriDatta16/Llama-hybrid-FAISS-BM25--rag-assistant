Ditch the sprocs and create a new DBML file for your tables. Drag your tables in and bam! LinqToSql will create entity classes for you with methods for updating (creating.. etc). LinqToSql has a number of approaches for concurrency. One of the overloaded Attach() methods (used for updates) requires 2 params: the original entity and the new entity. LinqToSql will do what the ObjectDataSource used to do and compare the old values with the new and throw concurrency exceptions (it even makes handling concurrency exceptions much easier. +10 ..but that's not your question). Use this reference , particularly the section towards the bottom called With Complete Entities . It makes a lot of sense and shows how the different concurrency approaches are used and how to handle the exceptions. hav fun.
