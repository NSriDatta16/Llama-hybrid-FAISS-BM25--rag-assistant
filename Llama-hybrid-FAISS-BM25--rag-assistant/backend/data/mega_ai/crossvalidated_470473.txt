Minimum posterior probability for Bayesian changepoint analysis in R

I have the following data set: Here is the sample data for this: structure(list(V1 = c(7L, 6L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 2L, 5L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 6L, 7L, 8L, 6L, 10L, 7L, 9L, 5L, 1L, 4L, 5L, 5L, 2L, 2L, 5L, 1L, 2L, 4L, 0L, 3L, 6L, 3L, 6L, 1L, 5L, 3L, 4L, 0L, 2L, 4L)), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -40L)) I am using the bcp package in R to detect change points. bcp_x Questions: According to this tutorial, https://www.marinedatascience.co/blog/2019/09/28/comparison-of-change-point-detection-methods/ at least 70% of the Posterior probability should be exceeded to be considered as a significant changepoint. In my data set I can see two peaks around 10 and 19, but probabilities are 0.4 and 0.6 respectively. How true is this minimum 70% for the Bayesian changepoint threshold? Any thoughts on this? Maybe the Bayesian method is not appropriate for this data set? How can I determine the minimum probability to consider the peaks as significant? I'll appreciate any thoughts on this.
