How to test MSN Explorer?

A client is seeing bugs on their website using MSN Explorer. I can't reproduce those bugs with IE7 or any other browser, and I can't use MSN Explorer, because it requires a subscription to MSN. What is MSN Explorer based on? I assumed it was exactly the same as IE7 with a different interface, from wikipedia and the user-agent string. Is there any way to test it? I can't find any browser screenshot sites that have MSN. Is there any possibility it's just different enough from IE7 to have its own bugs, or should I look elsewhere?
