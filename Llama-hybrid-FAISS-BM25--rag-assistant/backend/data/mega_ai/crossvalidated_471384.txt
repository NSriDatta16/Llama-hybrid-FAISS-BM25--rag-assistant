The conditional distribution remains binomial, just with an additional predictor. Feel free to continue using logistic regression. Instead of having $log(odds)= \alpha+\beta x_{dose}+\gamma x_{disease}$ , you will have another variable for weight: $$log(odds)=\alpha+\beta x_{dose}+\gamma x_{disease}+\nu x_{weight}$$
