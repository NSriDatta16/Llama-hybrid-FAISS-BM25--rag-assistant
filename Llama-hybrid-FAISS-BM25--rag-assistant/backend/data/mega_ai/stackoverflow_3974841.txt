Display text in multiline inside a grid view in asp.net

I am using a grid view in my asp.net application. In one column i need to display description(minimum 5 characters. Maximum 255 characters).i am using a label to hold description in that grid view. But my problem is that if the description is larger it stretches in the browser and show it in one line. I want to display description in multi line (like a paragraph) I hope some one help me . the entire grid view code is shown below ' Text=' '> ' > '> &nbsp;
