Why are the ROC curves not smooth?

The following are some performance results that I got from the currently trained model on both the training and validation data sets. There are 3 classes with imbalanced training samples. I use the sklearn.metrics to compute the metrics with average='weighted' . And the following are the ROC curves (the first is from the training data set and the second is from the validation data set). Class 0 (denoted as C0 ) is the background class, Class 1 (denoted as C1 ) and Class 2 (denoted as C2 ) are the positive classes. I want to increase the accuracy on both C1 and C2 . The ROC curves seem to be not smooth. Is this a valid model? What can I get from these results? How to improve them, especially to tackle the class imbalance problem? Any comments are appreciated. Thanks! UPDATEDï¼š The source code is as follows:
