Is there a conventional meaning of $\bumpeq$ symbol in statistics?

I was reading a paper on Bayesian curve fitting ( Dimatteo et. al. Bayesian curve-fitting with free-knot splines, 2001 ) and came across the symbol $\bumpeq$ . It is used a few times throughout the paper but never explicitly defined. After a few google and stackexchange searches, it appears as though the symbol is neither widely used nor conventionally defined. Below I give an example with context from the cited paper. I apologize in advance for not defining any of the other symbols, but doing so would amount to copying over large portions of text from the paper I have linked to and would be of little use to the question. From p1059 (equation 8): Incidentally, we can also see this in the likelihood ratio approximation for the normal model in equation (6) by $$\frac{p(y|k^c,\xi^c)}{p(y|k,\xi)}\bumpeq\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\left(\frac{(y-B_{k,\xi}\hat{\beta})^T(y-B_{k,\xi}\hat{\beta})}{(y-B_{k,\xi^c}\hat{\beta^c})^T(y-B_{k,\xi^c}\hat{\beta^c})}\right)^{n/2}=exp(-\text{BIC}/2)$$ From context it seems that $\bumpeq$ represents an approximation. If this is case, then is it synonymous with more conventional symbols for an approximation like $\approx$ or $\sim$ ? or is it being used to represent a particular kind of approximation for which $\approx$ or $\sim$ would be insufficient or misleading?
