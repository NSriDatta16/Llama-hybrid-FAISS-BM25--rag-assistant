Value remains in form field after it is cleared in bean in JSF2

In my JSF2 application, I have "Clear" button, which is supposed to clear all the fields. However, it doesn't always work. My page fragment: And clear() method in my bean: public void clear() { entity = new Entity(); } If I enter values in the fields, and click "Clear", everything is cleared as expected. However, consider such scenario: 1. Enter value only in one field (both are required by JSR303 annotations on entity). 2. Click "Submit". Error message appears. 3. Click "Clear". Entered value remains. Why is it not cleared? Moreover, if I clear it by hand, and click "Clear", it returns to the field. I checked that it comes to the browser in partial response after clicking "Clear" button. I suspect it has something to do with view state. Moreover, if I add validator="#{bean.validate}" to the field, it enter this validation. Even if button has immediate="true" attribute. Why? Shouldn't immediate button ommit validation?
