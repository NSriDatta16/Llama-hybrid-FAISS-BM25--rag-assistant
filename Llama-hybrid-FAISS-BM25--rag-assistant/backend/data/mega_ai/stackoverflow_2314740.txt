if you would like to change your tables again, here is my suggestion: why don't you store two columns: RatingTotal and RatingCount, each user that rates it will increment RatingCount by one, and whatever they vote (5,4,4.2, etc) is added to RatingTotal. You could then just ORDER BY RatingTotal/RatingCount also, I hope you store which users rated each item, so they don't vote multiple times! and swing the average their way.
