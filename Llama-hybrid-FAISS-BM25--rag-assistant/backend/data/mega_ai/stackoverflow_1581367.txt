How to best organize files

Often, when doing a process or storing files I typically try to work with a workflow, or system. For instance, when I download a file, I sort it within a folder Programming/Downloads/Templates/ or Libraries, etc., and when I start a project I create a new folder for it within a workspace folder. This works fine, unless I need slightly more control, and when I go back, I typically have old projects within a different folder from a few years back, but typically with the same structure (and cannot find things before I setup a structure, or saved things in crazy places, like utilities for school in the school, not the programming folder.) How do you sort files or projects? Furthermore, after a certain point of time how/where do you backup / archive them?
