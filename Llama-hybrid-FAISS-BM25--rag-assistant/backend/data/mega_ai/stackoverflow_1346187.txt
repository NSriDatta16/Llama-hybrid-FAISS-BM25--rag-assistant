WinForms or WPF or Qt for Windows GUI with C/C++ as backend

I am to develop an application on windows. I have never done that before ;-) I need to do some heavy audio calculation, which has to be written in C/C++. This part will be a room correction algorithm which currently takes about 10 seconds per channel to run in Matlab. It has to be written in C/C++, since it might be ported to a DSP later on, which has to be programmed in C/C++. Additionally, I need a GUI to review calculations, visualize results and modify calculation parameters. The tough part of this GUI will be lots of plotting of spectra, spectrograms, audio waveforms and the like. Now, I hear that WPF is all the rage in Windows GUIs, but it seems to be limited to C#. Is there a simple way to integrate my C/C++ code with some C# GUI code? Or should I rather take WinForms and just write the whole thing in C++? Or would Qt work just as well and provide some cross-platform capabilities "for free"? I have some experience with C/C++, Matlab and VST-development, but I never wrote a real application and honestly, I don't even know where to start. Thank you in advance!
