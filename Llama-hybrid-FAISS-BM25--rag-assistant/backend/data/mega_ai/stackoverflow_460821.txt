You can start by looking into Cruise Control . There's also CruiseControl.net if that's your poison. Essentially though, you need the following ingredients: A dedicated environment (Virtual Machine/server. Don't use a developer's machine, unless it's just you. Even then, run a VM if you can. Much easier to move it to a server when/if one becomes available in your organisation) A source control system that supports labelled/tagged revisions (for example, Subversion + TortoiseSVN ) Build scripts. These can be batchfiles that start the devenv.exe or msbuild.exe applications with a command line, or you can use something like Ant or NAnt . In this scenario, CruiseControl acts as the Continous Integration server, and can make sure that you have builds done as you check in your code. This means you know whether the build is broken quicker than if you just had nightly builds. You should probably also have nightly builds, though.
