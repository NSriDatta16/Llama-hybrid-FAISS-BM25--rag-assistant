I tend to agree with @JoshD, but if you must store binary files such as digital video/audio in the database, SQL Server provides the varbinary datatype . Note that the default maximum length for this type is 8000 bytes - likely not enough storage for the average audio/video file. Note the use of varbinary(max) for data larger than the 8K limit: max indicates that the maximum storage size is 2^31-1 bytes.
