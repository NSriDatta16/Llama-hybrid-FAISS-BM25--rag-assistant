VS2010: Autogenerated files and XML documentation

This is really just re-asking this question asked about Visual Studio 2008 . Does VS2010 offer any feature to get rid of the CS1591 compiler warning for auto-generated code? CS1591: Missing XML comment for publicly visible type or member To quote the question for VS2008: This is an annoyance more than a problem. My project contains a number of autogenerated files (using mgmtclassgen.exe). When I generate the XML documentation, my beautifully commented library is plagued by xml documentation warnings from these autogen files. Is there a way to either a) suppress generating documentation for these files or b) suppress warning CS1591 just for a set of files? I obviously do not want to modify files that are autogenerated, even if to just add suppression pragmas. EDIT: In my case, the offending files are generated by WCF RIA Services, so the file that is generating the errors is the auto-generated WebContext class ( MyProject.BusinessApplication.Web.g.cs ). I cannot hand modify this file because it is generated on the fly, all changes will be wiped out. I also don't want to globally disable the warning, as it is helpful in my non-autogenerated code.
