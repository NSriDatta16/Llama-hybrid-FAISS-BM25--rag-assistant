Both XML and JSON are good for inter-applications communication. In Javascript, JSON is much easier than XML to deal with, so that's what I'd recommend. As for storage... both are terrible as large datastores I'm afraid. MySQL would work better than editing a file, but it's still not an appropriate solution for a chat, especially if you're on a shared host. You may want to take a look at SQLite, perhaps creating one file per chat room.
