I think it's the wrong approach to try and count the number of lines and determine functions based on that. For something like initialization code I often have a separate function for it, but mostly so that the Load or Init or New functions aren't cluttered and confusing. If you can separate it into a few tasks like others have suggested, then you can name it something useful and help organize. Even if you are calling it just once, it's not a bad habit, and often you find that there are other times when you may want to re-init things and can use that function again.
