Dealing with high noise data?

I am working with sensors on trucks which give me data with a lot of noise. The goal is to make a prediction to prevent failure in the system. I am having trouble with this for several reasons: The high noise sometimes gives me values that would raise an alarm but in reality does not affect the process in a way that the trucks should stop running, such as hitting a pothole and more. The data includes down time which greatly affects averaging of data. My question is what techniques I can use to reduce the noise of the data.
