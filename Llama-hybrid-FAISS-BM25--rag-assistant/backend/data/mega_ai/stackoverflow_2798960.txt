Worth it to use jQuery UI hosted by Google?

So I heard good reasons why to use the jquery hosted on google because of caching. But I am not sure about jQuery UI though. I am guessing that the jQuery UI file hosted on google has every single extension and plugin (such as Draggable, etc). So is that not kind of a waste if say your only using only jQuery UI tabs? to get all that other stuff with it. Also I see they have some of the templates up for the css files. I am guessing the caching would be the main advantage of using the hosted file.
