It seems like just 4 or 5 variables are almost always missing data, but the rest is pretty complete.. what are those variables? If they are entirely useless variables, then do you need to include them? By your numbers, those columns are missing for 95% of the values... As to possible approach, this comes down to what is your goal. If you just wanted to understand the relationship between crime and variables, then you could omit those variables. A model is supposed to be a simplification of reality, we almost never have all the information we really want. If instead you wanted to build a causal model, then issues such as omitted variable bias could really matter because an inflation of one the other variables due to the omission of the dropped one could attribute incorrect causal effect. So your approach depends on your goals and the importance of those variables. As to possible approaches, imputation is a common approach, and one popular strategy is the missing-indicator approach, where you add dummy variables for each missing variable that is one is that variable is missing for a given observation, and you replace the missing values all with the same value (a common one is to take the mean). Then you can think of the dummy as capturing the effect of missing that variable. You can also get fancier with some Bayesian models, but I know less about that. All of these will require certain assumptions about the underlying reasons the data is random, so be careful with any of these.
