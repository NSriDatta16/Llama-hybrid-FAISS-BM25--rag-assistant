Persistent Data with Javascript

I have an application that has a "parent" window. In the parent window there are menu items, like the following (using PHP here): // sample link echo " Shift Coverage "; // logout link echo " Logout "; Each link opens the appropriate page in a different "child" window. When the parent closes all of the child windows must close. I have implemented this functionality with Javascript, here is the function: var childWindow = new Array(); var windowCount = 0; function openurl(url) { if(url != 'logout') { childWindow[windowCount]=window.open(url,'_blank','height=600,width=800,scr\ ollbars=1'); windowCount++; if (window.focus) { childWindow.focus(); } } else { var iCount; for (iCount=0; iCount Here is my problem, when a user reloads the parent window and then clicks logout, the child windows remain open. This makes sense as the childWindow array is lost when the parent reloads. How can I make the childWindow array persistent through a reload? Thanks!
