There isn't a way to do this, script can be called in many different ways, there just isn't enough need for this to put it in the spec in any way. I would imagine there's a much simpler way overall to do what you're trying to accomplish, embedding inside individual elements and basing anything off the element's location doesn't' seem like a sound approach. So...what are you trying to ultimately accomplish here?
