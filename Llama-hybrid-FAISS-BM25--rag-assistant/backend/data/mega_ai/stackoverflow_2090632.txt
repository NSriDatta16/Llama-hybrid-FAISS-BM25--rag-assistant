"Keyboard not responding" in emulator?

I'm using Android 2.1 SDK on MacOS 10.6.2. When I try to run the standard Notepad app in the emulator, I get the expected messages from Eclipse [2010-01-18 17:42:24 - NotesList]New emulator found: emulator-5554 [2010-01-18 17:42:24 - NotesList]Waiting for HOME ('android.process.acore') to be launched...

A dialog flashes on to the screen too fast for me to read it. Then notepad starts (I have to "unlock" the screen manually by dragging the lock tag) Then there is a "Force close or wait" dialog that announces " Application Android keyboard (in process com.android.inputmethod.latin) is not responding. " The app won't do anything further at this point. I have not made any changes to the app. Has anyone else seen this error ? Does anyone have advice on how to avoid it ?
