WPF Paper-like control

I want to create a WPF control that look like a white sheet of paper floating inside a container of some sort. I want to be able to drag the paper around and zoom. I am rather new to WPF and I would like to know which control I should look into to create that. I presume the paper itself will be a inkcanvas, but what control should the container be?
