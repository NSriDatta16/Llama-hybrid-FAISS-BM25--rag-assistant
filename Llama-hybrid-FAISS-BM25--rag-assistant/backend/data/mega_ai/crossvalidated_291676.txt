Representing a distribution of probabilities

I'm running a simulation where, for every iteration $i$, I get a detection probabilities $P_i$. Because of the law of total expectation, I think the overall detection probability (i.e. marginalizing over all iterations) is just the average, $\langle P_i \rangle = 1/N \sum P_i$. But how do I calculate error-bars (lets say, the 1-sigma confidence region) for detection probability? The distribution of $P_i$ is highly non-gaussian, and non-symmetric around the mean: such that the the values of P for the 16th and 84th percentiles of $P_i$ are both below the average. So naively it seems like my "error bars" should be plotted in a completely different place than my average / overall detection probability. If this were a probability distribution, I would want to plot the median or mode, and then (something like) the 1-sigma region around it... but the median or mode of a distribution of probabilities doesn't sound quite right as meaningful to me.
