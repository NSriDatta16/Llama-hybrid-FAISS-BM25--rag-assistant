personalize webpart-problem in giving url to xml file in toolpart

I am creatng a webpart and I am tryng to reference xml from toolpart . I hv created custom properties and its fine if I set the default value to some url otherwise its showing msg fle not found. I want that if its the first time I am loading file it should display the message Open tool part to select the XML. I m doing lke ths: private string feedXML; [Browsable(true), Personalizable(true), Category("Example Web Parts"), DefaultValue(""), WebPartStorage(Storage.Shared), FriendlyName("MySetting"), Description("An example setting")] public string FeedXML { get { return feedXML; } set { feedXML = value; } } string xmlurl = String.Empty; string _xsl = string.Empty; // Load the XML xmlurl = web.GetFileAsString(GetRelativeURL(feedXML)); As the frst time webpart is loadng its quite obvious it wud be feedXML wud be null but I want to display the msg to user "Select XML frm toolpart" as we generally get when we add OOB webpart (like XML Webpart)
