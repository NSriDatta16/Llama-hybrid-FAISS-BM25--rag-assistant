A docx file is a renamed zip file. You could rename it to .zip and extract it out. However the docx is not a zip of a single file.. its a folder hierarchy with xml files in it. So you could extract it out and script a comparing utility like Beyond Compare to get the differences. I'm not sure how you would present the differences though ? Do you want to visually show the difference in the Word documents? e.g. this paragraph is missing in the second file etc.
