Hardware is cheap, Programmers are expensive . as profitphp said, the performance hit is negligable. What's a bigger waste of resources in the long run? the complexity of working in a tens of thousands of lines of code file, or the microsecond load time you'll save? I don't know your motives, but if reorganising your code will put you in a comfortable environment, go for it! Be careful when refactoring though, don't bite off more than you can chew. And use source control.
