A very basic solution in python without machine learning: import pandas as pd testFrame = pd.DataFrame({'id1':['dsads', 'bcdaa', 'bcdaa'],'id2':['daddg','kjfjd','abcde']}) testFrame['id1_shift'] = testFrame['id1'].shift(1) testFrame['flag'] = testFrame['id1'] == testFrame['id1_shift'] With the value for shift you can modify how many steps before and after each window you want to look. This, of course, does not account for similar sequences but only for identical ones. If you want to use ML because the method above becomes very tedious (I could not modify it right away for similiar sequences, though that should be possible), you may want to do something like a one-hot encoder on id1 and id2 , then change your dataframe to id1 , id1_previous , id1_pre_previous until the memory you want to explore is reached, and then train an algorithm on labeled data.
