time series forecasting using auto.arima and exponential smoothing

I am working with workersâ€™ remittance quarterly data for Bangladesh. Here I am doing time series forecasting using R. I am applying auto.arima model and exponential smoothing model. I want to compare between them to check which best fits the data and gives better forecast. Here is the output: fit1 Best model: ARIMA(2,1,3)(0,1,1)[4] summary(fit1) Series: lremit ARIMA(2,1,3)(0,1,1)[4] Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 ma3 sma1 -0.5024 -0.1691 0.3940 0.1516 -0.1899 -0.9605 s.e. 0.6321 0.4860 0.6298 0.4465 0.1060 0.1098 sigma^2 estimated as 0.007314: log likelihood=135.59 AIC=-257.18 AICc=-256.3 BIC=-236.84 Training set error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set -0.003608938 0.08398593 0.06532171 -0.09985958 1.110818 0.4381367 -0.004851439 fit1 ETS fit2 ETS(A,A,N) Call: ets(y = lremit) Smoothing parameters: alpha = 0.8594 beta = 1e-04 Initial states: l = 4.2135 sigma: 0.0858 AIC AICc BIC 12.20515 12.50145 23.97172 Training set error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set -7.229862e-05 0.08579429 0.06800397 -0.01942594 1.169213 0.4561276 -0.002900248 It is my first work using R and I am facing problems regarding this. They are: auto.arima output shows seasonality in every 4th quarter, but exponential smoothing shows non seasonality, what is the interpretation of this contradictory result? How can I compare between them, what is the proper measure? What is the command for in sample forecast in auto.arima? If I write h=0, then it shows error Where can I find elaborate interpretation of auto.arima and exponential smoothing output and about the comparison? Which error measure should I prefer like ME, MAPE, RMSE etc. as they are almost same for the two models? In case of auto.arima it shows same output for allowing drift or no drift
