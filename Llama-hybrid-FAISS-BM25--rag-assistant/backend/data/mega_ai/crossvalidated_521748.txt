Well, 96 values per day means you have data every 15 minutes. I think the best first step would be to aggregate to hourly if you can, then you would have a pretty standard hourly seasonal shape. Then you would still have multiple seasonal patterns to worry about but it would be much simpler IMO. You would have 24 for the daily pattern then potentially 24 * 7 to account for a weekly pattern. With that said, if you have patterns in your residuals that just means you are not accounting for those patterns in your model. Now should we change our order to pick up this signal in our residuals? No, I would fit to produce the best forecasts on validation sets, which is our ultimate goal anyway. If the residuals contain real signal then that would mean a different order could produce better forecasts, and if it is just noise then the new order would produce worse forecasts. There are tons of statistical tests for white noise and all that but the best test for us is to just test the forecast. If you are new to time series then I always recommend more plug and play models like fbprophet. It also handles multiple seasonality quite well which seems like your biggest driver.
