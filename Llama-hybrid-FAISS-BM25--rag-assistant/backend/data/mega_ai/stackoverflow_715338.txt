[...] but certainly all data has some sort of life span? Not any kind of life span we can talk about meaningfully. A lot of data is useless as soon as it's created or recorded. Such data could be discarded immediately with no effect. On the other hand, some data has enough value that it will outlive the current system that hosts it. If Amazon were to completely replace their current infrastructure, the customer histories they have stored would still be immensely valuable. As you said, it's relative. Each type of data has its own life span that has no relation to another type of data's life span. There's no meaningful "average life span of data".
