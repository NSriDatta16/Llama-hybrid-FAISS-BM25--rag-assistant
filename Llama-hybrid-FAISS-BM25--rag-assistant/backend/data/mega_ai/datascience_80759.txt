How can I picture an unfolded RNN as a normal Feed Forward Network?

I am currently working on a Transformer architecture. Trying to picture an RNN (or Encoder) as a normal Feed Forward network really confused me after looking at the following image in an article : (Image 1) I am usually used to seeing it like this: (Image 2) In Image 1, it shows that the input goes in ALL at once, whereas in Image 2, we see only a single input at a timestep. My two questions: Does this mean that Image 1 is a single node in Image 2? How can I picture an RNN-architecture as Image 1?
