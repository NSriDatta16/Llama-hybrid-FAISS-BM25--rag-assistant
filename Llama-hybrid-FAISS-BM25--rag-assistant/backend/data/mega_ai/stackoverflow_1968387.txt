I haven't encountered this, even though I've used the scroll bar for navigation a number of times. However, I have experienced inconsistencies when using a wmode (i.e. not the default windowed mode) such as "transparent" or "opaque". If you are using a wmode, (e.g. wmode="transparent" in your embedding HTML), try disabling it and see if that changes the behavior.
