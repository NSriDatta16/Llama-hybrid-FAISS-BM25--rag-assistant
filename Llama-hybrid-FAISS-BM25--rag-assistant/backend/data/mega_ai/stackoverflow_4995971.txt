Is it possible to do client-side page/DOM caching with localStorage?

I'm reading up on Local Storage in HTML5 , and I'm starting to view it sort of like a client-side version of how I use memcached. That got me thinking -- I currently do page-level caching in memcache. Is that possible with localStorage? That is, can an assembled page store itself (or, more importantly, maybe parts of itself) in localStorage such that the client doesn't have to work its DOM so hard next time the user shows up to a page? It seems to me that since things are only stored as strings this may not work unless there is some string to object transformation available.
