There won't be any hassle. Once you have your itunes account setup as a dev account (join the iOS developer program) you can setup your signing certificates (easy) and then create a provisioning profile with your the UDID of your friends device. Then it's just a matter of using the xcode organizer (or manually) to create an ipa file of your app that you can send by email. You might also want to check out http://www.testflightapp.com . The service is free and makes sending builds even easier since your friend will be able to install the build without iTunes.
