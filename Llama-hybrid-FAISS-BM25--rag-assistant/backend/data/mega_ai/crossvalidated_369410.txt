95% chance of 1.6 Standard deviation?

I'M reading a book on portfolio management and I can't understand how the author came up with 95% chance of volatility reaching 1.6 times..here's the excerpt: "Suppose that we were to forecast that equity volatility over the next five years(our investment horizon) would average 20 percent a year (the long-term average or close to it). An equity exposure of 60 percent in our portfolio would translate this to a 12 percent volatility (0.60 times 20 percent) from the equity risk factor. This means an approximately 5 percent chance, of a drawdown of 1.6 times the volatility, that is, a 1 in 20 chance of a drawdown of more than 19.2 percent." From what I remember from stats,in a normal distribution,95% equates to 2 STD and not 1.6. Shouldn't the 19.2% drawdown be 24%?
