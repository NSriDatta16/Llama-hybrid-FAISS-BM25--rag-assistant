How to run a selected set of unit tests in Eclipse with one mouseclick?

I want to create a launcher/run configuration which runs only the JUnit tests in a selected set of test classes or selected set of packages. Now it looks like I'll have to create separate run configurations for each of my packages containing the tests I want to run. I also have a recollection of this working in older versions of Eclipse. And yes, I know: The tests should be organized so that I wouldn't have this problem but reorganizing source folders right now is not an option. I'm using Eclipse 3.4.2.
