neural network: why can't I predict y=x*2?

I'm trying to understand some basics of neural nets and am trying to build one that can predict the function $y = 2*x$ in R: library(caret) library(nnet) v1 I end up getting all 1's for the answers. I'm able to predict other, more complex functions using a neural net, but, for some reason, I can't predict this function. Does anyone happen to know why that might be? Thank you! Bill
