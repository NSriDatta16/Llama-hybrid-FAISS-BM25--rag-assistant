MKAnnotationView in both hovering and pinned states

I'm trying to add a pin (MKAnnotation and MKAnnotationView) to my MKMapView and allow the user to drag it around. I'd also like to make the dragging of the pin animated and interactive like the iPhone's Map App. My question is how do I change the state of the MKAnnoationView so that it's hovering over the map (so the pin isn't actually inside the map)? I'm not 100% sure how to do this. At present, my colleague as found an hovering image that he swaps with the default MKAnnotationView, but that means I can't easily animate between the two.
