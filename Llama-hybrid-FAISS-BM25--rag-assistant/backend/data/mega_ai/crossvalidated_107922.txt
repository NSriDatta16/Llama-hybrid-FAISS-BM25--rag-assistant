Interpreting significance of Cragg-Donald F-Statistic for weak instruments

I have a first-stage F value of 9 for a model with 1 instrument and 1 endogenous variables, the mechanical rule of thumb of 10 would say my instruments are weak. However, I am reading the 2005 paper by Stock and Yogo, who have tabulated the critical values and I don't understand the interpretation of the following in the note to the table: the desired maximal size (r) of a 5% Wald test of β = β0 Also, would Anderson CC , Cragg-Donald, or KP tests for under identification be of any use in a just identified model with only one endogenous variable so there is no matrix rank to test as such. Also could anybody suggest any other tests?
