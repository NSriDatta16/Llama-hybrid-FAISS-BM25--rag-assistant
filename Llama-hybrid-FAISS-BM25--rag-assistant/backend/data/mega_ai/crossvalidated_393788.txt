Your interpretation is not correct. Cohen's d is a measure of effect size - basically, how many standard deviations does the outcome (e.g. executive function) change for the average treatment recipient. The tl;dr and extremely oversimplified explanation of a p-value is that it shows how surprised you should be at seeing whatever result you had. If there were truly zero difference between groups, what is the probability that you saw the results you did, given your sample size? That's a p-value. If you have a very small study, you need a large effect size for it to register as significant. Conversely, if you have an extremely large study, you could detect a very small effect size, e.g. a d of 0.05, but that effect size may not be practically significant. And that is why they were using Cohen's d : statistical significance and practical significance can diverge. The people doing systematic literature reviews need to consider both. Consumers of any research should consider both.
