Stefan's iframe solution works, but if that's not elegant enough, I find the following JavaScript also solves it: window.onunload = function(){}; That is, if your menu is JavaScript, then you might prefer to solve this issue with JavaScript too. The unload event handler definition idea came from this Firefox 1.5 article: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_Firefox_1.5_caching .
