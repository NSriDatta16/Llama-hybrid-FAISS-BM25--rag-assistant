You can use CREATE TABLE foo LIKE bar and an INSERT...SELECT statement. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/create-table.html says: Use LIKE to create an empty table based on the definition of another table, including any column attributes and indexes defined in the original table: CREATE TABLE new_tbl LIKE orig_tbl; The copy is created using the same version of the table storage format as the original table. The SELECT privilege is required on the original table. LIKE works only for base tables, not for views. CREATE TABLE ... LIKE does not preserve any DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY table options that were specified for the original table, or any foreign key definitions.
