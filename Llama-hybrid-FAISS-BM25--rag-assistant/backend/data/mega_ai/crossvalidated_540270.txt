Does Increased Parameter Size Always Mean Greater Memory Size for Inferences? Densenet vs Resnet

I was using DenseNet, a type of CNN, and while it does not use many parameters, I have heard that it is not very memory efficient. However, the question I had was if I just download the weights and use it for another application (an example is a smartphone) and run inferences, would only the parameter size be taken into account for how much memory it uses? Simplified: Resnet 10 million parameter --> training Densenet 1 million parameter --> training Densenet uses less parameters than resnet but more memory Resnet weights deployed onto phone Densenet weights deployed onto phone Will densenet use less memory for inferences on phone than resnet?
