Clustering of body kinematics time series

I have 100 participants performing the same activity (picking up a box from the ground) in their preferable way, and for every participant I have recorded time series of all trajectories and angles of their joints. I wish to cluster participants based on the way they performed the activity. I can use factor analysis to identify which trajectory/angle time series are important for the analysis but how do I proceed with clustering the time series?
