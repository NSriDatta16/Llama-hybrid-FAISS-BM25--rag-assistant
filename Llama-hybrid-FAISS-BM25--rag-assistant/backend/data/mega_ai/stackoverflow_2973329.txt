What about the other issues? No one but Marc answered :-( ECB vs CBC It seems to me that ECB should be left out, but CBC will offer better security with bigger block sizes. I have read about XTS mode used in TrueCrypt, because CBC with IV derived from block index didn't convinced them. Keystorage A disadvantage to store encryption keys inside a keystore per file is how encrytion on keys are carried out --> Only password (at least JKS and BouncyCastle KeyStores). I would like to encrypt them with my master key (say it is AES-256). Key generation I missed a key point. What about key generation enthropy? Where should I take a seed inside a mobile phone to get a rather "good" key. The keys to encrypt files should be generated on-the-fly without user intervention.
