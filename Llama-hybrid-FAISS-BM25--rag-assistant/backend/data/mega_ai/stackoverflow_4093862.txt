import subprocess outfile = "foo.txt" url = "http://some/web/site/foo.txt" cmd = "curl.exe -f -o %(outfile)s %(url)s" % locals() subprocess.check_call(cmd) Shelling out may seem inelegant but when you start encountering issues with more sophisticated sites, but curl has a wealth of logic for handling getting you through the barriers presented by web servers (cookies, authentication, sessions, etc.) wget is another alternative.
