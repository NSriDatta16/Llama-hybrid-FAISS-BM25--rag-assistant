No, there is no optimization like you describe, but feel free to write a method that performs a reverse+capitalize in one loop. Definitely check out the Benchmark standard library. When writing optimizations, always benchmark, never assume :) PS: reverse.upcase is still O(n). Big O notation disregards constants.
