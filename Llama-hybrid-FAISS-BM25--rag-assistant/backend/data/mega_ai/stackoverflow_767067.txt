The easiest and fastest way to do this? Find a mentor , or a set of mentors. Not necessarily a real-life mentor, they can be offline, although a real-life mentor is more practical. You can find these people when you participate in local software development communities, e.g., forums, or user group meetings. Frequent these places, both offline and online; the amount of knowledge that you will learn is immense, not to mention the benefit of being able to bounce ideas off of other people. Code Complete and Pragmatic Programmer are likewise excellent book suggestions above. I suggest you go with Code Complete first, as it tackles on how to make your code sensible and elegant, which you certainly can use immediately. Goodluck!
