There are limits imposed on the number of transactions that can be performed against a storage account and a particular partition or storage server in a given time period (somewhere around 500 req/s). So in that sense, there is a reasonable limit to the number of requests you could execute in parallel (before it will begin to look like a DoS attack). Also, in implementation, I would be wary of concurrent connection limits imposed on the client, such as by System.Net.ServicePointManager . I am not sure if the Azure storage client is subject to those limits; they might require adjustment.
