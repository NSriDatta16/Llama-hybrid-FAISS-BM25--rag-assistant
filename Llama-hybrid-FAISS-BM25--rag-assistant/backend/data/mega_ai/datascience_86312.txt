How to improve results from ML model? (spam classification)

I am trying to build a model that predicts if an email is spam/not-spam. After building a logistic regression model, I have got the following results: precision recall f1-score support 0.0 0.92 0.99 0.95 585 1.0 0.76 0.35 0.48 74 accuracy 0.92 659 macro avg 0.84 0.67 0.72 659 weighted avg 0.91 0.92 0.90 659 Confusion Matrix: [[577 8] [ 48 26]] Accuracy: 0.9150227617602428 The F1-score is the metric I am looking at. I am having difficulties in explaining the results: I think are very bad results! May I ask you how I could improve it? I am currently considering a model that looks at corpus of the emails (subject + corpus). After Erwan's answer: I oversampled the dataset and these are my results: Logistic regression precision recall f1-score support 0.0 0.94 0.77 0.85 573 1.0 0.81 0.96 0.88 598 accuracy 0.86 1171 macro avg 0.88 0.86 0.86 1171 weighted avg 0.88 0.86 0.86 1171 Random Forest precision recall f1-score support 0.0 0.97 0.54 0.69 573 1.0 0.69 0.98 0.81 598 accuracy 0.77 1171 macro avg 0.83 0.76 0.75 1171 weighted avg 0.83 0.77 0.75 1171
