Just use the bilinearity of the covariance function: $$\operatorname{cov}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n a_iX_i, \sum_{j=1}^m b_j Y_j\right) = \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m a_i b_j(\operatorname{cov}X_i, Y_j)$$ to get \begin{align} \operatorname{cov}(X_t,X_{t-j}) &= \operatorname{cov}(\phi_1X_{t-1}+\phi_2X_{t-2}+\epsilon_t, \phi_1X_{t-j-1}+\phi_2X_{t-j-2}+\epsilon_{t-j})\\ &= \phi_1^2 \operatorname{cov}(X_{t-1},X_{t-j-1}) + \phi_1^2 \operatorname{cov}(X_{t-2},X_{t-j-2})\\ & \quad +\phi_1\phi_2 \operatorname{cov}(X_{t-1},X_{t-j-2}) + \phi_1\phi_2 \operatorname{cov}(X_{t-2},X_{t-j-1}) \end{align} which gives a linear recurrence relationship that you can try and solve for yourself, or read up on how to go about doing so in your book. A very general relationship for time series defined by linear recurrences is that the "output" autocovariance function is given by the convolution of the "input" autocovariance function and the "autocovariance" of the characteristic function of the recurrence: $$C_o = C_i\, \star\, \left(\phi(x)\, \star\, \phi(x^{-1})\right).$$
