Just compute a CI for the sum (which is Poisson), and then back out a CI for the mean from that. If you can get an interval for $Y=\sum_i X_i$, you can figure out a CI for $Y/4$. You simply use properties of algebra on the probability statements in the CI. If $\mu_Y=4\mu_X$ and the probability that the random interval includes the (fixed but unknown) $\mu_Y$ is $1-\alpha$ then you manipulate the statement as follows: $P(c_l \leq \mu_Y \leq c_u)\geq 1-\alpha$ $P(c_l \leq 4\mu_X \leq c_u)\geq 1-\alpha$ $P(c_l/4 \leq \mu_X \leq c_u/4)\geq 1-\alpha$ Note that at each step the relationships between the limits and the thing between them is simply implied by things that are known/stated. Hence the $1-\alpha$ interval for $\mu_X$ is $(c_l/4,c_u/4)$, where $(c_l,c_u)$ was the interval for $\mu_Y$. Note further that if it were the case that the actual achieved coverage in the first inequality was $1-\alpha^*$ (due to discreteness in $c$ values): $P(c_l \leq \mu_Y \leq c_u)= 1-\alpha^*$ then $P(c_l/4 \leq \mu_X \leq c_u/4)= 1-\alpha^*$
