Allow RESTful DELETE method in asp.net mvc?

im currently setting up asp.net to accept DELETE http verb in the application. However, when i send "DELETE /posts/delete/1" i always get a 405 Method not allow error. I tried to take a look at the header: Response Headers Cache-Control private Pragma No-Cache Allow GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE Content-Type text/html; charset=utf-8 Server Microsoft-IIS/7.5, Private-Server Date Tue, 17 Nov 2009 18:30:31 GMT Content-Length 5590 Allow GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE notice the Allow header in IIS7, it's only allow GET HEAD OPTIONS and TRACE. I currently using [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Delete)] in my delete controller (i think this one is extended by MVCContrib, correct me if im wrong) PS: i send DELETE using Javascript: function _ajax_request(url, data, callback, type, method) { if (jQuery.isFunction(data)) { callback = data; data = {}; } return jQuery.ajax({ type: method, url: url, data: data, success: callback, dataType: type }); } and: _ajax_request($(this).attr('href'), "", function(d) { alert("submit"); }, "json", 'DELETE'); THank you in advance!
