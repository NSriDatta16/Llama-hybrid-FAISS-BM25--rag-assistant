to use the bounds of the drag, use the following (remembering to import flash.geom.Rectangle; ) startDrag(lockCenter, new Rectangle(leftCornerx, leftCornery, width, height)) if you want it to move back on moving out of the menu object then you want to either use a MouseEvent.ROLL_OUT or MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE event listener and test stage.mouseX / stage.mouseY , or run a hitTest. depends on how you have it set up on the stage.
