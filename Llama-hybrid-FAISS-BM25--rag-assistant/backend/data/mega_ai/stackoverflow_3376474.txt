Saving your code, HTML, and data in different folders is the most basic way of structuring your application - and that's the primary reason for implementing MVC: organization. The other design patterns present in most frameworks supplement MVC, and they promote code reuse, rapid development, etc. But you can do the latter even without MVC - all it takes is a code library! Most frameworks utilize the MVC design pattern, but MVC != frameworks. Some frameworks require you to tweak Apache (Lighty, Nginx, etc) to make it a framework extension. Pretty URLs are just a way of presenting input data (view) that are consumed by the controller so the latter can route to the appropriate handler. Seen in this light, .htaccess is an integral part of MVC for such frameworks. Before you plunge deeper into your project, it helps to do a little more research. Most frameworks have taken the convoluted approach to MVC, which have led many to confusion. Fat-Free Framework uses a more direct and easier-to-follow path.
