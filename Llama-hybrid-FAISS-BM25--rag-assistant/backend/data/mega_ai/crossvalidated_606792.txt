An even simpler code is to use directly a poisson regression with library(tidyverse) library(broom) d Some explanations If you look at the poisson model, you see that it models the probability $\pi$ as \begin{equation} \ln(\pi_{i}) = \mathbf{X_{i}} \beta \end{equation} the log of probabilities is a simple linear combinations of predictors. This is the same equation as the logistic equation which is called "logit" \begin{equation} \text{logit}(\pi_{i}) = \ln \left( \frac{\pi_{i}}{1 - \pi_{i}} \right) = \mathbf{X_{i}} \beta \end{equation} You can test this equivalence with a simple model. You start with this linear model \begin{equation} y_{i} = 2u_{i} + \epsilon_{i} \end{equation} set.seed(123) n = 100 u = rbinom(n, 1, 0.2) y = u*2 + rnorm(n, 0, 0.5) y_prob = plogis(y) # transform log(odds) into a proba y_bin = rbinom(n, 1, prob = y_prob) You can directly model the data with a logistic regression glm(y_bin ~ u, family = "binomial") Coefficients: (Intercept) u -0.09764 2.93085 This is the log of odds, which we can simply retrieve with a table data.frame(table(u, y_bin)) %>% mutate(p = Freq/sum(Freq)) $$ \begin{aligned}[ht] \begin{array}{rllrr} \hline & u & y\_bin & Freq & p \\ \hline 1 & 0 & 0 & 43 & 0.43 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0.01 \\ 3 & 0 & 1 & 39 & 0.39 \\ 4 & 1 & 1 & 17 & 0.17 \\ \hline \end{array} \end{aligned} $$ The coefficient of your logistic regression is the log odds-ratio of this table \begin{equation} \ln \left( \frac{\frac{0.17}{0.39}}{\frac{0.01}{0.43}} \right) = 2.930852 \end{equation} log((0.17/0.39) / (0.01/0.43)) 2.930852 This is exactly the same as modelling the table directly with a poisson regression Just prepare the table df_poiss = data.frame(table(u, y_bin)) Run the poisson, and the interaction will give you the log odds-ratio between the outcome and the predictor u glm(Freq ~ y_bin*u, data = df_poiss, family = "poisson") Coefficients: (Intercept) y_bin1 u1 y_bin1:u1 3.76120 -0.09764 -3.76120 2.93085 The problem is that you can always transform dummy variables into counts for the purpose of using a poisson model. But you often cannot use aggregated counts to revert back to dummies for using logistic regression. A final note if you look closely at the two equations, the logistic model (the logit transformation) once exponentiate will give you odds , while when exponentiating the poisson, will give you a probability (or risk). However, when you take an interaction with the poisson, then you have a ratio of odds, which is the same as the logistic model.
