Why is training a deep convolutional neural network taking longer time than anticipated?

It's taking me over 4 days to train a deep learning network with just 10000 images of 224px x 224px x 3 channels size, with batch size 25. The machine has 32GB RAM, a Core i7 CPU, and a GTX 960 GPU. I'm further using matconvnet and cudnn . Instead of training from scratch, I am using the ready made vggface model. My question is: what could be the reason for the long training time and how could I fix this?
