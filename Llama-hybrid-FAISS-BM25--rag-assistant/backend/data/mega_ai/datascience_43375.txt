When projecting data with UMAP, should I use only the samples I need projected or the entire dataset?

I have a neural network that maps my data samples to a 64-dimensional embedding. I wish to visualize a few of these embeddings (between 30 and 600) through a 2-dimensional projection, and I plan to use umap to do that. Would providing more embeddings sampled from the dataset along with the ones I want to project help the algorithm to identify the manifold and improve the quality of projection?
