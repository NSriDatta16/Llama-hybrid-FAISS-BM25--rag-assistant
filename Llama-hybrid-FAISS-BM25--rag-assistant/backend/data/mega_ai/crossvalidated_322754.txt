Neural network with fixed length string data - how to code and what about unbalanced datasets

I have a dataset of about 990,000 data with two categories. The data is highly unbalanced (about 2% in one of the categories). Every item is a 12 letter length string that can contain 4 letters (say ABCD). I was suggested to use neural network for this data. How should I code the . strings as input? Using dummy coding like '1A', '1B', '1C', '1D' etc. and give 1 where it is true and 0 for false leading to 4x12=48 features? Or could I use a kind of categorical variable: 12 features with 4 possible values (A=1, B=2, etc.)? Does neural networks better work with balanced datasets or could I use it with unbalanced data?
