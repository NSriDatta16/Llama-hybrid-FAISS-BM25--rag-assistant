WSS 3.0 navigation structure

I'm a beginner in WSS 3.0 and I'm having some problems with the navigation setup. I can't find any documentation that clearly recommends best practices in this area. I'm trying to create an intranet, custom look and feel, that should have a structure similar to: Company - News - News type 1 - News type 2 - Organogram - ... Employees - Employees 1 - Employees 2 - Employees 2_1 - ... How to properly set this up? Company, News, are sites/subsites? And News type 1 and 2 are pages within a site? I created as described above and in the master page of the main site I added some scripts that will be used by web parts, like jquery. The subsites will have their own master page and will not recognize the scripts, I need to add them there which is annoying. Any recommendations? Or some resource that provides best practices setting up these structures? Thx in advance
