First of all, I think there is a (small) distinction between a web/app and a client/server app. The webapp is a kind of client/server app where the server is completely out of the customers' control, and the client is a browser. A client/server app is one where the customer owns and controls both the server and the client. Your case sounds more like a client/server app, not a webapp per se. In addition to all the reasons everyone mentioned regarding why webapps are more attractive, don't forget to include that most of them provide a free version. Not just a time-limited or crippled version, but a free version which you can keep using forever or until they discontinue it (in exchange for some thing of course, your personal data, attention for ad revenue, etc). That is a huge incentive (since most of the freeloaders wouldn't care to pay for the app anyway) in addition to the no install and no upgrade advantage. If you need to retain copies of your data though, and you are a hardcore "creator" rather than just a consumer, then a hybrid desktop app that syncs to a server is a much better solution in my opinion.
