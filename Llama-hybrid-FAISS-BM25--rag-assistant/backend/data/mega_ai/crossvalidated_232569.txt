I don't think the answer is obvious. Without figuring out their notation and possibly getting my pencil out, I can't get you all the way to an answer. But I think the following will get you pretty close: In general in SVMs, if you can find at least one $\alpha_i$ "not at bound", then you can find $b$ in a straightforward way (which amounts to your Eqn 1 in this context). Otherwise, according to the paper " A Note On Support Vector Machine Degeneracy " by Rifkin et al., the problem is degenerate, which means it has a solution for which $w=0$. Moreover, according to their Lemma 6, the solution has $b=1$ if there are more training examples in the positive class, $b=-1$ if there are more training examples in the negative class, and $b \in [-1,1]$ if there are equally many examples in each class. This must reduce to their claim in Eqn 2 for their special case.
