How to identify new potential customers from existing customers profile?

I have firmographic data of all the possible customers. Data includes sales, profitability, capital, organisation size, geographic location, industry, etc. What is the best way of identifying new potential customers from this data? I want to identify customers matching my existing customer profile. For example, companies from XX industry and YY Sales are likely to buy, or profitable companies with the employee size NN are likely to buy. I want to understand these patterns from existing customers, and potential customers with similar profiles should be identified. Is it possible to create a predictive model with the data? If yes, what is the approach for it? Or is clustering the preferred approach for similar problems?
