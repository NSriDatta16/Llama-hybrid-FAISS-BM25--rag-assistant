HTML id attributes have to be unique in the context of the whole document. You can hack it or rethink it. If you decide to rethink - consider also global variables. Help in rethinking: if you use ids to recognize objects you can use patterns like this: w11-22222 where w is just a letter (ids shouldn't start with a number), 11 is a window numner, - is a - ;) and 22222 is the id you used up to now. When you need the old id it's just id.substring(4) global variables should be replaced with a global object holding arrays/objects containing information about windows etc. Just a thought: It is possible to engeneer the interface in a way you would not need ids to get windows. When creating a window do: var $awindow=$(' ')...//build upon it with attr and append $awindow.appendTo('body'); AwesomeGlobalObjectToControllStuff.rememberWindow('the key to find it',$awindow); And then use the object to return the $awindow from its storage.
