XGBoost: how to adjust the probabilities of a binary classifier to match training data?

Training and testing data have around 1% positives, but the model predicts only around 0.1% as positives. The model is an xgboost classifier. I’ve tried calibration but it didn’t improve much. I also don’t want to pick thresholds since the final goal is to output probabilities. What I want is for the model to have a number of classified positives similar to the number of positives in the actual data.
