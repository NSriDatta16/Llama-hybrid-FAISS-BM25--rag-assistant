why String.class == "test".class

Anyone have any idea, why the == sign works on .class comparison? Besides, the javadoc for getClass() method as Returns the runtime class of this Object. The returned Class object is the object that is locked by static synchronized methods of the represented class. The actual result type is Class where |X| is the erasure of the static type of the expression on which getClass() is called. For example, no cast is required in this code fragment: Number n = 0; Class c = n.getClass(); What does the "object locked by static synchronized methods" means?
