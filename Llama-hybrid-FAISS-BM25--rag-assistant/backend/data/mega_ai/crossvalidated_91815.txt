Extreme value distribution for multivariate normal

I have a series of data sets. Each data set represents a measurement in 3D space relative to a global origin. I want to model the extreme values of my data. If I were to calculate the extreme radius and use that would I still expect a gumbel distribution? Alternatively I could produce a separate model for each axis if necessary but this is not as elegant as a single model. Ideally I would like to be able to predict the probability that a future experiment will have an extreme value less then X. Is there anyway I can determine the parameters of the extreme value distribution from my normally distributed data? I have done some testing and it appears that I could reasonably assume that all my data sets are sample from the same population so I could assume this. Or, is it necessary to perform an MLE fit. I appreciate this functionality is available in most analysis software I was just curious how much one can tell about the properties of the EVD from the mean and standard deviation from which the extreme values are drawn.
