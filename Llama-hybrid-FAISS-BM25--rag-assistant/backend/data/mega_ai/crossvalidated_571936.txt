in linear regression it is very important to cut those variables if they are not related in a linear way This is not true in general. As you can learn from the What is the benefit of breaking up a continuous predictor variable? thread, binning loses information and is not recommended strategy for creating features. If you need to model non-linear relationships, you can use transformations that are continuous like polynomials. Binning is a rather primitive way of creating features, definitely not the default approach. As for neural networks, the point of using them is that they can learn features and model non-linear relationships by themselves, so creating such features is not useful. That said, there are cases where feature engineering may be useful as you can learn from the Utility of feature-engineering : Why create new features based on existing features? thread.
