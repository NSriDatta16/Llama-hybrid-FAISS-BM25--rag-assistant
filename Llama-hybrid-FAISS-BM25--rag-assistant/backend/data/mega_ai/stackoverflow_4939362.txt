In my experience, a single developer should be working on the project until it matures enough to allow for outside help. That single developer should set guidelines and standard styles to be used throughout the application, so that people need not add a new style for each element. Try and have the initial developer review all new stylesheet changes as they're added to the repository initially, so that developers that are new to the project are made aware of utility classes, or conventions, that exist. It would also help if you had some kind of stock system theme that you always start with -- that way people know the score at the start of each project and have no excuse to mess up your organised CSS :) As @cHao points out, when a whole bunch of developers get involved make sure they never add directly to the end of the file. That's the single biggest cause of conflicts that we experience and can be easily avoided.
