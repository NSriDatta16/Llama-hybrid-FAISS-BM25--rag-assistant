I have been a member on stackoverflow for over 6 months now but the amount of knowledge I have gained over here in these 6 months was quite surprising. My strong field being SQL and C#, but being in stackoverflow just showed me how much more is out there in world which we are not aware of. Since the stackoverflow is lead by community people and the community has given me so much more knowledge at one common place than what I would've got going on normal google way. So here is the strong reason to give something back to the community from my side and hence nominating myself for the moderator post. Being a moderator, I can give my best not only in terms of giving correct answers and stuff, but also helping people with questions which are badly formatted, correcting some arrogant people and keeping the community clean. In general my strong points for being elected as moderator are - patience showing respect for the fellow community members in their actions and words open to resolve any disputes regarding any questions or answers or any other disputes regarding the website itself. Without taking much more time on this, I will be eagerly waiting to do my bit for the community being a moderator. Even otherwise I would continue to work with the community on stackoverflow anyway. Thank you all.
