Creating an AJAX toggle-image in ASP.NET MVC

So I wanted to create a toggle-button for a table, where I can make an async call to update a database record (enable/disable). After some trial and error, I have managed to get it working - but it feels like there must be a more elegant way. I don't like repeating my image-tag in my controller, obviously... How can I avoid that in an elegant way? Is there an overall better way to approach this that what I have done? Here is my code in the controller: public ActionResult ToggleEnabled(int id) { if (Request.IsAjaxRequest()) { var p = this.PageRepository.GetPage(id); p.Enabled = p.Enabled != true; this.PageRepository.Edit(p); return p.Enabled ? Content(" ") : Content(" "); } return Content("Error"); } And the view...: ... ", Model.ID, Model.Enabled ? "tick.png" : "tick_grey.png"))%> ... The trick/hack with the Ajax.Actionlink using an image was found here .
