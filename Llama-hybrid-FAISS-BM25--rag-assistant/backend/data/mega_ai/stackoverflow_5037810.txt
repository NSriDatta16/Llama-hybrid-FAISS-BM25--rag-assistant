JPA 2 query giving strange behavior on OR clause

I have a JPA 2 query that is driving me nuts. A SurveyQuestion may have an Organization. Here's the mapping within SurveyQuestion @ManyToOne( optional=true ) @JoinColumn( name="organization_key" ) private Organization organization; Organization has a field named key. I create a TypedNamedQuery with the following jpql SELECT q from SurveyQuestion q where q.organization IS NULL or q.organization.key = :organizationKey with that query I only get the questions that have the given key. If I remove the q.organization.key = :organizationKey from the query, then I get all those that have no organization, but I can't for the life of me get it to return the combination of those that have no organization or have the given organization. JPA2 with EclipseLink provider.
