Here is my take at it. Let's start with the two very broad categories: anything that even just pretends to be smart is artificial intelligence (including ML and DM). anything that summarizes data is statistics , although you usually only apply this to methods that pay attention to the validity of the results (often used in ML and DM) Both ML and DM are usually both, AI and statistics, as they usually involve basic methods from both. Here are some of the differences: in machine learning , you have a well-defined objective (usually prediction ) in data mining , you essentially have the objective " something I did not know before " Additionally, data mining usually involves much more data management , i.e. how to organize the data in efficient index structures and databases. Unfortunately, they are not that easy to separate. For example, there is "unsupervised learning", which is often more closely related to DM than to ML, as it cannot optimize towards the goal. On the other hand, DM methods are hard to evaluate (how do you rate something you do not know?) and often evaluated on the same tasks as machine learning, by leaving out some information. This, however, will usually make them appear to work worse than machine learning methods that can optimize towards the actual evaluation goal. Furthermore, they are often used in combinations. For example, a data mining method (say, clustering, or unsupervised outlier detection) is used to preprocess the data, then the machine learning method is applied on the preprocessed data to train better classifiers. Machine learning is usually much easier to evaluate: there is a goal such as score or class prediction. You can compute precision and recall. In data mining, most evaluation is done by leaving out some information (such as class labels) and then testing whether your method discovered the same structure. This is naive in the sense, as you assume that the class labels encode the structure of the data completely; you actually punish data mining algorithm that discover something new in your data. Another way of - indirectly - evaluating it, is how the discovered structure improves the performance of the actual ML algorithm (e.g. when partitioning data or removing outliers). Still, this evaluation is based on reproducing existing results, which is not really the data mining objective...
