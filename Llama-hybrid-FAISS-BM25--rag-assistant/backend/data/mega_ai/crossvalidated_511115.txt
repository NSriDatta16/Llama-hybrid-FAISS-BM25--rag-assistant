What you are seeing is not likely to be seasonality. Evgeny Slutsky, I think in 1922, showed that "additive errors" produce a sinusoidal pattern, when the shocks are independent. In other words, if you have a model such as $w_{t+1}=Rw_t+\epsilon_{t+1}$ then, even though this is a linear equation, you will get a sine wave effect. Using Excel, you can induce this yourself by adding a normal random variable. Second, a time series like this will have autocorrelation. Your top line is an autoregressive process, most likely, and your bottom line is a moving average process and both will have autocorrelation. Third, let us assume that the top line is $w_{t+1}=Rw_t+\epsilon_{t+1},R>1.$ If that is the case, then no standard solution to solve for $R$ exists using anything that minimizes squared loss. You cannot use Excel to solve this. Because of that observation, it is probable that any correlation would be spurious. Note that if you did not believe that your wealth would increase over time, then you would not invest, so $R>1$ must be true. Somebody may be able to show, by theorem, that any correlations would be spurious, but as we have a pretty good proof that no squares minimizing solution exists that is well-behaved, it isn't unlikely that any Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient would be spurious as well. Finally, if you are running a procedure on many stocks, some stocks will have you scratching your head because they will represent natural, but extreme, behavior. That does not imply that there is anything unusual or abnormal about the security. A purely average security, where every investment has an identical rate of return, will be at extremes due to a random pattern of independent shocks. You can test that in Excel too. Create a hundred similar time series, each using random, normally-distributed shocks. A few will look very weird in both directions. Also, if you would look at them with some metric, any metric will do, some of them will be extremes as measured by that metric. That is true even though they use identical growth rates in the software.
