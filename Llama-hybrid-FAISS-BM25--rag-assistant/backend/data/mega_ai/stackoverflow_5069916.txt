PHP, strip_tags stripping \n in text area. How to stop it?

I would like to be able to accept \n or \r\n and convert them to for use in the page. Although when a user submits a text area with new paragraphs, the strip_tags function seems to strip them right out. Anything I can do to keep these in the string? Thanks!!!
