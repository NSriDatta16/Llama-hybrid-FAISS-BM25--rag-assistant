Kernel PCA on each data set, not the whole matrix - Possible?

I have a matrix $X$ that has $M * n$ in size. I'm going to apply that with PCA. The problem is that $X$ contains nonlinear structures. So one good thing is to use The Kernel Trick. My data is orginized as $$X = \begin{bmatrix} x_1\\ x_2\\ x_3\\ \vdots\\ x_N \end{bmatrix}$$ Where each $x_i$ has the size $m * n$ . The matrix $X$ , as you understand, has the same column width as each $x_i$ . $M = m*N$ Question: Normally, people do kernel directly on $X$ . That will result a matrix with size $M * M$ . Very large. What if I did kernel on each $x_i$ instead and get a $X$ matrix that has the size $M * m$ instead. Will this work for projection, or will this fail? Consider that every $x_i$ is an image matrix.
