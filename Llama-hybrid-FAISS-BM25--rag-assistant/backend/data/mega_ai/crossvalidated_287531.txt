Panal data, simple model averaging in R

For my master thesis I working on model averaging for panel data. So far I was not able to use common model averaging packages (BMS, BMA) because I use panel data (plm regression first differences). My first question would be, is it possible to use those packages with panel data? If not, I managed to construct a restricted (pvalue > .1 and sign restriction for economic data) model space but I don't know how to proceed. Is for example a equal weight average of all models simply to average the different model coefficients? y = x1 + x2 y = x1 + x2 + x3 How would you average those two models (equal weights)?
