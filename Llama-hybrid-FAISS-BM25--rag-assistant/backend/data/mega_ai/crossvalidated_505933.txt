Yes, but it's tedious and time-consuming. The algorithm for random forests is presented on Page 588 of Hastie et al. Elements of Statistical Learning . Just follow the instructions. Probably not. Computers will use a different randomization method than you will when constructing the random forest by hand. This is because random forests are random , so the results will depend crucially on the results of the randomization. Another useful resource for learning about random forests is Leo Breiman's 2001 paper " Random Forests ."
