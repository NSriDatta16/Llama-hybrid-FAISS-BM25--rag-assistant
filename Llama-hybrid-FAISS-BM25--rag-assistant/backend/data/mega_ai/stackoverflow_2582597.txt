The easiest way to fix your problem is at the top of all of your header files add: #pragma once Do this always everytime you make a header file in C++. If your compiler doesn't support the above (I seriously doubt anyone uses a compiler that doesn't support it, Visual Studio which you use does) then you can use include guards . The #pragma once directive ensures that your includes will only be included once. You will get the error you got if you have the following situation: file: a.h #include "b.h" file: b.h #include "a.h" Then in your main app you include one of the 2 header files. You can fix your situation by doing the following: file: a.h #pragma once #include "b.h" file: b.h #pragma once #include "a.h"
