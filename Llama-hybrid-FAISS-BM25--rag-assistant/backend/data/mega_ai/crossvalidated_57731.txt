There are a number of different clever algorithms to try to reduce the number of support vectors, but if your problem is ill-conditioned or you are using wrong parameter values, there is not much you can do. Is your problem well balanced?. I often come across with the problem, that data is highly imbalanced (there are very small number of samples of a given class). If that is the case, you will end up with a higher number of SVs. Also, using the proper kernel for the problem makes a difference. You may want to go through this short guide . It gives you good advice on how to use SVMs and deal with some common problems.
