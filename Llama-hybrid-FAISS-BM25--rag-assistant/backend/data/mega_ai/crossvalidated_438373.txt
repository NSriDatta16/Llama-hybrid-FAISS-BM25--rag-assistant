I believe that our problem is that we are jumping directly to ARIMA model without trying the traditional models. for this reason, you can find the model is not giving the needed results. In your case, I tested your data, I found that there is a seasonality every 12 months which is clear for you, but also I found that a simple moving average of 3 terms Seasonal adjustment: Multiplicative is the best model. In my opinion, We have to try the traditional forecasting algorithms before jumping to any advanced technique.
