You have to run the link through your site first. For example, the link in the email could be http:// /Q9xDH364 And this link could take them to a special page on your site. On your site, if you detect the user agent from an iPad/iPhone/iPod, you can display an alert that says something like: If you have "MY APP" installed on your device, you can view this link in your app Then, if the user presses ok, translate the http:// /Q9xDH364 link into a link your app can get, such as my_app:// /Q9xDH364 This works well for my app, Ambiance . For an example, go to http://snd.am/35 from your iPhone and your browser and see the differences.
