Replacing binary logistic regression with multinomial logistic regression?

I am reviewing a study. It's authors wanted to investigate which of the care settings were more often used by women and which by men. Adjusting was done for age, comorbidity status. There were a total of 10 care settings. Thus, they did the following: Binary logistic regression sex ~ care_settings + covariates for adjusting But IMHO they should have been used multiple logistic regression care_settings ~ sex + covariates for adjusting Could you have a comment on that. Is their approach correct?
