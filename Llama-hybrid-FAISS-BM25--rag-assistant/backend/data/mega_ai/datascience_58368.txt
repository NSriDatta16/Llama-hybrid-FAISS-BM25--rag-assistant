Evaluating randomness in a model performance

I'm evaluating the variability in performance (AUC) in the test set of a machine learning model with an intrinsic random component (xgboost). How many sources of variation should I use? Just replicate the analysis harnessing the model intrinsic randomness? Bootstrap the train set? Bootstrap the test set? Bootstrap both train and test? Thanks
