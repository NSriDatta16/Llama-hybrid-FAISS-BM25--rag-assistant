We probably released the framework a little prematurely, but we are very serious, and this is not a hobby project. We have been using it in commercial application development for over a year now. You do raise some excellent points about things we are missing. We are currently using Assembla as a repository, but we will soon be moving to something else so that we can make it public. Unit testing and licensing information are also on the way. If those are the only things you are concerned about, that's great news =). Our biggest goal was to build a framework that leverages the advantages of a procedural language like PHP, speeds up development, and just makes sense. We have used a lot of frameworks before, and while they all have their strengths... none of them are what we, as developers, need in a framework. While that is a very subjective statement, I believe Jackal makes some serious improvements on other frameworks that developers will come to love. In short, we really appreciate you taking the time to give Jackal a chance, and hope you will continue to follow our progress as we add more "professionalization" to our framework. =) Best Regards, Jackal Team
