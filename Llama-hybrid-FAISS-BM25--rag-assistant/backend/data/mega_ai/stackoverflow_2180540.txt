Using game of life or other virtual environment for artificial (intelligence) life simulation?

One of my interests in AI focuses not so much on data but more on biologic computing. This includes neural networks, mapping the brain, cellular-automata, virtual life and environments. Described below is an exciting project that includes develop a virtual environment for bots to evolve in. "Polyworld is a cross-platform (Linux, Mac OS X) program written by Larry Yaeger to evolve Artificial Intelligence through natural selection and evolutionary algorithms." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyworld " Polyworld is a promising project for studying virtual life but it still is far from creating an "intelligent autonomous" agent. Here is my question, in theory, what parameters would you use create an AI environment? Possibly a brain environment? Possibly multiple self contained life organisms that have their own "brain" or life structures. I would like a create a spin on the game of life simulation. What if you have a 64x64 game of life grid. But instead of one grid, you might have N number of grids. The N number of grids are your "life force" If all of the game of life entities die in a particular grid then that entire grid dies. A group of "grids" makes up a life form. I don't have an immediate goal. First, I want to simulate an environment and visualize what is going on in the environment with OpenGL and see if there are any interesting properties to the environment. I then want to add "scarce resources" and see if the AI environment can manage resources adequately.
