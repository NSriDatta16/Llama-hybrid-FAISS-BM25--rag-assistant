How to model my data with linear mixed models for contrasts analysis

I have a dataset containing one dependent variable which is the concentration of antibiotic needed to kill a bacteria, which was measured for several different antibiotics for three different microorganisms. The antibiotics are also divided in two groups based on their origin (synthetic or natural). The data can be described as follows: $ ID: Factor w/ 3977 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 4 5 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ... $ OR: Factor w/ 2 levels "natural", "synthetic": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 ... $ MC: Factor w/ 3 levels "M1","M2","M3": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ Y : num 1.745 0.125 2.301 -1.615 -2.026 ... Additionally, as you can see the dataset is quite unbalanced and as a lot of missing values. MR OR M1 M2 M3 natural 1267 1032 400 synthetic 2129 2044 944 I have specified a couple of formulas for the lmer() model. (a) Y ~ OR * MC + (1|ID) (b) Y ~ OR + MC + (1|ID) (c) Y ~ OR + MC + (OR+MC|ID) For model (a), Anova with type 3 error showed that OR:MC is not significant. Model (b), shows a slope on the residuals, so i tried model c. Model (c) does not run in R (Error: number of observations (=7816) The slope in the residuals can be attributed, from what i understand, to several issues, poorly specified random effects or autocorrelation. The fact is that there might be autocorrelation as some antibiotics differ from other antibiotics in just a few atoms. Any idea on how to properly specify the model? Edit: y=residuals; x=fitted y=residuals; x=observed Model d (with a random slope and intercept for all levels of OR:MC) (b) Y ~ OR * MC + (OR:MC|ID) I believe both model b, c and now d are well specified, model b as a logLik of -7981, c of -7944 and d of -7933. Suggesting d is the better.
