Is my data ordinal or interval?

This may seem like a really simple question but I think my data straddles the line between interval and ordinal and I'm not sure quite how to treat it. Simply, participants have to estimate the time between two events by selecting 1 of 4 intervals which they have been previously trained to identify. The 4 options are 200ms, 400ms, 600ms, and 800ms. At face value the data seems to be interval; the options are ordered, and each one separated from its neighbour by the same meaningful interval. However, does the fact that there are only 4 possible options mean that the data is more ordinal than interval? Each participant is exposed to 8 presentations of each delay during the experimental phase, I don't know whether I can reasonably average their responses (which would be possible if the data was interval) or whether I should look at the number of times they selected each interval (like I would if it was ordinal).
