Can you recommend neural network suitable for finding minimum and maximum of numbers in list with some noisy data?

Let's have a list of integer numbers. These are generated about some "center" value with some tolerance +/-. I call this the "range". Also - there is some noise - the numbers are not in range. Each circle represents signal received from an antenna in one cycle. The max is length of the cycle, so the value of the number is the offset in the cycle. The point is that each signal should be caught in some expected time offset - call it the "center", but the real physical properties of the antenna makes the antenna catch the signals earlier or later, so this creates acceptable tolerance. However there can be ghost, invalid or whatever wrong signals out of tolerance, which should be discarded. I need to find the the range - the center and the tolerance - the green line and the red boundaries. Can a neural network solve this?
