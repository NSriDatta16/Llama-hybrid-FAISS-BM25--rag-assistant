Also you may want to look into NetBeans, it has great support for ruby and rails. They also provide several focused tutorials and even viedos. http://www.netbeans.org/kb/trails/ruby.html Another excelent source of focused tutorials is http://railscasts.com/ by Ryan Bates. On the ruby side, I strongly recommend The Ruby Way, and if you are into screencasts, the Pragmatic Programmers have some cheap and excelent ones on ruby object model and metaprogramming by Dave Thomas.
