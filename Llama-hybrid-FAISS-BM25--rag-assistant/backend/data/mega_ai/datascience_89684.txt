XLNET how to deal with text with more than 512 tokens?

From what I searched online, XLNET model is pre-trained with 512 tokens, and https://github.com/zihangdai/xlnet/issues/80 , I didn't find too much useful information on that either. How does XLnet outperform BERT on long text when the max_sequence_length hyperparameter is less than 1024 tokens ?
