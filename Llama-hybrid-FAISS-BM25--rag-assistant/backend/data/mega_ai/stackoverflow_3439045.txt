UISwitch force drag to change setting

Is there a way to stop a UISwitch from toggling state when you tap on the inactive side? I would like a control that forces a deliberate 'swipe' action to prevent the user accidentally clicking it. I've had a look around but haven't found any setting that removes the instant toggle on tap.
