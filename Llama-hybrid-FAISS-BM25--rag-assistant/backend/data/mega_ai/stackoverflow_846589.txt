Turns out that the object files containing the static initializers were not included by the linker because nothing referenced any functions in them. To work around this I extern "C"-ed one of the generated functions so that it would have a predictable non-mangled name and then forced a reference to it using a pragma like this for each message #pragma comment(linker, "/include:Create_GraphicsDynamicMeshCreationMessage") which I put in the generated header file that is later included in all the other non-generated files. It's MSVC only and kind of hack but I assume I can do something similar on GCC once I eventually port it.
