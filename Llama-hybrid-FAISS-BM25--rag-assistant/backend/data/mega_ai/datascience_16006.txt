Build classifier using a deep learning algorithm called convolutional neural network (CNN) Classification using a machine learning algorithm has 2 phases: Training phase: In this phase, we train a machine learning algorithm using a dataset comprised of the images and their corresponding labels. Prediction phase: In this phase, we utilize the trained model to predict labels of unseen images. The training phase for an image classification problem has 2 main steps: Feature Extraction: In this phase, we utilize domain knowledge to extract new features that will be used by the machine learning algorithm. HoG and SIFT are examples of features used in image classification. Model Training: In this phase, we utilize a clean dataset composed of the images' features and the corresponding labels to train the machine learning model. In the predicition phase, we apply the same feature extraction process to the new images and we pass the features to the trained machine learning algorithm to predict the label.
