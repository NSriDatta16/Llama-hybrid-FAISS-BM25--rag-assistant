Is it possible to create a predictive model for a dataset that consists of only positive occurrences of the dependent variable? One-class classification is a type of classification algorithm which does exactly that. In one-class classification the principle is to discover the patterns which characterize the instances of the class, assuming that everything which doesn't follow these patterns doesn't belong to the class. The model is trained using only examples from the class, and when applied the model predicts a probability that the input instance belongs to the class. By putting a threshold on the probability the model can be used as a binary classifier. In terms of methods/implementations, I know one-class SVM but there are probably other methods as well.
