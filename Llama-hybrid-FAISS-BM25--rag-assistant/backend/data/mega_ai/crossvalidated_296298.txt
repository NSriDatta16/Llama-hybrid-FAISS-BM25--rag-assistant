In addition to the great answers already posted, before you decide which method to use, you must first decide what you want to know. This is important because frequentist and Bayesian methods answer different questions . Frequentists are worried about the statistical properties of the process which they use to calculate, in your example, a confidence interval. They don't particularly care if the specific confidence interval you calculated from your data contains your true parameter. Rather, they care that, after a million confidence intervals are calculated using a certain process, a certain proportion of them is guaranteed to contain the true parameter. Bayesians, on the other hand, care about what information can be extracted from your data. They want to know how wide an interval must be, given your specific data, in order to contain a certain parameter with some pre-selected probability. So if you want to quantify the statistical properties of a certain process for analysing data, then frequentist methods are the way. If, on the other hand, you want to know what your specific data is telling you, then you should use bayesian methods. The fact that, under some very specific conditions, they both offer numerically similar answers shouldn't take away from the fact that they are answering different questions.
