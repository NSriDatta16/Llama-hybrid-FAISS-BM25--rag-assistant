Based on your result, it would appear to be a problem with how you are setting the subject value on your RSSFeedList objects. My guess is that a value is not correctly being stored in the subject value. Take a look at the following code which shows the an example of the set/retrieval of the RSSFeelList values: RSSFeelList.h see your code RSSFeedList.m @implementation RSSFeedList @synthesize subject, rssfeedDetail; // generates a usable log text - (NSString *)description { return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"RSSFeedList {subject=%@}", self.subject]; } @end other *.m // populate list NSMutableArray *list = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; RSSFeedList *f = [[RSSFeedList alloc] init]; f.subject = @"test subject"; [list addObject:f]; [f release]; // access data NSLog(@"Value = %@", list); RSSFeedList *f2 = [list objectAtIndex:0]; NSString *s = f2.subject; NSLog(@"Value = %@", s); // ... You do not need to release the value retrieved from the array unless you copy or retain it. Otherwise the value is managed by the Array itself. Hope this helps.
