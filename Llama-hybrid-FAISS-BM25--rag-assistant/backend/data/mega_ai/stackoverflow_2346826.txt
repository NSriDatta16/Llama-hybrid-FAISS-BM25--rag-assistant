Data structure for fast filtering (Delphi)?

I am optimizing a part of a Delphi application where lists of objects are frequently filtered using different criteria. The objects are kept in TObjectList structures and it is common to select a very small percentage (ex. 1%) of the entire set with each filter. The total number of objects can be in the 100k range and during computations the main set doesn't change. Although the filters are applied for only a few properties, the lists cannot be sorted in such a way that would optimize all the possible criteria. I am looking for suggestions on how to organize the objects (data structures) or an algorithm that can be used to approach this problem. Thank you! Filter example: ((Object.A between 5 and 15) AND (Object.B 0)) OR (Object.IsRoot(...))
