You should always post the full traceback so people can help better. If you say nothing has changed and it was working yesterday, there's one area where code doesn't need to change to throw an IndexError : organization=user.organization_set.all()[0] website=organization.website_set.all()[0] You sure that's not the problem? Either way, until we see a traceback, it's hard to tell ;)
