The book Peopleware put it in a nice way, that despite being a different context also works here. The manager's function, they write, is not to make people work but to make it possible for people to work. In this case you are your own manager, so its up to you to make it possible for yourself to work. If its something difficult you are struggling with, then you need to listen to yourself.. what is it you need in order to get started solving it. For me, it can be that a major class in the project has the wrong name and is inelegant. In order to solve the problem in an elegant way these needs to be fixed first, otherwise it will end out as a half baked solution. 10 cents
