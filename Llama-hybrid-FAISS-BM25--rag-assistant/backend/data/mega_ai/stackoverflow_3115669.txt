Random Tile layout

I need to place tiles on a large grid radiating from a central point in a way that looks organic and random. New tiles will need to find an open space on the grid that is touching at least 1 other tile. Can anyone point me in the right to direction to anything that might help with this? Or some basic concepts I can read up on that are in this vein? For example, in this picture, there is a shape already created (yellow) and I may be receiving a new tile, that may be 1x1, 2x2, or 3x3. Trying to find a good way to figure out where I can place the new tile so that it will be touching the maximum amount of current tiles. Picture: alt text http://osomer.com/grid.JPG
