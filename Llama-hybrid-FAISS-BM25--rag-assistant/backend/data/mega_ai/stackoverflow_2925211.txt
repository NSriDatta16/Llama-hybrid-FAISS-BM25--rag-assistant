Given how much the CPU was doing under the hood reorganizing your code, interleaving computation and memory access, I wouldn't read too much into a 4% difference - it's not worth worring about since you can't draw any sensible conclusions from a microbenchmark like this. Try a real computation, with real memory access to get a feel for how much the virtual method is costing you. The virtual method itself usually isn't the problem - a modern cpu will interleave the pointer fetch from vtable with other work - it's the lack of inlining that kills performance.
