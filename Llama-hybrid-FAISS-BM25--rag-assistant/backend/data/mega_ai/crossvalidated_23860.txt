How to forecast based on aggregated data over irregular intervals?

I am trying to forecast the sales of products in vending machine. The problem is that the machine is filled at irregular intervals and at every fill we only can record the aggregated sales since the last fill of the machine (i.e. we don't have daily sales data). So basically we have data for aggregated sales at irregular intervals. The intervals usually are between 2 days and 3 weeks. Here is example data for one vending machine and one product: 27/02/2012 48 17/02/2012 24 09/02/2012 16 02/02/2012 7 25/01/2012 12 16/01/2012 16 05/01/2012 16 23/12/2011 4 16/12/2011 14 09/12/2011 4 02/12/2011 2 Our current naive algorithm is to calculate average sales per day by dividing the total quantity sold during the last 90 days by 90. Do you have any idea how to improve the forecast of the sales per day? I need to forecast what will be sold at the next visit of the machine. Is it possible to use some sort of exponential smoothing algorithm given the nature of our data? Thanks in advance! UPDATE: Thanks a lot for all the answers and comments. Let me try to give a bit more context (the business case behind the question - very simplified of course). We have hundreds of vending machines. Every day we have to decide which 20 of them to visit for refill. In order to do so we are trying to predict what is the current status of the machines and to select the "emptiest" 20 machines. For each machine and product we are calculating the average sales per day (SPD) using the naive algorithm described above. Then we multiply the SPD by the number of days since the last fill of the machine and the result is the predicted quantity sold.
