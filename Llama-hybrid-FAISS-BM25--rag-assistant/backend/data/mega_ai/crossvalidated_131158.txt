Michael Neumann has a nice set of slides on the problem, I borrowed from those slides to answer your question: Given a Markov process on the state space $\{1,2,\ldots,7\}$ with transition matrix $\mathbf{T}$, $(X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{N}}$, the mean first passage matrix $\mathbf{M}$ is made of entries $m_{ij}$ that are the expected numbers of steps to reach state $j$ when starting with $X_0=i$. So $$m_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^\infty k\, \mathbb{P}\left(\min\{\ell\ge 1; X_{\ell}=j \mid| X_0=i\}=k\right)$$ So it is the average time it takes the chain to move from $i$ to $j$. For instance, $m_{ii}=1/\pi_i$ where $(\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_7)$ is the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. The formula for computing the matrix $\mathbf{M}$ has been derived by Carl Meyer, in this 1975 paper .
