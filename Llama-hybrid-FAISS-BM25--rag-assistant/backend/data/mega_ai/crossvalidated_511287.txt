What you’re asking about can reasonably be called “unsupervised text style transfer”. You have two styles of text: simple and complex. Your goal is to switch text from one style to the other, even though you’ve never seen the simplified version of a complex sentence or the complicated version of a simple sentence. One work that tackles this well is He et al. (2020) . By means of parameter-tying, they show how to do this transfer task you describe with only one translation model that they train and two pre-trained language models. You should also check the papers that it cites and papers that cite it for more ideas.
