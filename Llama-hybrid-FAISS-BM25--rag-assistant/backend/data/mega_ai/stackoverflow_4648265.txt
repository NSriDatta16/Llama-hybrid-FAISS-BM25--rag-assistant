Strategy for using svn for joomla component/extension development

I've always found developing joomla extensions a pain when it comes to organizing your workflow so I'm looking for a good strategy for using svn for joomla extension development (and deployment). I've scoured the web for ideas, but haven't found anything good. Specifically I'm looking for a smart way to install components using svn export (for deployment to production site) or checkout (for development site) and some scripting magic. Anyone have any experience with this that they would like to share? Any ideas is much appreciated. Thanks!
