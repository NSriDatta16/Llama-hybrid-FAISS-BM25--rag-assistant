I just had this problem. It turns out that, I accidentally drag-&-dropped files from one project to another, which created a duplicate. It took me a while to find the problem, because the files were hidden within the Properties folder (which I never look into). In any case, what helped me solve the problem was going into the file that was throwing the error, r-clicking on the erroneous line and "going to definition". Being in the definition, you can see which physical file you are looking at. If it isn't what it is supposed to be, then you found your problem. I know this is trivial, but it wasted me around 1 hour of time, so hope this info would be useful to anyone.
