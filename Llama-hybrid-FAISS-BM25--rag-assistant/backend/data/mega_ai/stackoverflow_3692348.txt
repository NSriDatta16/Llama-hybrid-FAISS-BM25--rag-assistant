Any reason why C#/VS doesn't have an auto-build feature like Java/Eclipse?

I am a C#/.Net developer who just began Java development for Android, and using Eclipse I noticed that it compiles as you go, so that at no point do you have to wait for the program to build. This seems pretty amazing, unless there is something going on I don't understand. I was wondering why C# and the Visual Studio IDE don't provide this functionality? Is there a reason?
