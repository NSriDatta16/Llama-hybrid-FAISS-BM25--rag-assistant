How to do an incremental update for the mean and standard deviation of tensor data?

I have a big dataset (some 400Gb) consisting of tensor data (shape is $(600, 600, 10)$ ) and I want to normalize this dataset before feeding it to a neural network but this dataset can't fit in my memory so I was wondering about incremental updates of the mean and standard deviation. The formulas are here but I don't see how to adapt them in the tensor case since I don't have only one value per new iteration step but a whole tensor, and I can't take the mean of this new tensor since the mean of means won't be the mean of the whole dataset.
