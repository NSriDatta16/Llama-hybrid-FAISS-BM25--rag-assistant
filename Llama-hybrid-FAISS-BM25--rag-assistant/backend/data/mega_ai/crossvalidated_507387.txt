since we are releasing a kernel library, I tried to do a simple introduction to kernels methods in this Tutorial . I hope that it will help you to understand kernel methods from a user point of view. If you want to dig in further, you might be interested to have a look to the bibliography: it links mostly to paper of mine, don't pay attention to it. However, you will find two very solid references of books of G. Fasshauer and Berlinet - Thomas-Agnan. EDIT : sorry, the references are not in the tutorial, but in the advanced tutorial, see enter link description here . I copied them here. They both require a solid background on functional analysis. A. Berlinet and C. Thomas-Agnan, Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in probability and statistics, Springer US, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004. Gregory E. Fasshauer, Positive Definite Kernels: Past, Present and Future, available at http://www.math.iit.edu/ fass/PDKernels.pdf.
