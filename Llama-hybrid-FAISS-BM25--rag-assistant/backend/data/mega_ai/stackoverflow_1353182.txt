Here's the design pattern I would use. I would create a simple class to facilitate it: class Configuration { String get($key) {...} String set($key, $value) {...} } Initial implementation could all be hard-coded with default values. Later, though, you could slip in the reading of a server and/or project specific configuration file. It would give you flexibility to add as needed. (I also noticed that the php.ini configurations seem to have the behavior you want, but I don't see how you leverage that system directly.)
