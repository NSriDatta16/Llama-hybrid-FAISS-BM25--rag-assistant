If I understand your purpose you want to embed a collaboration component into your existing winforms application and want to know if an embedded browser would be the way to go. There isn't a simple answer but I'll throw up some thoughts: Embedding browsers in winforms apps can be more tedious than you'd think (it's been awhile since I tried so it may have gotten better) a. If you do go that route I would suggest looking into an buying a hosted service with an existing message board feature and pointing to that page instead of rolling your own If you do want to control the info you need a way to get messages from one to the others, typically this would be done via a server database and a service layer (or page hosted on the server) a. It may be possible to host a web server in your win app but I doubt it's worth the effort if your app needs to be connected to others and/or a server anyways b. There are ways to share the data in a peer-to-peer way but it's no simple task c. As Bugai suggested you can use standard win forms controls to show messages (albeit not formatted pretty like html very easily unless you go to WPF... etc), if you do I would recommend looking at a RichTextBox or ListBox OR looking into 3rd party control vendors Hope this helps...
