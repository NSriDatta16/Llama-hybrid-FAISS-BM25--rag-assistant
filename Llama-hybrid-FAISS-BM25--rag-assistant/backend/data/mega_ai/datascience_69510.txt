Real-life applications/examples of transfer learning approaches

I recently read a nice, informative paper titled 'A Survey on Transfer Learning' . It mentions 3 settings of transfer learning - inductive, transductive, and unsupervised. At the same time, it states there are 4 common approaches on "what knowledge to transfer" for each setting - instances, features, model parameters, or relations. I looked up the descriptions of each category, but I do not understand exactly how they are utilised in the domains of Computer Vision and NLP. Could I get an example application of each of these categories to understand better how exactly they differ from each other? How does one determine which approach to use in which setting?
