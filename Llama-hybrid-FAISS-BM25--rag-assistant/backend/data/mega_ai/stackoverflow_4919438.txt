You can use ranges in choices but you should omit the parentheses. Not that your code fragment contained a lot more errors than just the superfluous parentheses. You had a missing end entity , a superfluous semicolon at the end of the port declaration, and incorrect integer port declaration,... A good VHDL IDE, such as Sigasi HDT , would help you catch these immediately. Corrected fragment: LIBRARY ieee; USE ieee.std_logic_1164.all; ENTITY alu IS PORT (a: IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (15 DOWNTO 0); b: IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (15 DOWNTO 0); operation: IN INTEGER range 1 TO 10; result: OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (15 DOWNTO 0) ); end entity; ARCHITECTURE arch_alu OF alu IS SIGNAL arith, logic: STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (15 DOWNTO 0); BEGIN --rest of the code which give values to arith and logic---- WITH operation SELECT result
