Perhaps a real world example will help to illustrate this. Imagine you need to build a series of logging classes that record messages to various media such as a text file, XML or a database. Each class needs to have separate code to interact with the different types of storage of course. However if they all implement the same interface the 'public face' that they show to other code is always the same. In that way other code that uses logging objects doesn't need to know what class they are instances of or what the storage medium is. All that they need to know is that all of the logging classes, by virtue of the fact that they all implement the same interface, share a common API. This can be a very powerful way of working. You can build up a library of code that solves related problems in different ways and simply 'plug and play' these in your code.
