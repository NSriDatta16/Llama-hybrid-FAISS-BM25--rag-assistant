Use JMX: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/agent.html Add the following parameters to your jvm (after javac ...): -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=8086 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false Then connect using jconsole . JConsole will be in the bin folder of your JDK. I am sure it comes with the JDK but i'm not sure if it's bundled with the JRE. In this case, when JConsole pop's up, enter localhost:8086 as the ip address. Change the port if needed. In JConsole, click on the Thread tab. This will show you the number of running and started threads with a nice graph. You can also click on the thread to see the current stack trace. You even have a button to detect dead locks!
