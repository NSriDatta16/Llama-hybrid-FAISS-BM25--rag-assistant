AutoML / Data science - Prediction websites

Are there any websites where we can simply upload a training dataset with labels, and get predictions for a test dataset ? Google AutoML and MIT ATM would be similar to what I'm looking for, but they seem to be mainly for images & classification problems but I need simple regression prediction as well.
