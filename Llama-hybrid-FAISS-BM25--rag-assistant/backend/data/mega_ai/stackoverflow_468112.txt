How do I get a usemap working within a firefox XUL document

In my XUL I have the following code fragments: ... The image displays just fine, however, when I mouse over, the cursor does not change to a hand, and clicking does not call the pad function. Similar code works fine in straight HTML, so there must be some trick to get it working via a Firefox XUL file.
