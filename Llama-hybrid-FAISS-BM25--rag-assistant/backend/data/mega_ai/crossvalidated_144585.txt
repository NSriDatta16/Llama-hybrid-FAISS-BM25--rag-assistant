The R package RSNNS has a plethora of options for training and pruning neural networks, including optimal brain damage and optimal brain surgeon, among others. The software appears to be rather robust. I'm not aware of another package implementing the OBD algorithm in R. Additionally, the package NeuralNetTools provides a few functions that allow one to assess variable importance and how varying levels of feature input influence the output of the network.
