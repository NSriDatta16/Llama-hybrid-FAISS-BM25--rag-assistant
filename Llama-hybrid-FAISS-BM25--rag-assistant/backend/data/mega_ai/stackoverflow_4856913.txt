Flash video alternative

I'm looking for a way around using flash for video's on a site. Does anybody have any suggestions for something that might work across multiple browsers that isn't flash based? HTML5 seems promising, but I need something with more browser acceptance. I'm trying to avoid having to serve up difference video's based on user agents. Any ideas?
