I'd like to play a little bit with it, but I'm a bit too lazy to setup a little test project. In any case, if you want to fetch those products, to display them in an overview or something like that, I would make use of Projections and the AliasToBean transformer, so that NHibernate issues a query that will be simpler, and retrieve only those values that you need to display your overview. In order to do so, you will have to create another class offcourse, which will hold the values that will be retrieved.
