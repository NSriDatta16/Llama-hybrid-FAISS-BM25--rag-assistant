Appengine retrieve data related to user form submission

I had read the docs for Appengine to know how to retrieve data from Models. But i´m missing something.. My models are user and student, where student is a reference property from user. Users login, fill form with some values and save the data with put(). If you login with test@example.com you get your data or if you login with another email you get the data corresponding to your information sent to db. Everythin is fine till here. I´m trying to get a PDF and want to get the data from the user loged in. Example: class SavePDF(webapp.RequestHandler): def post(self): user = users.get_current_user() if user: student= models.Student.all().get() p = canvas.Canvas(self.response.out) p.drawImage('ipca.jpg', 40, 700) p.drawString(50,640, 'Student Info:' + '%s' % student.name) p.drawString(50,620, 'Adress:' + '%s' % student.adress) p.drawString(50,300, 'PDF updated:%s' % str(datetime.date.today())) p.showPage() self.response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/pdf' self.response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'filename=mypdf.pdf' p.save() What i get here is a user that is not current user. Shows Info about other user. I´ve tried different things but it throws errors. If i try to iterate gives error. I´m missing something.
