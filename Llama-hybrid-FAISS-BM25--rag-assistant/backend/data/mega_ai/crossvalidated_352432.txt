Could you clarify what you did when you said you "replaced all the values below the 90th percentile with the value corresponding to that percentile?" That part is not clear to me, for one. I presume you mean that you discretized the continuous values to the left of your cutoff. It's not obvious, according to econometric or statistical theory, why you should choose to replace the data to the left of that point in the first place. Josh Angrist and Jorn-Steffen Pischke, in their book Mostly Harmless Econometrics, strongly advise against using censored data approaches when the data is not truly censored. For one, using approaches like Tobit require distributional assumptions, potential reductions in efficiency, and complicated functional forms to find marginal effects. See this discussion in Chapter 3, pages 94-102. There are other censored and zero-inflated approaches which do not require normality but still face the same criticisms I referenced above. Hence, the recommendation is to use linear-regression and pay particular attention to the structure of your standard error.
