Sounds like multinomial logistic regression is the tool to use. The dependent variable would be "field of work" and the independent variable would be "field of study". With such a large N you can be fairly specific in defining the levels of the variables, but you should probably start with frequency counts of each and then a crosstabulation of the two, not for statistical testing but to see what's going on and whether you want to combine some categories of either variable.
