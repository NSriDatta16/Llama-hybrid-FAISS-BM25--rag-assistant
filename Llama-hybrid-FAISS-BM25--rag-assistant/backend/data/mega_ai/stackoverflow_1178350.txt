I believe that the localStorage api is replacing globalStorage in FF 3.5. You can read more about it here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage I think the api is very similar, so you could try something like this: var storage; if (typeof localStorage != "undefined") { storage = localStorage; } else if (typeof globalStorage != "undefined") { storage = globalStorage[storageDomain]; } if (storage && storage.taskStorage) { taskStorage = storage.taskStorage; } Hope that helps! EDIT: Anywhere you use globalStorage, you'll have to check for localStorage as well. Or promote the storage variable up in scope and detect it once.
