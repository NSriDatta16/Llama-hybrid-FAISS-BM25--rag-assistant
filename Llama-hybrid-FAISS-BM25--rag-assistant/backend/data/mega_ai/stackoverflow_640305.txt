From a PHP book I have: PHP is an open source project of the Apache Software Founation and it's the most popular Apache web server add-on module, with around 53% of the Apache HTTP servers having PHP capabilities. PHP is particularly suited to web database applications because of its integration tools for the Web and database environments. In particular, the flexibility of embedding scripts in HTML pages permits easy integration of HTML presentation and code. The database tier integration support is also excellent, with more than 15 libraries available to interact with almost all popular database servers. It goes on to talk about the following advantages: Open source Flexible for integration with HTML Suited to complex projects Fast at running scripts Platform- and operating-system portable A community effort I know this doesn't really answer your question, but maybe it provides a little higher-level glance at what PHP is all about. From: Hugh E. Williams & David Lane. Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL . 2nd Edition.
