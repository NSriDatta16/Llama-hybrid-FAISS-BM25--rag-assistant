Backpropagation of Bias in Neural networks

My goal is to calculate backpropagation(Especially the backpropagation of the bias). For example, X, W and B are python numpy array, such as [[0,0],[0,1]] , [[5,5,5],[10,10,10]] and [1,2,3] for each. And, suppose dL/dY is [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]. How to calculate dL/dB? Answer should be [5, 7, 9]. why is it calculated that way?
