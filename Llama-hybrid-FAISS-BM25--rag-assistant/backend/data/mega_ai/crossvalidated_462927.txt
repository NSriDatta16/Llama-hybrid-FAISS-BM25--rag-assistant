Let $X\sim Poisson(\lambda)$ . Yes, $\mathbb{E}\big[X\big] = \lambda$ . You are totally correct about that. But... $Var\big(X\big)=\lambda$ Therefore, $\lambda$ influences the spread. When $\lambda$ is small, the distribution has little variability and a mean close to zero, so the distribution is bunched up around $\lambda$ but also has some mass out far, since all positive integers are possible. This means that the distribution is quite skewed. When $\lambda$ is large, the variability increases along with the mean, allowing the data not to be so bunched up near zero, lessening the skewness. A Poisson distribution with a large $\lambda$ is almost unskewed. I encourage you to plot some Poisson distributions in a software package like R or Python to get a feel for whatâ€™s going on.
