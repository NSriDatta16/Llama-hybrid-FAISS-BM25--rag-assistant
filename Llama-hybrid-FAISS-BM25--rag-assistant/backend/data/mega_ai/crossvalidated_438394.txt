How to recognize similar environmental variables using multivariate analysis?

I am completely new to multivariate analyses and I need an advice how to get it applied to my data and which analyses to choose for which purpose. My dataset is presence/absence (or relative abundance score) of 100 species on 5000 squares, and for each square I have 100 environmental variables (many of them strongly correlated). 1) Out of those environmental variables, how do I recognize which variables are similar with respect to species abundance ? Which analysis to choose? By "with respect to" here I mean also non-linear functional dependence, because I intend use non-linear models (GP). By "similar" I mean they have similar effect in those general non-linear models. 2) Is it possible to get a distance matrix (matrix of distance between all pairs of environmental variables), which would express the similarity of those variables with respect to species abundance? I was looking in R package vegan and the function vegdist() seems pretty close, but it's on the community data matrix - I need it for the environmental variables but with respect to the species abundance . EDIT: I found my very amateurish way to do it, but I don't know if it's correct because I don't understand this properly (esp. the different scalings and transformations), so I would be grateful if a) you could check this and b) tell me better way how to do it: I perform the CCA with species (community matrix) and environment. I take the coefficients for variables that are centred and scaled to unit norm. I scale (multiply) each dimension by appropriate eigenvalues of the environmental variables. I do this so that each dimension is weighted by its importance. require(vegan) c1 EDIT 2: (response to the request of writing down the model). Very general description of the model would be: $$\text{RelAbundance}_\text{species,square} \sim f(\textbf{Environment}_\text{square})$$ Where $\text{RelAbundance}_\text{species,square}$ is the relative abundance score (or just presence/absence) for given species and square, and $\textbf{Environment}_\text{square}$ is a vector of environmental variables for given square. $f$ is a general function of environmental variables.
