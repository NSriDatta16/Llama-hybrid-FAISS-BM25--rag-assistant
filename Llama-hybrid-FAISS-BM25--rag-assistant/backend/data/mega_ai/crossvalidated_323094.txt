Looking for references - ReLU neural networks vs Fitting continuous piecewise linear function

ReLU activated neural networks with a linear output are continuous piecewise linear functions (CPLF). There are technuques to fit CPLF functions, so comparison of those methods seems very natural, yet I was not able to find academic work which carries this out. I'm doing research in machine learning and am studying neural networks from a more theoretical point of view. In this context I trying to find results that compare performance of fitting a CPLF and fitting ReLU activated nets on a similar high dimensional data set, for example fitting MNIST . So I'm wondering if CPLF fitting is so unefficient compared to neural networks, that it cannot be applied to high dimensional data or large data set? Or I just missed the litrature on the subject. Any comments are welcome! Here is a paper by Alejandro Toriello (2011) that provides an overview of fitting CPLF.
