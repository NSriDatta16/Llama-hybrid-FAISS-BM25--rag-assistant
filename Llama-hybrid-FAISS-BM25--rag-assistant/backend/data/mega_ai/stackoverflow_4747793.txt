Improve XSLT transformation

I have a lot of xml (JUnit test results) that i want to transform with Xslt 2.0. I am currently using the net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl to perform the transform and the fn:collection() in my xslt to search xml files. Like this : There is 2 point that cause me trouble: first is the java transformer, i have to pass a xml"source" but i dont really need it because my .xsl is doing the xml searching and listing. second is when i am running the transform for more than 10 (maybe 8 or 7 ) xml my JVM heap space is full. I know i can raise the heap size but i have to apply the transform throught almost 300 xml so it will no be efficient. Any idea about what can i do to improve the number of xml i can transform? Thanks EDIT : I m trying to use the saxon:discard-document() like this : but I am still getting an error with my heap space. Am I doing something wrong?
