Printing Graphics in Python

I need to print "Wheel Tags" from python. Wheel tags will have images, lines, and text. The Python tutorial has two paragraphs about creating postscript files with the image lib. After reading it I still do not know how to lay out the data. I was hoping some one might have samples of how to layout the images, text and lines? Thanks for any help.
