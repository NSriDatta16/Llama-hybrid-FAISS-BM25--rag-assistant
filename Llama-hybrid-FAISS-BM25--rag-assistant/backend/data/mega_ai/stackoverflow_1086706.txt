If you want to bring database changes into your DBML diagram then you can: a) remove the changed entities from the designer diagram and re-drag them. You will lose any customizations (e.g. class and property name changes etc). b) manually update the diagram, adding/removing classes, member properties, etc. c) Use a third party tool capable of comparing and updating the DBML file with the underlying database. One such tool is my add-in, Huagati DBML/EDMX Tools . It adds a bunch of features to the L2S designer in VS2008 and VS2010, including update/sync, comparison, mass-renaming, name rule enforcement, documentation from extended properties/indexes/etc, multiple 'views' per dbml diagram etc.
