This is dependent on how the rest of your CSS is structured and what units you are using to assign font-sizes in the rest of the page. If you are using em or % then it is enough to do just like Chase Seibert says: $("body").css("font-size", "150%"); So simply use the correct units in your CSS and then manipulate the main body text-size. Otherwise you can also choose an element like a div which acts as the root element of all textual content on the page you are creating. As a comment by @praveen also says is that this will not necessarily affect you non-textual content.
