Have you tried running the same code and database on a local computer of yours? That's a good start. If the problem does not persist, there's an environment issue at play. If the issue does persist, try running the same database against a fresh copy of Magento (code straight from the repo, basically). If the problem subsides, you probably have a code issue. If not, database is likely to blame. Next, add a new product type and a new product. Try to add those to the cart. Use a new customer, etc. Debugging after that depends on the issues you found, but somewhere in the Magento logic you are getting tripped up. I'm guessing that it is the database, since Magento depends on several things existing in the database correctly. Stepping through the code with a debugger may show you where it bails from the process. Let us know how that goes. :)
