How to read and process binary (base-2) logical representations from file

I have a file containing 800 lines like: id binary-coded-info --------------------------- 4657 001001101 4789 110111111 etc. where each 0 or 1 stands for the presence of some feature. I want to read this file and do several bitwise logical operations on the binary-coded-info (the operations depend on user input and on info from a second file with 3000 lines). Then, these re-calculated binary-coded-info should be written to file (with trailing zeros, e.g. 4657 000110011 4789 110110000 etc. How should I do this without writing my own base conversion routine? I am open for anything, also languages I do not know, like python, perl, etc. And it should work without compiling. So far, I tried to script, awk and sed my way. This would mean (I think): batch read as base-2, convert to base-10, do bitwise operations depending on user input and second file, convert to base-2, add leading zeros and print. The usual console hints to use bc do not seem elegant because I have many lines in a file. The same holds for dc.sed. And awk doesnt seem to have an equivalent to flagging input as binary ( as in "echo $((2#101010))" ), and also, the printf trick doesn't work for binary. So, how would I do this most elegantly (or, at all, for that matter) ?
