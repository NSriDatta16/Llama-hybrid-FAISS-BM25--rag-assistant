If I understood it right your problem is with the source code indentation. Is it correct? Here will be your answer . I had this problem when I use the Source Code -> Format option from Netbeans IDE: paragraph But if use the Souce Code -> Format option or indent it by yourself it will be rendered with extra indentation. Using print or echo it dindn't go wrong.
