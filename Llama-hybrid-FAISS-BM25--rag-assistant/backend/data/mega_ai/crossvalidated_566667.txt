Penalized Regression for Predicting Rare Events

I have a data set where my binary dependent variable is rarely equals one (about 0.3 % of all observations). My goal is to predict the dependent variable based on a few variables and a constant term. I was wondering whether a penalized logit regression approach could make up for the fact that I have only a few events. I know that penalized regression leads ultimately to variable selection; variable selection is not my goal though. The reason why I thought that penalized regression my help is based on the following observation. Since the number of events is small, the estimate of the slope coefficient in the Logit regression is very large in magnitude as a large slope leads to predicted probabilities close to zero (or close to one, depending on the sign of the variable). Since the penality term causes the estimated coefficients to be shrunk towards zero, I thought that using penalized regression may be helpful in sitation with only a few events. Is this line of thought reasonable? Edit (Some more details about what I do). I want to predict the probability of complications after a particular surgery based on patient-specific characteristics and a disease-related score. The complications occur rarely. The hope is that the score helps predicting complications. The results so far (from a non-penalized logistic regression) suggest that the score does not help at all. This can be of course the case. However, my feeling is that score is not as effective as expected because there are only a few patients with complications. This motivated our idea to use a penalized regression approach to account for the low number of events.
