There are many possible forecast accuracy measures, e.g. here and here . Whether a given MAE is good enough for your needs is something only you can answer, based on what you plan on doing with your forecast. You can use accuracy measures to compare forecasts and select a more accurate model over a less accuracy one. (Use a holdout sample for this, do not calculate and interpret in-sample accuracy.) There is no common accuracy measure that is scaled to lie in the interval between 0 and 100%. If your closing price is 6000, a forecast of 12000 or 0 will be 100% off... but you could also have a forecast of 18000 and be 200% off.
