In the for loop you are calling setTimeout 30 times, each time with the same timeout value of 1000. So after 1000 milliseconds 30 scheduled functions will execute at almost the same time. I suppose this is not what you intended. If you wanted an animation of 30 frames over 1000 milliseconds, the setTimeout should look something like: setTimeout(function() { ... }, 1000 / 30 * m) Also note that all 30 scheduled functions will see the same gantt.startUnixTime value, since the same object ( gantt ) is passed to all of them, and when they execute, the for loop has finished already long ago.
