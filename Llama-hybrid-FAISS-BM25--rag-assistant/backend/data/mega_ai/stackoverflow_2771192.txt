Better way to Handle error

I recently migrated a VB6 app to VB.Net. Entire VB6 dependency are removed . And the code was working fine just for a single module mean to say like for WinApp it is working fine. Now my requirement has been changed, now the same class will be accessed by multiple application , it might a Windows App, Web App or a web service. So I am not able decide any efficient error handling pattern. So you you guys help me out. Currently what I am doing is that parent function , i am passing two vars LogError as bool and ErrorMessage as string parameter, that will further check something like this Catch(ex as Exception) If LogError then MessageBox.Show("My_Module_Name :" & ex.Message) EndIf ErrorMessage = ex.Message End Try Also same catch block is used in all other functions/ subroutines. So what I need is any elegant handling method that will work efficiently on cross-app platform(win/web/service)
