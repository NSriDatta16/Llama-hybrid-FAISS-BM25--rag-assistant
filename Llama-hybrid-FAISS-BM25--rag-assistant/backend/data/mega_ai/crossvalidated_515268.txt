Mathematical bias and weight vs machine learning bias and weight

I am a little confused about the term Bias and Weight with respect to machine learning. Say we want to predict the heights of people whose weights are given. So plot weights to x-axis and height to yaxis. To find out the linear relationship between height and weight we draw a straight line that shows the relationship between height and weight. Using the equation for a line, you could write down this relationship $y= mx+b ...i)$ more specifically in the machine learning terminology it could be $y= b+ w_1x_1...ii)$ So here b is the bias as per machine learning. However, b is the y-intercept as per mathematics. By defination b can be defined in machine learning A value indicating how far apart the average of predictions is from the average of labels in the dataset. Is that mean bias(b) is the distance between some particular point of the red line(as per picture) to the true point(say a blue or green point). Now another confusion if this is the case then what is loss? As per defination loss is A measure of how far a model's predictions are from its label. Then what is the difference between loss and bias? Now, for weight, here, weight(m)means slope as per equation i). Mathematically slope can be define as $m = \frac{rise}{run} =\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ However, weight $(w_1)$ can be defined in machine learning as A coefficient for a feature in a linear model . So my confusion is that is the procedure of finding weight is same as finding slope in mathematics?
