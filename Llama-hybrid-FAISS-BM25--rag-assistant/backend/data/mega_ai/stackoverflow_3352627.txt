jQuery Drag plugin - Prevent dropping of a drag element on the top of another

I uses the jQuery pluins event.drag and event.drop see a demo (just a reference question is not about restricting movement to a container) Is it possible to prevent dropping of a drag element on the top of another element? but it can be dragged over the other.
