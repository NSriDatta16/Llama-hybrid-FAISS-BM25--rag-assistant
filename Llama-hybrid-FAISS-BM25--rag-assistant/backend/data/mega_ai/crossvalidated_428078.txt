Per the comments by Aksakal and Alexis : fit any multivariate model to your data, e.g., multiple regression , but anything that can model one dependent variable with two independent variables is fine. This covers pretty much every tool you learn about in a statistics or machine learning textbook or course. Then calculate the fitted value for each observation, using the values of your predictors that correspond to that observation. Finally, subtract the fits from your actual observations.
