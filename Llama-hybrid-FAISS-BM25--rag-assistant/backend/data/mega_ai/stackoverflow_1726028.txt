In IB you certainly can just drag a view into the middle of the navigation controller and it will work fine if its just inside one navigation item. However, if the same view object reference is dragged into the title view area of different navigation items that will at some point be pushed onto the navigation controllers stack, you will run into problems with the title view disappearing when you travel back through the stack. The navigation controller isn't too happy with references to the same object popping up on multiple navigation items for some reason and it only throws a fit when you pop back to the view with the troublesome navigation item. To get around this you MUST explicitly set and unset the titleView object when the you navigate to the views using the shared title view object reference. For instance, if you had custom logic behind a subclassed view set as the titleView that you only wanted to instantiate once.
