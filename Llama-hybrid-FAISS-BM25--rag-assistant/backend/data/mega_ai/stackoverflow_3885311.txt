This question is nearly impossible to answer with the details given (what does the dialog do? what is the design of your application?), so the only answer I feel can be given is: be consistent. Make your dialog look as much like the rest of your application as possible, although depending on that design, you may want to draw attention to it a little bit more than your "regular" windows to make sure that it is acknowledged. You probably want to set the owner of the dialog to the calling window, and you probably want to WindowStartupLocation to be CenterOwner.
