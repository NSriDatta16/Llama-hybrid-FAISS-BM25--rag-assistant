durbinWatsonTest() in R for non time-series data

I am trying to understand whether the Durbin-Watson test is meaningful at all when applied to regression data that have no temporal order (eg. blood pressure ~ bodyMassIndex + exercise ). I would say no, as the autocorrelation should obviously vary with the order of the subjects (which is random), but I wonder whether the durbinWatsonTest in R involves a bootstrapping of the data, where order of the bootstrapping data is shuffled each time, and then perhaps an average autocorrelation is computed over the bootstrapping samples (but then again, shouldn't this average autocorrelation be zero for randomly sampled data?). On the other hand, the value of the statistics seems to be quite stable over multiple runs of the function, so I am even more confused... I came across it in Andy Field's book "Discovering Statistics with R", where it is used is an example with non-time series data, although in another, more recent book of the same author ("Adventures in Statistics") it does say that the test is applicable only to time series data.
