I really doubt that you want to be using Encoding.Default , which is specific to your system. Aside from that, why not use the more standard way of doing compression, namely gzip the binary data instead of doing text manipulation? I suspect that will have more impact, and isn't nearly as fragile in terms of accidentally breaking the HTML. In addition, you won't need to worry about the encoding any more.
