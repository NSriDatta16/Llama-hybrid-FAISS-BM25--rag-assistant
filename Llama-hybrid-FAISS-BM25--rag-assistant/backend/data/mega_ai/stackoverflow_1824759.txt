git push heroku master permission denied on VISTA

(Using Vista)I'm trying to clone an app from my GitHub Repository and push it into Heroku. Okay, so I've tried to create an SSH key so many times with this: `ssh-keygen -t rsa` It seems to go perfectly. I have it on my C:/Users/***/.ssh folder. I now try to clone an app i forked in GitHub. When I try to clone it on the rails_apps directory, I get a message saying Permission Denied(public key). I found a solution on the net saying that I should run this first: `ssh-add` So I tried doing that. But it said that: Could not open a connection to your authentication agent. Then after some googling I find something about executing the ssh-agent. So I do this: `ssh-agent bash` and the command line changes from my rails_apps directory to this: `bash3.1$>` So I run: `bash3.1$>ssh-add [path to .ssh folder]` and it successfully adds the rsa private key(it doesn't work with id-rsa.pub). I have also pasted the newly generated public key to my GitHub account. Now when I try to clone: `bash3.1$>git clone git@github.com:username/myrepo.git` It now successfully clones the repo I forked in GitHub. Now that I have the app in my local repo, I try to create a heroku app. `bash3.1$>cd myrepo` `bash3.1$>heroku create myapp` And this code runs successfully. Git remote added successfully. Now all I have to do is to push it. `bash3.1$>git push heroku master` BAM! I get the error message again. Permission denied (public key) I am so close into pushing my app to heroku. But it just won't work. Can you help me. What am I doing wrong here? Thanks! :D
