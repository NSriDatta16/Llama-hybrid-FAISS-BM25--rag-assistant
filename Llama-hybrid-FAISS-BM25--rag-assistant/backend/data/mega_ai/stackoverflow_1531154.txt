In terms of GUI editing, take a look at wxwidgets, and in particular XRCed . XRCed is an application for generating interfaces (not quite drag and drop, but close) which are then saved as XML files. Using wxPython you can then load the XML file and it will rebuild the interface for you. You then just need to obtain references to each of your UI elements (by name) and you can get on with the real work.
