How to display the image to be in transparent and clickable?

I have a transparent .png image file which I have attached it on my site, however the file has some background colour (grey) which I have no understanding why it is there. It's sure in transparent mode when I open it in any image editor or view, it has transparent background. Why when I link it, and when displaying on my site it isn't transparent ? This is the method I'm using http://book.cakephp.org/#!/view/1441/image I've tried embedding the image in CSS but find it a bit troublesome because I need the image to be clickable that links to my homepage. Anyone can suggest any way to achieve the result I mentioned? ..perhaps some links or scripts that would work..I appreciate that. :-)
