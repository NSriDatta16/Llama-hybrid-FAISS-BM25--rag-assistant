css - user menu - two issues

when I hover the mouse over it, the cursor doesn't change into hand until you actually over over the text. (For example, if you pay attention to SO navigation, your cursor changes into hand as soon as you touch the gray area. I am talking about Questions, Tags, Users, Badges, Unanswered navigation) when I click on it, it borders the link-text.. like it's dotted border or something by default. How do I get rid of that?
