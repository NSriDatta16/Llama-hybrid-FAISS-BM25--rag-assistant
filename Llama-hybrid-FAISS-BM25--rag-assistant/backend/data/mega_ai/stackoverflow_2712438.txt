A few thousand strings take barely any memory at all. 4000 strings would take a couple of hundred kB, depending on length. (Rule of thumb here is string length + 20). Edit: Probably more like string length + 30 or 40, actually; I'm not certain how much overhead NSArray adds. Reedit: Given the information from the below question; you could probably get away with loading a few hundred strings at the most; just around the area you are browsing; basically turning your SQLite access into a sparse array that caches a few strings around the search area. Not, of course, that I believe it to be necessary; if the strings are location names they probably have an average byte size of 20-30 bytes; giving a (very) rough estimate of 300k of memory to keep them all in memory permanently, greatly reducing access time and giving a better user experience. The iPhone doesn't have a lot of RAM; but you can afford, at the very least a fair few megabytes ; 300k isn't going to break your back.
