Can regression forecasts of univariate time series be independent (of one another)

Suppose I have short-term forecasts from two univarite regression models of the same time series. I am choosing the models to be as different as possible in structure and assumptions. For instance, one may be an autoregression and the other fits a set of Fourier terms. Both models use only lags or transformed lags of the dependent variable as independent variables. Is it likely that the two forecasts will be independent? Is it possible ? I am trying to understand why the average of several forecasts is often better than the individual forecasts, and whether there is anything I can do to make that more likely to be true, or true to a greater extent. It seems like the average should be better than the component forecasts if the components have expected value equal to the future value, variances are comparable in magnitude, and the forecasts are independent.
