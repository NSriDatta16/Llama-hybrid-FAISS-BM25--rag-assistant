Flex3 - Using an image as a HSlider

I'm using a hslider to select a range of values. However, I only have 5 values. The problem I'm having is that the dragging of a thumb does not look too good and the values of the thumbs are displayed in labels, beside the slider... I was then thinking about how to improve the look of the dragging and the slider. I came up with this: having an image that would behave like a slider. For example, something like this: a background image (sorry for the "drawing") | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | -/\----------------/\-------- With 2 thumbs (min and max values) that would stay in the middle of each box. I don't know if my explanation is understandable. If not, let me know and I'll try to explain it in some other way =) Thanks for your help. Regards.
