ThreadLocal objects are typically static, which means that they preserve their values between function calls within the same thread. In your first code snippet, every time convertDate is called, a new SimpleDateFormatter object is created. In the second snippet, one SimpleDateFormatter object per thread is created. The same object is returned by the get() method every time convertDate is called within the same thread. ThreadLocal objects are useful in implementing thread-local storage , which means maintaining separate instances of variables for each thread.
