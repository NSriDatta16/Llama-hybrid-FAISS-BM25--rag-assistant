A deep learning approach that can calculate distance to obstacles

After reading about the most famous object detection CNN based methods: YOLO, YOLO 9000, r-cnn, faster r-cnn, etc., I was wondering if there is an architecture that can calculate the distance to the obstacle after detection? Thank you.
