It sounds to like you need use time series methods, such as ARMA or ARIMA, that let you calculate a regression using time as an independent variable without violating the independent observations assumption of OLS. You may want to try a two step analysis: - first use time as a single predictor variable and use a suitable time series method - two see if there is any meaningful difference in residuals between the two suppliers. (A simple t-test might be sufficient.)
