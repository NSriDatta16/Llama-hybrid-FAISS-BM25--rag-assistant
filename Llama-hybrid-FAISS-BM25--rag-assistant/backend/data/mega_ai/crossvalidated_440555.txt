Is the input given to a GAN constant?

to train a generative adversarial network, a random input is given to the generator to produce a random output, which is given to the discriminatant and, by backpropagation, tweak the generator's parameters. However, if the generator's parameters are only tweaked with the same random input at each iteration, then the generator will be able to produce only a unique output. So the question is : is the input constant ? And if not, is there any rule to produce other inputs ? Thanks
