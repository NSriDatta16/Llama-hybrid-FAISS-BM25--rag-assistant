Sounds like you're on your way, but I just wanted to mention Memory Mapped I/O as being a huge help when working with gigantic files. There was a time when I had to parse a .5GB binary file with Visual Basic 5 (yes)... importing the CreateFileMapping API allowed me to parse the file (and create several-gig "human-readable" file) in minutes . And it only took a half hour or so to implement. Here's a link describing the API on Microsoft platforms, though I'm sure MMIO should be on just about any platform: MSDN Good luck!
