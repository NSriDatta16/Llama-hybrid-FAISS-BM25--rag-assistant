Observing pinch multi-touch gestures in a UITableView

I am looking to implement a pinch in/out on top of a UITableView, I have looked at several methods including this one: Similar question But while I can create a UIViewTouch object and overlay it onto my UITableView, scroll events are not being relayed to my UITableView, I can still select cells, and they respond properly by triggering a transition to a new ViewController object. But I can not scroll the UITableView despite passing the touchesBegan, touchesMoved, and touchesEnded events.
