Using Spring's @RequestBody and reading HttpServletRequest.getInputStream() afterwards

I'm mapping my request's JSON POST data into an object using Spring's @RequestBody annotation and MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter . However after that I'd like to read the data in String form to do some additional authentication. But when the marshalling has happened, the InputStream in HttpServletRequest is empty. Once I remove the @RequestBody parameter from the method the reading of POST data into a String works as expected. Do I have to compromise by giving up the @RequestBody and doing the binding somehow manually or is there a more elegant solution?
