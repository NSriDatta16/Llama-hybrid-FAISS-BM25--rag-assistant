Interpreting temporal trends and selecting predictors in regression models

Scientific question: I want to know if temperature is changing across time (specifically, if it is increasing or decreasing). Data: My data consists of monthly temp averages across 90 years from a single weather station. I have no NA values. The temp data clearly oscillates annually due to monthly/seasonal trends. The temp data also appears to have approx 20-30-yr cycles when graphically viewing annual trends (by plotting annual avg temps across year): Analyses done in R using nlme() package Models: I tried a number of gls models and selected models that had lower AICs to move forward with. I also checked the significance of adding predictors based on ANOVA. It turns out that including time (centered around 1950), month (as a factor), and PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) trend data create the 'best' model (i.e., the one with the lowest AIC and in which each predictor improves the model significantly). Interestingly, using season (as a factor) performed worse than using month; additionally, no interactions were significant or improved the model. The best model is shown below: mod1 anova(mod1) Denom. DF: 1102 numDF F-value p-value (Intercept) 1 87333.28 AIC(mpdo7,mod.2.1) df AIC mod1 15 4393.008 I decided to check the residuals for temporal autocorrelation (using Bonferroni adjusted CI's), and found there to be significant lags in both the ACF and pACF. I ran numerous updates of the otherwise best model (mod1) using various corARMA parameter values. The best corARMA gls model removed any lingering autocorrelation and resulted in an improved AIC. But time (centered around 1950) becomes non-significant. This corARMA model is shown below: mod2 anova(mod2) Denom.

I assume that any inferences from a simple linear model (e.g., lm(temp ~ year) ) are inappropriate b/c of other underlying correlation structure (even though this simple linear trend is what I'm most interested in. I assume by removing affects of time lags (i.e. autocorrelation), I can better 'see' if there is in fact a long term temporal trend (incline/decline)? Is this the correct way to think about this? Concerning year becoming non-significant in the model... Would this have occurred because all of the temporal trend turned out to be due to autocorrealtion and therefore is now otherwise being accounted for in the model? Do I remove time from my model now (since it's no longer a significant predictor)?? UPDATE: I did do this, and the resulting model had a lower AIC (4291 vs 4300 of mod2 above). Though this isn't really a useful step for me, because I'm actually concerned about a trend in temp due to time (i.e., year) itself. Interpretation -- Am I interpreting the results correctly??: So based on the summary output above for mod2, is it correct to assume the answer to my original scientific question is: "temperature has declined at a rate of -0.005929, but this decline is not significant (p = 0.5067)." ?? Next steps... I ultimately want to see if temperature will have an impact on tree-community time-series data. My motivation behind the procedure mentioned here was to determine if there was a trend in temperature before bothering to start including it in subsequent analyses. So as performed, I assume I can now say that there is not a significant linear change (increase/decline) in temp. This would suggest that perhaps temp is not important to include in subsequent analyses? However...perhaps the cyclic nature of the temp is important and drives cyclic patterns in the plant data. How would I approach this? (i.e., how do I 'correlate' the cyclic trend in temp with potential cyclic trend in plants' -- vs. simply removing cyclic (seasonal) trends based on the ACF results)?
