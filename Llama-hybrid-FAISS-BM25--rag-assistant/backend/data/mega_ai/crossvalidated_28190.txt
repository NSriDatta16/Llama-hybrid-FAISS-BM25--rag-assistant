What is the impact of low predictor variance on logistic regression coefficient estimates?

Let's say I am using a logistic model to predict whether it rains (yes or no) based on the high temperature and have collected data for the past 100 days. Let's say that it rains 30/100 days. Furthermore, let's say that 70/100 days the temperature is actually 50 degrees. So there were only 30/100 days where the temperature was not 50 degrees. So in terms of the response variable (rain - yes or no), there is enough variation to develop the model. However, in regard to the predictor (temperature), with so many days where the temperature is 50 degrees, how does a recurring variable "element" (50 degrees) impact the calculations of a logistic model?
