Specifying a Normal-Log-Normal Mixture (Skew Normal) in WINBUGS/JAGS

I am an actuary working on a Bayesian loss reserve model using incremental average severity data. Exploratory analysis of the response seems to suggest a skew normal distribution of some sort would be appropriate, as there are some negative values in the left tail, and the log transformed positive values fit a normal distribution fairly well. I was inspired by this posting by Glenn Meyers and feel like the latter parameterization should be easy to implement in JAGS. However, since I am not used to JAGS, I am struggling to set the model up. Here is a example of what I am trying to do. #Likelihood (training set) for (i in 1:n){ y[i] ~ dnorm(z[i], tau) z[i] ~ dlnorm(mu[i], tauln) mu[i] I am not sure how to handle the negative $\mu_i$s in the absence of control structures ( if , else , etc...) I am used to. I need to pass the zero valued or negative $\mu_i$s directly to the mean parameter for my response y i . Is there a clever way to do this with the step function? Should I consider specifying the normal-log-normal mixture another way? FYI â€“ I also posted this question here .
