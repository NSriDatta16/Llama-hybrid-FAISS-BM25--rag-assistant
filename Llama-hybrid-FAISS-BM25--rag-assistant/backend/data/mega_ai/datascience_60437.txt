Transform test data when using a persistent model

I'm quite new to data science and only slowly following the necessary steps to get valid results using scikit-learn. As far as I understand you fit and transform the training data and only transform the test data (using the parameters retrieved by the earlier fitting). For my project a persistent model is necessary, for that I export the trained model using joblib. When applying the model on test data later, is there a way to retrieve the parameters (for transformation) generated during the training process?
