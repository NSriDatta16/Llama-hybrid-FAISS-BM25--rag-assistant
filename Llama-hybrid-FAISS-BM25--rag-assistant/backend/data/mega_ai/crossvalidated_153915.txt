Property of the autocovariance function in time series

In the framework of time series analysis Why does $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} n^{-1} \sum_{|h| The LHS (left hand side) sequence of functions we are taking the limit of is $$\{ |\gamma(1)|, \frac{1}{2}(|\gamma(1)| + |\gamma(2)|), \frac{1}{3}(|\gamma(1)| + |\gamma(2)| + |\gamma(3)|), \dots \} $$ The RHS (right hand side) sequence we are taking the limit of is $$\{2 |\gamma(1)|, 2 |\gamma(2)| , 2 |\gamma(3)|, \dots \}$$ Adding some steps in-between might help me greatly. Where $\gamma(h)$ is the auto-covariance function defines as $\gamma(h) \equiv Cov(X_{t+h}, X_t)$.
