I am doing precisely the same thing and have various issues semi regularly even with this process. How do you handle the spacing between copying the file from Server A to Server B and restoring the transactional backup on Server B. Every once in a while the transaction backup is larger than normal and takes a longer time to copy. The restore job then gets an operating system error that the file is in use. This is not such a big deal since the file is automatically applied the next time around however it would be nicer to have a more elegant solution in general and one that specifically fixes this issue.
