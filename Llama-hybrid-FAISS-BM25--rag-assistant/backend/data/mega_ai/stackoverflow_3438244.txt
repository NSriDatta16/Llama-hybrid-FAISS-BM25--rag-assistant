Splitting the content of a cell in a CSV file into separate cells

I have a large CSV file full of organisations names and addresses. I need to hand over a clean csv file to our developers who need to build a database around them. The problem is that the street names and numbers are in the same cell, and they need to be separate, so that we can filter organisations by street names. So, I would like to split the content of the address cell, into two cells. The address cell is built like this: [streetname][space][digits][etc] - So I need to keep only the street name, and move everything after street name to another cell. An example would be the content cell D7: [D7]Konkylievej 3, 1. m.f.[/D7] Which would have to be split like this: [D7]Konkylievej[/D7] [E7]3, 1. m.f.[/E7] The size of the CSV file makes this impossible to do manually. Is there any way to do it automatically?
