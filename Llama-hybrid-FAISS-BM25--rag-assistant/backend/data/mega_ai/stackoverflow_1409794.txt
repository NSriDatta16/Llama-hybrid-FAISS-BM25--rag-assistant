Yep - a reference should be thought of as an alias for a variable, which is why you can't reassign them like you can reassign pointers (and also means that, even in the case of a non-optimizing compiler, you won't take up any additional storage space). When used outside of function arguments, references are mostly useful to serve as shorthands for very->deeply->nested.structures->and.fields :)
