I like to use it for clarification, as when accessing members that were inherited. It reminds the reader where the variable came from if you don't have a naming convention that conveys that information. You must use the this pointer when: Returning the current object. Setting up relations between objects (passing this into a constructor or setter) Checking for self reference: this != argPtr
