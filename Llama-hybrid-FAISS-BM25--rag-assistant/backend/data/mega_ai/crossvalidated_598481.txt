This is a really interesting question and I doubt that there is any one 'correct' answer to it, but here are my thoughts on the reasons, which can be split into three categories. History I suggest you have a look at Section 2.7 Discrete-Time Models in the book Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals by Keeling and Rohani. This book points out that most of the literature on epidemic modelling is focussed on continuous time differential equation models, following on from the SIR differential equation model which was first analysed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. The authors state This [focus on differential equation models in our book] is partly because the vast majority of models in the literature are based on this framework. The inherent assumption has been that the processes of disease transmission occur in real time and that variability in factors such as the infectious period may be dynamically important. However, they also acknowledge that some discrete time models have been developed, for example the "chain binomial" models which assume that there are successive generations of new infections. Mathematics Most differential equation models based on the SIR model cannot be solved explicitly. However they can usually be simulated in a straightforward manner, so the lack of easy solvability is not really a problem. One potential issue (also discussed in Section 2.7 of the book) with discrete time models is that we have to choose a time step, and it may not be obvious what the time step should be. Perhaps the time step should be the 'generation time' i.e. the time between successive individuals being infected in a chain of infection. However, these times may vary between individuals, and may be very uncertain in real applications. So we may not want to embed an assumption regarding the generation time in the formulation of the model. Hence continuous time models can seem more attractive. Another issue is that the process of formulating a discrete time model can 'fail', in the sense that the discrete time model does not exhibit the expected properties of the real disease system e.g. see Glass, Kathryn, Yincun Xia, and Bryan T. Grenfell. Interpreting time-series analyses for continuous-time biological models—measles as a case study. Journal of theoretical biology 223, no. 1 (2003): 19-25. Relating model to data One apparent motivation for discrete time models is that much of the data are collected at discrete time intervals e.g. daily reports of new infections. However, more sophisticated techniques for model parameterisation have made this consideration less relevant. We can use Bayesian techniques to fit epidemic models with latent variables: we can formulate a continuous time process model (which is not directly observed) and use discrete time data to parameterise it. There are countless examples of this approach in the literature e.g. Ster IC, Singh BK, Ferguson NM (2009) Epidemiological inference for partially observed epidemics: The example of the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic in great britain. Epidemics 1: 21–34.
