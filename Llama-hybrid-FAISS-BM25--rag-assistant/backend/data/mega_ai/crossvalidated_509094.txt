Why is Propensity Score Matching better than just Matching?

Propensity Score Matching at a high level uses a framework of: Identify potential confounders from the co-variates i.e all factors which can potentially influence the subject being part of experiment group Calculate Propensity Score = Pr (Subject being part of treatment | co-variates) Create a model to estimate the membership for each of the subjects of being in treatment. Subjects get divided into multiple strata of Control / Experiment based on Propensity scores. This would make the groups balanced w.r.t the subjects having similar characteristics in terms of co-variates. Calculate effect of treatment by averaging the sum of differences in the dependent variable for each strata. My question is: why is this better than just matching subjects with a treatment with a similar non-treated subject as measured by a distance measure and co-variate values? And then averaging the sum of differences between all pairs of treated-non-treated subjects? That seems simpler and would appear to address the self-selection bias that PSM is meant to reduce / eliminate. What am I missing here?
