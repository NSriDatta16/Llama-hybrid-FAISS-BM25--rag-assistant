Gnome Desktop Icons Alignment

It has been a long time since I started to compare the gnome desktop to the windows desktop. But since I began to use linux, I realized that the "gnome way" to align the icons on Desktop is not that nice for me. And comparing to Windows's way, windows is better for me. (remember, for me). I'd like to know if anyone has some tip to make "gnome desktop icon alignment" more like windows do. I tried to reduce the icon's size, did something, but was not that all. So, could anyone tell another tip? I like when I put something on windows desktop, and wherever I put the file, Windows organize the file and put the icon right after the last icon (in a cascade style) (and automatically). Any tips?
