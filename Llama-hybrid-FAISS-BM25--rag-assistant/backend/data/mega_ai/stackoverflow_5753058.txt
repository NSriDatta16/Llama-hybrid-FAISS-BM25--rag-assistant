How to format paragraphs like RFCs using gvim?

I write quite an amount of documents using gvim. I notice that I spend more time in formatting them. I like the RFC format. Trying to optimize, I was looking for commands/macros in gvim to do them efficiently. Has anyone tried RFC like formatting for paragraphs, headers with gvim?
