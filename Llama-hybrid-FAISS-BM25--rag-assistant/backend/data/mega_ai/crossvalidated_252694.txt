Average Marginal Effects interpretation

I ran a regression where the dependent variable is winning (1=win) Given that my regression is probit I want to understand the coefficient. I've done margins, dydx() for my independent variable (average marginal effects). This yielded a result of -.41. What does this mean? Does it mean that the probability of winning goes down by .41 percentage points? and if so, when does it go down by that much? I just want a lay person's way to explain this .41 value.
