Matrix dimensions in Linear Algebra vs Time series Analysis

I am confused or may misunderstand the dimensions of a Matrix when I was reading about time series analysis. From what I understand in linear Algebra, if we have a Matrix $A \in \mathbf{R}^{m*n}$ , this means $m$ refers to rows and $n$ refers to columns. But, when I was reading about multivariate time series, the notations kind of seem all the way around. They refer to $m$ as variables or features whereas $n$ as the length. From my general understanding, if we have a number of instances $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{R}^{m*n}$ , this means $m$ would be the dimension of matrix (column or number of variables) and $n$ would be the length (number of rows). This seems to me we have a transpose Matrix. The inconsistent in notations kind of makes me thinking that I may misunderstand something. does this help in time series analysis or what is the intuition behind this.
