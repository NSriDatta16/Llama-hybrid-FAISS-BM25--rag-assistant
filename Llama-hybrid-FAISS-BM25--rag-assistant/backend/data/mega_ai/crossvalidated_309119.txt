Yes, the average is higher than the median, and the reason is that the distribution of incomes is not symmetric. In fact, symmetric distributions have the same value for the mean and the median. But the income in the US is not symmetric: in fact you have a few people making a lot of money and a lot of people making little money. So that the median is pretty low, compared to the mean: the mean is affected by the rich guys but the median is not. About your argument, it is probably true that the income is correlated with age but that's not necessarily what makes the distribution asymmetric.
