Haldane's prior Beta(0,0) - Part 1

This article $^1$ on p.16 specifies Haldane's prior as: $$p(\theta) = \frac{1}{θ(1−θ)}$$. However, other $^2$ source on p.6 specifies Haldane's prior as proportional to $\frac{1}{θ(1−θ)}$, i.e. $$p(\theta) \propto \frac{1}{θ(1−θ)}$$. Could anyone clarify which expression is the accurate one. 1. Approximation of improper priors 2. Bayesian Analysis of Some Common Distributions
