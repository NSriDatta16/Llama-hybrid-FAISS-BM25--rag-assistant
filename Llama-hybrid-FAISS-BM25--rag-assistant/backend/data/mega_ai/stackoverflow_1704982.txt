What you want to do is store the Latitude and Longitude as the new SQL2008 Spatial type -> GEOGRAPHY. Here's a screen shot of a table, which I have. alt text http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/6839/zipcodetable.png In this table, we have two fields that store geography data. Boundary: this is the polygon that is the zip code boundary CentrePoint: this is the Latitude / Longitude point that represents the visual middle point of this polygon. The main reason why you want to save it to the database as a GEOGRAPHY type is so you can then leverage all the SPATIAL methods off it -> eg. Point in Poly, Distance between two points, etc. BTW, we also use Google's Maps API to retrieve lat/long data and store that in our Sql 2008 DB -- so this method does work.
