Changing link underline color

I wonder if there is any trick to solve this problem. I have my link as below text and want to change the underline color. This link contains in many lines which needs to change the underline color to be lighter than the existing one Using border bottom is not the way to solve this because multiple lines. are there any trick to solve this? EDIT @Paolo Bergantino: It works with IE8 , is it possible to hack with IE6,7?
