Trouble replicating a simple OR table (Bayesian meta-analysis)

I'm reading this intro to meta analysis from Columbia University, and I cannot replicate the Log OR in the very first table. For the first study: OR = (1/39)/(2/34) = .03/.06 = 0.44 Log OR = log(0.44) = -0.36 Where as the table shows -0.83. I'm puzzled. What elementary thing am I missing here?
