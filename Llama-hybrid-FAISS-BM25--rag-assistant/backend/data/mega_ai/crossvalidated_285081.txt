In general there is nothing wrong with using log transformation in a VAR model. For example, macroeconometric VAR models often use log transformations of GPD and other variables. Since you have a small sample (just 20 data points), you could try some very simple models or models that do some regularization. If it is a VAR, go for low lag order, e.g. VAR(1), or for a Bayesian VAR if you have some idea about suitable priors; alternatively, try exponential smooting or auto.arima (functions ets and auto.arima from "forecast" package in R).
