Construct a multivariate neural network

I want to build a neural network with a data input of 15-18 variables. I want to use the model for anomaly detection based on the reconstruction error. I've done some tutorials now but the data was always already given so I have to do the very first step on my own now. Thus, I wonder, how do I handle the multivariate data? I see three options: 1) Build a single neural network for each variable (univariate) 2) Build a neural network with a single outcome based on all multivariate input variables 3) Build a neural network with a multivariate output based on a multivariate input. 1) and 2) is quite cumbersome I'd say. But is 3) even possible? If so, what do I have to take into account? Will the outcome variable then just be a data frame, or some other type like a certain array or so?
