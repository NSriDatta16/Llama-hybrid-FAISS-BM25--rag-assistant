Using properties instead of public fields is good practice - I would imagine that when data binding was being designed, they chose to try to encourage that good practice. Allowing fields to be bound directly would be tantamount to saying that the separation between interface and implementation didn't matter, and that it was fine to just expose everything publicly. That's just a guess, mind you. Although there's PropertyDescriptor there could equally have been FieldDescriptor , and you can fetch fields by reflection just as easily as properties... so I doubt that it was a technical problem.
