If there exists a simple but less elegant solution that closely matches the style and techniques used elsewhere in the code base (and consequently, is more easily understood by your colleagues), it may be safer to take that path -- compared to the solution that is perfect from an academic point of view, but difficult to understand if you never happened to read that specific paper. Similarly, a small change may be considerably safer than a major refactoring effort that the elegant solution would basically require. This is especially relevant in any world that lacks unit tests.
