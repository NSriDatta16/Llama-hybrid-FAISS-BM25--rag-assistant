Interpreting adjusted relationship between two variables when using splines

Suppose I am interested in regressing the boolean outcome y onto two continuous variables x1 , and x2 . I might fit a logistic regression model, and then interpret the coefficient of x1 and say that this estimate for the relationship of x1 on y is "adjusted for" x2 . However, instead of simple logistic regression, I would like to use splines (i.e. I don't want to assume that the relationship of x1,x2 is linear in the log odds of y ). I'd still like to obtain the similar interpretation though. That is, I'd like to study the relationship between x1 and y , while controlling for x2 . Here is my attempt, using the Iris dataset as a working example in R: library(splines) library(ggplot2) data(iris) y $Species == 'setosa') df Sepal.Width, x2 = iris$Petal.Length) fit $x1,3) projection x1, projection) + geom_point()) In particular, it is different from the relationship between $x1$ and $y$ without adjusting for $x2$ : fit In my application, the relationship between $y$ and $x1$ changes dramatically when I add in $x2$ , but this example with iris is just to show the idea. Is it valid to interpret the first curve as the relationship between $x1$ and $y$ adjusted for $x2$ ?
