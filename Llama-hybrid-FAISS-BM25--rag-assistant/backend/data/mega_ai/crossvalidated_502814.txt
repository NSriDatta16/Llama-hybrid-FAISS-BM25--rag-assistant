After skimming some Bayesian Statistics textbooks, I came to the conclusion that the standard Bayesian approach would be to take : $$[_()]â‰¥2/3$$ Still, I am not sure about this. Correct. We want the probability of the next toss being heads greater than or equal to $2/3$ . This means $$P(H|\mathcal D)=\int P(H|\theta)\pi(\theta|\mathcal D)d\theta=\int \theta \pi(\theta|\mathcal D)d\theta = E[\theta|\mathcal D]$$ which is the posterior expectation. $\mathcal D$ represents the data.
