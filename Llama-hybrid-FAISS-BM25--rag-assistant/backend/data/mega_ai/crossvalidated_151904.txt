Lasso does variable selection, whereas ridge is similar to principal components analysis (PCA).. So you use these penalty methods accordingly.. Eg in image processing where you have a lot of similar correlated inputs (pixels) pca is natural and you select the directions that involve the most pixels changing together (throwing away directions in which only a few pixels change together-"noise'). Whereas lasso would be selecting individual pixels from each correlated group of pixels, and not averaging over them as l2/PCA would. If instead you have a whole bunch of heterogeneous inputs (eg predictors for smoking?) where correlation between inputs is either small, or you want to eliminate (to make the model interpretable), then lasso is more appropriate
