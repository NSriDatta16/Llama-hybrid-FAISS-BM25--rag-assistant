When is it more appropriate to use a binary model rather than a count model?

Is there a test or rule of thumb for determining when it is better to use a binary model such as logistic regression vs. a count model such as negative binomial regression? For example, these data "seem" like a "poor" candidate for a count model and perhaps would be better modeled as a binary model: count = 0, freq = 10,000,000 count = 1, freq = 700,000 count = 2, freq = 100 These data "seem" like a "better" candidate for a count model: count = 0, freq = 10,000,000 count = 1, freq = 70,000 count = 2, freq = 25,000 count = 3, freq = 10,000 count = 4, freq = 5,000 count = 5, freq = 1,000 count = 6, freq = 500 count = 7, freq = 50 And these data seem like they are in a grey area between a binary and count model: count = 0, freq = 10,000,000 count = 1, freq = 70,000 count = 2, freq = 7,000 count = 3, freq = 700 count = 4, freq = 350 count = 5, freq = 90 count = 6, freq = 50 count = 7, freq = 5 I just can't seem to find an answer to this question, but it is also hard (at least for me) to articulate it in a search.
