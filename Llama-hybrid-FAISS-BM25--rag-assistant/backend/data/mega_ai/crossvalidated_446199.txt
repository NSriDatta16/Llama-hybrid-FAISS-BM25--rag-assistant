Finding Average Wait Time From Number of People Waiting

Problem: We are trying to estimate the average wait time for a process. Only data we have is how many people are in the system at a given time, how many have entered this period, how many exited this period and the length of the queue at the end of the period. Data example: Period Waiting at the start of Period New Applications Finished Applications Waiting end of period 1 1000 100 50 1050 2 1050 200 150 1100 ... ... ... ... ... Goal: to find the average time people who made their application in period x waited. My Attempt: Using the general queue model (mm1), got the average waiting time as arrivals/ pending. This method assumes the serving times follow the same distribution over time, which is a fine assumption; however, we believe the number of servers in the queue changes over time (hence variable waiting time estimates). How would we go about estimating the average wait time for a person entering the system at period X given we have only these observations? We believe this is a first come first serve queue if it is any help.
