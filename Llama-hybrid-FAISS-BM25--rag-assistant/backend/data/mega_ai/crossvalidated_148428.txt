Inconsistent Performance of PCA Results from SPSS

I've completed PCA with my dataset (16 variables) and extracted 3 factors. I then created an Excel spreadsheet where I can enter in user provided data and calculate the scores for each of the three factors based on the regression coefficients from the Component Score Coefficient Matrix created during the PCA. My problem is that whenever I input some sample data, the resulting score is only matches the expected output for 2 of 3 factors. I've double checked three times that the problem is not with Excel or the entry of the coefficients. Back in SPSS, I've calculated a new variable based on the coefficients for the incorrect formula, and they still don't match the output calculated from the PCA. I've also tried to find the coefficients by performing regression on the calculated factor score from the PCA, and the initial input set of variables, but all that does is provide an unstandardized version of the coefficients, which has the same outcome (2 of 3 factors are accurate) Is there another step required between the PCA and finding the coeffcients to calculate my factor scores? thanks
