Mounting an xml file as a filesystem, where elements are directories, and their contents is stored as a plain file. The attributes are stored in an "attributes" file as newline separated name: value pairs in each directory. This would allow XML to be modified using the common shell tools. (sed, grep, mkdir, rm, rmdir, cat, vim, etc...) An elegant solution would have to be found for multiple elements with the same name. So it's a bit far field. You never said that it had to be a good idea.
