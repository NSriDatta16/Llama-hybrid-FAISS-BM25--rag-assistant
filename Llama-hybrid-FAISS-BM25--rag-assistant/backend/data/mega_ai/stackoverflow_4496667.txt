For ASP.NET MVC 3 the thing to do is "bin deploy" it - Scott Hanselman has a post on doing exactly that on his blog: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BINDeployingASPNETMVC3WithRazorToAWindowsServerWithoutMVCInstalled.aspx I recommend you download the Windows Azure platform training kit and work through the first few labs just to get the feel of Azure. http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=413E88F8-5966-4A83-B309-53B7B77EDF78&displaylang=en I agree with Nathan and XIII - you have to ditch SQL CE it just doesn't work in the elastic cloud model, look at Azure table storage instead, it's cheap and scalable. (And it's in the first lab) If you're just playing around then grab the introductory offer on Nathan's link, it's a free start. Unfortunately you can't use it to run something permanently as there aren't enough hours. (Apparently that may change in the new year). If you want to run a very small instance for a month it's about $40, a small is $90. If you're more serious than that, join Bizspark and get free access to more resources.
