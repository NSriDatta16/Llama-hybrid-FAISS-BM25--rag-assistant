PCA Correlation or Covariance? A follow-up question

I've already read the answers to this question , but they were written so long ago that I wonder if some progress has been made on the subject since then. I would like to know if there's some more objective way to choose the correlation or covariance matrix to do PCA than «careful thought and some experience» or «similar scales»? Any help would be appreciated. Edit: I asked this because there could be maybe some measure, and a respective scale of interpretation for when to use a covariance or correlation matrix. In statistics, we can observe some examples of this like for bayes factors, p-values, or at least an interpretative comparison like what happens with AIC or BIC, albeit these measures are for different objectives than the one I'm searching.
