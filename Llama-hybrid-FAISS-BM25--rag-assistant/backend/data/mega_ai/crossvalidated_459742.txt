How to construct confidence intervals for causal tree and calculate the actual coverage rate in simulation?

I‘m reading "Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects(Susan Athey & Guido Imbens(2016)" recently， and I'm curious about how do the author construct valid confident intervels for the conditional average treatment effect(cate) and how can we calculate the actual coverage rate if the confidence intervals are constructed? I've tried to
