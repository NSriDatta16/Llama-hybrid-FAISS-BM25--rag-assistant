How do I write the (multiple) linear regression equation with interaction term?

I was going through an article on Towards Data Science page on interaction Terms. The author used two predictors: Investment1 and Investment2 , he then wrote the multiple linear equation with the interaction between Investment1 and Investment2 as below: $$ ROI = \hat{β}{_0} + \hat{β}{_1}\text{Investment1} + \hat{β}{_2}\text{Investment2} + \hat{β}{_3}\text{Investment1*Investment2} + Ɛ $$ next he reduced the equation as: $$ ROI = \hat{β}{_0} + (\hat{β}{_1} + \hat{β}{_3}*\text{Investment2})*\text{Investment1} + \hat{β}{_2}\text{Investment2} + Ɛ $$ But this equation could also be reduced as below, instead of what the author has done.... $$ ROI = \hat{β}{_0} + \hat{β}{_1}\text{Investment1} + (\hat{β}{_2} + \hat{β}{_3}*\text{Investment1)*Investment2} $$ I am confused what difference is there in both of them? If the author's way is right then why is it right? if there is any interpretational difference, then could someone please explain both in layman terms... My second question regarding Interaction Term: Now, lets suppose instead of two predictors there are few more predictors and they are interacting too.... example: Lets say we have predictors: GPA, IQ, Gender and the ones that have interaction are GPA * IQ and GPA * Gender Now, the multiple linear regression equation with Interaction Terms included, would be: $$ \hat{Y}{_i} = \hat{β}{_0} + \hat{β}{_1}\text{GPA} + \hat{β}{_2}\text{IQ} + \hat{β}{_3}\text{Gender} + \hat{β}{_4}\text{GPA*IQ} + \hat{β}{_5}\text{GPA*Gender} $$ The part now I am confused here is, how to write this equation in reduced form as above.... which term should I take along with the interaction term and re-write the equation....!!!
