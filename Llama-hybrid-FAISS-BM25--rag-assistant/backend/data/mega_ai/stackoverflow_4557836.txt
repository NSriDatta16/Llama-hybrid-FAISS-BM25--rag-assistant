Controlling dynamically created containers

Forgive me, I'm new to Flash Builder 4 and Actionscript 3 (actually, to programming as a whole beyond some very simplistic stuff). I have watched / read a bunch of tutorials, and started a project but now seem to have hit a wall. The answer is most likely simple, but seems to be alluding me. How do I (or What approach should I take) to control visual elements, for instance, BorderContainer's, that I created dynamically? As is, I have an Application containing a BorderContainer and a DataGrid. At runtime, 3 new BorderContainers (which are dragable, and resizeable) are created based on XML data that contains X & Y co-ordinates, and Height and Width values, and then added to the pre-existing BorderContainer. How would I go about getting the properties of these children BorderContainers to be displayed and remain up-to-date in the DataGrid (such as when they are moved/resized)? My intentions in the future would be to have a custom component which displays a summary of these items in a separate area (think photoshop "layers" control, but much more simplistic), but wanted to get a better understanding of what's going on first. Any input, documentation, examples, etc. is all appreciated. Again, I apologize for what may be an incredibly easy solution, or if any of my language is unclear, I'm new to this ^_^;
