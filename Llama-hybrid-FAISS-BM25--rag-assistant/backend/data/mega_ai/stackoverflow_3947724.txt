Another approach could be to create Value Objects from your XML and bind your components to these objects, this way you would decouple your components from the XML , which can be handy if at some point in the future, you don't want to use XML, but JSON for instance. Each Value Object would have the properties defined in your question , i.e , imageSource , id , url etc... and each component would be bound to one Value Object Edit Have a look at this video training, it covers data retrieval from an XML , ArrayCollections of ValueObjets etc... http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/videotraining.html
