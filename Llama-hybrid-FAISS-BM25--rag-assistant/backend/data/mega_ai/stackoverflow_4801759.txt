Like eldarerathis commented, it's a bit overkilled if you would create a custom TextView just for changing the text color. Nonetheless, here is a tutorial on how to create a custom TextView. Building Custom component on Android developer is also a good read, in fact, I'd encourage you to read through it first. The summarize 3 steps: Extend an existing View class or subclass with your own class. Override some of the methods from the superclass. The superclass methods to override start with 'on', for example, onDraw(), onMeasure(), and onKeyDown(). This is similar to the on... events in Activity or ListActivity that you override for lifecycle and other functionality hooks. Use your new extension class. Once completed, your new extension class can be used in place of the view upon which it was based.
