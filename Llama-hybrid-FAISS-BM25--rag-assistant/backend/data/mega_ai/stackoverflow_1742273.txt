Qt (Creator) with WinSocks (ws2_32)

I want to use an older code-fragment in my Qt-project, which is using WinSocks. I created my program with Qt Creator and I don't know, how I can link to the ws2_32-Library. I already added LIBS += -lws2_32 to my .pro, but nothing happened. So how can I link to this library? edit: Where can I find the ws2_32.lib to include it? Do I have to download it first? I know it comes with "Visual Studio", but I don't use it and I don't want to use it.
