Most compilers (linkers) actually do support a (non-portable) way of specifying the order. For example, with visual studio you can use the init_seg pragma to arrange the initialization into several different groups. AFAIK there is no way to guarantee order WITHIN each group. Since this is non-portable you may want to consider if you can fix your design to not require it, but the option is out there.
