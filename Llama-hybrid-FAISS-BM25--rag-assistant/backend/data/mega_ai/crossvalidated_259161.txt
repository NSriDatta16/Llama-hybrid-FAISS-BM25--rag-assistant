Rank correlations with very coarse reference

I have some data about 50 hotels (for this example). They are rated 1-5 stars -- the ground truth. Then I have a number of different estimators which use some features to output a score. For example one estimator might be say "[average_room_cost] + 100*([number of staff]/[number_of_rooms])" which outputs a score between 50 and 10000. Another might be "[Average Yelp Review]*[average_room_cost]" All my other estimators are similar, all outputting roughly scores between 50 and 10000 (give or take an order of magnitude.). I want to work out which estimator is best. To do this I am using a rank correlation. Currently I am using Kendall's rank correlation, as I understand it handles ties better than Spearman's. There are a lot of ties in the ground truth ranks -- there are only 5 ranks and there are 50 hotels. but ties are very rare between scores given by 1 estimator. Is this the best way to assess it? Or are there special rating correlations?
