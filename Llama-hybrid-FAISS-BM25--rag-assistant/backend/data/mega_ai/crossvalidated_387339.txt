A not well-known observation is that a two-stage PCA is equivalent to an LDA if the W (within group covariance) matrix is full-rank. https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/30/3/268/1647927 This means it is an easy "trick" to do LDA if W is not full-rank (from 25 year old memory so check original paper!) Compute the eigenvectors (E) and eigenvalues (L) of W Using only the vectors of E with positive L, project the data onto this subspace (pca-1 scores) Standardize the pca-1 scores Do a PCA of the B (among covariance) matrix of the standardized pca-1 scores The scores in this PCA-2 space are your LD scores
