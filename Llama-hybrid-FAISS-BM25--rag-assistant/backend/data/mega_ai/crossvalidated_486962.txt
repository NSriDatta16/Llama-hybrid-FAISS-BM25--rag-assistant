Sampling from interdependent data set

I have a simulation model with trains entering at the limits of the simulation part way into their trip. I have sourced real-world data which provides the variation in the arrival time of these trains relative to their scheduled time. For trains, the lateness of a train is not independent of the previous trains arrival. I have calculated a correlation coefficient of up to 0.50 for some locations, meaning that you can get a pretty good estimate of the next trains lateness based on the lateness of the last train. If I blindly randomly sample from the data set, this interdependence would vanish, and I could even have very early trains following very late trains, creating an impossible out-of-order situation. What techniques are there for sampling from interdependent time series data like this? Should I create a simple linear regression with added randomness as a fit to the data? Should I sample real world clusters of multiple data points instead of sampling one at a time? I have searched, but I haven't been able to find any literature, perhaps because I do not know the correct terminology. I would expect that this is a common problem in sampling from economics and scientific datasets
