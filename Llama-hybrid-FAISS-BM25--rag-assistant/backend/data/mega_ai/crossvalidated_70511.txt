Assessing role of a count variable in regression... Do you need a zero?

Is it acceptable to run a logistic regression on a yes/no DV and include a predictor variable that is a count of the number of times something happened previously, but none of the cases has a zero count? It seems to me you would be testing if more than 1 event matters, but not whether the overall number matters compared to no events. Thanks. To give some context, it's a study to see how interaction with government officials affects future use of government services. If the participants were limited to those who had at least one interaction, could you then use a regression to identify the potential effect of each additional interaction? It would seem to be a better design and more robust results if you had some "zero" participants too. Thoughts? Thanks for the thoughtful responses. It's not my study, I'm assessing someone else's. It just struck me as odd to talk about the effect of something without including the comparison of people who had no experience with X. It may not be the number of times something happened that creates the effect, but rather that it happened at all. you may detect an intensification of the effect with more of X, but without zero, do you know if it would hold if there was no X. And, yes, there are many other issues, as it's apparent the number of previous X is definitely not random. Thanks again
