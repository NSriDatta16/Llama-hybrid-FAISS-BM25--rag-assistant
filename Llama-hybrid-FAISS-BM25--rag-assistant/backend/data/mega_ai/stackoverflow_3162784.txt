I realized that the best way to do this would be to create a test Storage that has a basic get and set functionality (kind of like a test database), and have UserInfoStorage use this to store and retrieve data. This allows for testing the interface of UserInfoStorage directly, without tying it to the implementation of Storage , so if I change the way UserInfoStorage works, the tests will still be valid (since they are not testing whether UserInfoStorage interacts with Storage correctly, but rather that the functions of UserInfoStorage produce the desired results).
