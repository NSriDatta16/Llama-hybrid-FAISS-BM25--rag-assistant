How to implement discontinuous action for reinforcement learning?

I am training a RL agent to operate a device and the agent has a continuous action space (DDPG). The device can be off or operate in a voltage range 6-12 V. If a naively map 6-12 V to the interval [-1, 1] then I remove the option switch of the device. If I map 0-12V to the interval [-1, 1] half the range will not be used and makes the learning problem harder. I can introduce a discontinuity and say that the action values in the range [-1, -0.9) turns of the device off Add additional action variables that is on/off Is there any standard way to approach this problem? Any reference to where a similar situation has been tackled would be appreciated.
