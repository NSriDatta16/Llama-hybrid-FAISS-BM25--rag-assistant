I've heard the term "benchmarking" in a Time Series context, and one definition I've seen for that is: Benchmarking refers to techniques used to ensure coherence between time series data of the same target variable measured at different frequencies, for example, sub-annually and annually. Benchmarking consists of imposing the level of the benchmark series while minimizing the revisions of the observed movement in the sub-annual series as much as possible. Consequently, the growth rates in the benchmarked series are coherent with those from the benchmarks. In certain situations, benchmarking can improve the accuracy and timeliness of statistical output. Not sure if that's applicable in one of these two definitions or not.
