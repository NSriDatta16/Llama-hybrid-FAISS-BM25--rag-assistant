Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, is it worth it?

On Goodfellow-et-al-2016,Deep Learning book the following sentence can be found: "Currently, we cannot unambiguously recommend Bayesian hyperparameter optimization as an established tool for achieving better deep learning results or for obtaining those results with less effort. Bayesian hyperparameter optimization sometimes performs comparably to human experts, sometimes better, but fails catastrophically on other problems. It may be worth trying to see if it works on a particular problem but is not yet sufficiently mature or reliable". Significant progress occurred? Personally, I never used Bayesian hyperparameter optimization preferring for simplicity grid search and random search. As a first approximation I'm considering easy AI task as multiclassification problems with DNNs and CNNs. In which cases should I take it into consideration, is it worth it?
