Is it reasonable to use rules to label positive samples when doing fraud detection in machine learning?

We use supervised learning algorithm to detect fraud, but we have fewer or even no positive samples, is it reasonable if we use rules to label positive samples? if so, is the supervised learning model is meaningful? If we make use of anomaly detection to catch fraud, we use rules to label data in model evaluation phase, will the model work? All above, if we can find rules to label data, does the model we build to detect fraud make any sense? because we've already used rules to find fraud.
