This thread is somewhat old, but this is a problem that I have been giving some thought to and wanted to suggest an approach. Let's say you have external data $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ and internal data $X_{n+1}, \ldots, X_m$ , a likelihood function $p(X_1, \ldots, X_n \mid \theta)$ and a prior distribution $\pi(\theta \mid h)$ . Your goal is to use the external data to estimate $h$ , then update your prior using the internal data. You could do this using an empirical Bayes type approach. That is, you first calculate the likelihood of the hyperparameters $h$ , given the external data. Then, you estimate $h$ using maximum likelihood estimation. $$p(X_1, \ldots, X_n \mid h) = \int p(X_1, \ldots, X_n \mid \theta)\pi(\theta \mid h) d\theta$$ $$\hat{h} = \max_h p(X_1, \ldots, X_n \mid h)$$ You then proceed in the usual Bayesian way, updating the prior based on the internal data. $$\pi(\theta \mid \hat{h}, X_{n+1}, \ldots, X_m) \propto p(X_{n+1}, \ldots, X_m \mid \theta) p(\theta \mid \hat{h})$$
