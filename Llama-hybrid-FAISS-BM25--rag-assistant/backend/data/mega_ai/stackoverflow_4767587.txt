You need to implement the DragOver event. Check if the mouse is located close to the top or the bottom of the control (use PointToClient). When it is, enable a timer with an interval of ~200 msec. In the Tick event handler scroll the DGV by a row. Disable the timer when the mouse isn't close and after DoDragDrop returns. The user can now easily and intuitively scroll the grid just be hovering near the ends.
