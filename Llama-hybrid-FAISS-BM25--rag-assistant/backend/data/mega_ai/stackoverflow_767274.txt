This solution makes your system dependent on javascript to work. A more robust solution is to build something that is at least functional without javascript, and then on load use javascript to modify the behavior of the buttons to do something more ajax-y. It requires more code to do it that way and doesn't look as elegant. But if you're looking for the "best" solution, you may want to weigh in and determine whether handling the "no javascript" corner-case is a priority or not. Which ever route you decide, you should at least consciously make a decision one way or another instead of letting it surprise you later on.
