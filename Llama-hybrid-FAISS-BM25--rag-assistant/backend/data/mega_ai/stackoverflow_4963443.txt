Use $pdf->SetMargins(20,18); To add margins. I use this library myself to do a wide variety of crap on a pretty busy e-commerce site. I'll take a look through my code to see if I can come up with a solution on the paragraph indentation. I'd like to add that this library is GREAT for what it does, but it is sometimes very frustrating in its limitations.
