XtraGrid Cell Grouping

I am using XtraGrid in my app. I want to group some cells togethere and replace them with group name. Following is the description. I above image I have selected few cells from First columns. Now, from context menu when I will click on "Group", I will popup up a dialog for group name. Now here onwards the problem is. I want to replace the cell containts logically with the group name. So in grid, for first column's selected cells, but while viweing it should appear as single cell. I have tried the cell merging feature of the xtragrid but that disbales the row selection feature. How to do this? The grid shown above is bounded grid, so if I tried to do grouping for lets say Integer type of column, then how can I replace the group name which is string in integer column? is this possible in grid? Can I add the unbounded column in bounded grid? Please help. Thanks, Omky
