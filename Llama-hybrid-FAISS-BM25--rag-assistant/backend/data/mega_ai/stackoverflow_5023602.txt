Facebook share link - can you customize the message body text?

I'm trying to create a link that will share a page on Facebook. So far I've got: href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php ?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F &t=CNN%26s+website" However, I'd really like to add some text that will go in the 'What's on your mind?' text box (especially as the t value gets overridden by the link's title). Does anyone know if this is possible?
