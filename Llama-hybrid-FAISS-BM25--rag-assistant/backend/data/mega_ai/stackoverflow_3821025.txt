Upgrading iOS SDK

I've XCode 3.2.3 with iOS SDK 4 installed in my iMac. I bought an iPhone 4 with OS version 4.0.2 and I would like to use that device for development. However the Organizer shows the message below when the device is connected. The version of iPhone OS on “iPhone 4G” does not match any of the versions of iPhone OS supported for development with this installation of the iPhone SDK. Please restore the device to a version of the OS listed below, or update to the latest version of the iPhone SDK. Currently my XCode supports Base SDK from 3.0 to 4.0.1. So if I download the latest XCode 3.2.4 with iOS SDk 4.1, will I still have Base SDK support from 3.0 ? Cheers Jugs
