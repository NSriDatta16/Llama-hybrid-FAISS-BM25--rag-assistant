To add to @Peter Flom's answer, it is worth defining the other terms that were used: Deductive reasoning: Derive conclusions or predictions about specific cases from fundamental rules or theories. Inductive reasoning: Derive universal rules or theories from observation of many cases. Inferential statistics use both inductive and deductive reasoning. You are trying to establish rules about the behaviour of a system based on evidence, but you are testing models against probability theories derived deductively (i.e., probability distributions in parametric models or the combinatorics that are the basis of non-parametric models). Descriptive statistics don't really qualify as "reasoning" in my book. Saying the average of something is x and the standard deviation is s isn't any more of an argument than saying the colour of something is blue. You're describing what you have in front of you, not drawing any conclusions beyond it.
