yes absolutely I been using sharepoint for Intranet for last the 3 years and iw ould say is a very powerful product for Intranet maintainance .. as far the usability goes.. our end users really love it compared to the old model of file share docu share acces rights... etc... I highly recommend you to go with the sharepoint plan... for both Intranet and Internet About using 2010 I have attended some webinars and read about the 2010.. iw ould say microsoft really opened up the sharepoint customization with 2010... There were some issues on both administration and development with 2007 but as far as my inital review went with 2010 Microsoft has really improved a lot and made Sharepoint very powerful and easy to use product... there are lot of third party sharepoint products based companies (Ex. Avepoint) that are organizing events and webinars and explaining the most enhancements for 2010 and how one can use SP2010 to get the most of out. try to check out them for more understanding of what you need to implement .. how you can you for your company etc..etc...
