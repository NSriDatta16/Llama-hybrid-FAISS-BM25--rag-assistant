Using gSoap in Qt/Windows

I followed the steps on gSoap's page and tried to run the example code in Qt/Windows with Mingw32 Compiler. However, I can't add lgsoap++ to linker, as stated in the documentation, since it is not in the source package To complete the build, compile and link the generated soapC.cpp, soapcalcProxy.cpp, and the run-time gSOAP engine -lgsoap++ (or use source stdsoap2.cpp in case libgsoap++.a is not installed) with your code. Then I tried adding stdsoap2.cpp to SOURCES and this is the compile output as a result. So my question is how I will run this example code snippet in Qt with Mingw32 compiler or how I will generate that lgsoap++. Followings are my pro and source files: QT -= gui TARGET = SoapCalc CONFIG += console CONFIG -= app_bundle TEMPLATE = app SOURCES += main.cpp \ ../Console/gsoap/stdsoap2.cpp OTHER_FILES += ../../../../../gsoap/gsoap-2.7/gsoap/calc.nsmap HEADERS += ../../../../../gsoap/gsoap-2.7/gsoap/soapcalcProxy.h #include"C:/gsoap/gsoap-2.7/gsoap/soapcalcProxy.h" #include"C:/gsoap/gsoap-2.7/gsoap/calc.nsmap" int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { calcProxy service; return 0; }
