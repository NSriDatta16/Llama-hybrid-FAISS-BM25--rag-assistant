[Edit - I expanded this a little more at http://www.acooke.org/cute/AutoScalin0.html ] A naive extension of the "nice numbers" algorithm seems to work for base 12 and 60, which gives good intervals for hours and minutes. This is code I just hacked together: LIM10 = (10, [(1.5, 1), (3, 2), (7, 5)], [1, 2, 5]) LIM12 = (12, [(1.5, 1), (3, 2), (8, 6)], [1, 2, 6]) LIM60 = (60, [(1.5, 1), (20, 15), (40, 30)], [1, 15, 40]) def heckbert_d(lo, hi, ntick=5, limits=None): ''' Heckbert's "nice numbers" algorithm for graph ranges, from "Graphics Gems". ''' if limits is None: limits = LIM10 (base, rfs, fs) = limits def nicenum(x, round): step = base ** floor(log(x)/log(base)) f = float(x) / step nf = base if round: for (a, b) in rfs: if f So, for example, if you want to display seconds from 0 to 60, >>> heckbert(0, 60, limits=LIM60) ['0', '15', '30', '45', '60'] or hours from 0 to 5: >>> heckbert(0, 5, limits=LIM12) ['0', '2', '4', '6']
