Use Deep learning or RL to maximize long term hit in caching file?

Suppose I have F video files with different file size and with different popularity . I have a memory cache of fixed size. What I have to do is following: I want to cache n files (n Note:- total memory cache is of fixed size. For this problem I have to learn some function which can predict the user's interest so that model can cache right files. But which machine learning technique should I use? Should I go with Deep Learning or Reinforcement Learning? Please suggest any useful research paper or study materials. Please note I have to use the user's browsing history to find his/her interest.
