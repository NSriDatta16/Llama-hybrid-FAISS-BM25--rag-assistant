I'm not totally sure to understand but it looks like you misunderstanding the difference between Authorization and Authentication. Zend_Auth is about Authentication, therefore you should not use Zend_Auth to process Authorization but Zend_Acl. However, if what you want is to store an additional information from the Authentication process (ie Database Authentication) you can use the getResultRowObject($returnColumns, $ommitColumns); method. There are several implementation to get the "Row Object" depending on your current Adapter. Zend_Auth_Storage_Interface is about storing the result, I don't think you'll need to do such implementation since it's about storing the identity object in session or in a database for example. What you may want is to use Zend_Acl and construct an Access Control List which defines generically a Role ( can be an user ), a Resource ( your version-ed application ), a Privilege ( can use or not ) Note: *Most people have difficulties to use Zend_Acl because they think in Module/Controller/Action, but it is just one way to define resource. A resource can be whatever you want, a entire application, a controller action, a view, another user, a database connection, etc.*
