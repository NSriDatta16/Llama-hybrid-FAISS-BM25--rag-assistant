Show file tree in visual studio 2005?

I have a large project that I want to start using visual studio 2005 to edit. I want to tell it "Here are all the files I want you to track, now get on with it" and have them displayed as a directory tree, for example: Folder 1 - File A - File B - File C Folder 2 - Folder 3 - File X - File Y - File D - File E Right now it's just showing all the header files in one big list, and all the source files in one big list, which I find unhelpful. I also don't want to spend ages creating a folder in the project for each folder on the disk. Is there any way I can get VS to show me a source tree of everything in the solution, organised by where it is on the actual disk? Thanks.
