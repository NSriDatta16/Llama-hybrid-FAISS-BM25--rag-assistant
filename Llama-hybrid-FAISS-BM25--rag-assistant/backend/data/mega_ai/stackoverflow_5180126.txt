First you should strip certain tags which are inline formatting elemnts like: I strongly agree. But you sbhould leave in block-level elements, like DIV and P because there are even stronger delimiters than . ? and ! Then you have to process the content in these block level elements. Typically there are navigation links with one word, you might want to filter them out later, so it is not the right choice to strip away the block structure of the document. At this point you can safely use the regex pattern to identify blocks: >([^ When you have your blocks you can filter out the short ones (navigation elemnts) and strip the big ones (paragraphs of text) using your sentence delimiter. There are interesting questions when a fullstop character signals an end of the sentenct and when is it just a decimal point, but I leave that to you. :)
