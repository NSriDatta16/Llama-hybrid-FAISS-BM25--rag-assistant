How to implement a "selective" clipToBounds for a UIView, i.e. clip some subviews but not others

I want to clip some of a view's subviews to the bounds of the view and not others. Any ideas as to how to set about implementing this quickly and easily. For context: I have a UIScrollView with a set of subviews that can be dragged off the view. When dragging them off the view, I want the subview NOT TO BE CLIPPED. Otherwise I do want them clipped. If I perform [view setClipToBounds: YES] before laying out the subviews all is well until I come to drag the subview off. And if, when dragging begins, I perform [view setClipToBounds: NO] at touchesBegan:withEvent and [view setClipToBounds: YES] at touchesEnded:withEvent:, then the scrollview redraws during the drag, so the previously clipped subviews appear. One approach I have tried, but not got to work, is moving the subview from the scrollview to the scrollview's superview as soon as dragging begins (in the subview's touchesBegan:withEvent). However, when the view is moved from one view to another, it appears to lose track of touches and dragging is ends.
