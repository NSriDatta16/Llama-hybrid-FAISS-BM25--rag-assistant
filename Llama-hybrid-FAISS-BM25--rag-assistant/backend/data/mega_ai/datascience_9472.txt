Which text clustering algorithms should I use to group free text fields in Python?

I have a data set in which users have input free text (think "APPLE", "Apple", "apple", "appl") and I'm trying to group the input by response type (e.g. organize all of the preceding examples by "Apple"). What's the best way to do this in Python?
