Bottom line...focus on your goals and even more importantly the goals of others...help to meet those needs. Never start with just technology. I'd recommend against creating your own Operating System. (My own geeky interruption...Look into Cloud Computing and Amazon EC2 ) I totally agree that it would first help by defining what your goals are. I am a big fan of User Experiences and thinking of not only your own goals but the goals of your audience/users/others. Once you have those goals, then move to the next step of how to meet it. Now days what is an Operation System any way? kernal, Operating System, Virtual Server Instance, Linux, Windows Server, Windows Home, Ubuntu, AIX, zSeries OS/390, et al. I guess this is a good definition of OS... Wikipedia I like Sun's slogan "the Network is the computer" also...but their company has really fallen in the past decade. On that note of the Network is the computer... again, I highly recommend, checking out Amazon EC2 and more generally cloud computing .
