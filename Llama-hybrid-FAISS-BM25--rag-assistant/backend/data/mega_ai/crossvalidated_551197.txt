More typically outliers are defined as near or mild outliers and far or extreme outliers. From nist Engineering statistics handbook 7.1.6. What are outliers in the data? "Box plots with fences A box plot is constructed by drawing a box between the upper and lower quartiles with a solid line drawn across the box to locate the median. The following quantities (called fences) are needed for identifying extreme values in the tails of the distribution: lower inner fence: Q1 - 1.5*IQ upper inner fence: Q3 + 1.5*IQ lower outer fence: Q1 - 3*IQ upper outer fence: Q3 + 3*IQ Outlier detection criteria A point beyond an inner fence on either side is considered a mild outlier. A point beyond an outer fence is considered an extreme outlier." Now as to what this means and why it does, consider the following. First, we do not know what type of distribution, e.g., skewed normal, log-normal, etc. we have in our data. Consequently, standard deviation and other normal associated distance measurements are not as good a yardstick to use as general rules as quantiles, which are more non-parametric. Thus, it is a more general rule to use quantiles as above, to classify outliers. Now, as a general fule of thumb, one can expect near, mild outliers and such should be noted as an indication of possible non-normality. Far outliers I consider worthy of further investigation. For example, they may occur in very heavy tailed distributions, like the Cauchy distribution, in which case those far outliers may be a typical occurrence, or they may be due to a measurement system problem in which case they would be true outliers. I would not eliminate any outliers unless they are highly suspicious for being due to measurement system problems. For example, if extreme outliers are a result of the measurement system itself, I would model the system according to the needs of the measurement system, and not discard anything without good motivation. For example, for Cauchy distributed rv's one can use 25% truncated mean values , which are better than the median for determining the Cauchy peak value, but that is not the same thing as discarding outliers, per se . Now this answer is not a direct answer to the questions posed, because I wouldn't do either of the choices offered. Also see Handling outliers in ANOVA , Boxplot Outliers and Simple algorithm for online outlier detection of a generic time series among others. Also see footnote 13 of Comparison of the gamma-Pareto convolution with conventional methods of characterising metformin pharmacokinetics in dogs As well as the treatment of outliers generated during bootstrap in that publication's Appendix Subsection entitled "Parameter errors from model-based bootstrap," which although not perfect explains a lot.
