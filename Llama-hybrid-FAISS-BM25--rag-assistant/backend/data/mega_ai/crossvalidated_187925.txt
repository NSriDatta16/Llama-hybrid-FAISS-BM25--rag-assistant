Law of Iterated Expectations in Practice

I was wondering if the the following is an example of the law of iterated expectations. Say we observe the entire population of the random variable $X$. Call the mean of the population $\mu$ . Now, let us arbitrarily resample a fraction of this population n times. For each of these samples, obtain an unbiased estimate of the mean as $\hat{\mu_{i}}$ where i denotes the sample. Now, we can obtain the average of these sample averages as:$$\tilde{\mu}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}\hat{\mu_{i}}$$ Given that our estimator is unbiased, it should be that $\tilde{\mu}$ is extremely close to $\mu$ . Now, can this also be thought of as the Law of Iterated Expectations where $$E[X]=E[E[X|i]]$$
