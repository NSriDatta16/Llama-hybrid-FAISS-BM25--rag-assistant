Is the R2 statistic affected by normalizing your timeseries?

I have been trying on comparing to time series, one predicted and one measured. One of the first and most simplistic statistics that can help is R2. I have no issues calculating R2 but my supervisor suggested to first normalize both time series such that the daily trend is removed and then calculate the R2. I am wondering whether normalising the time series will affect the R2. Note: with normalising, I mean that I have a third time series that I use to devide the other two time series with. So in a more abstract way. I started with time series t1 and t2, than I decided both timeseries by time series t3 giving time series t4 (=t1/t3) and t5 (=t2/t3). Now my question is: Is the R2 of t1 and t2 the same as the R2 of t4 and t5?
