How to stream data and resources from a website

This is very naive... but how do you stream certain bits of information from a website. From what I understand webview launches a web page, but what if I want to only stream a paragraph that was published on a site. Example: Yahoo! Fantasy Football... Updates on players and the news feed about them. This is obviously a lot more complicated than my question. I would be interested in a tutorial that could walk me through this. Does this also take programming on the server side to send this out? Thank you in advance.
