Have you checked what the output of Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() is, because if it does not contain a trailing file seperator (/) then your image will end up in a directory that does not reside on the SDcard such as: /mnt/sdcardmake_machine_example.jpg When what you really want is: /mnt/sdcard/make_machine_example.jpg Try this code instead: _path = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + File.separator + "make_machine_example.jpg";
