QNetworkRequest (HTTP GET) doesn't fire, after refactoring into a standalone class

I've recently began the tedious process of modularising a large, monolithic audio player application that I wrote roughly 2 months ago. This process is going reasonably well, although it appears that one of the methods (ScrobbleMedia - which predictably enough makes HTTP requests to submit information about a playing track to last.fm) no longer seems to make network requests. However, the QUrl object that would be passed through to the QNetworkAccessManager instance/QNetworkRequest is being built correctly. For comparison, a functional Mercurial revision of the code is available on BitBucket . The ScrobbleMedia method currently looks like this, after refactoring: #include "scrobblemedia.h" #include #include ScrobbleMedia::ScrobbleMedia(QString asUsername, QString asPassword, QString asArtist, QString asTrack, QString asAlbum) { QString KEndPointURL = "http://lastfmstats.livefrombmore.com/universalscrobbler/scrobble.php"; QUrl iScrobbleEndPoint(KEndPointURL); QNetworkAccessManager *iScrobbleDispatcher = new QNetworkAccessManager(this); iScrobbleEndPoint.addQueryItem("submissionType","track"); iScrobbleEndPoint.addQueryItem("username", asUsername); iScrobbleEndPoint.addQueryItem("password", asPassword); iScrobbleEndPoint.addQueryItem("artist", asArtist); iScrobbleEndPoint.addQueryItem("track", asTrack); iScrobbleEndPoint.addQueryItem("album", asAlbum); iScrobbleEndPoint.addQueryItem("number","1"); iScrobbleEndPoint.addQueryItem("duration","200"); iScrobbleDispatcher->get(QNetworkRequest(iScrobbleEndPoint)); connect(iScrobbleDispatcher, SIGNAL(finished(QNetworkReply*)), SLOT(replyFinished(QNetworkReply*))); // QString Outside = iScrobbleEndPoint.toEncoded(); qDebug() The associated header file looks like: #ifndef SCROBBLEMEDIA_H #define SCROBBLEMEDIA_H #include #include #include #include class ScrobbleMedia : public QObject { Q_OBJECT; private: public: ScrobbleMedia(QString asUsername, QString asPassword, QString asArtist, QString asTrack, QString asAlbum); ~ScrobbleMedia(); }; #endif // SCROBBLEMEDIA_H I'm currently building the application itself against a MinGW build of version 4.7.0 of the Qt libraries (included as part of Qt SDK 2010.05) under Windows 7 x86-64. Any assistance would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
