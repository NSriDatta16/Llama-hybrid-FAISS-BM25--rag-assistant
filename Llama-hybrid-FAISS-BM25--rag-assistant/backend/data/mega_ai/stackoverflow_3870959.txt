@ Brian Flanagan (this reply was too long for a comment) I'm using IE8, but this solution should work for older IE versions as well. Shouldn't it to be fairly simple to organize 5 pictures on a screen? :-P I should also mention that I didn't copy and paste your solution "as is", since I didn't want my css to refer to general tags such as img and div , but the changes are meaningless in terms of logic. The actual code I used: HTML: â€‹ CSS: #imagesContainer {width:550px; overflow:hidden;} .articleImage {width:180px; float:left; display:inline; margin:15px;} .middle {margin:15px 90px;} any suggestions?
