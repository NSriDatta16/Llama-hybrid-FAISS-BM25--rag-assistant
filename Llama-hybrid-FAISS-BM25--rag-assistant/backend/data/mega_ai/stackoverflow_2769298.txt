In Magento, how can I preview a page before saving it?

I am using the Magento ver. 1.4.0.1 Community Edition. The problem I am running into is that Magento only allows me to preview pages that I have already saved. This works fine if I am creating a new page - but what if I am editing a current page? I want to be sure that the changes I make look good on the site before saving them. Does anyone know of a way to preview a static cms page before saving the changes made? I'm open to using some sort of plugin if anyone knows of one. Thanks
