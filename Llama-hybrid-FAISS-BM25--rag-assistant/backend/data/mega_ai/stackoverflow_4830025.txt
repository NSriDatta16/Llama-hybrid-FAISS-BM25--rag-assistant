Log all received data (headers, IP, etc.) to db for each aspx page request

We are building asp.net application in which we want to log the received data (IP, http headers, etc) to database for every page request. How to organize aps.net application, so that we are able to make a log to db even in case of exception? Is this a good idea? Should we write data to db in a new thread, so that it doesn't slow down the response?
