I don't know that the is an "elegant" solution to this very inelegant problem. Remus has good thoughts, also suggest you do some reading on replication. You had also better design a de-dup process because sure as anything, rep A is going to upt in customer A and rep b is going to put in customer A as well and because they came from differnt sources with differnt primary keys, they will be different records.
