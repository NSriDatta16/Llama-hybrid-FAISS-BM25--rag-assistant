This forum post http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sqlsecurity/thread/15e4a7c0-6547-44e8-9e25-4f14c12570ca implies that sqlcmd does not support empty passwords. The workaround is to use osql. However the documentation for sqlcmd here suggests you can use a blank password: "If the -U option is used and the -P option is not used, and the SQLCMDPASSWORD environment variable has not been set, sqlcmd prompts the user for a password. If the -P option is used at the end of the command prompt without a password sqlcmd uses the default password (NULL)." Hope one of those helps you!
