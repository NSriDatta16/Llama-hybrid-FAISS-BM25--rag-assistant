I found a paragraph which gave me an idea on how you could evaluate the difficulty. One class of approximation algorithms is based on the “greedy” method - the vertices are processed in order, with each vertex assigned to the lowest numbered color class that does not place it in conflict with its previously colored neighbors. Because the vertices adjacent to the current vertex might use all four colors, a fifth, or even sixth, seventh, etc. color may be necessary. When the greedy method needs to create a new color class the vertex is said to be at impasee. So the number of necessary color classes could be the difficulty of your puzzle. You could process the vertices e.g. from highest degree to lowest degree (ordering schema Largest First ) I found the cited paragraph in the paper A Fast Probabilistic Algorithm For Four-Coloring Large Planar Graphs by Raymond A. Archuleta and Henry D. Shapiro
