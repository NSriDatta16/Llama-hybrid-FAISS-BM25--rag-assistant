Understanding statistical control charts

Control charts are all the rage at my company these days. Our "data analysts" (quotes are on purpose) are putting control limits on almost all graphs that they produce. The other day we were looking at some graphs of calls into our support call center over the last year. We have measurements of the number of calls for each week that are plotted on a line graph. Recently, the analysts who prepare these graphs have started putting lines on the graphs indicating "control limits". The question I have is about how they are calculating where these control limits should be. When I asked how they determined the limits here is the answer I got: First we find a section of the graph where the points look somewhat stable (meaning small variance) then calculate the mean of those points. Then we calculate the standard error of those points and draw the control limits at +/- 3 standard errors from the mean that we calculated. Is it correct to calculate the mean this way? It seems like we should be using ALL the points to calculate the mean instead of throwing out anything that "looks" like it varies too much. Does it even make sense to put control limits on a measurement like this (the number of calls coming into a call center)? As long as the measurements are within the control limits we consider the week normal. If the measurement for a week's call volume is outside these control limits it is deemed significant and warrants further analysis. Something just seems artificial about all this to me.
