I think the Dashcode bit might be getting in the way. Dashcode sites and apps comprise of html/css/javascript so what you are actually doing is building a web site with these elements and what you need is some form of persistent storage for the "like" values. One way of doing this is to use a database. As we are talking about client side javascript then the solution there would be to use an ajax call to an sqlite or mysql database on the server. I say sqlite as it is a single file solution without the need for install. The storage will need to be done on the server to get the running total of "likes". See this link for some advice on javascript/sqlite/storage Hope this helps. Please comment if not or you need any more info.
