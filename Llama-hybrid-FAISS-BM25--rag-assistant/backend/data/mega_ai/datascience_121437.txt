Feature scales and feature importance

Tree-based algorithms do not require feature scaling before fitting, and I am working on gradient boosted tree models (and random forest) without scaling features. I'm curious if feature scaling affects the feature importance in a meaningful way? To be specific, When both X (explanatory) and Y are NOT scaled When X (explanatory) is scaled and Y are not scaled When both X and Y are scaled If it does affect, what is the reason for that?
