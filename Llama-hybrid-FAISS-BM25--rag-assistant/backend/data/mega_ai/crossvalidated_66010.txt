Level here is to be understood as mean. This is an approximation at best, but it does not depend on data being a time series, let alone economic data! For a fairly detailed discussion in a wider setting, see J.H. Curtiss. 1943. On transformations used in the analysis of variance. Annals of Mathematical Statistics 14: 107-122. Link A side-comment important to some kinds of statistics users is that standard deviation being proportional to mean clearly implies that their ratio is a constant. That ratio is the coefficient of variation, which is therefore a natural property for description in this circumstance.
