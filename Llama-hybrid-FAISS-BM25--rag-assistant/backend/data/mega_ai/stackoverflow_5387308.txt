Q1: EventTrigger and System.Windows.TriggerAction is discouraged. The link you give for "they appear to be so useful?" is for System.Windows.Interactivity.TriggerAction whose use is encouraged because it is supported in Blend SL projects and it can be used for more than just the Loaded event. Q2: You can databind an animation's To value, but I'd consider creating a custom templated control instead. This way you could define that changes to the IsSelected property change the control's VSM states.
