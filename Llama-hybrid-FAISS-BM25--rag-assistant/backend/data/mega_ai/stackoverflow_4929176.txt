Flex Advanced Data Grid w/ hierarchical data: How to access currentTarget fields on dragdrop event?

So this is driving me crazy. I've got an advanced data grid with a dataprovider that's an array collection w/ hierarchical data. Each object (including the children) has an id field. I'm trying to drag and drop data from within the ADG. When this happens, I need to grab the id off the drop target and change the dragged object's parentid field. Here's what I've got: public function topAccountsGrid_dragDropHandler(event:DragEvent):void{ //In this function, you need to make the move, update the field in salesforce, and refresh the salesforce data... if(checkActivateAccountManageMode.selected == true) { var dragObj:Array = event.dragSource.dataForFormat("treeDataGridItems") as Array; var newParentId:String = event.currentTarget['Id']; dragObj[0].ParentId = newParentId; } else { return; } app.wrapper.save(dragObj[0], new mx.rpc.Responder( function():void { refreshData(); }, function():void{_status = "apex error!";} ) ); } I can access the data I'm draggin (hence changing parentId) but not the currentTarget. I think the hierarchical data is part of the problem, but I can't find much in the documentation? Any thoughts?
