You are interested in the distribution of $D := \theta_{A} - \theta_{B} | W$ , where $\theta_{A}$ and $\theta_{B}$ are parameters from your model representing the posterior click-through rates under variants A and B, respectively. $W$ is meant to represent "the data", i.e. we are conditioning on all of our available information and are working with the posterior. To avoid Monte Carlo simulation, you have to derive the probability distribution of $D$ , which means you have to work with the joint posterior density $f_{\theta_{A}, \theta_{B} \ | {W}} \ (a, b)$ . The problem is that we don't often know what the joint density is. Deriving it in some cases is possible for specific distributions and under assumptions like independence between $\theta_{A}$ and $\theta_B$ , but in general, it's often easier to just use Monte Carlo simulation since in practice, you will have: realized samples from the joint posterior distribution via. MCMC, of which you can estimate any quantity you wish, OR an approximation to the true joint posterior distribution, of which you can simulate from/use that approximation directly if closed-form expressions exist for it Also: without sounding too pedantic, note that the idea of a "hypothesis test" is very much a frequentist and not a Bayesian way of thinking.
