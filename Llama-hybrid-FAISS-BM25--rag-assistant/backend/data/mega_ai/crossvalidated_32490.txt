I would say no for several reasons: 1. the individual scores are not independent because of sample reuse 2. the distribution is confined to [0,1] so it is truncated and not normal (could be approximately normal though if truncation is not too great) 3, Saying "some sort of hypothesis test" doesn't tell us what you want to do. How many methods are you comparing ? If it is more than 2 are you comparing them pairwise? If one method has a higher average score what does that tell you? Maybe a nonparametric ANOVA is really what you need.
