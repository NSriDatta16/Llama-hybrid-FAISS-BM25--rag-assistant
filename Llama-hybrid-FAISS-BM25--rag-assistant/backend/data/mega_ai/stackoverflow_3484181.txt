python reorganize codes

Sorry I dont know how to add a comment with the format, so I post another question with code here, as I am new to python, seems that there are many better ways to reorgnize the codes to make it better: def min_qvalue(self): s = 0 q = 1 for i in range(len(self.results)): if self.results[i].score > s: s = self.results[i].score q = self.results[i].qvalue return q For the above code, should not be the best piece, any improvements possible? thanks :)
