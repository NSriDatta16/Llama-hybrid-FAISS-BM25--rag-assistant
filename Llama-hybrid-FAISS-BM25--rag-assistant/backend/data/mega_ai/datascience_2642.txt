Machine Learning & Partial Differential Equations

Are there any algorithms which were developed using partial differential equations for tackling some of the machine learning problems? Most works I see online are in the field of computer vision and a few bizarre ones in topic modelling. But just curious if someone has used or seen it being used for some decision making process or classification problems?
