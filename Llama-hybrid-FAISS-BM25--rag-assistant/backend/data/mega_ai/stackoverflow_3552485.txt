Substituting one node for another

I'm using docx4j, which uses JAXB. I want to change a Text node to be a Paragraph node (or delete/add in the same place). This may be more of a JAXB question .. I'm not familiar with it. I can find the relevant Text node using MainDocumentPart.getJAXBNodesViaXpath() Looking at samples, I can see how to create a new paragraph node. However, from there, I'm lost. Not sure how to delete the Text node that I find, and how to insert a new paragraph node at that position (or -- if it's better -- how to "change" the Text node into a Paragraph node).
