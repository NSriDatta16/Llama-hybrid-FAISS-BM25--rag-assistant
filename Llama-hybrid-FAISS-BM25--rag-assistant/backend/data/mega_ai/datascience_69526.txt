Classification task: Predict (guess, estimate) a class (a nominal variable) based on some predictor variables, which can be of any type. Example: Based on the videos a user has watched over a video streaming platform, predict whether this user is a male or female. Regression task: Predict (guess, estimate) a continuous value (a numerical variable) based on some predictor variables, which can be of any type. Example: Based on the videos a user has watched over a video streaming platform, predict the user's age. Now, there is a gray area: There are algorithms which predict probability , which is a continuous value, between 0 and 1. By the above definition, you can consider them regression algorithms (think of logistic regression ). At the same time, this probability refers to classes , so they can be used for classification (just set a threshold for probability: everything with probability 0.5 into the other). How you "classify" these algorithms is a philosophical question, of little practical importance.
