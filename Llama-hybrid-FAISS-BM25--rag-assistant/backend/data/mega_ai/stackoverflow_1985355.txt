.Net RTF(or)HTML to Image

In .Net (C#) server process, i want to generate image with lot of rich text (with paragraphs, font style, etc.. ). The richtext can be described using RTF or HTML. Is there any way to convert RTF/HTML to a image ? Since it is a server process, i want to avoid windows forms controls.
