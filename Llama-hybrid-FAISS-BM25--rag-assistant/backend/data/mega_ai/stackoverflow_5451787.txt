Attach draggable div to another div

I'm trying to use jQuery UI draggable / droppable plugins. I have draggable div that I drag onto target div . Target div is also draggable. I can't seem to be able to figure out a way to attached div s to their target to move them together when I drag target div . Any pointers in the right direction would be highly appreciated.
