Have your team lead read this paper (pdf), (which you can find neatly digested in this blog post ), and see if he changes his mind. Now, one study doesn't prove anything, but there is one very intriguing take-away paragraph: We found that test-first students on average wrote more tests and, in turn, students who wrote more tests tended to be more productive. We also observed that the minimum quality increased linearly with the number of programmer tests, independent of the development strategy employed. In other words, better tests, better code. Period. (This squares with my experience, and the experience of countless other developers I've worked with.) If you can't get this guy to change his mind, then look for work elsewhere -- you've ended up on one of those loser teams where those in charge are impervious to learning something new. Not good. EDIT: there are dozens of studies showing the effectiveness of TDD. Try here and here for more.
