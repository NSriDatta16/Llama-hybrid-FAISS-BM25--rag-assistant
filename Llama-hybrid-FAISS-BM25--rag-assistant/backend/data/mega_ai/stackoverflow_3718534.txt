The max size of an SNMP PDU is 64k (i.e. the max size of a UDP datagram). Some implementations may have smaller limits. Some networks will not pass large datagrams cleanly (they may get fragmented and not reliably reassembled). You don't want to transfer a file through SNMP. Use a more suitable protocol: TFTP, FTP, HTTP, SCP all come to mind, depending on the needs of your application.
