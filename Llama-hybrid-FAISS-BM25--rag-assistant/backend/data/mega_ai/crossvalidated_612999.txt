How can I interpret the below GJR-GARCH model in terms of "leverage effects"?

I'm very new here and am struggling to interpret the model. Please help me in layman's terms.

Int. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ nu 5.2877 0.574 9.215 3.121e-20 [ 4.163, 6.412] ======================================================================== I read so many articles or paper over the internet and I concluded below. But not sure if I'm right. Here, the p-value for gamma[1] is 0.172(which is greater than 0.05), hence gamma[1] is not statistically significant, and we cannot conclude that there is a significant leverage effect. However, the p-value for gamma[2] is less than 0.05, indicating that gamma[2] is statistically significant. Therefore, we can conclude that the model has captured significant leverage effects. Also, I want to write a generic code that includes all the scenarios like, What if the gamma[1] is +ve and gamma[2] is -ve. What if we have n the number of gammas in the model, in that case can I follow the same approach? If we have n number of gammas, and they are in a combination of +ve and -ve, how we can conclude then?
