If the clicking sound produced by the computer disturbs you or others in the office, disable the sound in Windows and enjoy a quieter and more productive computing experience. Click “Start,” then “Control Panel.” In the “Adjust your computer’s settings” window, click “Hardware and Sound.” Click “Change System Sounds” underneath the Sound link in the "Hardware and Sound" window to open the Sounds window. Click the “Sounds” tab. Scroll down to and select the “Start Navigation” option in the Windows Explorer section of the Program Events list box. Click the drop-down list labeled “Windows Navigation Start” and select “None.” Click “Apply,” then the “OK” button. Close the "Hardware and Sound" window.
