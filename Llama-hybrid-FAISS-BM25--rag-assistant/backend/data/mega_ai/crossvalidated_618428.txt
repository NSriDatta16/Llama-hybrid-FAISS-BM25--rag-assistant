Rank-Ordered Logit models for partial rankings with time as covariate

I'm working on a problem which requires a ROL model, the problem is R does not have much support for these in terms of packages and documentation. I want to fit a ROL model to partial rankings with time as a covariate. I've tried the PlackettLuce package (only works with subset rankings), the PLMIX package (has partial rankings, but no covariate functionality), and the ROlogit package (unclear documentation). Does someone here have experience fitting partial rankings ROL models with covariates? Specifically, in having them run in R. EDIT: Adding information on the data as per @awhug's request. The data is a set of rankings of players over time. The rankings are partial (top n), so that not every player is ranked. There are no ties. Moreover, the rankings are over time, and we are looking to see what the final rankings are at time t. A rough way to do this is to attribute weights to the rankings based on their distance in time to the final ranking date, but I think there is a more elegant solution, perhaps with coxph() as suggested by @awhug. Here's an example of the set below, where we have 15 players ranked over a season. The ultimate goal is to create probability distributions for each player's ranking. tibble( player_ranking = 1:10, ranking_1 = sample(1:15, 10), ranking_2 = c(sample(1:15, 5), rep(0, 5)), ranking_3 = c(sample(1:15, 7), rep(0, 3)), ranking_4 = sample(1:15, 10), ranking_5 = c(sample(1:15, 3), rep(0, 7))) %>% pivot_longer(ranking_1:ranking_5) %>% pivot_wider(id_cols = name, names_from = player_ranking, values_from = value) %>% mutate(date_of_ranking = c('2022-07-01', '2022-10-10', '2023-01-01', '2023-05-05', '2023-06-01'))
