Apache: mod_rewrite: Spcaes & Special Characters in URL not working

i am using APACHE:mod_rewrite to define a set of rules for rewritting URLS i want this link to be displayed as /myDIR/walls.php?f=All&of=0&s=Newest -> All.html so i am using the following rule text from (.htaccess) RewriteEngine on RewriteBase /myDIR/ RewriteRule ^All\.html$ papers.php?f=All&of=0&s=Newest now these variables that are being passed as f=All of=0 s=Newest these are being used in query, OBVIOUSLY, and one of these variables, i.e f sometimes has values with spaces and special characters, and i can't avoid that because the database is already in-place and all i am doing rewrite of URLs.... NOW when i try to define a rule like this i want this link to be displayed as /myDIR/walls.php?f=Characters & Supers&of=0&s=Newest -> Characters & Supers.html which is wrong i know because there shouldn't be any spaces.. so to make it right i define the rule like this RewriteRule ^Characters%20%26%20Supers\.html$ papers.php?f=Characters%20%26%20Supers&of=0&s=Newest it lets me define the rule but when i click my link i get this 404 Not Found Error "The requested URL /wallz/Characters & Supers.html was not found on this server." QUESTION: WHAT To Do ? my guess is i am not supposed to be doing HTML URL Encoding inside .htaccess
