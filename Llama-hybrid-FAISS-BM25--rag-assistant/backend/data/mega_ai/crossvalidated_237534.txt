It is possible to use RBMs to deal with typical problems that arise in data collection (that could be used for example to train a machine learning model). Such problems include imbalanced data sets (in a classification problem), or datasets with missing values (the values of some features are unknown). In the first case it is possible to train an RBM with data from the minority class and use it to generate examples for this class while in the second case it is possible to train a RBM separately for each class and uncover unknown feature values. Another typical application of RBMs is collaborative filtering ( http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1273596 ). As far as popular libraries are concerned I think deeplearning4j is a good example ( http://deeplearning4j.org ).
