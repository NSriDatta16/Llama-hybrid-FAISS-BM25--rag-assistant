How we can add new data in training time of neural network without stopping it in MATLAB?

I have a binary classification problem. Now I'm using patternnet in MATLAB R2014b to design a neural network for this problem. We have a system that data-set is increasing in time (for example every hour we have new 100 samples in this data set). How we can add this new data-set to training process? I read somewhere some structures of neural network have this ability to do this in real use of neural network. Adding new data in time with shorter training time. How can I do this?
