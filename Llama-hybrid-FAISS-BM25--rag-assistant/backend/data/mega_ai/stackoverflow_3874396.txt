Depends on the data and usage patterns. Generally unserialize() is faster than json_decode(), which is faster than include(). However with large data amounts, the bottleneck is actually the disk. So unserialize(gzdecode(file_get_contents())) is often the fastest. The difference in decoding speed might be neglectible in comparison to reading it from disk. If you don't really need to read out the complete data set for printing or calculation, then the fastest storage might be SQLite however. It often keeps indexes in memory.
