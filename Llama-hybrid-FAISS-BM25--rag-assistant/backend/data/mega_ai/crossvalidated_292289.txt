How can I classify my text by using unsupervised approaches?

I have a corpus of newspaper articles and would like to classify them according to content (words, phrases) that I determine beforehand. The only way to do this that I found so far is by looking at how often my terms appear and then classify into a, b or neither of them. But there must be more sophisticated techniques looking at neighbourhoods, correlations, relative frequencies etc. But I only find these in the context of Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN etc. which require a training set (I'll do that in a later step as well but here I am really interested in explicitly determining classification requirements beforehand). Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you very much in advance.
