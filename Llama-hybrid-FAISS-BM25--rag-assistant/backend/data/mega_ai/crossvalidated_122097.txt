SVMs are able to deal with datasets with imbalanced class frequencies. Many implementations allow you to have a different value for the slack penalty (C) for positive and negative classes (which is asymptotically equivalent to changing the class frequencies). I would recommend setting the values of these parameters in order maximize generalization performance on a test set where the class frequencies are those you expect to see in operational use. I was one of many people who wrote papers on this, here is mine , I'll see if I can find something more recent/better. Try Veropoulos, Campbell and Cristianini (1999).
