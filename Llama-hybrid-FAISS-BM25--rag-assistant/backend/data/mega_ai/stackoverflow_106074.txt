@JustMike . . . A FEW C EXAMPLES: . . . to accompany the Java ones. NON-NESTED loop: . . . limiting scope where possible /*LOOP_DESCRIPTION*/ { int i; for (i = 0; i NESTED loop: . . . ditto /*LOOP_DESCRIPTION*/ { int row, column; for (row = 0; row One good thing about this layout is it reads badly without comments, thereby encouraging them. It's verbose perhaps, but personally this is how I do loops in C. Also: I did use "index" and "idx" when I started, but this usually got changed to "i" by my peers.
