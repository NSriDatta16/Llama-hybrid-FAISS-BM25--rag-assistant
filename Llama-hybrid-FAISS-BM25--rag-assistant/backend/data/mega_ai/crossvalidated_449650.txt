Whatâ€™s the difference between online machine learning and software that updates the model automatically and reestimates when new data are entered?

Is online machine learning basically a software that updates the model automatically every time the data changes? So instead of having to run the same line of code again by a person and again by manually clicking or edit the model as data comes in, it just model selects and recalculated the coefficients automatically?
