The HTML spec allows you to omit certain end tags. In general these are tags that cannot self-nest and therefore the closing tag is never ambiguous. Take this example: A paragraph of text. Another paragraph of text. A divider element... Another divider element... In the first example, when you get to the second , this means the previous paragraph has finished, because you cannot nest paragraph tags. The browser interprets that as: A paragraph of text. Another paragraph of text. In the second example, however the second creates a nested div element, and the closes the inner element. You would need to add another wherever you wanted the outer one to finish. However, having said all this, it will probably be easier to close all tags as you go to avoid any problems. It depends how well you will remember the whitelist. If you forget, for example that div s must always be closed, you will mess up your layout no end. And as bobince said, with gzip it's kind of irrelevant. If you have 30 paragraphs, the difference between the versions with and without closing tags would be 120 bytes. However, if both are gzipped, the difference is going to be tiny - less than 10 bytes. I suggest writing HTML however you are comfortable.
