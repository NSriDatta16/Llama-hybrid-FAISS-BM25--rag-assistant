How to create a logistic regression model based on a two way table

question Given a table such as : $$ \begin{array}{ll|ll} & A & {} \\ & & 0 & 1 \\ \hline B& 1 & 44 & 27 \\ &0 & 443 & 95 \end{array} $$ If I wanted to develop a logistic regression model that included $A$ only, how would I go about that. following Maarten Buis example Following this but predicting $A$ instead of $B$ $$ \ln( \text{Odds}(A=1 \vert B)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 B $$ Then $\beta_0$ is found from the log odds of $A$ being 1 when $B=0$ , which is $\ln( 95/443) = -1.54$ . So the odds of $A$ given $B=0$ are $95/443$ . Then for $\beta_1$ we have the log odds of $A$ when $B=1$ which is $\ln( 27 / 44 ) = -0.49$ . Meaning that for a unit increase in $B$ the odds change by $(27/44)\div(95/443) \approx 2.9$ . About three times larger if we predict $A$ from $B$ , which matches the change in predicting $B$ from $A$ .
