You can measure the frequency of the data - if there are a lot of big changes from item to item, then the data is high frequency, indicating a pretty random distribution. If the changes are smaller, then the data is low frequency - indicating a non-random distribution. You can also measure the general trend using a filter - is the average trend measurably downwards or upwards - if downwards you might consider flipping the whole array or using a sort good for 'reversed' data. There are other measurements you can use the might give yo insight - check out signal processing and see what you can glean. -Adam
