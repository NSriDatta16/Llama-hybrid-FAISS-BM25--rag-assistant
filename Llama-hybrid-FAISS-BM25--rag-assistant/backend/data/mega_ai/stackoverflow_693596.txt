Elegant examples of xslt?

After a long learning loop via XAML, I've returned to HTML and javascript, and realised that the concept of declarative code - in terms of rules for transformation - is an incredibly powerful concept. Despite its surfeit of syntax, XSLT processing of XML is the keystone of declarative transformation programming. I have, however, always found it hard to understand how XSLT would be used for everyday tasks (with XML). What are some good examples of XSLT elegantly solving a programming problem, outside of generating HTML? I'm guessing it's good at graph transformation and data reprocessing... Edit: I'm hoping for some actual examples - one of the things that puts me off full-on xslt is the visual complexity of the code.
