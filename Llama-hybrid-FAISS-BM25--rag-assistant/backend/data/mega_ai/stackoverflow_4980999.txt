Subfolders in script folder

I have a ton of scripts in my script folder want to organize the scripts in subfolders. For example, I moved user_prune script to bg_jobs subfolder. When I try to run the script... script/bg_jobs/user_prune ...from the console I get this error: script/bg_jobs/user_prune:2:in `require': no such file to load -- script/bg_jobs/../config/environment (LoadError) from script/bg_jobs/user_prune:2:in ` ' Why am I getting this error? And what do I have to do to run scripts in subfolders?
