To close this one: "Expected profit" is most probably understood as "the expected value of the random variable profit". There are three "states of the world", each with its profit and probability of occurring: \begin{array}{| r | r | r | r|} \hline \text{State of the world} &\text{Profit} & \text {Prob} \\ \hline \hline X 8 & -C_2 & 1-\Phi(8-\mu) \\ \hline \end{array} The middle column describes the support of the discrete random variable "profit" ($\equiv \pi$), and the last column is its probability mass function. $\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal, and it determines here how probability mass is allocated to the three values in the support of $\pi$. So the expected value of $\pi$ is $$E(\pi) = -C_1\cdot \Phi(6-\mu) + C_0 \cdot [\Phi(8-\mu)-\Phi(6-\mu)]-C_2\cdot [1-\Phi(8-\mu)]$$ Collecting terms, $$E(\pi) = -\Phi(6-\mu)\cdot (C_0 + C_1) + \Phi(8-\mu) \cdot [C_0 +C_2] -C_2$$ To get the maximum with respect to $\mu$ we differentiate $$\frac {\partial E(\pi)}{\partial \mu} = \phi(6-\mu)\cdot [C_0 + C_1] - \phi(8-\mu)\cdot [C_0 + C_2]$$ where $\phi$ is the probability density function of the standard normal. Setting this equal to zero we have $$\frac {\partial E(\pi)}{\partial \mu} = 0 \implies \frac {\phi(6-\mu)}{\phi(8-\mu)} = \frac {C_0 + C_2}{C_0 + C_1}$$ Calculating the left-hand side and taking natural logarithms, we end up with $$\mu* = 7 - \frac 12 \cdot \ln\left(\frac {C_0 + C_2}{C_0 + C_1}\right)$$ One should also verify that the second-order derivative is negative so that the sufficient condition for a maximum holds here (it does). We can gain some intuition from the result, observing that if the losses are symmetric ($C_1 = C_2$), the logarithm term will be zero and the optimal mean will be $\mu^* = 7$, i.e. at the center of the "within specs" interval. But if they are not, the optimal mean is "pushed away from the comparatively worse deviation from specs": for example, if $C_2 > C_1$, meaning that the loss if we are "above specs" is worse than when we are "below specs", we will have $\ln\left(\frac {C_0 + C_2}{C_0 + C_1}\right) >0$ and so the optimal mean will be $\mu^* In fact they play a role so large, that we may even end up having an optimal mean outside the within specs interval . For this to happen we want, for example, $$\mu^* 1 \implies \frac {C_0 + C_2}{C_0 + C_1} > e^2$$ $$\implies C_2 > C_0\cdot (e^2-1) + C_1\cdot e^2$$ This reflects that the loss if we are above specs is comparatively too big, so big in fact that we prefer to be "on average" below specs! Counter-intuitive it may be, but it is what the criterion we chose (maximization of expected profit), dictates that we should do.
