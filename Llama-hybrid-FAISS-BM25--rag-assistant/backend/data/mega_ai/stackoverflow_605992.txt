There is no standard Access Point Selection APi in J2ME. That means the MIDlet itself can't decide whether to use Wi-Fi or GPRS. Some phones will allow the user to change application settings in order to force a MIDlet to use a specific network when it is available (and maybe prompt the user for an alternative when the preferred network is not available). This is mostly because there is no standard way to describe a wireless network that contains enough information : QoS, cost per byte downloaded and uploaded, average bitrate, ping time... In most cases, the logic to automatically choose a network without those information would be too complicated and not reliable enough. Manual Access Point selection is the only way to put the user in charge of the cost of data transfer, so far.
