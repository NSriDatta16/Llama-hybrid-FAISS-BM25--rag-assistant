First you need to make a time-embedding of your data. E.g. take as the first input [1, 12, 2, 3] and the corresponding output [5], and as the second input you take [12, 2, 3, 5] and the corresponding output [9]. (This is embedding with delay 4 but you can choose another value that fits better. ) Now you have a valid prediction problem. To these data you can apply Online Gaussian Processes . This is a machine learning method which does exactly what you describe, and it provides confidence intervals. If your model is non-stationary you can try the non-stationary extension, kernel recursive least-squares tracker . By the way, that paper includes Matlab code for stationary and nonstationary cases. These methods are reasonably fast: their computational complexity is quadratic in terms of the number of data you store in memory (which is typically a small, representative part of all data processed). For faster methods I recommend for instance kernel least mean squares method, but their accuracy is less.
