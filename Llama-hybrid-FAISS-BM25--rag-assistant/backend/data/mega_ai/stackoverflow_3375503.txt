Missing DLL when run as script

I'm trying to get a PHP script to run every 30 minutes on my server (Win XP SP3, xampp 1.7.3). To do so I'm running the following script (update.cmd) using the MS task scheduler SET PATH="C:\xampp\PHP" start php.exe \htdocs\update_dashboard.php I am using the oci8 php extension on my webserver, but when I run that script it gives me errors that php.exe can't find the necessary dll for the oci8 extension. I get the following errors: This application has failed to start because OCI.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem. PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 'C:\xampp\php\ext\php_oci8.dll' - The specified module count not be found. I know that the file is there and I don't get those errors when the php is run through apache, am I running the wrong copy of php.exe? Any ideas why not? Does my PATH have to be set differently? My Windows PATH includes: C:\instantclient_11_2;C:\oracle\ora92\bin;C:\Program Files\Oracle\jre\1.3.1\bin;C:\Program Files\Oracle\jre\1.1.8\bin;C:\Program Files\ActiveState Komodo Edit 5\;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;C:\Program Files\Altiris\Software Virtualization Agent\ Thanks for your help.
