It's quicker because you avoid the overhead of calling a system routine to manage your storage. malloc() maintains a heap, so every request requires a scan for an appropriately-sized block, possibly resizing the block, updating the block list to mark this block as used, etc. If you're allocating a lot of small objects, this overhead can be excessive. With static allocation you can create an allocation pool and just maintain a simple bitmap to show which areas are in use. This assumes that each object is the same size, so you commonly create one pool per object type.
