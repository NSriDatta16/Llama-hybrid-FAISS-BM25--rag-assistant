Intuition for Autoencoders with Single Hidden Layer and Single Latent Variable

I'm currently creating an autoencoder that reduces a dataset to single a single dimension. For example: If the input is 5, the autoencoder will have the following topology: Input Layer: 5 dimensions Hidden Layer: 1 dimension Output Layer: 5 dimensions What would be the intuition behind this approach since I'm not having multiple layers? Also, will there be some effect in the case of really high dimensional data?
