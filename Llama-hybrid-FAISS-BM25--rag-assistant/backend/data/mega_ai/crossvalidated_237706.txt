Parametric (model): data which can be described by a finite number of parameters (for example gaussian with both unknown mean and variance). Nonparametric (model): data which need an infinite number of parameters to be described (for example bounded probability distributions, continuous regression functions...) Parametric/nonparametric algorithms: algorithms devised to work for parametric/nonparametric models. Basic SVM only works for linear data, so it's a parametric algorithm. More advanced SVM work for more complicated data. If your SVM works for nonparametric data (for example regression functions only assumed to be continuous), then it is nonparametric.
