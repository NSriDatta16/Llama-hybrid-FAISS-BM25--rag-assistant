I agree with JMS, you will need to plot each of your variable first because PCA requires the normality assumption. If your variables are not normally distributed then it is not appropriate to use PCA before transforming the variables. I think you will need to ask yourself, what you really want to know from this data set (set up your hypothesis) then you will be able to pick the right statistical tests. It is not good to dichotomize continuous variables into categorical variables because you will lose power to detect the difference. However, if this is the case, You could use "odds ratio", "risk difference" etc to interpret your data sets. Sincerely,
