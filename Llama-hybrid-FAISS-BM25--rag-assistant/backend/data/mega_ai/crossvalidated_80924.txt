Many structure learning algorithms can only score competing structures up to their Markov equivalences and as a result it is impossible to learn a unique DAG for a Bayesian Network (BN) based solely on data, which makes the causality hypothesis questionable. Spirtes et al. term this issue as “ statistical indistinguishability ”, discussing it at length in their book. I take the view that the edges in a DAG should mainly be interpreted as probabilistic dependencies that also lend insight into causal relationships. This is in line with the viewpoint of the proponents of 'causal' Bayesian Networks (including Judea Pearl) who defend that the probability distribution represented by a BN has an underlying causal structure. The take-home message is, there does not exist an overarching agreement on this issue. But I guess the viewpoint I shared above is a safer one.
