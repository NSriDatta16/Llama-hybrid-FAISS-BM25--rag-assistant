Proving that paired time series are (not) correlated

I've got a dataset comprised of a bunch of "paired" time series, where the data in each part of the "pair" are dependent on each other, but I'm actually concerned with (dis)proving that the two time series in each pair are significantly more similar to each other than they are to all the other series in the dataset. How can I most easily do this, especially given that I want to control for the fact that the two time series are dependent? -- in other words, given series $S_{1,a}$, $S_{1,b}$, $S_{2,a}$ and $S_{1,b}$, how can I show that series $S_{i,a}$, $S_{i,b}$ are significantly more related for a given $i$ than for all other values of $i$? To illustrate, I've got data of an experiment with two participants where, in each turn, each participant makes a set of observable choices apple , banana , kumquat , orange , pear , etc. I want to show that, all else being equal, not only is there (not) a trend of participants making choices similarly to their own previous choices but also there is (not) a separate trend of making choices similar to that of their partner's: | Dyad | Participant | Timestep | Stimulus | Apple | Banana | Kumquat | Orange | Pear | |------|-------------|----------|----------|-------|--------|---------|--------|------| | 1 | A | 1 | Red | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | | 1 | B | 1 | Red | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | | 1 | A | 2 | Blue | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | 1 | B | 2 | Blue | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | | 2 | A | 1 | Yellow | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | | 2 | B | 1 | Yellow | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | | 2 | A | 2 | Red | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | | 2 | B | 2 | Red | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Moreover, I would like to control for any possible timestep-related effects, namely that e.g. for whatever reason, as timestep increases, the probability of choosing kumquat increases (e.g. just because it's a cool name and the participants haven't picked it yet so they feel they have to eventually). What sort of analysis best fits this problem? Moreover, how should I best structure the data? â€” Would simply having one pair of observations Apple_A and Apple_B etc. be better than separating the data into individual datapoints, as shown above?
