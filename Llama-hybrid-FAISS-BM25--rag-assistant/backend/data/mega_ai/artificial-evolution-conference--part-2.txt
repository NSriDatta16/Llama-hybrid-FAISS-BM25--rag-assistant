ry speakers come from further afield. (Ochoa is Venezuelan-British, based in Scotland; Hart is English, based in Scotland; Kern is German, based in England; and Trujillo is Mexican, based in that country). Demonstrations Because artificial evolution, evolutionary computation and related areas of natural computing may be addressed in many different ways, time is reserved at Artificial Evolution conferences for demonstration of some of the solutions that have been obtained. At EA 2022 in Exeter the following demonstrations were included, showing the application of artificial intelligence and natural computation: Augmented Evolutionary Intelligence Demonstration (Matt Johns, Edward Keedwell). Neural Network-Based Virtual Analog Modeling Applied to Guitar Amplifier Emulation (Tara Vanhatalo, Pierrick Legrand). Poster sessions Artificial Evolution conferences also include time for poster sessions. At EA 2024 in Bordeaux the following posters were presented addressing a number of topics within the overlapping fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning and evolutionary computation: Comparative Study of Order Crossover Variants in Memetic algorithms for Solving the CVRP (Mohamed SA Sakhri, Goudet Olivier). Designing Less Myopic Routing Policies with Genetic programming for the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (Đurasević Marko, Francisco JG Gala). Training Free U-Net for Retinal Vessel Segmentation (Muhammad J Ali, Laurent Moalic, Mokhtar Essaid, Lhassane Idoumghar). Relevance It is worth considering the importance of the Artificial Evolution conference series when many other research conferences are available. The Artificial Evolutions attract participants from other European countries in addition to those from France. This is because the locations of the conference are easily accessible from other parts of Europe. There are fewer participants from further afield than some conferences held across more global venues. Gabriela Ochoa and Nadarajen Veerapen created a visualisation of the collaboration network across Artificial Evolution conferences by extracting articles from the Artificial Evolution conference proceedings between 1995 and 2017 using the DBLP computer science bibliography. It should not be surprising that the collaboration network shows clusters of collaboration around French computer scientists. But it also shows collaboration between French computer scientists (for example Evelyne Luttion) and British computer scientists (Edmund Burke and Gabriela Ochoa). Further afield, collaborations have involved Darell Whitley (Colorado State University), Thomas Baeck (Leiden University) and Thomas Stützle (Universite Libre de Bruxelles) as well as others. Clearly Artificial Evolution conferences cannot compete with the much larger evolutionary computation conferences (GECCO or IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation) in the number of presentations that can be covered in one conference, nor in the number of potential attendees. But in contrast, as a smaller conference, presenters can be sure that the majority of attendees will watch their presentations, and any attendee at the conference will find it easier to talk with other attendees at the conference. Alternative conferences Other European conferences covering similar disciplines include EvoStar (comprising the four conferences EuroGP, EvoApplications, EvoCOP and EvoMUSART) and Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN). The Foundations of Genetic Algorithms workshops (FOGA), actually a conference rather than a workshop, and devoted to the theoretical basis of all evolutionary algorithms and related heuristics rather than just genetic algorithms has been held in European locations as well as other international locations. The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) originated in the United States and many successive instances of that conference have been held there. Nevertheless, a number have been held in European locations, being linkely to attract s
