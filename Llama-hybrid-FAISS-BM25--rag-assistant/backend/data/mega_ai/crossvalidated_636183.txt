Can correlation be negative for a couple of series but positive for the average of those series?

Say I have a couple of equal-length data series, X1, X2, X3, and Y. I also create a series Xm which is simply the mean for X1 X2 and X3. Can it be that the correlation between Y and all of X1, X2, and X3 is negative, but the correlation between Y and Xm is positive, or vice versa? If so, how, and what does that tell you about your data, if anything. Context: I saw this occur in some personal data analysis I was doing today, and it's making me doubt the correctness of my analysis/calculations. But I also feel it can be a counter-intuitive result of how standard deviation works in practice.
