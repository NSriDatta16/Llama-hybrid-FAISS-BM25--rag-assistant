SDL_image's IMG_Load do not work

I am using IMG_Load() to load png file, but it simply not working. loadedImage = IMG_Load(filename.c_str()); after this sentence, loadedImage is still NULL,not error happened. PS:I am using VS C++2008, png file is in the develop folder. Here is my code:(It is exactly what Lazy Foo like) //The headers #include "SDL.h" #include "SDL_image.h" #include #pragma comment( linker, "/subsystem:\"windows\" /entry:\"mainCRTStartup\"" ) //Screen attributes const int SCREEN_WIDTH = 640; const int SCREEN_HEIGHT = 480; const int SCREEN_BPP = 32; //The surfaces SDL_Surface *image = NULL; SDL_Surface *screen = NULL; SDL_Surface *load_image( std::string filename ) { //The image that's loaded SDL_Surface* loadedImage = NULL; //The optimized image that will be used SDL_Surface* optimizedImage = NULL; //Load the image using SDL_image loadedImage = IMG_Load(filename.c_str()); //If the image loaded if( loadedImage != NULL ) { //Create an optimized image //cout The output return 5.
