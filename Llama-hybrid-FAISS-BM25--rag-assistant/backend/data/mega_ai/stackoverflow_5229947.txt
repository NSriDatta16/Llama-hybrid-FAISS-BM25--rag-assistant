Make all your directories importable first i.e. use __init__.py . Then have a top level script that accepts arguments and invokes scripts based on that. For long term what Keith has mentioned about distutils holds true. Otherwise here is a simpler (sure not the best) solution. Organization runscript.py group1 __init__.py script1.py utils __init__.py utils1.py Invocation python runscript -g grp1 -s script1 runscript.py import utils def main(): script_to_exec = process_args() import script_to_exec as script # __import__ script.main() main() Maybe your script can have main function which is then invoked by runscript. I suggest that you have a script at the top level which imports the script.
