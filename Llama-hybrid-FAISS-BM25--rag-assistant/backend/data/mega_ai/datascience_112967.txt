The "unraveling" you are referring to is just to illustrate how the different time steps of the input are received and processed. It doesn't have anything to do with the number of units. The "number of units" actually refers to the dimensionality of the input vector and the hidden state. The output and hidden state are passed to the computation of the next time step . $h_t$ and $h_{t-1}$ and vectors that have been computed at different time steps. Depending on how you configure of the LSTM, you may get all $h_i$ 's (e.g. to apply attention over them) or just the last one (e.g. to perform classification). As I mentioned in (1), the "number of units" actually refers to the dimensionality of the input vector and the hidden state so, what you read is true. The prediction at reach time step is a vector of real numbers.
