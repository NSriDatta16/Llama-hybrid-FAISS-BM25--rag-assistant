Why Engle-Granger cointegration test states cointegration between two variables but their trend in time is almost identical?

I have run the Engle-Granger cointegration test in Python between a stock's return and its index return. In this case i have run the test between QQQ returns vs CCMP returns like this: from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import coint results = coint(df_stock_returns['QQQ'], df_stock_returns['CCMP']) print(results) which yields: (-2.7063675732286856, 0.1972968735378101, array([-3.99084033, -3.38795719, -3.08028241])) The p-value is huge (0.19) so we can state that the two series are not cointegrated with a 95% confidence right? Now, if i plot the two variables' time series, this is what i get: How in the world is this even possible? They seem to move almost identically in time, they are almost like a replica of each other. Shouldn't we we be expecting to see the two variables moving/behaving differently over time? How can we explain that despite the high p-value the two series look so correlated like this? I have been searching about this in Google but i didn't find a meaningful answer and this is driving me nuts, i would really appreciate a good explanation about this. Thank you very much in advance.
