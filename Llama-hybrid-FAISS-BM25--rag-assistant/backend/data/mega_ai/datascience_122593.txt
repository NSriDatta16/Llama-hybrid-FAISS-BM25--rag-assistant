I am a beginner for AE. I have similar question with Q1. I know AE could compress information and extract new features which represent the input data. I found a paper which used AE to evaluate the importance of every feature in the origin matrix. In the subsequent analysis, the research leveraged these selected features to establish machine learning model like randomforest, XGBoost, and logistic regression.
