What is happening to such distributed in-memory cloud databases as Hazelcast and Scalris if there is more Data to store than RAM in the cluster?

What is happening to such distributed in-memory cloud databases as Hazelcast Scalaris if there is more Data to store than RAM in the cluster? Are they going to Swap? What if the Swap space is full? I can't see a disaster recovery strategy at both databases! Maybe all data is lost if the memory is full? Is there a availability to write things down to the hard-disk for memory issues? Are there other databases out there, which offer the same functionality as Hazelcast or Scalaris with backup features / hdd-storage / disaster recovery?
