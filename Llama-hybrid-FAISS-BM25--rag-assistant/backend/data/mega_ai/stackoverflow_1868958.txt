If you're coding OpenGL then it's normal to use GLSingle (eg single) rather than GLDouble. In nearly all circumstances single precision is more than enough for most graphics applications and should be faster - although I confess I'm not certain of this on the latest generation of GPUs. My favourite citation on this is that single precision was sufficient to navigate to the moon and back, so in practise it's unusual to cause a real issue. That said in most circumstances I'd reach for a double nowadays as storage is cheap and there's less likely to be any odd binary to decimal issues.
