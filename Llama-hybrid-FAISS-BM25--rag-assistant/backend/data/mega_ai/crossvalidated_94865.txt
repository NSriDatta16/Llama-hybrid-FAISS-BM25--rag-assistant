What is MA(q) model input in real world?

I understand the AR(p) model: its input is the time series being modelled. I'm completely stuck when reading about the MA(q) model: its input is innovation or random shock as it's often formulated. The problem is I can't imagine how to get an innovation component having no model of the (perfect) time series already (i.e. I think $\varepsilon=X_{\rm observed}-X_{\rm perfect}$, and that's probably wrong). Moreover, if we can get this innovation component in-sample, how can we get it when doing a long-term forecast (model error term as a separate additive time series component)?
