The C99 standard is not explicit about this, but taking all facts together, it is perfectly valid. A case and default label are equivalent to a goto label. See 6.8.1 Labeled statements. Especially interesting is 6.8.1.4, which enables the already mentioned Duff's Device: Any statement may be preceded by a prefix that declares an identifier as a label name. Labels in themselves do not alter the flow of control, which continues unimpeded across them. Edit : The code within a switch is nothing special; it is a normal block of code as in an if -statement, with additional jump labels. This explains the fall-through behaviour and why break is necessary. 6.8.4.2.7 even gives an example: switch (expr) { int i = 4; f(i); case 0: i=17; /*falls through into default code */ default: printf("%d\n", i); } In the artificial program fragment the object whose identifier is i exists with automatic storage duration (within the block) but is never initialized, and thus if the controlling expression has a nonzero value, the call to the printf function will access an indeterminate value. Similarly, the call to the function f cannot be reached. The case constants must be unique within a switch statement: 6.8.4.2.3 The expression of each case label shall be an integer constant expression and no two of the case constant expressions in the same switch statement shall have the same value after conversion. There may be at most one default label in a switch statement. All cases are evaluated, then it jumps to the default label, if given: 6.8.4.2.5 The integer promotions are performed on the controlling expression. The constant expression in each case label is converted to the promoted type of the controlling expression. If a converted value matches that of the promoted controlling expression, control jumps to the statement following the matched case label. Otherwise, if there is a default label, control jumps to the labeled statement. If no converted case constant expression matches and there is no default label, no part of the switch body is executed.
