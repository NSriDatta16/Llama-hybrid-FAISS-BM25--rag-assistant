To expand on the accepted answer, functional logistic regression refers to a model in which a functional covariate, $X(t)$ where $t\in T$ (e.g. time), is used to predict the response of a (scalar) binary outcome, $Y$ . As mentioned in the above answer, this falls under the broader class of functional generalized linear models (FGLMs): $$ E[Y_i|X_i(t)] = g^{-1}(\eta_i) \qquad \eta_i = \alpha + \int_T X_i(t)\beta(t)dt$$ where $g(\cdot)$ is a link function relating $X_i(t)$ to $Y_i$ . In the case of logistic regression, $p_i = E[Y_i|X_i(t)] = P(Y_i = 1|X_i(t))$ and $g$ is the logit link function so that $$ log\left(\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\right) = \alpha + \int_T X_i(t)\beta(t)dt.$$ The accepted answer provides excellent references. But since it mentioned the case of sparse functional data, I'll add one more paper that illustrates how to use functional PCA to accommodate such a sparse setting ( Wei, Tang & Li, 2014 ).
