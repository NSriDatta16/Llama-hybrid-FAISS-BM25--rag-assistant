In your code, you have the line newNode->next; in your for loop. That operation doesn't do anything. You also have newNode-> = NULL; which is not valid C, and I have no idea how you got that to compile. But really, don't use that loop. A linked list is one of the most basic recursive data structures. As a result, almost all algorithms manipulating them are most elegant as a recursive solution. typedef struct node node_t; node_t* delete_at_index(node_t* head, unsigned i) { node_t* next; if(head == NULL) return head; next = head->next; return i == 0 ? (free(head), next) /* If i == 0, the first element needs to die. Do it. */ : (head->next = delete_at_index(next, i - 1), head); /* If it isn't the first element, we recursively check the rest. */ }
