Why Standard Deviation is more popular than Mean Absolute Deviation?

$$ Mean\;Absolute\;Deviation = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-mean(X)| $$ Almost all textbooks and papers are using Standard Deviation as a measurement of dispersion. And of course, almost all the models are built based on Standard Deviation. But I don't understand how Standard Deviation has gained such popularity. I mean, Mean Absolute Deviation is a very intuitive measurement of dispersion. It tells you exact average distant that each value deviates from their mean. Standard Deviation, on the other hand, makes the result more sensitive to outliers. Why we need this sensitivity. Is there any historical reason leads us to use SD way more often than MAD?
