You can sort of do this in an automated with AS2, but it only gets the top-most object. This is done using to _droptarget property of movieclips. What you do is make a blank MovieClip, run startDrag on it with the lockCenter arugment set to true. Then you stopDrag and look at that clips _droptarget property. The only other method of doing this would be to manually loop over your clips and use the hitTest method.
