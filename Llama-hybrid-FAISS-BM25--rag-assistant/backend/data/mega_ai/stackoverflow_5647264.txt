Key-Value storage with realtime multimaster replication

Are there any opensource distributed key-value storage which satisfy following conditions. Almost real-time multimaster replication. (tie-breaker will be based on timestamp and not anything more complicated) Each node should be able to work with it's local data if disconnected from the rest of the nodes(Consistent hashing based approaches will not be feasible). Max number of nodes expected ~10. Evaluated the following. memcachedb couchdb cassandra and found that the above ones does not satisfy all the requirements.
