rendering pdf on webside ala google documents

In a current project i need to display PDFs in a webpage. Right now we are embedding them with the Adobe PDF Reader but i would rather have something more elegant (the reader does not integrate well, it can not be overlaid with transparent regions, ...). I envision something close google documents, where they display PDFs as image but also allow text to be selected and copied out of the PDF (an requirement we have). Does anybody know how they do this? Or of any library we could use to obtain a comparable result? I know we could split the PDFs into images on server side, but this would not allow for the selection of text ... Thanks in advance for any help PS: Java based project, using wicket.
