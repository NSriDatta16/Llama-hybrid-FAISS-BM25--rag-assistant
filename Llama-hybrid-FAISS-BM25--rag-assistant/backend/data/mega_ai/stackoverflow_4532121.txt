Removing AppWidgets programmatically

I'm having the hardest time figuring out how to remove home screen AppWidget's programmatically (i.e. without the user actually dragging one into the trash). As an example, consider an app that can have multiple accounts, with any number of widgets for each account - once an account is removed, widget should be deleted as well. I've tried following an obscure example from http://www.netmite.com/android/mydroid/cupcake/frameworks/base/services/java/com/android/server/AppWidgetService.java , but that doesn't seem to even trigger OnDeleted, much less remove the AppWidget from the home screen. Intent intent = new Intent(AppWidgetManager.ACTION_APPWIDGET_DELETED); intent.setComponent(info.componentName); // references AppWidgetProvider's class intent.putExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, widgetId); sendBroadcast(intent); Does anyone have any advice on how this can be accomplished? An example would be the bee's knees. Thanks.
