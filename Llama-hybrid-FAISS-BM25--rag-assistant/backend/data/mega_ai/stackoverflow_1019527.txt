Pandora stores some information in the Flash local storage, including your username and login credentials. When you clear cookies in your browser, it does not clear Flash local storage which is why Pandora still remembers you. Also, since Flash local storage is shared between all browsers on that computer, the settings will be available to Flash within any browser. If at any time you want to clear your Flash local storage, you can right click on the Flash app (i.e. the Pandora music player) and select "Settings..." then in the "Local Storage" tab slide it down to 0 then "OK". Keep in mind that the next time you start Pandora, you'll have to allow it to store some data again otherwise it won't be able to load.
