The two things you need to be privy to are constraining access to data in transit and filtering input in prevention of code injection. There are multiple way to constrain the data in transit, but they not be practical for your application configuration. By not securing that tranmission the data is open to eavesdropping and interference. You can digitally sign the packets as this would provide a mechanism for authentication. You can encrypt the data as this would provide confidentiality. You can also perform a hash comparison upon the final payload as this would provide integrity. If you are not taking into account confidentiality, integrity, or authorization then you have no security. As far as the best way that I do not know. The best way is what is most efficient with regard to processing and I/O versus the degree of risk that is acceptable to your organization.
