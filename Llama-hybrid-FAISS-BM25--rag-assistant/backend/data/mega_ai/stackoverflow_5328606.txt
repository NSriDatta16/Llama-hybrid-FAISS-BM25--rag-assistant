Two panel UI with Fragments vs Separate activities

I am starting a Honeycomb application that will have a basic two panel layout, one panel on the left for the menu and one on the right for the main functionality of each section. Contrary to the available samples of the Fragments API the content displayed on the right panel consists of a completely different UI for each of the menu options. It is tempting to just replace the right fragment according to the selected section, but this would mean using just one activity in the entire app, and this does not sound good. Moreover, the fragment's lifecycle is tied to the activity, so no fragments will be killed until the activity gets killed, resulting in a lot of fragments "alive". However, having a different activity with two panels for every menu option means that the fragment used for the menu will have to be added in EVERY activity and will be subject to inconsistent layouts across all the sections that should have a menu. What are the best practices here?
