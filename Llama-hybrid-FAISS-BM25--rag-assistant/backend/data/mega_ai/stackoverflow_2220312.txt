For many commonly used languages, the array will require allocating storage k memory addresses (of the data). A singly-linked list will require 2 addresses per node (data & next). A doubly-linked list would require 3 addresses per node. Let n be the actual number of children of a particular node A : The array uses k memory addresses The singly-linked list uses 2 n addresses The doubly-linked list uses 3 n addresses The value k allows you to determine if 2 n or 3 n addresses will average to a gain or loss compared to simply storing the addresses in an array.
