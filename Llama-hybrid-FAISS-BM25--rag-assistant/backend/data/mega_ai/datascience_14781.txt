I think a random forest would be appropriate in this case. If you have annotated historical data (records of all the variables you described as well as if the tube passed or failed), you could build a random forest, determine variable importance, and link both the categorical data (human operator) and continuous data (temperature, pressure...) to the tube outcome. A benefit of random forests is that they can be more easily described in terms of a decision tree. R has some nice visualization tools for decision trees, and in my experience, management has an easier time accepting decision trees then other methods. Let me know if you need more detail and I can edit this response to include some sources on random forest, or more in depth explanation.
