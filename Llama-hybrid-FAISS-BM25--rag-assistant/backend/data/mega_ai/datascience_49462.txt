Adjust class weights due to class imbalance and class importance Multi class classification XGBoost

With respect to this question and the answer given by @Esmailian, Would anyone be able to let me know if Class B has a higher importance or the positive class ( i.e. it needs to have a higher predicted accuracy not necessarily at the expense of other classes). How should we readjust the weights of the classes. I tried to increase the weight of class in importance (Class B) but the accuracy of it reduced. Thank you Michael
