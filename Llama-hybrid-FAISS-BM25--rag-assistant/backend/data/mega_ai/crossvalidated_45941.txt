As you point out, the individual cell means match, but where you see the problem is in the marginal means. There are multiple ways to calculate the marginal means. Suppose that the data has information on sex (male/female) and age (old/young) and we want to calculate the margin for sex. One approach is to ignore the age variable and just take the mean of all the males and the mean of all the females. Another approach is to find the mean of males by averaging the mean of old males and the mean of young males (add the 2 means and divide by 2). In a balanced design those 2 methods will give the same answer (can be shown with simple algebra), but in the unbalanced case they will usually give different answers because the weight that each data point contributes to the overall mean is different. With model based means you can get different weightings from the 2 I mentioned (I used them for examples as simple ways to understand). I expect in your case that R and SPSS are likely using different approaches.
