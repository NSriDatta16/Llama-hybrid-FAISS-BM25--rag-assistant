Is it possible to have SNMP Agent without MIBâ€™s support?

hii, i am working on SNMP from last few days,i have develope a small application(SNMP Agent) which * Run on 161 port. * Have a tree structured OID support. * Respond to all Get,GetNext,Set Pdu Request types. * Tested with some SNMP Managers(free available) by get and set the values of the OID's. BUT,now question is when i tried it with Cacti it will not respond anything,but detect windows snmp service..it just respond to the requests of the SNMP Managers. So,Is it mandatory to provide mib with SNMP Agent??.
