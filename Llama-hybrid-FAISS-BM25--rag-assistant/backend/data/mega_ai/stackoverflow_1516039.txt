I am not familiar with the from-tree-id element; I don't remember it from any previous JSF version. The element doesn't appear in any of these schemas: http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-facesconfig_1_0.dtd http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-facesconfig_1_1.dtd http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-facesconfig_1_2.xsd http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-facesconfig_2_0.xsd Check the element isn't in another namespace; it could just be a typo in the tutorial.
