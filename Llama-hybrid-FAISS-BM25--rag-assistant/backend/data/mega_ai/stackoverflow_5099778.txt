Detecting start and end position of a 'drag' in Android, and drawing a line between them

I want to make a simple doodle application, for android, but I don't know how to get some data from android! I need: The position of the mouse before and after the drag or if it is a simple touch how to get the position of the touch. How should I go about drawing the lines? Can somebody please help me?
