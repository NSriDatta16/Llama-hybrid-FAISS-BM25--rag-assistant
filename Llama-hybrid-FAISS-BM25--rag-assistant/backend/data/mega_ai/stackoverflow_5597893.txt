Inserting HTML fragments returned from a JSON response into the DOM

Hopefully this isn't a stupid question so here goes: I am using a Web Service that's returning json like this through a jquery post request: { "response": [ [ { "class": "class blah blah blah", "index": 0, "item": { "imageurl": "image.jpg", "description": " 10 Great Gift Ideas for Valentines Day Only 5 days left " }, "prices": null } ] ] } That is just one part of the response. I need to extract the response.item.description and insert that into a div on the page but when I do, the extra \ are still there which causes the display to break. Is there a proper way to handle the html fragments? I was thinking that I could use a regex to check to see is a \ was followed by a " / etc and strip it. I was also thinking if I changed the data on the server side to be HTML encoded than maybe it wouldn't get escaped but I would rather keep the data the way it is. Is there anything built into jQuery or javascript that I am missing?
