Your code looks good. There are a few possible reasons you could be seeing a slowdown. First: upstream caching. For example, if you're running a test multiple times on the same group of URLs, once you hit a URL it will be cached in many places-- your proxy server (if you have one), your internet provider's proxies (if they have them), the destination site's caching, etc. So for any crawler speed test, make sure you're picking URLs from random from a very large set of URLs (large enough that the chance of any of them being cached as a result of your crawling is very small). Next, I'd look at the rest of your app. Are you sure it's the actual fetching that's slow? Or is some other part of your app (e.g. the part that stores the fetched data) perhaps causing the slowdown. Since most data-storage mechanisms (in-RAM, in a database, etc.) get a lot slower as you put more data in them, you should ensure you're only timing your HTTP access and not looking at overall crawler throughput including storage.
