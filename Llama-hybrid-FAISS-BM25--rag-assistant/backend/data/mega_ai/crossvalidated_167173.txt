When you use linear regression, you are violating the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity (of the residuals). Using a linear regression here cannot be trusted. The standard errors from the logistic regression will be appropriate. In addition, the way the standard errors are calculated differs. Your linear regression almost certainly used ordinary least squares to fit the model. From there, the standard errors are the square roots of the main diagonal of $\ \hat\sigma^2\bf (X'X)^{-1}$. The logistic regression will have been fit through maximum likelihood, and the Wald standard errors are determined from the degree of curvature at the maximum of the likelihood function. If the response distribution was specified as normal, these would be the same, but since the response distribution is binomial there is no reason they should be the same.
