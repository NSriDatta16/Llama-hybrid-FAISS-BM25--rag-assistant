Normally Applets are only allowed to access the host they came from (in your case allcitybuilder.com ). Thus, you either have to put the file to view also to this host (or install a proxy there), or your applet needs additional privileges to have more access. For the applet to have more access, it needs to be digitally signed, and the user needs to confirm the applet loading. But there is no way to say "I need only access to minecraft.net" and for the user to grant you only this permission (without manual editing of policy files), so it is an "all or nothing". Also, if the user refuses, the applet may either run with usual applet permissions (on Sun's Plugin) or not run at all (on IcedTea). With JNLP you can get a confirmation for the user for individual actions, but this is only for local access, no remote one.
