That's the way it works. I don't think it's inadequate insofar as SharePoint is not a version control system, but rather a document management one. From that standpoint, deleting something from the repository means "I don't want to see it again". From here : You can choose to delete a single version of a file — for example, if you know that you made a mistake in that version — which removes that version from the version history. However, if you delete the actual file, all of its versions are deleted with it. By default, when you delete a version, the version is sent to the Recycle Bin, where it can be recovered until it is permanently deleted. Your organization may handle deletions differently, however. My car doesn't float, but then it was never designed to do that. If I wanted something that floats, I would buy a boat. So it goes with technology - if you needed a feature like keeping a deleted object forever then SharePoint is probably not the right product for you or your organization.
