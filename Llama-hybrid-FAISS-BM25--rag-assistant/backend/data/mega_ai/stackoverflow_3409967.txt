Yes, it is plausible : Shelf objects support all methods supported by dictionaries. This eases the transition from dictionary based scripts to those requiring persistent storage. You need to call shelf.sync() every so often to clear the cache. EDIT Take care, it's not exactly a dict . See e.g. Laurion's answer. Oh, and you can only have str keys.
