deep learning : how to retrain an already trained model on different data?

I have a model (a convolutional neural network) that has already been trained on set of training data for human pose estimation. It works very well for simple cases, but I want to make it more robust to human truncation and occlusion. For this I prepared a different set of data that covers such "difficult" situations. I intend on taking the current weights and biases as initial values for the model and train it using gradient descent and back-propagation on this new set of data. As I lack experience in deep learning, before I go on and apply this, is this "correct" from a scientific point of view? should I change something before (such as the loss function...)?
