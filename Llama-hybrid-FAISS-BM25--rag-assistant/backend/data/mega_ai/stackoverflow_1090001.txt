It won't rotate correctly, even if you set shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation. Confirmation of this comes from a blog: "I'll make a really long story really short by noting that this little bastard is hardwired for portrait use. I could get it into various stages of landscape, but when the orientation was rotated correctly, the touch inputs and drags weren't. If I could get the sizing right, then the orientation was wrong. And so on. I even cashed in one of my Apple developer tech support incidents looking for a solution (they confirmed my conclusion about the portrait limitation)." http://hunter.pairsite.com/blogs/20090628/
