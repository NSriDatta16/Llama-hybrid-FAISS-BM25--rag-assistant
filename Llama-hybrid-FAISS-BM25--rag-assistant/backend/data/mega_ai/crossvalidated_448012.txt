The formula that divides by $n-p$ is an estimator for unbiased mean squared error for regression , where you divide by the degrees of freedom. Imagine you would like to compare results returned by different machine learning algorithms, in many cases it would be hard to say what does exactly $p$ is, and for some models, like non-parametric models, or neural networks, $n-p$ could go all the way down to zero, or get negative, so this wouldn't have much sense. That is why in machine learning we use the simplified version, that works no matter what algorithms do you compare with each other.
