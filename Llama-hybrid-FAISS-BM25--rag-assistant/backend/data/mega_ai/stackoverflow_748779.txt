I re-wrote the System.Net.WebClient class a while back. I was doing some web scraping and started my own class to wrap HttpWebRequest/HttpWebReponse. Then I discovered WebClient part way through. I finished it anyway because I needed functionality that WebClient does not provide (control of cookies and user agent). Something I'm thinking about re-writing is the String.Format() method. I want to reflect the code used to parse the input string and mimic it to build my own "CompiledFormat" class that you can use in a loop without having to re-parse your format string with each iteration. The result will allow efficient code like this: var PhoneFormat = new CompiledFormat("({0}){1}-{2}x{3}"); foreach (PhoneNumber item in MyPhoneList) { Console.WriteLine(PhoneFormat.Apply(PhoneNumber.AreaCode, PhoneNumber.Prefix, PhoneNumber.Number, PhoneNumber.Extension)); } Update: This prompted me to finally go do it. See the results here: Performance issue: comparing to String.Format
