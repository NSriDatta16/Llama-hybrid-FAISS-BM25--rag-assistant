Bayesian inference adaptable to not mutually exlclusive events?

Say I have $n$ possible events that lead to $m$ observable effects. The Bayesian inference hypothesis is that events are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. Could I still be able to use Bayesian inference (modified, eventually) when more than one event occurs at some observation? Real example: $n$ possible faulty components on a single board with $m$ on-board test points that can result "in range" or "out of range," and I cannot a priori exclude that two components are faulty at the same time.
