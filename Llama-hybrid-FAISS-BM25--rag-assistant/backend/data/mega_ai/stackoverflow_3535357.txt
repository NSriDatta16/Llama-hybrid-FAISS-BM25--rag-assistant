Can jquery UI draggable be "position-aware" of other elements?

I'm implementing jquery UI draggable and have 2 of these draggables that you see on the linked page. They're of course draggable, so I can move them around as needed. How would I make them aware of each other though, so that I could try to make them align or show alignment marks when while being dragged, they get to the same x or y as another draggable?
