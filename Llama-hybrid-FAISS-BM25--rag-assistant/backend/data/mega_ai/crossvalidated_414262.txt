When to use the full and the conditional likelihood

In the context of estimating parameters of a time series model, we may consider either the full likelihood or the conditional likelihood. I was wondering in what situations the full likelihood is significantly better than the conditional likelihood? By full likelihood, I mean $f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = f(x_1)f(x_2|x_1)\ldots f(x_n|x_{n-1},\ldots,x_1)$ , while conditional likelihood only considers $f(x_2,\ldots,x_n|x_1) = f(x_2|x_1)f(x_3|x_2,x_1)\ldots f(x_n|x_{n-1},\ldots,x_1)$ .
