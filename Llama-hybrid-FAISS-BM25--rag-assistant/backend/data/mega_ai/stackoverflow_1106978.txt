Determine the distance of point E to each point A,B,C,D The color for point E will be the combination of Red / Green / Blue. Calculate each color axis as the average of the same color axis for A,B,C,D, ponderating by distance. distance_a = sqrt((xa-xe)^2+(ya-ye)^2) distance_b = .... sum_distances = distance_a + distance_b ... red = (red_a distance_a + red_b distance_b ... ) / sum_distances color_E = ColorFromARgb(red,green,blue)
