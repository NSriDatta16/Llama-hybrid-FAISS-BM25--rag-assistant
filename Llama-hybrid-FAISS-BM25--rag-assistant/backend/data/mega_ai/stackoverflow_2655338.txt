Provided you can get your view to a point where it is searching both content types, I think this actually does become a theme issue. You could override the various theme templates for the view and organize the returned array of nodes in a particular way. You could also simply omit content type Y from the list during output and theme the content type X node to list the nodes from the CCK node reference field (this would be similar to what you mentioned, but you'd still leave content type Y in the view query and omit it during output). There might be some performance implications depending on the amount of content type Y nodes per content type X nodes there are. I think no matter what you end up doing this will be a theme issue albeit a complex one.
