One possibility you might try is simulating Gaussian Processes with different kernels. In that way, you can get a feel for what the different kernels will produce. This can most easily be done by selecting a grid of values and simulating from the multivariate normal implied by that grid. To make things easier, just use a zero vector for your mean function. You can also see with this method if the properties of your simulated draws tend to match up with how your time series data looks. For example, you will see that the squared exponential kernel is very smooth. In fact, draws from a Gaussian Process with a squared exponential kernel will be continuous with probability one and also in fact infinitely differentiable with probability one. This is one property of the squared exponential that makes it very useful. Another reason for why it gets a lot of use is its clear connection with a Gaussian density. Other kernels such as the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck covariance function will produce much rougher draws and may be more desirable in terms of a model.
