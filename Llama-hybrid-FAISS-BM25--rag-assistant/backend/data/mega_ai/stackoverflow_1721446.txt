Difficult question. It actually depends on the size of the project. In large projects, you will often have an overall project lead, and a development lead. Then the dev lead should be developer with good management abilities. Not all devs can do this, so it's important to choose someone with a good balance of technical and organizational/social skill. If you only have an overall project lead, then it's a bit more difficult. The lead will probably do a lot of customer interaction & organization, so a dev does not make a lot of sense. Then you should probably choose someone as the dev lead (even informally) to liaise with the project lead. The important thing is to have someone responsible for technical dev questions, and that someone must be a dev.
