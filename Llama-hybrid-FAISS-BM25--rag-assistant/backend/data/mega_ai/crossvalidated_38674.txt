The answers and comments so far are basically correct at the practical level, but for completeness, there is research into so-called causality models that are based upon Bayesian statistics and graph theory. So although in general correlation indeed does not imply causation, there are more complex models that do attempt to tease out causation. See the book Causality by Judea Pearl for more details, but this is very heavy-duty mathematics and is probably not what you want.
