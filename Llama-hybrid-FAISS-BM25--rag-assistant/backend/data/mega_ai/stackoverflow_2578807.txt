Why does only youtube embeds work on iPad?

I am trying to find out as to why youtube embeds works just fine on iPad, and not the embeds of any other video site. Example of youtube embed: is this because iPad has got a native youtube app which has special support for youtube embeds, or is this something that is handled by the script that's get executed by the youtube embed code, which might check for the user agent, and then load the HTML5 video player with a source pointing to the h.264 encoded version of the video (is something of this sort possible)?
