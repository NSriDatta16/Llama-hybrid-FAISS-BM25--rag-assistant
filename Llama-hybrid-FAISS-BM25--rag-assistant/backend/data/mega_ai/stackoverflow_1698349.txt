One option is to put them in a new directory, for example app/models/modules/ . Then, you can add this to config/environment.rb : Dir["#{RAILS_ROOT}/app/models/modules/*.rb"].each do |filename| require filename end This will require every file in in that directory, so if you put a file like the following in your modules directory: module SharedMethods def foo #... end end Then you can just use it in your models because it will be automatically loaded: class User This approach is more organized than putting these mixins in the lib directory because they stay near the classes that use them.
