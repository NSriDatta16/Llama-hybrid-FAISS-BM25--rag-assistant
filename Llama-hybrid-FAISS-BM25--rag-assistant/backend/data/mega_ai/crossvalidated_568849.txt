How to interpret a regression with both time and individual fixed effects?

Let's say we have the following regression $Y = \alpha + \beta X + \gamma W + u$ the way I interpret $\beta$ is "the effect of $X$ on $Y$ keeping $W$ constant". Now let's say that I have panel data, and I want to control for unobserved heterogeneity, then I add individual fixed effects to the previous equation. The interpretation is similar: "the average effect of $X$ on $Y$ across individuals". Alternatively, I am worried about unobserved time-variant confounders, therefore I include time-fixed effects. The interpretation is now: "the average effect of $X$ on $Y$ across time". My question is: "how to interpret $\beta$ in a case in which I include both time and individual fixed effects?"
