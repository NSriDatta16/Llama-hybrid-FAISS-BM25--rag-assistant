Controlled interrupted time series (segmented regression) - calculating group effects separately

I have conducted a controlled interrupted time series using Linden's formulation, where $Y_t = β_0 + β_1T + β_2X_t + β_3TX_t + β_4Z + β_5ZT + β_6ZX_t + β_7ZX_tT$ $β_0...β_3$ represent the control (untreated) group and $β_4...β_7$ represent the difference between the treatment and control groups. From this model , is it possible to calculate the values that represent the treatment and control groups separately?
