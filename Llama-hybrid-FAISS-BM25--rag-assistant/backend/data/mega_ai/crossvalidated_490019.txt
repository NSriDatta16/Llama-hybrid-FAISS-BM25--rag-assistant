test the internal validity of this model / score by Resampling by Bootstraping

I am working on a predictive model of a diagnosis via a logistic regression "glm" Let me clarify right away, I am a medical doctor and researcher, not a mathematician, so sorry if I use terms that lack precision / accuracy. I initially identified 2 biomarkers very associated with the desired diagnosis (varExplicative1 & varExplicative2). So I made ROC curves, ..., defined thresholds, binarized the 2 biomarkers, and created a predictive score from the coefficients of these biomarkers from the regression model. It is therefore a score constructed to be a screening / exclusion score, so as not to carry out the imaging procedure necessary to make this diagnosis. This score obtains a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI 93-99), and a NPV of 92% (75-99). This is what the dataset limited to these 3 variables looks like : head(XX, 5) clin_diag score_ddi_etev score_leuco_etev 1 etev_pos >=3000 >=12 2 etev_pos >=3000 =3000 =12 5 etev_pos >=3000 >=12 Logistic regression: creation of the model : glm_mod |z|) (Intercept) -2.219552 0.6223875 -3.566190 3.622094e-04 score_ddi_etev>=3000 3.199800 0.7350007 4.353466 1.340019e-05 score_leuco_etev>=12 2.679261 0.9645409 2.777758 5.473535e-03 The sample being small (n = 72), I therefore built the model on the whole sample (n = 72) My question: I would like to test the internal validity of this model / score by Resampling by Bootstraping. I read the doc on the "boot" package. but I don't know how to apply it to R. In particular the function to be entered in "statistic" Can you help me ? As well as the interpretation of the response of R My essay : # Function # ???? # Resampling# b Thank you a lot
