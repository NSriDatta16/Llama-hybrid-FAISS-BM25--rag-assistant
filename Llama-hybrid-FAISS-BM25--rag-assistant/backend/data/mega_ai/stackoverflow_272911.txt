What is the best way to organize user generated content in a social network?

I'm searching for the best way to automatically organize all user generated content in a social network. I'm building a site in ruby based upon lovdbyless' framework. the site is a place for men to share specialised knowledge. I've looked into wikis,forums, blogs by need a platform/organizational structure that will allow user generated content from these 3 sources to be automatically aggregated, indexed and make it searchable, so that other users can get access to it easily and efficiently. Something like a knowledgebase, that is automatically updated wherever a user creates a forum post, personal blog post, wiki entry etc.so that the combined knowledge of the site is accessible to members with minimum effort
