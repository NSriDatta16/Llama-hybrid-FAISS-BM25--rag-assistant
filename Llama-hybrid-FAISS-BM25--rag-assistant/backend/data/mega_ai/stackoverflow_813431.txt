Plain C or Pascal, Modula2. But due to compiler availability that means C. The extra's of C++ and similars are only interesting out of style grounds, since dynamic allocation and program size is usually very limited. Also a more complicated runtime can be a pain if your apps get tight. Assembler can be useful too, but only if you sell really gigantic quantities, and a smaller firmware means a smaller, cheaper chip (less flash) and the program's size is overseeable (read: there is some chance that you will get it bugfree in time)
