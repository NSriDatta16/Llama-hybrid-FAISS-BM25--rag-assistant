Firstly, Agile methodologies emphasize on these practices but they have not introduced them. They have been there in software development process well before Agile came in. So simply saying that if you are not using Scrum/XP/RUP then you are not following these practices is plain wrong. If you are a professional software development organization, these practices will exist in one form or other. Secondly, whether you are an agile developer in a Waterfall organization or vice-versa, you can not do much, at-least not effectively or significantly. What development 'culture' the organization has is a function of the commitment and focus of the management and executive. If that does not exist, you can do your 'bit' but you will lose out in the end. That is the reason Agile fails in many organizations when they transition to it, because they are unwilling to make the cultural change.
