There's a few ways you could get rid of the warning, but still use a pointer value as a boolean. For example, you could do this: const void * bools[] = { "ItemA", mine->a ? &bools : 0, "ItemB", mine->b ? &bools : 0, 0, 0 }; This uses a NULL pointer for false, and a non-null pointer (in this case, &bools , but a pointer to any object of the right storage duration would be fine) for true. You would also then remove the cast to unsigned int in the test, so that it is just: fprintf(stderr, "%s = %d\n", bools[i], bools[i + 1] ? "true" : "false"); (A null pointer always evaluates as false, and a non-null pointer as true). However , I do agree that you are better off creating an array of structs instead.
