It's a difficult book, used by one of the pre-eminent technical universities in the world. It's no surprise that it's challenging. There are a LOT of exercises of varying difficulty. It's a noble goal to attempt all of them. Aren't the course materials on-line? It'd be interesting to see if students taking the course for credit do all the exercises. I wouldn't be discouraged. Keep plugging, even if you have to pass on some of the exercises. There's nothing saying that you have to master it in one pass, either. Go through, take in what you can, and re-do if necessary. You might find that the extra context helps. The lectures are available on iTunes if you find that helps. The important thing is to set a deadline and make steady progress. Good luck.
