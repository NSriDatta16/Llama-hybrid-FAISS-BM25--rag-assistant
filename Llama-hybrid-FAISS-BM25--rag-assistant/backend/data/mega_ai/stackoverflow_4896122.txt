Make sure the UIView has multipleTouchEnabled=YES , the default is NO . Edit:I see what the problem is. In touchesBegan:withEvent:, you will only get the new touches. You don't get all the active touches. It is very unlikely, if at all possible, that you will get more than one touch to begin at the same time. To check is there is more than one active touch int touchesBegan: try this: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if ([[event touchesForView:self] count] > 1) { NSLog(@"%d active touches",[[event touchesForView:self.view] count]) ; } [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event] ; }
