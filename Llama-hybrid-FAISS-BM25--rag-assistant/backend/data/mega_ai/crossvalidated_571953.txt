As time and censoring are important, this is clearly a survival-model situation. You have to decide what you want to choose as time = 0 for the model. If you want to model tenure as an outcome, then you would effectively set time = 0 to the time that each individual started as a customer by using tenure as the (potentially censored) outcome in a survival model, as you propose for a Cox model. If no covariate values change with time and no customer departs and returns, then you can use just the last observed tenure value along with a censoring indicator as the outcome in a Cox (or other proportional-hazards) model. You might, however, want to consider time = 0 as some fixed calendar date. See this answer and the linked reference to a thesis that used that approach instead for modeling insurance-customer churn. Then you could use tenure prior to that starting date as a predictor. That's your choice depending on just what you want to model. If you only have a small number of possible event times (e.g., monthly data over a year or so), you probably should be using discrete-time survival analysis. That can be set up as a logistic regression based on data for each individual at each at-risk time (to handle censoring; you evidently have data in that format already) and that includes time as a modeled covariate . This answer provides several links for study and to tools for setting up such data. Finally, this will be most reliable if the "churn" is an active event, like the refusal to renew an insurance policy. If it's just that you haven't seen the customer in a long time at which point you call a "churn" then you might need to model this more subtly.
