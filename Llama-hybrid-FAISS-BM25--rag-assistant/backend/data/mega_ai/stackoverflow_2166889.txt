How Can I Clone a Camera Source DirectShow Filter?

I'm doing some stereoscopic work which means I have need to work with two instances of various filters (i.e. a camera source that receives an IP stream), and this is proving not to be trivial. I even tried copying the IPCamfilter.ax to IPCamfilter.ax and manually making new CLSID entries in the reg, and the clone shows up, but won't work. Any ideas? Should I edit the clone filters binary to change its CLSID and then register it? Or is there a simple way to use GraphEdit to do this?
