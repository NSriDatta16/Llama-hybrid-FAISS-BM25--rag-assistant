How to send request from client side if one table affects

I am inserting a row in one table say appcapacity using stored procedure at every 1 min using timer task in java. I am monitoring that table in admin side as chart with two column values say (TIME,FILESIZE) as x and y respectively. ie. in client side by using Google visualization API. table : appcapacity TIME FILESIZE 19:25:28 1.91015625 KB 19:39:10 4.400390625 KB . . . . . . What i have to do is i need to update that chart with new value in admin panel if a row gets insert in that table. My question is : Is that possible to send request from client side to get the data from that table only when a new row gets insert in that table????
