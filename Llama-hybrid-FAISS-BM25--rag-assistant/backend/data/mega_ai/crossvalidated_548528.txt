You might add a post-hoc for Kruskal-Wallis. I recommend Dunn test (1964). You might add some kind of nonparametric analog of two-way anova. Maybe Scheirer–Ray–Hare test, or Aligned Ranks Transformation anova. Saying "data normally distributed" as a condition of two-way anova is really misleading for students. There is so much misinformation about the assumptions of general linear models, and it causes so many problems for students and young researchers. I try to address these misunderstandings continually on ResearchGate. Please don't be one of the people who's resources I say to "discard entirely" because they don't correctly address the assumptions for these models. For anova-type tests, relative homogeneity of variance may be a bigger concern than the conditional normality of the data. But more importantly for this project, in general I strongly discourage writing things like "data are normal" in a flow chart like this. Why? 1) No data are truly normal. Students should say this to themselves every morning. 2) These tests are somewhat robust to deviations from their model assumptions. 3) It's not really the distribution of the data that we are concerned with. Students should say this to themselves three times every morning. Maybe just say something like "Parametric test is appropriate" on the flowchart, and then have a separate sheet that addresses what this means. Some of my recommendations: a) Start with the assumptions of a general linear model. For example, in Montgomery, Design and Analysis of Experiments . Or at the following presentation, see slide 8, and then slides 19 - 22. https://staff.emu.edu.tr/adhammackieh/Documents/courses/ieng581/lecture-notes/ch03.pdf . From there, you can describe the simplified assumptions for t tests, and variants for e.g. Welch's t test and anova. b) Don't use tests for normality or homogeneity; Use q-q plots or histogram of residuals; Use plots of residuals vs. predicted values. c) Consider that tests are somewhat robust. d) Consider where your data come from, and if an assumption of conditionally normal distribution makes sense.
