swapping views with cool page turn animation

Below is code that I'm using to swap views MySecondViewController *tempVC = [[MySecondViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MySecondView"]; [self presentModalViewController:tempVC animated:YES]; [tempVC passDataWithString:@"a string" andColor:yellowcolor]; How can I get the cool page turning animation (as with iBook or ROAD RAGE SIGN) I don't want the user to actually tap and drag his finger on the screen. I want him to push a button and the animation occurs by itself.
