I doubt it is a question of performance or optimization. I would suspect the author of that code was simply not comfortable or familiar with regular expressions. Also notice how the comma-separated string isn't split apart in order to leverage object properties - possibly also a case of lack of familiarity with the language. For example, another way of testing for an operator in a comma-separated list of allowable operators would be to split the comma-separated list of allowable operators and do a one-time initialization of an object with the operators as properties: var aOps = ">=, ".split(","); var allowableOps = {}; for (var iLoop = 0; iLoop This small initialization overhead would likely be offset by the ability to do speedy lookups: if (allowableOps[sCompOp]) { ... } Of course, this could end up being slower overall, but it is arguably a cleaner approach.
