If you look at the documentation for push_back on cplusplus.com it states: This effectively increases the vector size by one, which causes a reallocation of the internal allocated storage if the vector size was equal to the vector capacity before the call. Reallocations invalidate all previously obtained iterators, references and pointers. So I very much doubt the size would change before that but you could always test it. At least on my platform the size changes as stated above: size vs capacity 1020 vs 1024 1021 vs 1024 1022 vs 1024 1023 vs 1024 1024 vs 1024 1025 vs 2048
