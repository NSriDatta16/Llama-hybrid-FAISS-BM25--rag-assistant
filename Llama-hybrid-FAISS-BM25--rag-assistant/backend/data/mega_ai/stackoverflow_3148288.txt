Do your users get to see the XML at all? If so, you could simply allow the user to input an XPath expression, such as /interface/data/unit=1 or substring-before(',',/interface/data/transaction/data)='Z' then simply do if (xml.SelectNodes(xPathExpression) == null) /*discard*/ IMHO anyone who works with XML should be encouraged to learn XPath; you could provide a few simple examples next to the input to help. If your users don't see the XML, you're probably better off having a few predefined conditions that the user can select from and then supply a value, otherwise you're going to have to create a whole expression parser, which is probably overkill for a task like this.
