Is it valid to use bootstrapping to generate a confidence interval of an accuracy measured by rolling window analysis?

I would like to generate confidence intervals for the accuracy of a model that I use to forecast time series data. In order to get an average accuracy for my model I use rolling window analysis (See under the heading - Rolling Window Analysis for Predictive Performance). My model produces a multi-step forecast and due to a limited test set size I perform an overlapping window analysis to compute an average accuracy for the model. Let $T=1,2,3,4,5$ be my test data and $h=2$ be the forecast horizon. Then I have the following overlapping test sets $$ T_1 = 1,2 \\ T_2 = 2,3 \\ T_3 = 3,4 \\ T_4 = 4,5. \\ $$ Each time the model produces a forecast it takes the first point from the previous test set and appends it to its input, as this is how the model would be used in practice. To demonstrate the input data for the above test sets would be (with an input window size of 3) $$ I_1 = -2,-1,0 \\ I_2 = -1,0,1 \\ I_3 = 0, 1, 2 \\ I_4 = 1,2,3. $$ I compute an accuracy measure for my predictions and get an average accuracy of the model made over the test sets. I would like to compute a confidence interval that tells me how probable it is that the accuracy of my model is within a given range. I have found out that I can do this using bootstrapping but I am dubious as to whether it holds when my test sets are not independent from each other? As I have understood it my data set would be the set of accuracies computed above for each model $A_{1:5}$ . I can estimate the distribution $\delta$ of these accuracies by generating many samples using sample with replacement and using the following equation $$\delta^*=\bar{x}^*-\bar{x}.$$ I repeat this many times in order to achieve a high precision and then simply order the results $\delta$ s and select the quantiles I am interested in, let's say 0.1 and 0.9 to get an 80% confidence interval. I would be comfortable doing this if my test sets were not overlapping and therefore independent: $$ T_1=1,2 \\ T_2=3,4 $$ Here we have to lose the last point as it doesn't fit into our forecasting horizon. I would be fine with bootstrapping to compute a confidence interval if my test sets were as described just here. I am not certain I can do this if they overlap as described initially. Can I? If I cannot and it is not always possible for me to generate independent test sets, due to lack of available data is it still possible to compute a confidence interval using another method? Is there a minimum number of data points my empirical distribution has to have in order for it to be a valid approximation of the true distribution? For example if I had only enough data points to have one test set, then the empirical data distribution can only ever be that one number, so there would be no point in bootstrapping?
