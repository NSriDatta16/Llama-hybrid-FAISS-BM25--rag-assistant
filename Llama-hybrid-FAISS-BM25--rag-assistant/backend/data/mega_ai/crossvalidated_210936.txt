A convolutional neural network learns certain features in images that are useful for classifying the image. Sharing parameters gives the network the ability to look for a given feature everywhere in the image, rather than in just a certain area. This is extremely useful when the object of interest could be anywhere in the image. Relaxing the parameter sharing allows the network to look for a given feature only in a specific area. For example, if your training data is of faces that are centered, you could end up with a network that looks for eyes, nose, and mouth in the center of the image, a curve towards the top, and shoulders towards the bottom. It is uncommon to have training data where useful features will usually always be in the same area, so this is not seen often.
