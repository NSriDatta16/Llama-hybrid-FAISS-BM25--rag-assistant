This often happens when internally some of the results were invalid, like logarithms of non-positive numbers. In my experience, I have found fitdistr to be very "fragile". Sometimes you will still get results, other times (often with gammas) fitdistr just fails. You are almost always better off writing a small function to return the negative loglikelihood, and passing it directly into optim using Nelder-Mead (to dispense with calculating derivatives, although deriv3 often works).
