Why is my list-style-image not showing up?

I'm building out this landing page and after the second paragraph I have a list of points to which I have applied a list-style-image to the li.actionItem, however I'm getting the default disc instead of my images. I know the url is working because a) I wrote it in absolute form, b) if you enter that absolute url you get the image (see here) and c) I tried applying the icon instead as a background image with some padding for the text and that works. I can just do that in the end if I have to (the background image with padding version) but I would prefer to write it as a list-style-image. Plus it's just driving me crazy why it won't show up that way and I'd like to know. Any thoughts or tips?? Thank you! Here's the relevant markup at a glance... performed more than 500 surgeries set more than 3,000 fractured bones mobilized more than 90 volunteers to Haiti sent pastors from our DR hospital to minister to the victims ul#introPoints { list-style-image:url (http://blog.helpcurenow.org/images/campaigns/jan2010/haiticrisis/arrow-green-distress.gif); list-style-type:disc; } li.actionItem { font-family:"Trebuchet MS", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#6e5e4c; font-size:14px; text-align:justify; width:580px; font-style:italic; margin:10px 0px 10px 20px; text-indent:15px; } li.actionItem strong { color:#dd7439; }
