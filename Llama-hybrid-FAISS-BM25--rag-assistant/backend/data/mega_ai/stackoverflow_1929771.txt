I would look into your memory usage, rather than trying to retrieve all the responders. Either look into instruments http://www.mobileorchard.com/find-iphone-memory-leaks-a-leaks-tool-tutorial/ or conversely, just throw in a few NSLog(@"responded"); into your touchesBegan methods and see if it gets logged like ten times for each touch.
