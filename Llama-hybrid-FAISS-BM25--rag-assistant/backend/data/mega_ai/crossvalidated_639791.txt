I'm wondering if the MLE of such a logistic regression is statistically valid Yes, its valid. There is no requirement that the regressors be continuous. If valid, how can I interpet the estimation results? Each coefficient is the log odds ratio. A covariate vector of all zeros defines the baseline or reference group. The exponential of the coefficient, $\exp(\beta_j)$ then describes the factor by which the odds of the outcome changes for the group defined by the covariate vector $x$ such that $x_j = 1$ and $x_i =0 \forall i \neq j$ .
