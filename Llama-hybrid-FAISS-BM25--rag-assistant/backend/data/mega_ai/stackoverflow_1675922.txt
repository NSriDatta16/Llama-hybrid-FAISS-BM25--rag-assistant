Get a couple copies of "Head First Design Patterns" and ask folks to read it. It's a fun way to learn about patterns. I teach a Design Patterns course for the Johns Hopkins Engineering Program for Professionals (evening Masters degree program), and regularly hold brown-bag lunches at work to talk about patterns. I'd recommend holding a one-hour brownbag lunch once or twice a month. Talk about the concept of the pattern and show some programming examples. Every lecture I talk about the Golden Hammer -- learn how to use each pattern and LOCK them in your toolbox until you need them! My favorite technique is what I call "Pattern Theatre". Each of my students researches a pattern and writes a 2-3 page script that uses the pattern in the real-world. For example, I present a theatre about Paul Revere's ride to describe Observer. (Robert Newman see the British and lights lamps; Paul Revere sees the lamps and starts riding and yelling; some townsfolk hear him and hide; some townsfolk hear him and grab their guns - discrete stimulus/response pairs) Nothing in the theatres mention programming; they're all about getting the concepts down before I start the programming part of the lecture.
