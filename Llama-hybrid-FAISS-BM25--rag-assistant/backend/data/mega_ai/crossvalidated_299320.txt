Do you have reason to believe that it is in fact an outlier? You say that you intentionally measured it as such to check if there was an apparent change in the response - which there does not seem to be. In general, I oppose ever removing outliers if you cannot directly explain that it in fact must be an outlier (e.g. an age of 200 years, a negative pulse or what have you). The data that you have observed is your basis for drawing inference. Can you reasonably remove any part of this basis and still believe that you are getting the full picture? However , in cases such as this there is an obvious problem with the range of data. You have a huge gap between the left cluster and the right-most point, so any inference drawn in this range is pure guess-work. This makes, as Michael M says, the right point a high-leverage point, pretty much forcing any regression line directly through this point. And for that reason I'd probably exclude this point and simply state the range that you believe your analysis to be reasonable in. Ideally though you should repeat your experiment but take more measurements and distribute them more evenly (so to avoid the above case). That's my two cents at least.
