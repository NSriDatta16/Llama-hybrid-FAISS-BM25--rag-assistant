Performance: Need to read from LONGTEXT

I'm building a CMS-type webapp that allows users to enter arbitrary-sized blocks of HTML. These blocks are entered by the user in their admin area and inserted into their template of choice when a page is delivered. I'm guessing a user is not going to add more than 50-100 blocks and I'm not going to be getting more than 1000 users any time soon. I was planning on using mySQL's LONGTEXT type to store these but I'm wondering if storing files in a directory will be more performant as the Linux OS will cache them? Given that I'm building for at most (1000 * 100) text blocks is there any reasonable performance worry with using mySQL? Obviously I will be caching the HTML before delivery so I won't be reading these blocks on every delivery - reads will only occur when someone updates/creates new content. I could use memcached/other cache/noSQL implementation or some other storage mechanism but I'm focusing on keeping it simple and delivering ASAP so don't want to introduce other stuff that I don't have experience with unless there's a significant performance worry.
