I suspect you don't want to do what you are asking, but you can do it. Take the hash key/values and flatten them to an array @foo = (%foo) . MD5 the array to get an ID code - use md5_base64(@foo) if you want it to be 7bit (human readable). Remember that hashes are not ordered, so you need sort @foo the array if you want it to be repeatable. In code, something like: use Digest::MD5 qw(md5_base64); my $foo = { api => POST, username => sganesh, pass => "pass", message => "hai", time => "current_time", }; my $id = md5_base64(sort %$foo); # in my case eRR9QzGN1n+nIl1TDmclEA To be honest, I think you are better off generating a unique random ID (a token) and giving it to the client to return to you, but then from your question, I don't know your motivation.
