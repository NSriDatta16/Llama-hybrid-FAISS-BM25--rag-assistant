How do I choose a laptop if I'm interested in learning and applying data science?

I just got started with learning data science, and I was wondering what type of laptop I'd need to buy. I understand that this might come probably a little too early -- but my current laptop absolutely needs to be replaced and I don't want to buy a new laptop only to find out about a year later that I can't apply what I've learnt. So, what are the minimum specs I should be looking out for? I've read about Amazon's AWS that allows us to create and access virtual machines using the cloud -- is that a good idea, especially considering that I'm only starting out? I won't be using a laptop for any other intensive activities such as gaming or video-editing. Should I get a high-end laptop or stick to a basic model and just use cloud based services for my data science needs? If the latter (buying a basic model) is a better choice, does that also need certain basic hardware requirements?
