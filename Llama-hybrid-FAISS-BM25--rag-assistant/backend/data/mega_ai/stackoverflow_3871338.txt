How to create a PDF which, when printed, will have each page sent to another tray/printer?

our application is a Java webbased application which is used by a number of different organizations and which we host ourselves. I'm currently struggling with the described issue. In our application we have a mass printing functionality that spits out PDF file's, generated by Apache FOP, which the user can then print. The problem is that sometimes some of those pages need to be printed in one printer(or a tray of one printer), the second one somewhere else and the third page in the same printer/tray as the first one. My original intent was to use Adobe Javascript because it seems that it allows for a per-page printer selection(unfortunately no tray selection which is currently not supported). I could then solve the tray selection by selecting different printers who each have a different default tray. The last part is the problem: So my question is, does someone know how, or if it's possible, to create network printers with default trays? This would also mean that a network printer needs to be able to have multiple IPs, each with a different setting. PS: When writing this, I realized it may be more of a sysadmin type of question. However, considering this problem is programming related I think it's belongs here.
