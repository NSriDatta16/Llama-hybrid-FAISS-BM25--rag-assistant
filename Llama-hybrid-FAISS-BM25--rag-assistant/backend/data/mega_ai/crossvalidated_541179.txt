For instance, if we try to estimate linear regression model, we then check an assumption of an absence of autocorrelation (particular, in time series). We use, at first, covariance matrix between residuals with zero non diagonal elements. Then we use Newey West matrix with consistent estimates and compare this matrix to the previous (also, you could use tests to detect). So, according to the theory, yes, this matrix exists, but in practice, we always get nonzero values (maybe, small, e.g. 1e-5) on non diagonal elements.
