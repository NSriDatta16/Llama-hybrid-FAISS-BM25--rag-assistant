If the parent li has position: relative , you can position things absolutely inside it without messing with the way the parent floats around. Another, somewhat inelegant solution would be to add an onclick event to each of the parent li s, and use JavaScript to change the URL. Also, add cursor: pointer to your CSS to make it look like a link. But as I said, this is not elegant.
