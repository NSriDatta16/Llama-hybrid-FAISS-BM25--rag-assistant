What tools do you use to faciliate Continuous Integration (CI)?

Assuming you're doing CI , the title really says it all: What tools do you use? In our case we're a .NET development shop, and are using Enterprise Cruise Subversion NAnt However we're hitting some performance issues with Subversion and the number of Cruise build agents & pipelines we're running, so are looking at using Git in the back-end to alleviate this. However the Windows version of Git is giving us problems (seems a little too "beta") so we think we need to go with the Linux version. Downside of this is that it is further increasing the skillset required of anyone who's going to administer this setup. So, what tool(s) do you use for your version control and automated build/deployment? Please also mention what your development platform is.
