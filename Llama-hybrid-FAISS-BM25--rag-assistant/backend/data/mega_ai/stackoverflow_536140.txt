As an experienced translator between Japanese and English, I can say that this is extremely difficult to quantify, but typically in my experience English text translated from Japanese is nearly 200% as many characters as the source text. In Japanese there are many culturally specific phrases and nouns that can't be translated literally and need to be explained in English. When translating it is not unusual for me to take a single Japanese sentence and to make a single English paragraph out of it in order for the meaning to be communicated to the reader. Off the top of my here is an example: 「懐かしい」 This literally means nostalgic. However, in Japanese it can be used as a single phrase in an exclamation. Yet, in English in order to convey a feeling of nostalgia we require a lot more context. For instance, you may need to turn that single phrase into a sentence: "As I walked by my old elementary school, I was flooded with memories of the past." This is why machine translation between Japanese and English is impossible.
