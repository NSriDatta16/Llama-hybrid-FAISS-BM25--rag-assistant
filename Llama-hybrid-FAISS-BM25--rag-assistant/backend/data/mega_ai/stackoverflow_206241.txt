One way I've seen work very well is using a gantt chart: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart You can create a single line chart and then you can scale it across months, days, hours and minutes depending on how wide or zoomed in you make the control. The problem is I don't know of any control out there right now that does just one line, so you may need to create a custom one. You could possibly look for a gantt chart control and just do one task/item.
