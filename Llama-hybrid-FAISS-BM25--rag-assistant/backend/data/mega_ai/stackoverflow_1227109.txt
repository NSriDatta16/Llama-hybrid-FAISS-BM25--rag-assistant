Setting a browser's media type

This sounds like a stupid question (to me), but I've searched and I can't find anywhere that seems to talk about it. Where is the media type for an agent set - is it hard-coded by the browser (or whatever) or is this configurable (specifically, IE)? I ask because I am writing a web app that will be mostly used by normal PCs, but there will be some netbooks using it too. However these netbooks will be running XP, and that seems to be detected as a normal windows browser, however for certain pages I want them to use different CSS (mainly for larger font types), so I was hoping to set them up to be handheld devices and then hit that on my CSS for the appropriate pages (the users that have them will also log on from normal PCs, so detecting type by user isn't an option). Or is there a better/more correct way of doing this?
