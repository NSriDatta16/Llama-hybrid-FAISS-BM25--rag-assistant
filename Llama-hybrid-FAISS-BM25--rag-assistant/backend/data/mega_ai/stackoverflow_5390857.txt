The layout you are proposing to use is pretty much how most of the projects are organised. And its a very well organised way of having a project. I usually also have a docs folder wherein goes all the documentation about the project. So heres my usual project setup. Project - lib //Library output folder bin //Executable output folder src //All cpp source files include //All header files test //All tests docs //All project documentation ------> new addition
