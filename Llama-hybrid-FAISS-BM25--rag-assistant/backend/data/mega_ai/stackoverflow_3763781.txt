Remember Previous Output in a Random Array

I have an application with the following code listed below that displays random questions for the end user. I am trying to figure out how to have a user be able to go navigate backwards in an array that is displayed randomly. For instance, a user is going through the questions and accidentally advances past one and wants to go back, I want them to be able to just simply hit a back button. Could you provide any guidance on how to do this? Thank you very much!!! - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { myArray5= [NSArray arrayWithObjects: @"Question 1", @"Question 2", @"Question 3", @"Question 4", nil]; int chosen = arc4random() % [myArray5 count]; NSString *item = [myArray5 objectAtIndex: chosen]; label3.text = [NSString stringWithFormat: @"%@", item]; label3.alpha = 0; label3.transform = CGAffineTransformIdentity; [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:NULL]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:1.0]; label3.alpha = 1; label3.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(1, 1); [UIView commitAnimations]; UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; if (touch.tapCount == 2) { } }
