Dataframe request with groupBy

I'm a beginner in Spark and I want to calculate the average of number per name. I have a JSON file with this information df = spark.read.json("myjson.json") df.select(avg(df["number"]), df["name"]).groupBy("name").show() But I'm doing it wrong.. How can I solve my problem? Thanks a lot
