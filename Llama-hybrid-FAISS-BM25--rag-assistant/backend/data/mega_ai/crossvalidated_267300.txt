residuals for proportion prediction

There is something I am not sure about. If the random variable I'm modelling/predicitng is a 'proportion' (therefore between 0 and 1). So say $X \sim Beta(\alpha, \beta)$. Now if I want to evaluate my model, do I evaluate it as any other Bayesian regression model (using Standardised Pearson residuals)? So I guess my question is if Standardised Pearson residuals are invariant to the range of the value that we are predicting (if say its between [0,1] or [-100,100])?
