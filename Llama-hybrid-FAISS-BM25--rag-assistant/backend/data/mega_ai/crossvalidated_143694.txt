Data stratification for long-tailed distributions

I'm encountering a few problems successfully stratifying a dataset that is long-tailed to the right. In my research, I came across this excellent response: Sampling from a long tailed distribution which helped clarify a few things. However, before I dive into the specifics of doing complex data surveys, I have a few questions... Thus far, I've tried stratifying my data set of about 8000 observations into 14 strata. This left me several strata with no counts and several with less than ten. Reducing the number of strata (until each stratum had at least one observation) left me with only three strata in the end. Log-transforming the data (log10(1+n)) helped increase the available strata to eight. Running my analysis on this (log-transformed) case proved valuable. However, of the eight strata which resulted, two only had one observation, and two others had fewer than ten: Stratum Count 1 3 2 1 3 541 4 4909 5 379 6 40 7 6 8 1 So, my question is, would it be reasonable to combine the least-populated strata until each meets a minimum count (like 10)? Looking at this data, I'd be inclined to combine strata 1, 2, and 3, as well as 6, 7, and 8. That leaves me with only 4 strata, which seems too few. Perhaps I could split the most-populated into two? I realize this changes the shape of the distribution, but it still seems to be a reasonable representation. Of course, this is the entire dataset, from which I would proportionally choose subsets of data for analysis... I'm using this in a neural network application to predict costs of contracted work. The "cost" represents material, labor, and equipment costs which contribute to the overall value. At this point, I'm using data stratification to help improve model accuracy before going after more data / features. The model predictions are based on a fixed success criterion (e.g., predictions should be within 15% of target values), which improved significantly even with my modest attempt at stratification. I'd like to take the work here to other contracted types of work, so, obviously, I'd rather not have to extensively tweak each model for each type of work (there are several hundred)...
