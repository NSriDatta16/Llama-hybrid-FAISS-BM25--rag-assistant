Access Video Across Network?

Has anyone designed a network to deal with video? Scene: 40 Computers will access access a storage point that will hold approx 10TB of data (HD quality video, thats all i know). All 40 computers could be accessing video at the same time all the time. I havent got to much to go on, so sorry I cant pass on more info, but if you were to design a network (best bet) to deal with this much bandwidth, storage, configuration How would you do it, and what would you hardware would you look at, ie Fibre switches? VLAN tagging?
