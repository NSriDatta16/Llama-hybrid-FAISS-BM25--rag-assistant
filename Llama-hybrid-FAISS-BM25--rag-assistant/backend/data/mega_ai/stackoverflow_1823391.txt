Finding a newline not immediately followed by a newline

(in PHP ... ) I'm trying to take a block of text and remove all hard line breaks so it can be re-wrapped to a specific line length using wordwrap(). However, since its possible to have multiple paragraphs, I'm assuming I need a way to remove a single newline, but not two in a row. If this is right, how can I say find \n but not \n\n in a regular expression? Or am I approaching this the wrong way?
