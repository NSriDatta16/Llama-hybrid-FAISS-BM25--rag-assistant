Markov chain with conditions

I have a data that is being modelled through the continuous time Markov chain with discrete state space. The model is simple: only 4 states. However, I have an additional condition imposed on the model: if the subject spends more than 2 years in the second state, then he/she cannot go back to the state 1, only to the states 3 or 4, from which there is no way back to state 1. I could take a very "rude" way and simulate this Markov chain numerically with this additional condition, but I would rather have it solved mathematically. In other words I'm looking for some refereces on the Markov chain case, when after some deterministic time interval, spent in one state, at least on transition rate becomes 0 (in my case transition rate from state 2 to state 1 becomes 0). The main objective is to obtain transition probabilities for various time periods.
