ASP.NET MVC Index vs. Index and List views

I'm developing my first ASP.NET MVC application. This application tracks events, users, donors, etc. for a charitable organization. In my events controller I support standard CRUD operations with New/Edit/Show views (delete is done via a button on Show view). But I also want to list all of the events. Is it better to have a List view that you navigate to from an Index view or have the "List" view be the Index view. The Index view is my default view for the controller. If you keep Index/List separate, what would you put in the Index view? Right now I'm leaning toward keeping them separate and putting basic help information on the Index view. Should I consider changing this and have the List view become the default view and rename Index to Help? TIA for the collective wisdom of SO.
