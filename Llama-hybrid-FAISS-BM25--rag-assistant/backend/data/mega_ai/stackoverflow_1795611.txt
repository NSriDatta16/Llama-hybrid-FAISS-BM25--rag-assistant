must do configurations in tomcat for prod configuration?

Anyone has some pointers/recipe for must/should do configurations for putting a war into production with Tomcat 6.0.20? I understand that it depends on my application, I just want to leverage the communities experience :-) My application will mainly receive webservice requests (CXF and Spring security) store them to DB (JPA/Hibernate) and then send the data received to some 50 subscribing systems via different protocols. I will also run to slightly different versions of the same application (two war-files) under separate contexts. Cheers! Tomas
