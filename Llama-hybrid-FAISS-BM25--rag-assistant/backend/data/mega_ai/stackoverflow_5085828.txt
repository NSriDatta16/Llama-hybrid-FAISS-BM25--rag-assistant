Its not possible because As mentioned in MSDN XML serialization is the process of converting an object's public properties and fields to a serial format (in this case, XML) for storage or transport. But you can use DataContractSerializer. Here is a link to Marc's Answer on SO Serializing private member data Update You can get over that behavior by leaving Auto Implemented properties and have somthing like this: private List _Effects; public Effect() { _Effects= new List (); } public List Effect { get { return _Effects; } }
