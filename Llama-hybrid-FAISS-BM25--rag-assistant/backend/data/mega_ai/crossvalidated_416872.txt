Question regarding notation for F-distribution

Apologies for the basic question; I don't have a very deep or broad background in statistics. I am reading this paper on phase transitions in the existence of maximum likelihood estimators for logistic regression . On page 4, Section 2.1, (The Main Result), it is written: $(Y,V) \sim F_{\beta_\theta \gamma _\theta}$ if $(Y,V) \equiv (Y,YX)$ I don't quite understand this notation (for the first part). My understanding is that $X \sim D(\alpha_1,\alpha_2...)$ means that the random variable X has a distribution D that depends on the parameters alpha. In this case, the F distribution really does exist and generally is written with two parameters: F-distribution . A ratio of two Chi distributed variables normalised by the number of their degrees of freedom. It can also be written as a ratio of normalised normal-distributed variables. I initially interpreted the statement as meaning 'Y and V are drawn from the same F distribution, characterised by the parameters $\beta_\theta , \gamma_\theta$ . However, this can't be right. Y is a Bernoulli random variable (on page 5 in the effective case of $\beta=0$ , "Y is a Rademacher variable". Could someone please help me to understand this notation?
