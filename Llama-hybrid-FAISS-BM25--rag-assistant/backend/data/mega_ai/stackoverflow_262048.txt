A SQL statement, especially a complex one, can actually be executed by the DB engine in any number of different ways (which table in the join to read first, which index to use based on many different parameters, etc). An experienced dba can use hints to encourage the DB engine to choose a particular method when it generates its execution plan. You would only normally need to do this after extensive testing and analysis of the specific queries (because the DB engines are usually pretty darn good at figuring out the optimum execution plan).
