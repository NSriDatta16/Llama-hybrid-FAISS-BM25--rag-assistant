MS SQL Server, multiple insert

Say I write the query: INSERT INTO DestinationTable (ColumnA, ColumnB, ColumnC, etc.) SELECT FROM SourceTable (ColumnA, ColumnB, ColumnC, etc.) And my source table has 22 million rows. SQL server fills up my hard drive, and errors out. Why can't SQL server handle my query? Should I use a cursor and insert a row at a time? PS - it is SQL Express 2005, but I could try on the full version. UPDATE: I also want to mention that my source table only takes up around 1GB of storage when I look at it in the management studio. And yet my 25GB of free disk space somehow gets filled up? I am also using 2 different databases Source.mdf -> Destination.mdf, I don't know if this makes any difference.
