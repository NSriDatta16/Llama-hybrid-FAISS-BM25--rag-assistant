Here's a suggestion, The good people at Vivotech have developed a couple of different installers for both Windows/IIS7 and various flavours of Linux for both Railo and Open BlueDragon. The setup installs Tomcat, Railo/Open Blue Dragon and the necessary connectors to the web server. Here's the link: http://www.viviotech.net/company/installers.cfm I think you'll find using the installers to be a lot easier than working through it yourself. If you want to go that route, Adobe and various bloggers have instructions on how to do it. Matt Woodward has a very good blog posting on it: see MattWoodward.com , He also has a presentation on this, you can see it here . hth, larry
