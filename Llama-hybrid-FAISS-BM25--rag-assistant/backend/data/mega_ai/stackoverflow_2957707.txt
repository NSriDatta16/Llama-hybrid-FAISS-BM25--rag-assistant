You definitly want to avoid NullPointerException problems in your code, so you may want to add a check before calling fetchPage or you may want to add some extra code to the fetchPage method, which I'd prefer anyway. for(int i=0; i is the easiest solution to solve your problem. A more elegant solution is to implement a new method for checking a citylink row: //... inside some method for(int i=0; i This is what I'd suggest (taking your code from a previous question): public String fetchPage(String url) { try { if (url != null) { // a null value check return URIUtil.encodeQuery(url); } else { return "No URL available"; } } catch (URIException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } Please keep in mind, that in this code each assignment to body replaces its previous content and that body will contain the content of the last valid citylink URL of your list/array.
