For visual tasks, data augmentation can often be accomplished by rotation, scaling, or rearranging patches. These transformations do not necessarily add information, but can be useful for models to learn to generalize better. The generator in a GAN learns a complex distribution from its training data from which you can sample, and you can view these new samples as another type of transformation of the original data, akin to rotation, scaling, etc.
