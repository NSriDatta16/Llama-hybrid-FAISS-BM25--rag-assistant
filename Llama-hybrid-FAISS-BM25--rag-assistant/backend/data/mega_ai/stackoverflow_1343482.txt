You have a few options actually: You could use the CDN for everything (though using the full source locally does give you better error messages). Google has them as well . Dijit is here: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.3.2/dijit/dijit.js FYI. This has many advantages in my opinion. User caching of the JS being the primary one. Build a layered file. I think the O'Reilly book has a section about it but the PragProg book is better in this regard IMO. There's also this doc on dojocampus.org about building. This will trim down the files you need to upload to GAE and speed up your app loading. This is actually what I do in order to cut down on HTTP requests. Keep doing what you are doing. :) Regarding the errors you are seeing about 404 for en-us files are essentially harmless. Here's a better description . You also might be reloading dijit files by using dijit.uncompressed.js and dijit-all.js and causing problems in the process...but I'm not sure about this one.
