Documentation of available Ant tasks for Android?

I just accidentally discovered the ant task for test coverage reports with emma. I'm now looking for a target that only invokes the unit test and generates unit testing output. Is there a list with the available ant targets somewhere, or is it possible to look them up somewhere inside the code of the SDK?
