Difference between logistic regression predictions

I have created two logits using tensorflow for a binary classification problem. The first one is built on one feature "Dose", the second one is built on two features "Dose" & "LogP". Now I am testing these models using a set of 311 molecules. I am getting better AUC on the model built on two features. I want to know which of the molecules went through the biggest change? Should I subtract the probabilities that I received during predictions or should I first take the log of the probabilities and then subtract them? or anything else? Thanks.
