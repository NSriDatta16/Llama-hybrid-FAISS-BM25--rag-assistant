Performance of CNN based deep models with number of classes

How does a given deep cnn model performance vary with number of classes in tasks such as classification, object detection segmentation? For example mobilenet v2 gives around 90% accuracy on classification task using PASCAL VOC; now if we train the same network with just 2 classes (say human and dog) how will it effect accuracy, speed and model size?(say, using tensorflow).Also what will be the case in tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation(in particular)? Can we make the network smaller to learn from the smaller dataset(2 classes) to achieve same or better accuarcy & speed?
