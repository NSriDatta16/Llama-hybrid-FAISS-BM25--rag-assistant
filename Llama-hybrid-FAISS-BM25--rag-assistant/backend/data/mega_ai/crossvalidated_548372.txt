What is the sampling rate of quarterly time series data?

I am doing spectral analysis of quarterly data. I am very new to spectral analysis and have been using Shumway & Stoffer's textbook as a guide, but I am not understanding exactly what is going on. I have quarterly data with a trend and seasonal component: I have removed the increasing trend from my data and calculated the periodogram: detrend Im slightly confused as to how to interpret the periodogram. The frequency axis is in terms of cycles per sampling interval correct? Is the sampling interval a year? So the peak at a frequency of 1 is indicating one cycle per year?
