need to remove a column from a table in a Linq project

I have extensive experience working in ASP.NET and Sql Server but I am new to Linq. I have just inherited a project that was created using Linq. Unfortunately the last developer knew nothing of efficiency and was storing images in the database in a truly terrible way. I have modified the code so that it no longer uses the column that stored the image. Now I want to completely delete that column from the database to keep the Linq queries from wasting time and resources pulling in these huge files. I searched my project for every reference to the column and removed it, then deleted the column from the database (don't worry, I have plenty of backups of everything). When I did this I began to get error messages about an invalid column name for the column I deleted. So my question is, how the heck do you modify the structure of a table when using Linq?
