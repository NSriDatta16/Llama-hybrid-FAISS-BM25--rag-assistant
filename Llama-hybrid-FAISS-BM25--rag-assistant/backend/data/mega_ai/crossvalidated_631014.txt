What is the point of finding the best matching unit in a self organizing map?

During the update step while training a self organizing map, the best matching unit for a particular input is found, then that BMU (and to a lesser degree it’s neighborhood) is perturbed to better match the input. If we are using a Euclidian distance metric to find the neighborhood and update weights, is there a point to finding the best matching unit? In other words, we can find distribution of units which match the input best by a Euclidean distance of all the units weights, and update the system accordingly, without the extra step of finding the BMU. Why isn’t that standard?
