Here are some links which may interest you comparing frequentist and Bayesian methods: http://www.stat.ufl.edu/archived/casella/Talks/BayesRefresher.pdf Archived here: https://web.archive.org/web/20140308021414/https://stat.ufl.edu/archived/casella/Talks/BayesRefresher.pdf http://www.bayesian-inference.com/advantagesbayesian http://www.researchgate.net/post/Bayesian_vs_frequentist_statistics2 In a nutshell, the way I have understood it, given a specific set of data, the frequentist believes that there is a true, underlying distribution from which said data was generated. The inability to get the exact parameters is a function of finite sample size. The Bayesian, on the other hand, think that we start with some assumption about the parameters (even if unknowingly) and use the data to refine our opinion about those parameters. Both are trying to develop a model which can explain the observations and make predictions; the difference is in the assumptions (both actual and philosophical). As a pithy, non-rigorous, statement, one can say the frequentist believes that the parameters are fixed and the data is random; the Bayesian believes the data is fixed and the parameters are random. Which is better or preferable? To answer that you have to dig in and realize just what assumptions each entails (e.g. are parameters asymptotically normal?).
