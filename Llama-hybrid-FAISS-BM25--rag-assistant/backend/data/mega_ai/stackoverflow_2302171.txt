Editing the raw HTML inside a TinyMCE control

I have a Django website in which I use django-tinymce to edit HTML fields with a TinyMCE control. TinyMCE practically gives me a WYSIWYG way to edit HTML. My question is, can I get access to edit the underlying HTML directly? I was thinking, maybe there's some button I can enbale which will toggle between "WYSIWYG mode" and "raw html mode" in TinyMCE. Is there one? If not, is there any elegant way to edit the HTML?
