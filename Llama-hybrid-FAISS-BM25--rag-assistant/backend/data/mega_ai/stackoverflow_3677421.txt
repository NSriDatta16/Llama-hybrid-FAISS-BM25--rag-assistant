There are two probable explanations for what's happening: The server looks at the user agent and decides not to include this line. This is the less likely of the two, but wget allows you to change the user agent string, so you should be able to work around it easily. The long line is constructed on the client, using JavaScript. This is far more likely, but unfortunately for you, not easy to replicate in a command-line environment. To verify, use a tool such as Fiddler to look at what's actually coming over the wire.
