JSTREE, exact move position

I want to show an explicit tooltip while drag-drop tree node inside treeview. example: "Node 1 will be moved before/after/inside Node 2" From move_node callback argument, we can get the position ("before/after/inside") but not from check_move callback (neither from prepare_move). Tooltip should be displayed while drag-droping, so move_node is too late. The same problem when drag-drop external object to treeview, the drag_check callback from dnd plugin has no information about the position (we just know the target node but not if it is before, after or inside). In that case, even for drag_finish callback we don't have the information. Is there somebody who can help me solving this issue ?
