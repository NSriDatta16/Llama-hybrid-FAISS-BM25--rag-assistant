Note that $\nu$-SVM and $C$-SVM are equivalent (at least for balanced problems). Performing a grid-search over $C$ should be more than sufficient. Also, generally $C$-SVM is more efficient to solve (note e.g. for $\nu$-SVM in libSVM that the initial starting point will tend to set many non-support vectors to have bound $\alpha_i$, thus loading large parts of the kernel matrix that you may not need).
