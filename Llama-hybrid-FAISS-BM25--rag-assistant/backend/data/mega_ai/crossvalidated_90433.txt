1.) You can fit multilevel (mixed) models in various ways. Restricted Maximum likelihood or bayesian are the most popular ones. I would recommend MCMC (bayesian) when the data set is small or you need many random or cross Level effects. E.g. check the MCMCglmm packages in R for Multilevel with MCMC. 2.) No, there are other models using hierarchical bayes which are not truly multilevel models.
