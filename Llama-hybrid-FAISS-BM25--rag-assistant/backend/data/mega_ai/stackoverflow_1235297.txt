Actually, asking any busy project team to include in their schedule time for making their software suitable for adoption by another team is extremely hard in my experience. Doing extra work for the public good is a big ask. I've seen a common pattern of "harvesting" after the project is complete, reflecting that immediate coding for reuse tends to get lost in the urgency of the day. The only avenue I can think of is if the reuse is within an organisation with a budget for a "hunter gatherer", someone whose reason for being there is IT. You may be on more of a win for things such as unit tests because they have immediate payback for the development.
