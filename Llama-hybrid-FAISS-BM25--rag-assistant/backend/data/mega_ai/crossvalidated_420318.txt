I don't know exactly what models you are working on, however I don't think this is strictly necessary for a general answer. How are you estimating the GLM? Are you using Maximum likelihood? If so, why you should not use Akaike's (same story for LR test)? A couple of links pointing to this may be of some help link 1 link 2 Edited: If your aim is to test the joint significance of the two independent variables (i.e. to test whether your model as a whole is significant or not), then I would use a Wald test link wald or a LR test where you restrict both the variables to be 0 and compare the restricted model to the model with both variablkes left inside. If instead your ambition is to define whether to use 1 or 2 variables for the model and which variables then use a specification crierion or info criteria (different IC may give different answers as they impose a different penalty function on the number of parameters Akaike's link , Bayesian link , Hannan-Quinn link )
