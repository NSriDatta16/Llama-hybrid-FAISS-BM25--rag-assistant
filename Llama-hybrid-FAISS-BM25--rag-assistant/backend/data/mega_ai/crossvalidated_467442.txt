Product of Two Conditional Probabilities

Suppose we have $\Pr(A|B)\Pr(B|C) = ?$ I've tried expanding this out: $\Pr(A|B)\Pr(B|C)=\frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} \cdot \frac{\Pr(B \cap C)}{\Pr(C)}$ But can't seem to simplify any further. Does this simplify, or is this as nice as it gets? My initial thought was that $\Pr(A|B)\Pr(B|C) = \Pr(A,B|C)$ but this is wrong after simple counter example. The reason I ask is I am trying to understand some of Bayesian analysis. Namely, when we integrate out the prior parameter to arrive at the posterior: $ \int_\Omega f(x|z)f(z|y) \, dz = f(x|y)$ where I am wondering if the term under the integral will simplify to a joint density of some kind.
