It kind of depends on what sorts of analysis you are going to be doing on these stats. If you are going to be doing a lot of different operations (averaging, summing, joining...) you may find NoSQL solutions to be more of a pain then they are worth. However, if you are storing stats mostly for a display purpose, or for very specific analysis routines, NoSQL solutions start to shine. If your data is small enough, stick with a SQL solution, which will give the benefit of a full query engine to work with, but if you have lots of values (one value a day is nothing, even if you were running for a million years), and are worried about storage size and performance, NoSQL options once again may be worth it. If your data is semi-structured, take a look at CouchDB, which offers some rudimentary indexing and querying support, which could provide some basis for analysis routines. If you are storing individual values with very little structure, my best advice would be to take a look at Tokyo Cabinet and Tokyo Tyrant, which are absolutely incredible options for key-value storage.
