MySQL Storing "Generic" Data (Can be very long or very short)

ok i am developing a quiz ... the question's options ... so i am wondering what can i use for options that can both be very long (eg. Long paragraph of text/code) or very short (eg. boolean) if i use whether i use VARCHAR(65535) or TEXT i only use the space i need right, L chars + 1 or 2 bytes vs L chars + 2 bytes? any speed differences? or any other concerns? what other ways might i work around this - options that maybe very long or very short that maybe supposed to ideally use different data types
