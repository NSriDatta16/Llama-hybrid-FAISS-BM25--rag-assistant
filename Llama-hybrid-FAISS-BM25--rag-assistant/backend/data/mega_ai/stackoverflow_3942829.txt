With UDP there's actually only the receive socket buffer . While there is SO_SNDBUF socket option, the value supplied is just the upper limit for the datagram size. The outbound datagram is either given to the hardware in whole, or in fragments (if it's bigger then the MTU), or discarded. The hardware usually have some ring buffers, but that really has to do with DMA and of no concern to userland apps. The most straightforward technique for packet queueing in the application is, again, a circular buffer - make it large enough for normal usage, lose some packets during heavy spikes. Surely there are other approaches.
