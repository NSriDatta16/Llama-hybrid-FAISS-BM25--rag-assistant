Visualization of fully-connected neural networks

I'm trying to visualize a neural network built by keras with the following structure where all three Dense layers include a bias term. I found this tool to visualize neural networks: NN SVG . When I selected Show Bias Units , I got this result: However, I think the following visualization should be the correct one since the plot created by NN SVG does not include the bias term of the first Dense layer. Currently I'm confused with the difference between the two visualization plots. Can someone knidly explain it to me?
