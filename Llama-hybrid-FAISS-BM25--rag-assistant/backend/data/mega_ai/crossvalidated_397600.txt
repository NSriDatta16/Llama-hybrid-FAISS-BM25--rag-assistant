If your dependent variable is dichotomous, you should use the binary logistic regression. Regarding the independent variables to use, you can use both categorical and quantitative variables. However, regarding the independent variables, you should check for outliers and avoid using collinear variables (variables strongly related with each other). In SPSS, don't forget to mark as categorical the corresponding variables.
