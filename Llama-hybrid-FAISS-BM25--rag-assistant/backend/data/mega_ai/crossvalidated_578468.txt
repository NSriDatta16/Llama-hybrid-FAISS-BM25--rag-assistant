Events per time given time that an event takes to happen

In a book I read this affirmation: "Hard disks are reported as having a mean time to failure (MTTF) of about 10 to 50 years [5, 6]. Thus, on a storage cluster with 10,000 disks, we should expect on average one disk to die per day." I couldn't think how could we estimate the daily disks that die per day with only what I assume to be a confidence interval for the mean of disk duration. Is some information missing(and why)? And, with all the necessary information, how could we estimate the number of disks dying per day?
