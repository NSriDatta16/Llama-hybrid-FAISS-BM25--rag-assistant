Unfortunately, there is no direct way to get such information with SVMs, in contrast to, for example, logistic regression. If you want, you can estimate the contribution of a single predictor ad hoc by training a model on all predictors except that specific predictor. The difference in performance between that model and the one with all predictors may then be considered the marginal contribution of that predictor. If time permits, you can perform this procedure for all predictors.
