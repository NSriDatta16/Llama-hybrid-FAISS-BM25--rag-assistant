What is the frequentist take on the voltmeter story?

What is the frequentist take on the voltmeter story and its variations? The idea behind it is that a statistical analysis that appeals to hypothetical events would have to be revised if it was later learned that those hypothetical events could not have taken place as assumed. The version of the story on Wikipedia is provided below. An engineer draws a random sample of electron tubes and measures their voltage. The measurements range from 75 to 99 volts. A statistician computes the sample mean and a confidence interval for the true mean. Later the statistician discovers that the voltmeter reads only as far as 100, so the population appears to be 'censored'. This necessitates a new analysis, if the statistician is orthodox. However, the engineer says he has another meter reading to 1000 volts, which he would have used if any voltage had been over 100. This is a relief to the statistician, because it means the population was effectively uncensored after all. But, the next day the engineer informs the statistician that this second meter was not working at the time of the measuring. The statistician ascertains that the engineer would not have held up the measurements until the meter was fixed, and informs him that new measurements are required. The engineer is astounded. "Next you'll be asking about my oscilloscope". The story is obviously meant to be silly but it's not clear to me what liberties are being taken with the methodology it pokes fun at. I'm sure in this case a busy applied statistician wouldn't worry over this but what about a hardcore academic frequentist? Using a dogmatic frequentist approach, would we need to repeat the experiment? Could we draw any conclusions from the already available data? To also address the more general point made by the story, if we want to make use of the data we already have, could the needed revision of hypothetical outcomes be made to fit in the frequentist framework?
