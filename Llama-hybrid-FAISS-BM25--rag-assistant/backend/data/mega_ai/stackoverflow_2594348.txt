Display same webpage on many screens

I have a website with live stats that I wish to display to every agent (150) in a call centre. The agent application is windows forms and so the obvious way would be to host a WebBrowser control and simply point it to the site. However the site is not mine, and the site owner is understandably nervous about a site going from very little traffic to a constant stream of 150 (and this number is continually growing) users. Is there a way to cache the site and then display the results to each user? The site uses AJAX to update which scuppers my initial plan of using HttpWebRequest to save a copy of the page every 5 seconds and then have the app look at this.
