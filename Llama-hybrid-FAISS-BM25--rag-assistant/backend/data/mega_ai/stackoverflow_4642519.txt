Have you tried checking to see if it's a backface culling issue? Check it by changing the glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE) to glDisable , just to check it's definitely not that. It can be possible to have both winding orders on the same mesh, so culling can be right for one part of the model but wrong for another - it's easiest just to disable it to be sure that's not the issue. It's either that or your surface may have been created without a depth buffer for some reason? Check the EGLConfig parameter to be sure that's not the case. Usually it would be created with a depth buffer by default, but it's possible to override that behaviour. Also modelling things with internal faces which will never be seen is not going to do good things for your realtime performance. You should consider using a boolean 'or' operation in blender at least to get rid of the internal faces but ultimately it's best to craft your models with lots of care and attention to their topology, not just for poly count but also for how well they fit together into a triangle strip (that doesn't excuse the issue you're getting right now - that's just a note for the future)
