Firefox and everything but IE uses the Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface (NPAPI) for Flash. Firefox (et al.) use the param elements but IE reads from the attributes. It's annoying specifying everything twice but that's what you have to do unless you're using something like swfobject that does it for you (highly recommended) . Updated based on using swfobject: Sounds like you're essentially trying to reimplement swfobject.embedSWF Using jQuery.clone . I'm sure it could be made to work but I suggest you stick to swfobject for Flash embedding and jQuery for the DOM. I'd use the following structure: function embedAudioPlayer(replaceElemIdStr, audioFile) { // customize these options for the audio player you're using swfobject.embedSWF( "yourplayer.swf", replaceElemIdStr, width, height, "9.0.115", "expressInstall.swf", { soundFile = audioFile }); } $("select[name='variation3']").live('change', function() { // ... var audioFile = path + $(this).find(':selected').val() + '.mp3'; var uniqueId = 'audio-' + +new Date; player.replaceWith(' '); embedAudioPlayer(uniqueId, audioFile); }); Create a embedAudioPlayer function and use it for everything both at initial page load and in response to page events. When responding to page events use jQuery to determine the soundFile url and the destination element where a new audio player should be created.
