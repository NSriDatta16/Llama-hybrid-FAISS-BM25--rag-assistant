Based on your model The coefficient for severe is the log odds ratio for severe condition versus not severe for the same time and drug. The coefficient for drug is the log odds ratio between the two drugs for the same severity and at time 0. The coefficient for time is the log odds ratio for a unit increase of the time variable for the same severity and for the old drug. The coefficient for drug:time is the difference between the log odds ratios for a unit increase of the time variable of the new and the old drug. A couple of other notes: You should be aware of the fact that the interpretation of the fixed-effects coefficients in mixed effects logistic regression is conditional on the random effects; for more info check here . It is better to fit the model using the adaptive Gaussian quadrature rather than the Laplace approximation.
