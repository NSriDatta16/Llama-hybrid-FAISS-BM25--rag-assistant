I think the widget is going to be getting mouse coordinates in the viewport/"view space" coordinate system, which may not make much sense to the controller. I think your widget should convert the co-ordinates of any clicks and drags to world space, then pass them to the controller. Why is this good? Because it avoids your controller needing any special knowledge of the viewport/widget, and so preserves encapulation. If you add more viewports/widgets or maybe even a console or a script that also wants to feed the controller, they can all pass their "instructions" in world space and the controller will function quite happily. Your viewport is already "aware" of "world space" and "view space" or it couldn't have rendered your model.
