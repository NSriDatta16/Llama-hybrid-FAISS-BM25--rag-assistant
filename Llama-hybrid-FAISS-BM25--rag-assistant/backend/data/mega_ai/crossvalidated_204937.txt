Why are standard errors affected by choosing a reference group with a small N?

I am trying to understand why standard errors are negatively affected by choosing a reference category with a small N. Example Model: Logistic regression Outcome: Smoking (Yes vs No) Independent variable: Race (NH White, NH AA, NH Other, Hispanic) Normally, I would choose the reference category with the largest N (in this case NH White), but I am trying to justify why that is an appropriate decision. Any insight is appreciated!
