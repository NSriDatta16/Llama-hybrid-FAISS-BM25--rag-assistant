Organizing Build Output (centrally)?

I have a solution that is building a lot of executables and assemblies which need to be in a specific folder hierarchy to work. Mostly all the .exe files and their accompanying .dll files must be in one folder because the main exe will spawn (via process.start) the other exe files and they will dynamically load assemblies. TS redirects all output to a common folder which works fine. In installation, all th output for the main app will end up in one directory, too. Is there a central way to do so in a solution (with our without UI)? My alternative so far would be to change that in every project which seems - a lot of work and unstable (I have about 30 or so projects so far).
