You seem to have answered the new formulation of your question yourself, in the comments. A primary appeal of Bayesian analysis of an experiment (which is what marketers call an A/B test) is that it lets you answer probabilistic questions about population values, such as "What is the probability that treatment A is better than treatment B?". This works even if you don't have rich prior information about the effects of A and B. (You still need to choose some prior distribution, though, and your choice between various so-called uninformative priors can be surprisingly consequential.) In a frequentist approach, by contrast, the true effects of the treatments are fixed, not random, so it makes no sense to ask about the probability that one is greater than the other.
