Should I report the pseudo $R^2$ value for full or final logistic regression model after removing NA's & running stepwise selection?

I'm working with a logistic regression model in r. model and I'm using DescTools::PseudoR2(model, which="Nagelkerke") to get an estimate of model fit. My dataset has missing values, so if I want to do stepwise selection I have to remove these missing values using na.omit() , but doing so drops 37 out of 187 rows of data. data2 Comparing the two models before using stepwise, I noticed a significant drop in my pseudo $R^2$ value: DescTools::PseudoR2(model, which="Nagelkerke") # 0.6496515 DescTools::PseudoR2(model2, which="Nagelkerke") # 0.4652934 After using model 2 to run a backward step based on AIC, my pseudo $R^2$ drops to around .35, which makes sense with fewer variables. I'm wondering which $R^2$ result I should trust when presenting the model? Could I present the $R^2$ from model 1 and build a model with the variables kept from the step model, but use the non-NA removed data or is this an inflated and disingenuous estimate?
