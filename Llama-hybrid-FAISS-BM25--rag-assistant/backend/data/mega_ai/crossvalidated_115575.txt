Because bagging equalizes influence . This essentially means that the influence of so-called leverage points (points which have a large impact on the overall model) decreases compared to non-bagged models. This is good if the leverage points are bad for the model's performance, which is not always the case. For an example of a leverage point, consider an outlier in least-squares regression. The variance-reduction argument which most people know about does not explain everything as nicely (e.g. in some cases bagging does increase variance).
