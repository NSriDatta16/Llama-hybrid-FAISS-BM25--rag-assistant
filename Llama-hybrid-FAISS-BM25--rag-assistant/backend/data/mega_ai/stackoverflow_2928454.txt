How to customize s:formattedText

I am using for formatting my page.It works fine as expected, but the padding around the text seams to be large. So I applied my own styleClass to this element but it didn't take effect. Firebug shows that the paragraph has styleClass 'seamTextPara'. Where will I be able to find details on the above styleClass and how to customize it?
