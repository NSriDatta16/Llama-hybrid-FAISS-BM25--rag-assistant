If Y is customer demand, than you are observing X=min(Y,1000) due to resource constraints. The actual Y could be larger, but you never observe it. So if you fit a time series model to X, you can set the forecasts to min(F,1000) where F is the forecast from the time series model. I don't think there is a need to do anything more fancy than that.
