If you are running Java Tomcat then you set a few properties on your Connector ( in conf/server.xml ). Specifically you set: compressableMimeType ( what types to compress ) compression ( off | on | ) noCompressionUserAgents ( if you don't want certain agents to receive gzip, list them here ) Here's the tomcat documentation which discusses this: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/http.html
