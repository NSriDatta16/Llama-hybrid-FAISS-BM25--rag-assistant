Final solution: I finally found some workaround that's satisfying for me without doing some extravagant stuff... I had a parent container to which I was dynamically adding some children, and it's height wasn't getting updated. The issue I was having is that neither measuredHeight, nor explicitHeight, nor height, nor unscaledHeight of the parent container were giving me the height I needed when I wanted it. So, I added a listener to the creationComplete of each child. Once the creation complete event is launched, every control of the child is taken into account. At this moment, the measuredHeight of the parent container is set to the expected value. So I just needed to set: parentContainer.height = parentContainer.measuredHeight Thanks again to Flextras who has given some useful information =) Regards.
