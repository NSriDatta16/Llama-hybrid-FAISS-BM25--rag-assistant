Meta analysis across studies with multiple response measures

I'm trying to do a meta analysis across a bunch of bird playback studies. Thanks to help on a previous post here I'm fairly certain I need to use inverse variance weighting (maybe with the 'meta' package in R). These playback studies use different response measures with some overlap. Some studies use 10 response measures while others use one. I have the means and standard errors for each study's response measures. I want to look at if, across birds, these response measures increase along with another variable that I have for each bird. I am unsure where to go from here. It doesn't seem appropriate to average the means and standard errors within each study. I'm also not incredibly familiar with the 'meta' package and can't find resources online detailing how to conduct a meta analysis with data like this. What should be my next step?
