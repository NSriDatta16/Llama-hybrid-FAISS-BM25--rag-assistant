Good implementation of SVM with operator valued kernel

I've already come across the question Vector Valued SVM but the replies doesn't point to SVM with any operator-valued kernel . I understand that svm-struct can solve the same by solving an inference problem, but I'm interested particularly to the SVM implementation with operator-valued kernel. Does any one know existing implementation of the same?
