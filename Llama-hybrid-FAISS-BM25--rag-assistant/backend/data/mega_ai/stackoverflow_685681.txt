For SQL coding standards, your best bet is to search for what others have written. There are several resources containing standards that various people have published. You are unlikely to find one that will completely fit your organization. Plus, some have standards that IMHO are just plain wrong. Your best bet is to read through the documents you find and extract the concepts and rules that make sense and fit your organization. Some standards may be overkill, like how to indent the code. It depends on how strict you want the standards to be. Here are a few examples: http://www.nyx.net/~bwunder/dbChangeControl/standard.htm http://www.SQLAuthority.com http://www.SQLserverPortal.com You'll have to look around at links two and three as I don't have the exact URLs handy. Also checkout the link posted by Mitch Wheat above. These are just some examples, but you'll find more by searching.
