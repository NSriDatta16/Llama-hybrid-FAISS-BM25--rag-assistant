embedded swf auto-zoomed when loaded

I am embedding swf videos of size 1280x800 into an html document, and am trying to scale them down to 800x500. The problem is they are scaling down, but showing at the original size - zoomed in. So in order to see them properly, I have to right click -> show all. I also tried a simpler version: but again, the flash is zoomed in when the page loads. Is there a better way to scale them, or a way to fix the zoom-in issue?
