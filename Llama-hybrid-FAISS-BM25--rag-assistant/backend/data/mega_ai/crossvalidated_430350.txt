Machine Learning - Training/Validation Sets

I have a very general question that I can't seem to get a straight answer on. Machine Learning - I understand how it works - you have your dataset for which you want to answer either a prediction or classification question. For a prediction problem, you want to split your dataset into a training dataset first (usually ~80% of full dataset) and run your regression model on this data and look at a confusion matrix of predicted vs. actual response values to see how well your model predicts. Then, you fit the same model on the validation set (remaining 20% of the full dataset) and construct another confusion matrix to see if the % of correctly predicted responses is close to the % from the training dataset. At this point, let's say you have equal %s. What is the next step? Do you then run your model on the full dataset now that you have confirmed it predicts well with different subsets of your data? Do you just use your training set? Any advice or explanations would be great and very appreciated! Thank you!
