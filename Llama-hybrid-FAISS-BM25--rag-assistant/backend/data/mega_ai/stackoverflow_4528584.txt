I suppose that problem is in line: field.Dispatcher.Invoke You should put this part of code inside try/catch block and catch TargetInvocationException This exception can provide more information what the problem is (pay attention to its InnerException ). P.S. Put the whole body of function inside try/catch block; and catch not only TargetInvocationException but at least System.Exception after it.
