$(colInProcID) is a jQuery object, not a string. You'll need to specify which of the potentially many matches you want. EDIT: Remember that in the browser, while it's true that everything is textual (obviously negating images), what we work with in javascript are objects, such as a div object holding a text span or a paragraph or whatever. So when you grab it with jQuery via a selector, it's now a jQuery object wrapping another object (even if that target object is a string). So, you have to either remove the reference to the jQuery object (by calling a array reference or what have you) or you have to use direct XHTML/XML/HTML inside your call. $('#columnList').append(" " + $(colInProcID) + " "); into var stringToInsert = " sometext "; $('#columnList').append(" " + stringToInsert + " "); or perhaps var stringToInsert = $(colInProcID)[0]; $('#columnList').append(" " + stringToInsert + " "); or someone suggested .get(0) which I think works too. You have to remember the part about anything grabbed with a selector $(colInProcID) or $("#SomeDivToUse") is a jQuery object, not an XML object or a string. Hope this clarified things just a tad, and helped you out.
