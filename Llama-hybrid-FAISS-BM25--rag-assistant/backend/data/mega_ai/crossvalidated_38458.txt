As @Michael said, this would be considered a sample. One additional question is "from what population"? That is harder to say, but this is a problem that bedevils many studies. Often researchers will assume that a sample like this is "almost random" or something like that. What is the population, though? All college students? All students in this particular university? All students taking this type of class? All humans? To consider these two groups as populations would be to say that you aren't interested in generalizing the study at all. This is tricky stuff that often gets little attention.
