Combining forecasts or distributions to form a more accurate one

Suppose you are interested in getting as good an estimate as possible for a random variable $X$ , this could be for example a stock price in the future. You go to see $N$ experts, each gives you a distribution for the value (for simplicity, assume Gaussian so you get the mean $\mu_i$ and standard deviation $\sigma_i$ , $i = 1, ..., N$ ). How do you combine these estimates to form a better one? I believe one can't just average the means, because the accuracy of each estimate is related to the standard deviation.
