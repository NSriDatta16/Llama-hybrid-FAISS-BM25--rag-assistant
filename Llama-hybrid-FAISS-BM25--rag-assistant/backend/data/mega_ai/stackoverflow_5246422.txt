A point that seems not to have been raised yet: In Java (not exclusively though), exiting nested loops will be more elegant with break than having the same condition nested in every level. It will also make the code more maintainable. In addition, it can make the logic of the loop much more simple, because as soon as your come to a breaking condition you can act, rather than continue executing code. This too promotoes modularity within the loop body.
