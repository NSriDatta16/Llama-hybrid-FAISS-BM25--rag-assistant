I assume DB will store data in device's internal storage (versus SDCard). Am I right? By default, yes. Given SQLite DB is just a file, probably the DB size is limited with free internal storage space. Again - Am I right? That would be my guess. Does it vary on a device model basis or OS version basis? On a device model basis. are SharedPreferences saved to the internal storage too? Yes. If yes, then is it the same storage where the DB stores its file? Yes.
