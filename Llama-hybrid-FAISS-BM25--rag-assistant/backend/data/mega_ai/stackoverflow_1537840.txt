The error is raised within the pickle module, so somewhere your DB-Cursor object gets pickled and unpickled (serialized to storage and unserialized to the Python object again). I guess that pyodbc.Cursor does not support pickling. Why should you try to persist the cursor object anyway? Check if you use pickle somewhere in your work chain or if it is used implicitely.
