C# - Entity Framework add new object to ObjectContext

im working with Entity Framework, SQL and C#. i have a Table called Client and other called clients_phone. I have a form with a Xtragrid and using BindingSource I bind the IQueryable to the grid. myBindingSource = new BindingSource(); myBindingSource.DataSource = clients; //Clients it is the IQueryable myBindingSource.DataMember = "clients_phone"; myBindingSource.AllowNew = true; Then, i wan to add a new clients_phone to my client. To do this, i make a New Client() and then add the Phone. clients newclient = objContext.CreateObject (); newclient.clients_phone = newClients_Phone; objContext.AddObject("Clients", newclient); Finally i add the new clients_phone in the ObjectContext, but when i see the Xtrag clients_phone don't show. Any idea of what happens??. Thanks
