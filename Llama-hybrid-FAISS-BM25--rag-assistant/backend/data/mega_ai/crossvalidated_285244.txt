Should I turn a distinct quantitative feature into a dummy variable?

I am attempting to run a logistic regression on a data set. Within this regression, I have a feature that is quantitative in nature, but only contains a definite set of values (three). For example, I have a feature x that contains values 15,20,30 Should I create new dummy variable for each value of the set, effectively turning the measure into a dimension? Or should I keep the feature as a measure, even though it is not continuous? Thanks in advance.
