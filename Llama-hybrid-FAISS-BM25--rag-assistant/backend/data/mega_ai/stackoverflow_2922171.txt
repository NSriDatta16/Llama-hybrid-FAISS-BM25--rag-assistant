ASP.NET Page.Cache versus Page.Application storage for data synchronization?

Both Page.Cache and Page.Application can store an application's "global" data, shared among requests and threads. How should one storage area be chosen over the other considering scenarios of data synchronization in the multi-threaded ASP.NET environment? Looking for best practice and experienced recommendation.
