We have Visual Studio Team System Development Edition at work, and I have Visual Studio Professional at home (I have my own MSDN license). I don't know about load testing, but the two features I miss the most from Team System are the C++ code coverage tools and C++ static analysis. Oh, and I kinda miss the FxCop integration, but that can be worked around. If it weren't so expensive, I'd upgrade my MSDN subscription to include it. If I were setting up my own company, I'd be all over the BizSpark program.
