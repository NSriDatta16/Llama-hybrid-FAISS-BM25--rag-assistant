What is the best approach to tackle stance prediction?

I am working on a task where I need to predict one of the following stances for a tweet: "In favor", "Against", "Neutral", "Not related", and "Yes if". I've been trying to use scikit-learn and transformers for classification, but both seem to produce quite poor results. The problem is that the categories are not usual categories, but rather the attitude of the writer toward a specific topic, which probably should be tackled differently. I think there should be something that works with stances, but I managed to find only sentiment analysis and topic modeling tutorials so far. Is there anything I can take a look at? Any links, models, and advice would be greatly appreciated!
