You're not going to find a pure 3.2 resource because (A) 3.2 is too new and (B) apps for iPhone are still released under the 3.1.3 sdk. Dealing with old reference material is a pain but it is unavoidable in a fast moving business such software. Technically, virtually everything written becomes somewhat obsolete within six months. You have to constantly pay attention to notices of changes and revisions. There is just no way around it. However, the core of the language and API for iPhoneOS hasn't changed radically in 3+ years. The only major shift has been the support for the iPad hardware e.g. popups and that is clearly distinct. In my experience free resources age worse than paid ones for the simple reason that updating a reference to keep it current is tedious and most people who aren't being paid don't have an interest in engaging in that drudgery. If you want relatively current and updated info, you have to pay for it. I recommend O'Reilly's Safari Online to my clients. For cost of a hardcopy book or two a month you can get unlimited access to a huge library. The books publication dates as well as the version they cover are readily available. Many of the books are updated fairly continuously. You have access to articles and video which are even more current. In the end, however, its just a slog. The perfect resource isn't going to fall into your lap. Really, the only way to get only perfectly up to date info is to hire someone experienced enough to know whats new and what's old.
