Manually calculating PCA rotation using original data and PCA projections (scores)

Is there any possibility of calculating PCA rotation similar to R 's prcomp function, by that I mean if I do the following log.ir where ir.pca is a 150 by 4 (row by column) matrix, can I use this information to calculate rotation without using prcomp(log.ir)$rotation ?
