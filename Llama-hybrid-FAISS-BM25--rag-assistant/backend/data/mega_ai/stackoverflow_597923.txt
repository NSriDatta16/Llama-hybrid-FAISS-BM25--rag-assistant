Found the problem. I haven't read all the docs, but there are a lot of them... Anyway, I fixed this by dragging the directory /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator2.2.1.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/MediaPlayer.framework/ into the Frameworks folder in XCode and clicking OK on the import dialog.
