You could use the AVG aggregate: SELECT username, month, AVG(rating) as TheAverage, COUNT(*) as TheCount FROM ratings WHERE month ='Aug' GROUP BY username HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 ORDER BY TheAverage DESC, TheCount DESC Grouping by month is innesessary in MySQL , since your month is filtered and MySQL supports selecting an ungrouped column in a SELECT list of a GROUP BY query (returning a random value within the group).
