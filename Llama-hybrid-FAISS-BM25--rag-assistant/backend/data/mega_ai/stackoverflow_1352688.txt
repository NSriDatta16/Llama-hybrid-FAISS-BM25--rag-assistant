The C++0x concept feature would be a core language feature , whose whole process would be done by the compiler. The Boost Concept Check Library is the almost same feature but written in C++ and macro as a library to simulate some of the feature. It cannot do all that would be required in the final language feature (depending on the final feature definition) but provide some equivalent solutions for template type checking (and other compile time checks). As suggested, as the C++0x concept is a language features, it would allow to provide more elegant semantic and allow compiler to use informations not currently available to the program, allowing more detailed or intelligent errors at compile time (as the concept first purpose is to allow abstract type check in templates).
