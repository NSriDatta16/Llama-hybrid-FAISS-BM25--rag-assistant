what does one Shot learning mean? do they only need one image to train for some new class detection?

Being new to deep learning I am somewhat struggling to grasp the idea of one shot learning. Let us say I have a class to detect which didn't exist in training dataset such as COCO or Image NET. Can I train model for that class using only image or the training set must be large as for YOLO or RCNNs?
