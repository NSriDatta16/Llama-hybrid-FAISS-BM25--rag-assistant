Create random time series with shifts in R

I'm trying to create some random time series with shifts along the series. Some with normal distribution and the others with non-normal distribution (Log normal for example). For both I have to decide: the numbers of the shifts the positions of each shifts the magnitudes of each shifts the length between a shift and another one The data is 130 years length (monthly) with all positive numbers (because I want to simulate natural abundance time series). I hope with a picture you can understand better. I've foun in other questions some methods for example arima.sim . But I do not think that I can put in my shifts.
