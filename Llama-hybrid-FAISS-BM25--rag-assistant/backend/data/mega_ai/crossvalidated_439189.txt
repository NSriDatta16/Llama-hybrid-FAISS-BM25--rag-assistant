Posterior Predictive Check for Hierarchical Logistic Regression Model

I need to apply Posterior Predictive Check (PPC) on Hierarchical Logistic Regression Model (so I have binary outcome) to validate my model (to see goodness of fit of my model). I know that I need to simulate replicated data from the Posterior Predictive Distribution of my model and compute a test statistics ( discrepancy ), so that I can compare that with the one I compute from my observations. If my model is good than the PPD of my data should generate same sample as my observations... I believe, I understood the concept of PPC correctly, but the thing is I am not sure about what test statistics can be selected for Bernoulli distribution. I waiting your recommendations (with reasons if it is possible)with respect to that. I would be much appreciated if you also could help me how to implement the computation of the statistics on Winbugs/OpenBUGS. Thank you all in advance!
