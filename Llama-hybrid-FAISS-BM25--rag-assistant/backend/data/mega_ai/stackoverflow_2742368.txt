dropEvent not being called on custom view in PyQt4?

I'm trying to create a custom QTableView that will respond to drag and drop actions. So far, I have something like the following: from PyQt4.QtCore import * from PyQt4.QtGui import * class FooTableView(QTableView): def __init__(self, parent = None): QTableView.__init__(self, parent) self.setAcceptDrops(True) def dragEnterEvent(self, event): print "dragged!" def dropEvent(self, event): print "dropped!" The problem is that when I drag a file into this view, I see "dragged!" but upon releasing the file over the view, I do not see "dropped!". Is there something else I need to do in order to make this functionality work?
