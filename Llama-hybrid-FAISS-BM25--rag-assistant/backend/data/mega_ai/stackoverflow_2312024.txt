Use a thread-safe connection pool and keep connections thread-specific (don't share connections across threads). I believe the MySQL .NET connection framework comes with one built in. If you use the same connection string for all connections, simply add "pooling=true" to your connection string. ( Source -- there's no hyperlink fragment, so look for "pooling" in the table) The drawback of this approach is that some threads will block until a connection is available. You'll need to account for this in your program structure.
