Based on your comment, I would say just restricting yourself to one encoder might not be a wise choice. There are a lot of different types of encoders out there and each will give you a different level of accuracy/performance. Also XGBoost and CatBoost can be used with any kind of encoder not just OrdinalEncoder . The reason you are getting different result with both the above mentioned models ( CatBoost and XGBoost ), is not only because the model architecture is different , but also because the encoding techniques are different in both the models. Both the models are handling the categorical variables differently. I would suggest that you try different encoding algorithms on both the models and then select your final model. This is the usual way to go when selecting the final model. You try different things and then based on the results, you select the final model. Here is a list of different encoders you can implement in python. Try all these encoders and then select the final model. Cheers!
