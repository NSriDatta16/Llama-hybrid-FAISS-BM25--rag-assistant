Comparing a new value to a time series

I have a time series, of market volume data, in fixed-step time gaps. Given a new value I need a way to compare this new value to the previous vector. In the time series the most recent values, obviously, impact more on what the next value will be than ones before them. So, some method of weighting should be available. I have experimented with first fitting a least-squares function, then using various ways of comparing the function to a new value. However I have found it is too temperamental. As this is being used for finance, and it is automated, it must be more robust. I am thinking on the lines of comparing a weighted mean/variance to the new (squared) distance. I would like this calculated value to be in the range $[0,1]$ as well. If possible. Thanks.
