It looks an interesting project. If I am not wrong, you would like to predict whether a particular user add a specific product into his/her cart (target = 1) or not (target = 0). It's an awesome idea to use Data Science concepts for this project. From my point of view, first of all, you should skim through your data to manually analyse it and try to gather as much hidden data as you can. The more analysis you will do (on e-commerce), the more data you will get. Well, I am not an expert in e-commerce world, but lets say for example the type of day (festival or working day) or the particular user history might be useful for this system. After doing this, you should try to fill up missing data (if you have some data missing) instead of just ignoring those data. Then, you should plot some graph of your data to find how all features are correlated with each other. This might help you to analyse what are the important features. For example, by seeing at the graph, it might be possible that you could see that the sale of the particular product is increasing with the popularity of that product. matplotlib and seaborn are the best libraries to do this. The next and the most important step is to apply the Machine Learning model for the prediction of the target data (yes / no). It is obvious that you will have majority of data with No (y = 0). So, you have imbalanced dataset in your training data. As suggested by your peers, XGBoost will be the best to classify imbalanced data. Now, you should do a minor modification on your data before fitting the model. You can adjust the weights of the target data by putting more weight on (y = 1) class. weights = np.zeros(len(y_train)) weights[y_train == 0] = 5 weights[y_train == 1] = 10 I think that you can also try cross-validation (5-fold) only on your training data. It's also good use F1-Macro score to find accuracy and to evaluate the model. You should definitely try this thing. It might be possible that you can get more benefits than your expectation at last. You can also use this data to make the product recommendation system on your e-commerce site later on.
