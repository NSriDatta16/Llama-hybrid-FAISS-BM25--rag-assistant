There are a number of reasons: 1. It is by no means a dead language. There are thousands of Java developers out there. 2. Many available Java developers means that it relatively easy to find maintenance programmers if necessary. 3. The Java / J2EE architecture is robust and reasonably elegant. It makes it possible to architect well built applications. 4. The free tools available for it are enterprise ready. For example, Apache / Tomcat / JBoss are a solid foundation to build a web-app from. 5. Excellent support for developers. Eclipse is one of the best developer platforms available. Ant and Maven support for Java is excellent. 6. There is a good availability of third-party (and open-source) libraries and Eclipse plug-ins for most of the additional functionality that might be needed but does not come in the core libraries. 7. There is also great support tools from commercial vendors: ORacle; IBM / Rational; etc. 8. Updated versions with newer language constructs are constantly being developed. In short, it is a good tool for the job. It is compares favourably to other development platforms (.Net, Ruby, etc), and perhaps is better than some.
