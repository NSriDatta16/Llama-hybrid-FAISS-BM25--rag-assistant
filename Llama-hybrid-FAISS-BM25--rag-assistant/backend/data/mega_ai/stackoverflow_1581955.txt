I guess you could go count them (programmatically, of course). Java Enterprise Edition requires Java Standard Edition, so you'd have to sum the two. Here are the results for the public API types for the JEE5 standard: http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/ packages: 79 classes: 1045 http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/ packages: 166 classes: 3278 Of course, it isn't that simple. More recent JEE5 servers will be bundled with and/or run on JSE6 and server vendors often bundle more up-to-date enterprise components and non-standard libraries for value-add. The Java ecosystem is a bit more diverse than the .Net world.
