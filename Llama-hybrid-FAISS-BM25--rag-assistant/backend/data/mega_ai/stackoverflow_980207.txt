You can't change the number of columns dynamically, but you can get separate rows for each date very easily: SELECT to_days(thedate) - to_days('2009-06-13') as interval, max(price) FROM `personals` WHERE personal_id = '1234' GROUP BY name, thedate You need to do a separate query to get the average data: SELECT name, AVG(price),SUM(price) FROM `personals` WHERE personal_id = '1234' GROUP BY name
