With what goodness measures can cross-validation be done for robust regressions?

Cross-validation involves splitting data in training and test sets (several times) and assessing the goodness of applying the fitted coefficients from the training set to the test set. I was wondering which goodness measures can be used there. Using regular likelihood, r-squared, adjusted r-squared etc is discouraged for robust regressions because of being subject to potentially being dominated by outliers. Even weighted r-squared should only be used as one of several other measures, according to this answer . Unfortunately the answer does not elaborate which others are available. Related questions This question asks about a closely connected issue - assessing the goodness of a fit in a test set corresponding to a robust regression model. Unfortunately, the accepted answer only addresses how a fitted R model can be applied to a test set and remains silent about what goodness measures to use. This question also asks about goodness for robust regressions, but in a different context. An answer points out that the comparison the question asks about as stated cannot be done because of different data sets being used. A comment actually suggests cross-validation, but does not specify how. Some details: I am doing the robust regression with statsmodels.robust.robust_linear_model() from Python (version 3.10.7, statsmodels version 0.13.2) with Huber's norm (the default in the package; using any of the other options does not make a huge difference in my case.).
