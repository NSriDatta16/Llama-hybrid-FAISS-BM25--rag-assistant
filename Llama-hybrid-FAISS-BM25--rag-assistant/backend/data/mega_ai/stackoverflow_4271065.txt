How does one use the TreeViewDragDropTarget MVVM

There seems to be a lot of "behind the scenes magic" involved in TreeViewDragDropTarget. All the posts I've seen so far, stop at the presentation of the treeview without explaining what's going on with collection of data the TreeView is bound to. How does the TreeViewDragDropTargt communicate back to the ViewModel property that my TreeView is bound to? Are there any MVVM oriented walkthroughs or tutorials about TreeView Drag and Drop ala MVVM? UPDATE: "If an item is dropped onto the drag drop target, it is added to the nested control if the nested control is bound to an ObservableCollection (or any collection that implements INotifyCollectionChanged and contains the same type of items as the item that was dropped)." And what that means is that I can hook into the CollectionChanged event of the ObservableCollection my TreeView is bound to keep my model in sync. Is there a better option?
