This Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is exact for the distribution over $\alpha$ $$\tilde \pi(\alpha| \mathbf x) \propto \pi(\alpha,\arg\max_\gamma\pi(\alpha,\gamma,\mathbf x),\mathbf x)$$ which is a form of profile posterior. It thus does not target $\pi(\alpha,\gamma|\mathbf x)$ and does not bring information about $\gamma$ . The difference with the average $$\pi(\alpha| \mathbf x) \propto \int \pi(\alpha,\gamma,\mathbf x)\,\text d\gamma$$ means that there is no accounting for the variability in $\gamma$ . Plus, setting $\gamma$ to depend on $\mathbf x$ as well as $\alpha$ means a potential for overfitting. To check the difference, I look at a Normal case: $$\pi(\alpha,\gamma|\mathbf x)\propto \alpha^{-n-3}\exp[\{-n(\bar x-\gamma)^2-s^2-\delta\gamma^2-\beta\}/2\alpha^2]$$ where $$\pi(\alpha|\mathbf x)\propto\alpha^{-n-2}\exp[\{-\underbrace{(n^{-1}+\delta^{-1})^{-1}\bar x^2}_{=\dfrac{n\delta\bar x^2}{n+\delta}}-s^2-\beta\}/2\alpha^2]$$ and $$\gamma^\star(\alpha,\bar x)=\frac{n\bar x}{n+\delta}$$ implying $$\tilde\pi(\alpha|\mathbf x)\propto\alpha^{-n-3}\exp[\{-n^2\delta\bar x^2/(n+\delta)^2-s^2-\beta\}/2\alpha^2]$$ which shows the difference between both "posteriors". The pseudo-posterior $\tilde\pi(\alpha|\mathbf x)$ is more concentrated near zero, reflecting upon the extra confidence on $\gamma$ brought by using the "best" value of $\gamma$ .
