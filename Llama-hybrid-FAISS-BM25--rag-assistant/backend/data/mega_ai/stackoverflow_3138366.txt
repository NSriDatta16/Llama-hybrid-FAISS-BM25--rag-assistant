Have a look at w3schools. http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference_atoz.asp But remember that there are also styletags specific to a certain browser (like the mozilla tags). As far as I know Visual Studio shows the tags which are compatible with all browsers (and that might be the reason why you are missing some items). Also, you can apply all style tags to all HTML tags (you can assign font to an img tag), but they might not give you the effects you are hoping, but the beauty of CSS is that you can assign any style to any tag (and if you are embedding tags in eacht other it will inherit the style, so for example assigning a list-style to a div might not look usefull, but is allowed and will cause all lists in that div to look the same, ofcourse this can be done in various other ways).
