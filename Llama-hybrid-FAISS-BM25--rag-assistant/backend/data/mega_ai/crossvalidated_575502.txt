Random Forests- Out of Bag Error Calculation

I was learning about the Out of Bag error in random forests and I did not understand a point about the error calculation. Assume we have N bootstraps and there are a number of Out-Of-Bag samples for each one of these bootstraps.We can have a sample, say for instance sample x, appear in Out-Of-Bag part of multiple bootstraps. In such a case, do we consider these multiple x's as a single test sample or we will consider each one of them separately and say we have , for instance 5, test samples ( all being x), ? Thanks in advance.
