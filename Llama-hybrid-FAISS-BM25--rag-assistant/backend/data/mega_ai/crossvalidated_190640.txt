Quasi-complete separation

I have a question regarding quasi-complete separated data. One example of quasi-complete separation is a dataset, where all x 2 have y=0 and some x=2 have y=0 and some x=2 have y=1.

Does is matter for logistic regression if the range of x=2 to x=5, where y varies, is small? An example how my data look like:
