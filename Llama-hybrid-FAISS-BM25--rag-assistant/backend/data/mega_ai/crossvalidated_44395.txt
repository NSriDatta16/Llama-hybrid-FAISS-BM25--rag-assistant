The Posterior predictive distribution is a weighted average over your hypothesis space where each hypothesis is weighted by it's posterior probability. In Bayesian analysis, beliefs are expressed as entire distributions rather than point estimates. In your example, you have a posterior distribution over all possible weights. The fully Bayesian way to make a prediction is to marginalize out the weights by integrating over your posterior. There are alternatives to this such as taking the MAP value, which is the most probable weight value under your posterior, however that is not strictly Bayesian. It might help to review a smaller, more introductory Bayesian inference problem (e.g. inferring the mean of a Gaussian with known variance) to get your head around the concept, because it is rather fundamental to the entire approach.
