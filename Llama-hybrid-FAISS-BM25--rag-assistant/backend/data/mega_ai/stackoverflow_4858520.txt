For iOS applications you just need to submit a zipped .app, the same .app generated by Xcode is enough, no need to put it into an IPA before archiving it. For Mac OS X applications (Mac App Store), you need to submit the PKG generated by Xcode's Organizer Share/Save To Disk… command. Alternatively, you can use the Build And Archive command and submit via the Xcode Organizer window… as another user points out.
