Predicting university course marks using historic data of class mean and student's own marks

I would like to predict my course marks for this year based on the data for class mean and my own marks for the past years. What would be a good starting point for a model for such kind of data? Input to the model: I am currently in 4th year doing Computer Science. The input to the model would be my marks for the subjects I have taken in year 1-3 and the historic data from the class mean/variance for the subject in the previous 4 years. For example in first year I took Course X and I scored 65/100. For in the previous 4 years the average class marks for Course X was 62, 63, 59, 60 and we have the corresponding variances.
