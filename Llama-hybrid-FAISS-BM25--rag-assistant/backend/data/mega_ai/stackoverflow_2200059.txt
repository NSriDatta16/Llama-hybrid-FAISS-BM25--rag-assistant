Based on the title of your question, i would say no. There could be instances that you have tables that you don't need to map to Linq2SQL. One immediate example that comes to mind, is if you were using the ASP.NET Membership API, you wouldn't need to drag those tables/sprocs/functions into the designer since that data is exposed by the API. If you are using the designer(DBML file), you can pick and choose which db objects to bring into your solution. This is the way that I have done it, only bringing in those db objects that I actually need access to. As another example, I worked at a shop once that were strongly wed to the idea of all db access being done via stored procedures. So in that case, I worked with a lot of [StoredProcedureName]Results which I in turn mapped to other objects, never the actual tables themselves, which werent even defined in the solution.
