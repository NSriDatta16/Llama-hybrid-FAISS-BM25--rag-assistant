Frameworks are a good idea in general. Since the framework is usually native to the language, you are really just extending your reach into the language itself. Frameworks keep you from having to write code that has already been thought about and implemented elsewhere. But also frameworks tend to offer many other benefits as well, such as MVC code organization, handy HTML Form/Url helpers (codeigniter), independent 3rd party modules (drupal), and a slew of easy to manage configurations. Having access to ready-made code makes your job easier and allows you to be more graceful and efficient in your implementation. That being said there is no preset rule that you have to use a framework, if you know what you are doing, you have a straight-forward scope/objective and the task at hand is not complex, then just using raw PHP would benefit in this case, especially due to the fact that different frameworks have differing learning curves.
