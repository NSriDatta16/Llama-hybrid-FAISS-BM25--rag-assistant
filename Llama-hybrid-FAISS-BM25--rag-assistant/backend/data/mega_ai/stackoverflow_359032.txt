setting up two CMS for one site, best practice

I am currently developing a (somewhat large) site for a magazine, the site mainly consists of sections like : news (for various categories), members, and some 'other stuff' (like shoutbox, polls, previous covers, photo galleries that can be tagged, and ad banners system). Now, since most part of the site is a typical blog style (single-post page), I'm thinking of using Wordpress as the main engine because of its powerful backend with a good (easy to use ?) WYSIWYG editor, nice page organization, media handling, and lots of other features. Naturally that leaves me with the 'other stuff'. (banner management, photo tags management, etc.) The easiest way (well, I think) was to set up another CMS (let's call it CMS2), to handle all those things that would be impossible or probably difficult to integrate into WP admin, and then trying to cope everything in the frontend, WP style. My questions : Is it good (normal) for a site to have two (or more) CMS behind it ? What could possibly go wrong ? (or perhaps, is there anything I should know beforehand with this kind of approach ?) The other alternative would be to look for another good, single way to handle everything. But the main problem now is to find a CMS powerful and flexible enough for those. What framework / CMS is the most appropriate for this (according to you) ? Other alternative ? Many thanks in advance.
