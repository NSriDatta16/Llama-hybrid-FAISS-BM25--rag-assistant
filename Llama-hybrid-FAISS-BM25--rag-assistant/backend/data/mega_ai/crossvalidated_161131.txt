Can anyone explain what is happening in the stl function of R?

I am recently working with seasonal-trend decomposition. Yet I am not that familiar with the approach that R is using. Can anyone one kindly explain the mechanism of the stl function? OP questions copied from comments: In step 2, is $C^{k+1}_v$ again a complete time series (joining all the cycle subseries accordingly)? In step 3, I dont really understand how the filter looks like. What does "the filter consists of a moving average ... followed by another moving average ... followed by another moving average, followed by a loess smoothing" means? Does it means smoothing the series 4 times, each done by the corresponding technique?
