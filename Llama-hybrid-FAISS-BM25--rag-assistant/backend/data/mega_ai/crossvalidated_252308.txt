What is the relationship between two variables that Chi-Squared Test for Independence is testing for?

I am trying to understand the application of Chi-Squared test for independence between predictor and response variables as it applies to feature selection in machine learning and exploratory data analysis. I understand that there are few types of Chi-Squared test for independence. However, I do not understand what exactly is this relationship that Chi-Squared measures. Is it simply a measure of a correlation coefficient between distributions of categorical variables? I would prefer an intuitive explanation over mathematical proof. Thank you!
