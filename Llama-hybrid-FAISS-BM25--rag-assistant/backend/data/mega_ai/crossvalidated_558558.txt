Logistic Regression using Excel Solver

Suppose there is a problem where a business analyst works for an energy company and they want to find out the customer probability that a given set of customers will churn and move over to other energy providers. Where 1 = yes (they will churn) and 0 = no (they will not churn). Using the 2 models below, I need to be able to predict the probability of the churn: So far this is what I have managed to do along with the formulas implemented for each, but I am not sure how/if anything needs to be amended in order to see which model works best as a solution to the problem. In my example b0, b1 and b2 have been named as x1, x2, and x3 where b0 = x3 (the intercept). I have set this as 0.001 to start off with but the solver will optimise these values accordingly. Step 1 - Calculating the Logit: Step 2 - Calculating the exp of the Logit: Step 3 - Calculating the probability: With this one I have used 2 formulas to satisfy what I understood to be this part of the models. Where churn = 1 the formula used is exp(logit)/1+exp(logit) but where the churn = 0 I have used the formula 1/1+exp(logit). Is this the right approach? As I was unable to find anything directly related to the equations already shared above Step 4 - Calculating the log likelihood: Is this only supposed to be used for equation 2 or for both equations? Because in my example equation 2 is the only one where I see the use of log. The last step is the objective function which I have currently calculated as a sum of the log likelihood column, although again according to the equations I should use, only the second one seems to be a sum where as the first one is a multiplication? After this I then run the excel solver set it to maximise and make sure the relevant cells have been selected: The end goal is to have 2 separate (but equivalent) models that I can then compare the output of. This all needs to be done using the standard excel solver and not any add-ins. I feel I am very close to a solution for both, but may be missing something rather simple. Thank you in advance
