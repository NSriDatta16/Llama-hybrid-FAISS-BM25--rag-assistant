One approach is to consider outliers those points that can not be well reconstructed using the principal vectors that you have selected. The procedure goes like this: 1.Fix two positive numbers, a and b (see the next steps for there meaning an to understand how to select them; to be refined using cross-validation). Compute PCA. Keep the principal vectors that are associated with principal values greater than a, say $v_1,v_2,..,v_k$ (this are orthonormal vectors). For each data point compute the reconstruction error using the principal vectors from step 3. For a data point x, the reconstruction error is: $e = ||x-\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_iv_i||_2$ , where $w_i = v_i^Tx$ Output as outliers those data points that have a reconstruction error greater than b. Update: The procedure capture only "direction" outliers . Additionally, before the first step, a "norm" outliers detection step can be included. This consist of computing the norms of the data points and labeling as outliers those that have a too small or too big norm. It depends on what an outlier is in your context.
