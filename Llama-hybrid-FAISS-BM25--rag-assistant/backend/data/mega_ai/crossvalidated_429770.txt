As long as you have numeric data, you can still do the same. In fact, Ward linkage is closely related to kmeans. However, you may want to use some more advanced methods than looking at the mean only. For example, Fishers LDA takes variance into account, and with non-numerical values it may be meaningful to identify relevant features and values by analyzing, for example, a random forest. With the search function you will likely find discussion of further ways of analyzing clusters.
