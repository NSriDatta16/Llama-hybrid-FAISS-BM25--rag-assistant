Taking a Conditional Mean in Stata

Let's say I have a Stata dataset that has two variables: type and price . The type value for each observation is a number between 1 and 10. I want to add a third value that is the average price of all variables of that type . So, for example, if the first observation had a type of 3 and a price of 10, then I'd like to add a third value that is the average price of all observations with type =3. How can I do this in Stata?
