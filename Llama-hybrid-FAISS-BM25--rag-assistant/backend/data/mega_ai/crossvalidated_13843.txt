CDF of first passage time for Poisson dam/shot noise with constant amplitude jumps and exponential decay

I'm looking for a CDF (either exact or approximation) of the first passage time, $T$, of a storage process $\{X(t); 0 \leq t I found several references in the literature of similar problems where the inputs are compound Poisson, i.e. both the intervals between successive inputs and the input amplitudes are exponentially distributed, e.g.: Harrison, J.M & Resnick, S (1976) The stationary distribution and first exit probabilites of a storage process with general release rate. Mathematics of Operations Res. 1, 347-358. Yeo, G.F. (2010) Rediscoveries of a first passage time result for dams and shot noise. Mathematical Scientist vol. 35, no. 1, 18-22 as well as an example of input and release amplitudes both constant: Moran, P.A.P. (1959) The Theory of Storage 79-81. But I haven't been able to find the case of constant amplitude inputs and exponential decay.
