You may need to rephrase your question but I'll see if I can help you out. To find what view is being touched, you can define the touchesBegan method in your view controller. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; //gets the touch object [touch.view thisIsAMethod]; //once you declare touch, you can access what view is being touched with touch.view } Also, if you want to move a lot of UIImageViews at once, you can make them all subviews of one UIView by calling [oneBigUIView addSubview:oneUIImageView]; for every UIImageView . Then you can change the position of the UIView to move them all at once, since the coordinates of each UIImageView are in relation to their superview .
