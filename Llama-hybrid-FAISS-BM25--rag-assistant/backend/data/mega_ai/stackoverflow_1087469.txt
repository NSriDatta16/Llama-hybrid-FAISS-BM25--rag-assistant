Persisting large text fields

At the risk of sounding foolish, in a scenario where large data fields need to be persisted (such as with blog posts), is database storage always the best solution? I'm guessing bloating the database is probably not too high a risk, as thats kind of what databases are meant to be good at, right? Also databases can be good for text indexing and fast access. Is that assumption correct? It occurs to me that that kind of data could be stored outside of the database in some kind of xml flat file, I'm not sure that's a good idea...
