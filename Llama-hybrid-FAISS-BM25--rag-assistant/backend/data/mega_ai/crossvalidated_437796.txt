This is the classic case of "local outlier detection". You have a set of images, but a few objects divert a little bit more than the others. There exist some deep learning approaches for this, but they seem to mostly work for images (read: they work on MNIST). As I don't use images, I have not further studies them. As a starting point for local outlier detection prior to deep learning, see this overview that discusses some applications (there is video in there, but IIRC not deep learning): Schubert, E., Zimek, A., & Kriegel, H. P. (2014). Local outlier detection reconsidered: a generalized view on locality with applications to spatial, video, and network outlier detection.
