It looks like you're trying to bite off too much at once. If the XML file is too large to confidently create by hand, create a piece of it, and test that. Your first schemas should be a very small subset of what you are trying to create. Test the fragments by themselves. It is much easier to determine if the test data or your code is the problem if you break the problem into smaller pieces. The same applies to the graphics. If the final product is too complex to test, break it into pieces. This isn't necessarily the same as testing your components in isolation (although that would be a good idea too). Using what you already have to produce simplified cases makes it a lot easier to test what you have than trying to produce the whole thing all at once.
