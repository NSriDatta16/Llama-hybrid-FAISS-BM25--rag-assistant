.net winform Grid Alternatives?

I am using vb.net / Winform 2010. I am looking for a free (or very cheap) alternative to the DataGridView, one that looks more like what I see on ads for XTraGrid. Something that will multiple lines per records, and for lines to be rolled up, and expanded by clicking, etc.
