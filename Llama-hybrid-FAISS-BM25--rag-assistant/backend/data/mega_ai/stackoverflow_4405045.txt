If you add a Class Diagram item to the project and from Solution Explorer you drag the class file which contains the method into it, you can invoke static methods (right click on the Class element or use Class Diagram Menu). It will ask you the values for the arguments. And really you do can use Immediate window (Ctrl+G or Debug->Windows menu) Open it and type: CorrectAnswers=25.5 TotalQuestions=30 ?Math.Round((Math.Abs(CorrectAnswers) / TotalQuestions) * 100) And you'll get: 85.0 {Double} Double: 85.0 Tip: type >cls to clear the immediate window contents. I don't understand how Bill says he misses it from VB6. We have it too at VisualStudio and fully functional :) Regards. ps:I translate from the spanish 2008 version so you could have other menu options, hotkeys, etc.
