sniff and block packets in a server

I'm new to the concept of nw-sniffing. In an organisation , there are 30 computers connected to a server. And as users of these systems browse the Internet , packets are sent to the outside nw via this server.. i want to write an application that runs in this server , that sniffs these packets , reads the Http requests , the IP addresses to analyse these packets and block those found objectionable. Where to begin ? pl help. Thanks in advance.
