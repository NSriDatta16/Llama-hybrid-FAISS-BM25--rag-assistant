Duplicating a Ruby array of strings

arr = ["red","green","yellow"] arr2 = arr.clone arr2[0].replace("blue") puts arr.inspect puts arr2.inspect produces: ["blue", "green", "yellow"] ["blue", "green", "yellow"] Is there anyway to do a deep copy of an array of strings, other than using Marshal as i understand that is a hack. I could do: arr2 = [] arr.each do |e| arr2 but it doesn't seem very elegant, or efficient. Thanks
