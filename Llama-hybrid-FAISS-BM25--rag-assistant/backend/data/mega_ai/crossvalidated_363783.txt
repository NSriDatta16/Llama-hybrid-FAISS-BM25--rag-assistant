Why uncentered hat matrix can be used to measure the distance from the center of data?

This question is motivated from here : Why leverage measure the distance of the ith observation from the center of the x space? which is the question related to the wonderful answer of this link : Prove the relation between Mahalanobis distance and Leverage? It is known that the diagonal elements of hat matrix can be used to measure the distance between the center of data and one specific data point. It seems clear that the diagonal elements of hat matrix is related to Mahalanobis distance when the data is centered (or the mean of the regressor vectors is 0). But many text books refer hat matrix's diagonal elements when the data is not centered as standardized measure of the distance from the centeroid. How does it come possible?
