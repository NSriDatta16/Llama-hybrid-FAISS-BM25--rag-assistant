You can do Bayesian updating for the covariance structure in much the same spirit as you updated the mean. The conjugate prior for the covariance matrix of the multivariate-normal is the Inverse-Wishart distribution, so it makes sense to start there, $P(\Sigma) \sim W^{-1}(\mathbf{\Psi}, \nu)$ Then when you get your sample $X$ of length $n$ you can calculate the sample covariance estimate $\Sigma_X = \frac{1}{n}(X-\mu)^\top(X-\mu)$ This can then be used to update your estimate of the covariance matrix $P(\Sigma|X) \sim W^{-1}(n\Sigma_X + \mathbf{\Psi}, n + \nu)$ You may choose to use the mean of this as your point estimate for the covariance (Posterior Mean Estimator) $E[\Sigma|X] = \frac{n\Sigma_X + \mathbf{\Psi}}{\nu+n-p-1}$ or you might choose to use the mode (Maximum A Posteriori Estimator) $\text{Mode}[\Sigma|X] = \frac{n\Sigma_X + \mathbf{\Psi}}{\nu+n+p+1}$
