Correct for cage effects using pooled control with ordinal response

Description of the dataset I have a data set with three categorical explanatory variable (treatment, environment, "cage") and an ordinal response (very low, low, medium, high,...). To control for "cage" effects each cage contains a pool of controls. Each pool of controls has of course the same environment as the pool of test subjects that are in the same cage, and all controls share the same treatment across cages and environments. Objective of the analysis I am trying to use the ordinal response of the controls to correct for the cage effect to be able to look at the effect of the explanatory variable of interest: treatment. Previous findings It looks to me like a fairly standard experimental design but, until now, I only found models that create a continuous response (score) from the ordinal response using an arbitrarily weighted average, or models based on a contingency table where the test subjects with a certain ordinal response can be match to the controls with a given ordinal response. Question Is there any method that either deals with my type of data where controls and test subjects are pooled within cages and cannot be matched at the individual level, or at least, converts the ordinal data into a score by estimating appropriate weights?
