Near miss of a very recent posting. See my response there on using exponential weighted moving averages. C++: Counting total frames in a game Here's sample code. Initially: avgFps = 1.0; // Initial value should be an estimate, but doesn't matter much. Every second (assuming the total number of frames in the last second is in framesThisSecond ): // Choose alpha depending on how fast or slow you want old averages to decay. // 0.9 is usually a good choice. avgFps = alpha * avgFps + (1.0 - alpha) * framesThisSecond;
