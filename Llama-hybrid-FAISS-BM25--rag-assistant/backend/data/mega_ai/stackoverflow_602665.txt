How can I get Flash to share the browser cookies/session?

I'm building a PHP-based web app and am integrating a Flash-based charting engine. The Flash chart needs to make a AJAX request for its data. This request fails because it is seen as a new user agent and doesn't contain the PHP session cookie to identify it. So, it gets redirected to the login page. I've read a few hacks to make this work, including supplying the session ID on the querystring, but that opens up security holes. How can I get Flash and PHP to share cookie-based session state automatically and stay secure?
