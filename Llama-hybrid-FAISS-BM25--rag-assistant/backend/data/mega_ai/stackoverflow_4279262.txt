what is the simplest way to block users to log on to a webapplication twice

i have users who can logon to my site. I don't use the asp.net provider (i have my own user storage) but do use forms authentication. No i want to block users from log on twice to my app. Now what is the simplest thing to accomplish this? I thought about an extra field in the database in the user record but is there something simpler? is there a sort of 'session' for the entire application where i can remember who is logged on (and which is not flushed at a random time)? maybe in the cache (but the cache is sometimes flushed) i've seen an example where a file with the username was written to disk (and removed when logged out) EDIT: Good question was: what do you mean with logon twice. I mean when a user logs on on another computer or when another person logs on with the same credentials
