Your approach to estimating the parameters of a single gaussian is correct, I think. For multiple gaussians, you might want to look up mixture models or more specifically mixtures of gaussians. Just a few notes on that: (you probably already knew that) the strongest gaussian in the mix doesn't have to be the one with the highest peak If you have a sum of two gaussians with different average, the peaks in the histogram won't match the averages Using the height of a single peak in a discrete histogram probably isn't a good idea: The actual peak might be in between the two histogram bins. [Clarification: In that case, the count in both bins can be significantly lower than for a peak that's centered in a bin.] Also, for most kinds of data, your histogram will contain a lot of noise. At least use some kind of averaging filter over the histogram.
