Advantages/disadvantages of Wiki over CMS (and vice-versa)

How do your store your company's accumulated internal knowledge? Meeting minutes, software specifications, plans, notes about other organisations, documents for discussion and storage, agendas... We're involved in software development but it's not our primary focus. So our wiki/CMS needs to be able to easily link to files in SVN and Trac tickets. We're using Trac Wiki atm, but it's underfeatured: tedious to reorganise, no "what links here", no revisions of documents. So: should we use a CMS or a wiki? As I see it: Advantages of Wiki: easy to grow organically, creating new pages on the fly, good at interlinkages. Disadvantages: no support for structure/hierarchy so you spend a lot of effort creating and maintaining navigation boxes. No per page/area permissions model. No "workflow" support. Generally inferior attachment support. Or do many people use both?
