Expected waiting time until no event in $t$ years for a poisson process with rate $\lambda$

As an example, assume that the yearly rate of earthquakes in a region is $2$ , so on average two earthquakes happen every year. How long should I expect to wait until I expect to see no earthquakes in three years? If the time between earthquakes is exponentially distributed, I can just sample from $\mathrm{Exp}(\lambda = 2)$ until the waiting time is larger than 3: $$0.13, 0.11, 0.32, \ldots, 0.11, 0.16, 1.94, \mathbf{3.14}$$ and the sum $0.13 + 0.11 + 0.32 + \cdots + 0.11 + 0.16 + 1.94 = 128.51$ is the waiting time until this occurs. So in the general case, with a rate of $\lambda$ , what's the expected waiting time until I don't see any events in $t$ years?
