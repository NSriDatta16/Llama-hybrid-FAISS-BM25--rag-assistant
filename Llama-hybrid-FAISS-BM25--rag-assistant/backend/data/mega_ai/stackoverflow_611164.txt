GCC Manual: Note that the alignment of any given struct or union type is required by the ISO C standard to be at least a perfect multiple of the lowest common multiple of the alignments of all of the members of the struct or union in question. Also, this typically introduces an element of padding (i.e. filler bytes to have the structure aligned). You can use the #pragma with an argument of packed . Note, #pragma s are NOT a portable way of working. Unfortunately, this is also about the only way of working in your case. References: Here GCC on structure alignment. MSDN structure alignment.
