You are returning false for the keydown event, not for the submit event. This way, form submission will go ahead unchanged. It may be possible to stop the event in the keydown handler which might be the most elegant solution - I don't know, maybe somebody comes up with a suggestion for that. Meanwhile, as another option, you could set a "do not submit form" flag in the keydown event that you then check for in the form's submit event. Untested but should work somewhere along these lines: // in the `keydown` function if (key == 13) { alert('Test text.'); this.form.do_not_submit = true; ...... .... function submit() { if (this.do_not_submit == true) return false; } I'm not 100% sure OTOH whether it's possible to assign properties to DOM elements like that ( this.do_not_submit ) but I'm pretty sure it is.
