This is a good strategy provided that you tune the number of clusters. I would suggest you the Sculley's paper "Detecting Adversarial Advertisements in the Wild". The paper is remarkable when it comes to practical machine learning and how to deal with large datasets. It addresses also the issues of scale, class inbalance, different misclassification costs and advices on building more complex models from basic linear classifiers.
