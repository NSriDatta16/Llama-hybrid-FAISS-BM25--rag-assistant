The error is caused by return_states = True . You set it to True only if you feed the output of a recurrent layer to another. The "states" are the hidden states of recurrent cells, that could be fed to Dense() layers only though Flatten() . Moreover, I suggest you to delete the Dropout() layer. Don't put it after an Embedding() , it contains information (i.e. the learned representation of words/chars) that is not safe to be distorted by dropout. This is just a suggestion of course. EDIT: You need return_sequences = True only when a recurrent layer outputs to another recurrent layer. If the following layer is Dense() , then you can drop return_sequences = True and also Flatten() .
