If users aren't allowed to access the content of the files, I see no reason why they should be shown the actual files, or indeed why the files should take up storage in the document library. Why not populate a list or, if you want it to make as file-like as possible, generate some dummy file hierarchy (containing empty files but with the original names) from the actual original files, which can be stored away safely? This could be done dynamically, or with a batch process that is running on a timer, dependent on how often the content of the folders changes.
