How far back do you need to go when sampling this information? This solution works as long as it's less than a year. Because day of week and week number are constant for a record, create a companion table that has the ID, WeekNumber, and DayOfWeek. Whenever you want to run this statistic, just generate the "missing" records from your master table. Then, your report can be something along the lines of: select DayOfWeek , count(*)/count(distinct(WeekNumber)) as Average from MyCompanionTable group by DayOfWeek Of course if the table is too large, then you can instead pre-summarize the data on a daily basis and just use that, and add in "today's" data from your master table when running the report.
