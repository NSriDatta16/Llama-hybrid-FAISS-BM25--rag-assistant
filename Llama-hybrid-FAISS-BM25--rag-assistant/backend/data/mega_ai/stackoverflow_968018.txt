Python Advice for a beginner. Regex, Dictionaries etc?

I'm writing my second python script to try and parse the contents of a config file and would like some noob advice. I'm not sure if its best to use regex to parse my script since its multiple lines? I've also been reading about dictionaries and wondered if this would be good practice. I'm not necessarily looking for the code just a push in the right direction. Example: My config file looks like this. Job { Name = "host.domain.com-foo" Client = host.domain.com-fd JobDefs = "DefaultJob" FileSet = "local" Write Bootstrap = "/etc/foo/host.domain.com-foo.bsr" Pool = storage-disk1 } Should I used regex, line splitting or maybe a module? If I had multiple jobs in my config file would I use a dictionary to correlate a job to a pool?
