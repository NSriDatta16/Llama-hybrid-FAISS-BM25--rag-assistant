I was simulating my data incorrectly. The identity link is not creating the data according to assumptions of logistic regression, although I can't tell what is going on exactly in that library. The correct thing to use is logit link but instead of raw probabilities, give it log odds of your probabilities like this: def Then to plot the calibration on probability scale and not log odds, simply let glm predict probability and transform your log odds using logistic like this: predictions1 but I am curious why is the link='identity' misbehaving, but documentation seems to be terse in this aspect
