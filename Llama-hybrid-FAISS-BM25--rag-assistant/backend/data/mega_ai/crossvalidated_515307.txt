Bayesian sequential updating with current Bayesian sampling software?

I'm having a hard time implementing sequential updating with current software, I don't even know how to start. Basically, I'm having to refit the whole model by simply appending the new data to the old data. Surely, there must be a better way to do that. So how can one implement Bayesian sequential updating with current Bayesian sampling software such as JAGS or Stan? Can you show how to do it with a simple numerical example (and code)?
