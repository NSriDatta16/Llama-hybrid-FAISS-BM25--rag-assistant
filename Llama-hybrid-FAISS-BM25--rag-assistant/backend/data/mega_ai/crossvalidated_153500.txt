What statistical test would be appropiate for determining the preferences of lottery players?

I'm trying to conduct a simple study: to find out if there is a significant relationship between the time perspective of a person and his propensity to buy lottery. So to keep it simple, my dependent variable would be binary (the person buys lottery or does not buy lottery) and the independent variable would have two factors: present-oriented and future-oriented. Now, I think I have two hypotheses: 1) Present-oriented people buy more lottery than those not present-oriented. 2) Future-oriented people buy less lottery than those not future-oriented. I've thought about doing two Chi-square tests for each hypothesis, but I'm wondering if there are some better alternatives. For instance, I would also be interested in considering the age of the interviewees and gender. Should I do a Logistic regression perhaps? or is it a good idea to do several Chi-tests? Thanks!
