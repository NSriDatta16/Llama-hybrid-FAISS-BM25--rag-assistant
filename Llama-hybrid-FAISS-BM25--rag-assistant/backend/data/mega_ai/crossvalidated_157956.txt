Use the sample proportions of each category. For simplicity, imagine a linear regression includes a three class categorical variable (Single, Married, and Divorced) dummied so Single is the reference case. The response variable is household income and the estimated parameter for Married , $\beta_{Married}$, is +40,000 while that for Divorced , $\beta_{Divorced}$, is -5,000. Remember that these $\beta$ shift the intercept above or below the base case, Single . So in this example someone who is married is expected to make \$40,000 more than someone who is single (given the other $X$ variables are the same.) If someone is married, we could just add 40,000 to the intercept term and the rest of the equation is identical. Any good method of finding the "average" of a categorical variable should be able to clearly handle the obvious cases. First, if the vast majority of the category belongs to one class, the "average" class effect should look very similar to the predominant class effect. By using class proportions, if the vast majority of the data set is married, the "average" person would have income very near that of a married person. Similarly, if the vast majority is single, no major adjustment (intercept shift) would be made from the base case. Second, if half of the categorical variable is one class and nearly half of it is another class, then the "average" effect should be somewhere between the two classes. If half of the observations are married and the vast majority of the other observations are single, it makes sense that the "average" class has a \$20,000 higher $y$ value than someone who is just single. This second point really gets to the crux of the argument. If half of the observations are married and the other half are single then the expected intercept shift due to marital status is 20,000, which is what is exactly accomplished using the class proportions method. By using the class proportions, you are weighting the $\beta$ terms so the net effect is the expected intercept shift based on the distribution of classes for the category. To me this seems ideal. Although this example has focused on linear regression, I hope you could see how it would easily apply to logistic regression. instead of influencing real values, you're finding the expected intercept shift of the odds ratio.
