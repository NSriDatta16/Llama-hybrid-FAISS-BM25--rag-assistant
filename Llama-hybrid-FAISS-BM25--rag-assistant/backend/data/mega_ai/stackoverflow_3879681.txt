A better approach to compare the both versions is to analyze the source code of indexOf method and the regex.matches methods itself, calculating runtime of both the algorithm implementations in Big_O_notation and comparing their best, average and worst cases (charsequence found at start, middle or end of the string respectively). The source code goes here indexOf_source and here regex.matches . We need to do a run-time analysis of both to see what it is exactly doing. Hectic task but it's the only way to make a true comparison, the rest of them being only assumptions. Good question though.
