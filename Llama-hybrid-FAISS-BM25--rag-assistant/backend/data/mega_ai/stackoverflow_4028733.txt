this is due to the fact that the commons-dbcp bundle cannot look at the actual driver class, because of the osgi class loader. The solution to this is to attach a fragment to the commons-dbcp class with Dynamic Import *. The actual headers that you need in your MANIFEST are the following: Fragment-Host: org.apache.commons.dbcp DynamicImport-Package: * After this, the code you mentioned worked. Hope this doesnt come too late.
