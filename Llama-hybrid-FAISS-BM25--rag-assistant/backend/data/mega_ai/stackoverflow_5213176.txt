The "invalid Binary" did cost me 4 days to figure out. and because I stumbled over this helpful page, I want to help saving you the valuable time. In my case, in the provisioning portal, a colleague revoked the distribution cetrificate, built a new one and did not let me know. You can use the new certificate for making new prov files, and in the build process, xcode "thinks" everything is all right. which of course is not. Only after uploading to the itunes connect you see the "Invalid Binary" note without further explanantions. The solution was to revoke the certifikate (again) with the whole certificate request procedure and make a new one. Use this as the certificate, and you will be fine - no more uncommented "Invalid Binary" - and if you share tzh eteam agent access to the portal with others, make sure, you let them know and hand over your new .p12 key file.
