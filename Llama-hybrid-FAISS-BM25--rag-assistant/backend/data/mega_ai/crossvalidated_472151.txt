I doubt there is any agreement on the "best" way to do this. Predictions for future results are worse further in the future IMHO (but I am not an expert). Structural breaks occur that change the results over time. The simplest way is to plot a univariate time series of success rate using say exponential smoothing or ARIMA (the former is far easier than the later to do). The experts I have read, very few of the total experts of course, felt univariate methods like this were more accurate at predicting the DV than multivariate models where you have predictors. You won't be able to tell from this if a predictor had an impact of course. If you are new to time series I would try exponential smoothing if you want likely future results.
