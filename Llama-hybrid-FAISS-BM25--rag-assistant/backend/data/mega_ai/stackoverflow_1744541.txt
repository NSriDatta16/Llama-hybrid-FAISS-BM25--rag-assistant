Embedding Fonts in AS3 - Dynamic Text Field disappears

This is hopefully a new problem or just me missing something obvious. Please help! I'm embedding a font into my AS3 application. I'm doing everything by-the-book and it half-works. In my main class, [Embed(source="Art/moolbor.ttf", fontFamily="MoolEmbed", mimeType="application/x-font")] var MoolEmbed:Class; Then later on in my code: var newFormat:TextFormat = new TextFormat(); newFormat.font = "MoolEmbed"; newFormat.size = 20; newFormat.color = 0xFCF374; year.autoSize = TextFieldAutoSize.LEFT; year.text = "Hello World"; year.embedFonts = true; year.setTextFormat(newFormat); year.antiAliasType = "advanced"; This works perfectly fine, and the text shows up beautifully. I can rotate it, alphas apply to it, and it's nicely antialiased. The problem is that the textfield is dynamic - Later on in the code: year.text = "And a second hello world"; As soon as this code is triggered, the textfield disappears completely. I turn on year.border = true; and I can see that the textfield is still there, but it's size has shrunk down to just a few pixels. Thinking perhaps it was the autoSize messing things up, //year.autoSize = ...; Same problems. Thinking it might be embedding, I commented out the line: //year.embedFonts = true; And the textfield returns to working status, but (Understandably) loses it's ability to do alphas and rotations. Any idea what's going on?
