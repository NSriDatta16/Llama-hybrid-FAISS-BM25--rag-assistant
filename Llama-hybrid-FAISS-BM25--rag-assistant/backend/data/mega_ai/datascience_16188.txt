I feel awkward for asking this question because all I had to do was add a Threshold to the prediction i.e. after training the model to recognise the objects in the picture ( I used faster-rcnn to find multiple objects). I just had to make a threshold such that, only if the model is at least 50% sure that the object is a car then a car exists in the picture.
