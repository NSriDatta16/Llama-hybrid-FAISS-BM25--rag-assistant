Try this: div.image { position: relative; float:left; width:202; height:402; filter:alpha(opacity=100) !important; -moz-opacity: 1 !important; opacity: 1 !important; } http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#important-rules EDIT: sorry; I've even come across this before and didn't twig. I think that the nested element's maximum opacity is the same as the outer element's opacity; you can never get more opaque than your parent element! Last I checked this is a proper CSS issue, and I don't know a workaround. As a workaround, you could try not making nested, but use some ucnning positioning trickery.
