width() and height() for modern browsers without jQuery

I am trying to implement a simple fold/unforld effect for elastic div's, i.e. when actual dimensions of an element are not set through CSS and thus are not trivially determinable. So I need equivalents of jQuery's width() and height() for arbitrary elements; the methods should return something that would be assignable to *.style.width/height to achieve the fold/unfold effect. The methods can be setters as well, though not necessarily as it's trivial anyway (or is it not?) Compatibility: IE8+ and the adequate gang of 3: Firefox, Chrome, Safari. S.O. doesn't have an answer for this other than "use jQuery" which I don't want to do at the moment. The thing is I don't need to support such archaic browsers as IE6/7 and Netscape. I want my code to be just simple, maiden JavaScript for modern browsers. Dropping IE8 for IE9 is an option, too. I think the answer may be useful to many web developers. Thanks! Edit: I understand of course, analyzing jQuery (and dropping archaic quirks) is a good option, but I thought someone has done this already and could share with us.
