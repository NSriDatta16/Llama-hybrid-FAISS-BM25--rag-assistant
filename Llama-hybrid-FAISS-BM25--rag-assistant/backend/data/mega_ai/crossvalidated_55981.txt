How should we interpret the variable created by Principal Component Analysis?

I tried to model $\text{Saving} = a + b_1*\text{Income} + b_2*\text{Wealth}$ but found that $\text{Income}$ and $\text{Wealth}$ were highly correlated. I applied PCA to get a new variable $\text{New}$ based on the first component. Next, I modeled $\text{Saving} = c + b_3*\text{New}$. I then had two questions as follows: How should I interpret the model: $\text{Saving} = c + b_3*\text{New}$? If it would not make any sense to interpret $\text{Saving} = c + b_3*\text{New}$, should I replace $\text{New}$ with the corresponding weights (loadings) generated by PCA? The weights regarding $\text{New}$ were $1.5*\text{Income} + 2*\text{Wealth}$. (I mean should I do $\text{Saving} = c + b_3*(1.5*\text{Income} + 2*\text{Wealth})$ instead?)
