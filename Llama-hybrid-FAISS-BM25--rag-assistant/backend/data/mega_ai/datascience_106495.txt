Mapping categorical levels to integer values is commonly called feature hashing / hashing trick. Feature hashing can be useful for certain machine learning algorithms (e.g., tree-based and neural networks). However, linear models (e.g., logistic regression) will be unable to learn the relationship between hashed features and target values.
