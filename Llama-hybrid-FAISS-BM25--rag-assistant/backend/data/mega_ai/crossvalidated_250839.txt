This question seems to be based on a misconception. The difference between Bayesian and frequentist inferential frameworks is not that one is "sampling-based" and the other is not. It is resampling methods that yield results with the limited direct scope of inference like the statement "Is ... the treatment ... actually effective in the group of patients we analyzed?". As I see it, there are several differences between the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks that assume greater or lesser importance depending on context. One important difference is that frequentist approaches can only yield probabilities of the frequency of events flavour whereas the Bayesian approaches can yield probabilities of the fractional belief flavour. Thus whereas a Bayesian method might yield a result in the form of a rational belief about the effect of a treatment on a set of patients, a frequentist one will yield a statement about how often such a treatment effect might be observed in the long run given a specified value of the parameter of interest. Any connection between the frequentist result and belief is non-statistical. Frequentist methods treat parameters as fixed where Bayesian methods treat them as variable. That leads to a difference in the treatment of evidence. Evidence provided by observations usually enters Bayesian methods in the form of a likelihood function which has at least one axis (dimension) corresponding to the parameter(s) of interest. Frequentist methods often focus on a single (null) value for the parameter of interest and therefore rarely utilise the whole likelihood function. Frequentist approaches therefore do not weigh the evidential support of all possible parameter values and the data are taken to either support the null (fail to un-support it?) or support an unspecified point within a diffuse non-null alternative. The final notable difference that I will mention is one that is often described as being the primary difference: Bayesian methods can explicitly take existing information or opinion into account in the statistical calculations whereas frequentist methods cannot. If a non-misleading prior is available then using it seems to be a good thing, but many people are worried by the possibility of subjectivity in statistical inference.
