There is no SQL-92 solution for recursive queries. The best option is to use one of the solutions for encoding hierarchical relationships so that you can query all descendants or ancestors, using standard SQL. See a brief description here: " What is the most efficient/elegant way to parse a flat table into a tree? ". Or read " Trees and Hierarchies in SQL for Smarties " by Joe Celko.
