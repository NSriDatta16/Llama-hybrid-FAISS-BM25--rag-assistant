Why first fully connected layer requires flattening in cnn?

One can read everywhere on internet or in books that in convoluted neural networks, between convolution layers and the first fully connected layer, you should flatten your data. I managed to understand that Dense layer (=first fully connected layer) requires 1d (= flattened = linearized) data. However, I failed to figure out WHY dense layer specificaly requires 1d data. Could you share your explanation if you have a didactical one?
