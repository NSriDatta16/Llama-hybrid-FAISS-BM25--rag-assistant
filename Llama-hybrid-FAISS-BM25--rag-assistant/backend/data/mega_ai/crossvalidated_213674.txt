The answer is no for logistic regression, but yes for linear regression. Why? Because the conditional expectation function in linear regression is linear! Logistic regression case: The logistic function $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ is non-linear. You almost certainly do not have $E[f(x)]$ equal to $f(E[x])$ (except in absolutely degenerate cases like $x = 0$ for all data). The prediction at the average of the covariates would be: $$f\left(E[\boldsymbol{x}]'\boldsymbol{b}\right)$$ The average of the predictions of the covariates would be: $$E\left[ f(\boldsymbol{x}'\boldsymbol{b})\right]$$ In any realistic setting, the two would not be equal. Linear regression: On the other hand, for linear regression, the conditional expectation function $f(\boldsymbol{x}) = E[y \mid \boldsymbol{x}]$ you're estimating is linear! For a linear function $f$, (eg. $f(\boldsymbol{x}) = \boldsymbol{x}'\boldsymbol{b}$), you have $E[f(\boldsymbol{x})] = f(E[\boldsymbol{x}])$. Intuition: $\boldsymbol{x}'\boldsymbol{b}$ is a sum, taking the expectation is a sum, and you can reorder sums any way you want and it doesn't matter. For linear regression: $$E[\boldsymbol{x}'\boldsymbol{b}] = E[\boldsymbol{x}]'\boldsymbol{b}$$ $E[\boldsymbol{x}'\boldsymbol{b}]$ is the average of the predicted values while $E[\boldsymbol{x}]'\boldsymbol{b}$ is the prediction of the average. Note: I use bold symbols to denote vectors. I use $\boldsymbol{b}$ to denote the vector of estimated coefficients (either from linear or logistic regression, depending on the section).
