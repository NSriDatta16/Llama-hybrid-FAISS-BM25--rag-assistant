Logistic regression: Estimation of marginal effects of predictors

I ran a logistic regression analysis with 12 independent variables (predictors). I heard that I could estimate the average marginal effects of these predictors using a linear regression model. Could anyone help me understand this better? What would the interpretation of the marginal effects be in this context?
