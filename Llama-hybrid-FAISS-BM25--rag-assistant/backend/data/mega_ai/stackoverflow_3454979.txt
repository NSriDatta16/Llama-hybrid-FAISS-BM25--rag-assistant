Is the way C++ structs are laid out set by the standard, or at least common across compilers? There is no guarantee in the standard. I would not depend on compilers having the same alignment I have a struct where one of its members needs to be aligned on 16 byte boundaries, and this would be easier if I can guarantee the ordering of the fields. Compilers will not change the order of the fields. Here are some links on how to set them for both GCC and MSVC: For GCC: http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/DeveloperTools/gcc-4.0.1/gcc/Structure_002dPacking-Pragmas.html MSVC: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms253935(VS.80).aspx and http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2e70t5y1(VS.80).aspx I would keep them as structures and use an extern "C" to ensure that it works properly. Maybe not needed but that would definitely work.
