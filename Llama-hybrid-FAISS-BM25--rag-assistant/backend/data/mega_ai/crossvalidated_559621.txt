You want the performance to be good on average, between the folds. It is expected to see some variability in the results. On another hand, it is bad if you see big discrepancies. Even if your model would perform very well on all but one folds, where it would perform poorly, this would mean that it can overfit to unlucky data configurations, so you have no guarantee about its out-of-sample performance.
