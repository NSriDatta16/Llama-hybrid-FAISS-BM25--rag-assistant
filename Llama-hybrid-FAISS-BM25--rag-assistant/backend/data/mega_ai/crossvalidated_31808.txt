As I told you with your previous question the prediction can be highly influenced by nonnormality and robust regression is an alternative. It sounds like the nonnormality is due to very short tails and heavy skewness. You say that your DV is confined to [0,1] with high concentration at 1. That certainly is short tailed and it would be skewed if there are a few point far away from 1. If y were just a binary response only taking the values 0 and 1 you could apply logistic regression.
