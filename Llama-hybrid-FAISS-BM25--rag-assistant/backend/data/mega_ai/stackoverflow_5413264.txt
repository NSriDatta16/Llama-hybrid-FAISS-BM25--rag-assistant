There are many reasons to separate javascript code from HTML (if not just for "best practice" purposes), but there is one big one that is very important in this situation. Caching. When it is in another file (such as "script.js"), that file will be cached after the first page load and will, therefore, not be read from the server until the cache expires. If you put it into the HTML, the javascript will be reloaded every single time. Varnish is simply an HTTP accelerator on the server-side . It does not modify the cache of the client at all, so all the data will still be sent. Varnish will just not reparse the data on the server (server scripting (PHP/ASP/etc), not client scripting (javascript)). This is the biggest point to learn about this issue. All the code will continually be resent to the client, which will greatly hinder the load time. In addition, it is really only important to split them up among different files if: A) One file will be changed a lot more frequently than the others (caching reasons again) B) If you plan to use some functions on some pages (and not all on every page). It is unnecessary to make the javascript interpret the function headers (only really the function headers due to lazy execution) of functions that it never uses on that page. C) It is easier for organizational purposes. Finally, browsers actually load multiple pages concurrently. If you have an "index.html" page and a "script.js" page, they will both being loading concurrently and, therefore, begin execution faster. If you split "script.js" into three files (lets say "script1.js", "script2.js", and "script3.js"), the browser will load these pages concurrently and, thus, begin execution even faster than just one script.js file. Most browsers have a default concurrent page loading value of "3", meaning it will only load 3 pages concurrently, so it does not make sense to split something into tons of files instead of just a couple. I hope I have made it clear why you should separate your javascript from your HTML (especially if you are making a large webapp in javascript).
