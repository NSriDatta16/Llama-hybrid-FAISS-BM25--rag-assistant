A classic example is when you have tested a drug versus a placebo in a randomized clinical trial of 1 year duration and there were 1000 patients in each group. An adverse event that people were concerned could be a side effect of the treatment occurred in 0 patients in the treatment group and 0 patients in the placebo group. We have rates at which these events occurred in the placebo groups of previous similar studies in the same population, where they were also very rare, but sometimes occurred. What can you say about the odds ratios (or rate ratio or hazard ratio)? A frequentist estimate would be that we don't really have an estimate and maybe our confidence interval is something like $(-\infty, \infty)$ . In contrast, a sensible Bayesian analysis will do something more informative as long as we have at least some weak prior information about the likely placebo rate and the possible size of a treatment effect. With a plausible level of prior information, a Bayesian unless would in this kind of scenario already suggest that extreme odds ratios are no longer very likely. In contrast, see e.g. the TGN1412 example (see e.g. pages 2 and 92 to 94 here or Senn, S. (2008). Lessons from TGN1412 and TARGET: Implications for observational studies and meta-analysis. Pharmaceutical Statistics, 7(4):294–301. ), where 6 out of 6 patients with an adverse event on a test drug compared with 0 out of 2 placebo patients with an event is not statistically significant at the one-sided 2.5% level (Fisher’s exact test). However, a sensible Bayesian analysis suggests that we are pretty sure that the side effects were due to the drug.
