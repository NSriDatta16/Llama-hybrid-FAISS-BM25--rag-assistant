You could just add a menu item in the view itself...and restrict access (to the view) to the admin role of choice :) In your view choose "page" and click on the "Add Display" button (if there isn't already a page display). Under "Page Settings" add a Path and a Normal Menu-Entry in the Navigation Menu Next Under Basic Settings change the access to Role based and choose the role(s) that should have access Finally go to the navigation menu settings and drag the new menu item to the desired place in the Administer menu
