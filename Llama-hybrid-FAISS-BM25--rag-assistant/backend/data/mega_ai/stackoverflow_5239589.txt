There is a book: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0387001638/theinternationscA/ A friend of mine received such a book (as price for a junior programming contest), and was quite enthousiastic about it, but I'm not sure whether it is this one (although it does have a good rating on Amazon). The best way to prepare is to just do old programming problems. Check past problem sets, there's always some problems which are always there: something with a maze, something with dynamic programming, etc. Practice these types of problems, so you can quickly solve them in the real competition. Also, don't underestimate the amount of planning/organizing which goes into participating in a programming contest. A good interaction between team-members (for instance, in picking which excercises to solve) is really important. Also a good process for how to fix wrong programs. Another thing thing, you said you're really nervous, and afraid to let your team down. But do remember, you're a team. Practice together!! If you're going there as three individuals, you're sure to loose... (best way to lose: Have one teammember claim a certain problem, which he is not going to solve, but of which he is convinced he is 'almost there'; thereby claiming lots of computer time, and solving nothing...) Also, think about how you're going to work. My personal favorite is two coders and one non-coder. That way there's always some-one using the computer, while the other coder can discuss problems with the non-coder. (by coder I mean someone who actually types code, instead of just writing algorithms on paper) Good luck! and more importantly: Have Fun!
