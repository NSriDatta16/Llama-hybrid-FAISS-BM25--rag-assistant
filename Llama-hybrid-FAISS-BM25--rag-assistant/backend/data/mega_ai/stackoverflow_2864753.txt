As an alternative you can try the following approach. I find it very elegant, because it does not require to store a list of available property values in the object. Therefore, for example, you can show one set of values on one form and another set on another. Create an interface IYourDataProviderService. Create an implementation of IYourDataProviderService, which knows the concrete data to provide. Create a class implementing ISite. In GetService() method return an instance of class which implements IYourDataProviderService, if the serviceType parameter is typeof(IYourDataProviderService). I left rest of ISite methods throwing NotImplementedException (except DesignMode property) and for me it worked, but probably this is not an ideal solution. In 'Load' event handler assign your implementation to the Site property of your propertygrid. Enjoy!
