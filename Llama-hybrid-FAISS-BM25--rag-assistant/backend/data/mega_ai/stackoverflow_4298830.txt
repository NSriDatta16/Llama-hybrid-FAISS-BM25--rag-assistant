I'm partially agree with @Armen, they should be comparable. But: consider the case when they are split in the middle. To merge two lists of lengths n we would need 2*n - 1 comparations (sometimes less, but we'll consider it fixed for simplicity), each of them producing the next value. There would be log2(n) levels of merges, that gives us approximately n*log2(n) comparations. Now considering the random-split case: The maximum number of comparations needed to merge a list of length n1 with one of length n2 will be n1 + n2 - 1 . Howerer, the average number will be close to it, because even for the most unhappy split 1 and n-1 we'll need an average of n/2 comparations. So we can consider that the cost of merging per level will be the same as in even case. The difference is that in random case the number of levels will be larger, and we can consider that n for next level would be max(n1, n2) instead of n/2 . This max(n1, n2) will tend to be 3*n/4 , that gives us the approximate formula n*log43(n) // where log43 is log in base 4/3 that gives us n * log2(n) / log2(4/3) ~= 2.4 * n * log2(n) This result is still larger than the correct one because we ignored that the small list will have fewer levels, but it should be close enough. I suppose that the correct answer will be the number of comparations on average will double
