Ordering by multiple columns in mysql with subquery

Hey guys I have a query that selects data and organizes but not in the correct order. What I want to do is select all the comments for a user in that week and sort it by each topic, then sort the cluster by the latest timestamp of each comment in their respective cluster. My current query selects the right data, but in seemingly random order. Does anyone have any ideas? select * from ( SELECT topic.topic_title, topic.topic_id FROM comments JOIN topic ON topic.topic_id=comments.topic_id WHERE comments.user='$user' AND comments.timestamp>$week order by comments.timestamp desc) derived_table group by topic_id
