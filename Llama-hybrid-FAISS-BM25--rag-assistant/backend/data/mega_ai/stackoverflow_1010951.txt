My preferred style is probably anathema to most developers, but I will add occasional blank lines to separate what seem like appropriate 'paragraphs' of code. It works for me, nobody has complained during code reviews (yet!), but I can imagine that it might seem arbitrary to others. If other people don't like it I'll probably stop.
