Linear Regression with vs. without polynomial features

I have a conceptual question about why (processing power/storage aside) would you ever just use a regular linear regression without adding polynomial features? It seems like adding polynomial features (without overfitting) would always produce better results? I know linear regression can fit more than just a line but that is only once you decide to add polynomial features correct? My experience with python using sklearn's libraries.
