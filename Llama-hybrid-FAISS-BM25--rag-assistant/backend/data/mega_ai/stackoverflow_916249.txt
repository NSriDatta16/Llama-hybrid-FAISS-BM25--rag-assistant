"I am actually confused how the integration tests fit in.if all the integration tests work ( ie all the functional, units tests should anyway pass )" It depends. Sure, it's possible to write integration tests in such a way that all unit and functional tests pass. It's just much more difficult. Imagine that you have 3 models, 3 controllers and 3 views. Imagine that all are super simple with no conditions or loops and have one method each. You can now (unit) test each one of these for a total of 9 assertions and have full coverage. You can throw in an integration test to make sure all these things work well together. If instead you skip units/functionals and needed to have full coverage, you're going to need 27 assertions (3 x 3 x 3). In practice things are more complicated of course. You'll need a much larger amount of integration tests to get to the same level of coverage. Also, if you practice TDD/BDD, more often than not will wind up with lots of unit tests anyway. The integration test is there to make sure all these pieces fit well together and do what the customer wants. The pieces themselves have been tested individually by the unit tests.
