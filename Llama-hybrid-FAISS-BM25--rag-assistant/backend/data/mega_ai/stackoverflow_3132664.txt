No, JavaScript cannot do what Flash does. Maybe HTML5 w/ canvas,JavaScript w/ JQuery,CSS3, some Webkits and some SVG/JPG to handle pictures and animations can make an attempt at what Flash was 5-10 years ago. Video JavaScript - There is only one implementation I know that slice the video into JPEGs then dram it onto the canvas. No clue what happens if one wanted to stream a file. tag - Best thing to come along. I would not lie. But this is not JavaScript. Audio JavaScript - I remember once it could be used for MIDI files but then it needed compatibility checks based on the browser tag - Same reasoning as tag, it is not JavaScript Animation These are three places I know making the cream of the crop that can be made with JavaScript. Mr.Doob's Playground Spiderman Animation SmokeScreen Flash to JavaScript Note well. Do not talk about Apple Demos ... that is a joke and all marketing. They have only optimized for their browser (Safari) Also do not talk about what Steve did or did not say. He is a pro at marketing. The other steve (Steve Wozniak) is the engineer. (1) I highly respect because Mr.Doob really pushed that and JS . (2) Was great animation that could be accomplished by a teenager in Flash IDE 5 years ago ... way too much effort to make something so simple. (3) Is really good yet you start with the Flash File ^.^ Lines Of Code In many cases ActionScript, better yet the Flash IDE make animation a breeze with half the lines of codes (or maybe even simple drag and drop on timelines) than JavaScript. Libraries such as JQuery were brought in to try to shorten the amount of code. Even then in most cases less code/implementation was needed in ActionScript. Accessibility and Performance This is in the hands of the developer and has nothing to do with the language. Flash is capable of providing deep linking with SWFAddress (Ajax), page resizing (Stage Scale) and so forth. People constantly talk about performance with Flash, yes this is true but this is poor design on the developer for memory management. Updates JavaScript will be limited by the and other elements to achieve what Flash can do.How ? If issues started to occur in HTML5, what would you do ? Send in a bug request ? No ... you will wait a next 3-5 years for HTML6 specification. Suggestion I suggest looking through Mr.Doob's work, Webby Awards and google the best of Flash Websites. Look at them carefully see if you can bring up case studies. Like this one : Creating marketing platforms with Adobe Flex Website under study : http://www.bombaysapphire.com/ And a word to a wise , one of your favorite websites - YouTube, would not have survived if it was not for Flash :D
