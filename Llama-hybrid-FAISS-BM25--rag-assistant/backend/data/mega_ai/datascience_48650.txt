I think this kind of question is better fit for the Artitifical Inteligence SE, but it works here as well (I guess). So Natural Neural Networks had a lot of time to develop using Genetic Algorithms (evolution). Even the complex human eye might have started with bacteria search for light (energy) sources using simple light intensity sensing. Having enough time, our brains developed and we have about 5 know regions in the Visual Cortex, each responsible for a kind of feature (check on Mind Field ) Also, little is know about the learning process/otimization of a natural neuron but your question is on the data used... Well, we cluster things in utility for survival: We detect human faces and perform person identification really well, this is one of the most advanced features of our visual cortex and this can be traced to our social needs which are intrinsically related to our survival ability. It is really important for us to identify the people that are friendly to us and those that may cause us harm. When the object is brain diseases diagnosis using imaging, CNNs are already beating our brains. So summarizing my answer: Fitness to environment allow us to define what to learn, correct predictions allow us to survive and evolve, while premature deaths avoid bad genes from propagating Our environment provide us the label by Reinforced Learning + Genetic Algorithms. Adding: We also developed the capability of propagating our knowledge (sometimes by genetic code and sometimes by teaching others).
