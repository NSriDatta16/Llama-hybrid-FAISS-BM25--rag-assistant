Does the following id max intswitch cond 1 3.351453 1 high 1 3.813666 1 low 2 1.881614 0 high 2 4.234444 0 low 3 3.198558 0 high 3 3.306464 0 low 4 1.982942 1 high 4 2.858967 1 low 5 4.139784 1 high 5 3.502371 0 low 6 1.364619 0 high 6 1.604352 0 low match your data structure? In the example, id refers to participant identifier, max to maximizing tendency (I drew it from normal distribution with mu=3 and sd=1, maybe your variable is different but ignore that for the example's sake), cond to product involvement (high or low, each participant goes through both), and intswitch to intention to switch (0=no, 1=yes)? If so, I think a multilevel logistic regression model with max and cond and their interaction predicting intention to switch and including random intercept of participant should work. The interaction and relevant post-hoc comparisons will provide evidence about whether maximizing has a different relation with switching intentions in the high vs. low involvement condition, and the participant id random intercept will take care of the repeated nature of the data. You can do this in SPSS using Mixed models...Generalized linear option. The r code I would use would be library(lme4) model but I don't dare suggest SPSS syntax as it's been too long since I used SPSS for this type of analyses. EDIT - so your data is id max intswitch cond 1 3 1 high #here, high would refer to the 1 3 0 low #trial where the participant was presented 2 2 0 high #with high involvement products and low 2 2 0 low #to the trial with the low involvement 3 1.5 1 high #products 3 1.5 1 low Or, possibly, the "cond" variable is yet somehow different? If so, please clarify. But in any case, it seems to me you can model your data in multilevel logistic regression regressing intention to switch on the condition variable, maximizing tendency and their interaction and include participant random intercept, and that should be doable in SPSS Mixed Models Generalized Linear :) EDIT 2 - if your data in SPSS now has this kind of structure id1 max low high 1 3 0 0 2 4 1 0 3 2 1 0 4 2 1 1 5 3 0 0 6 5 1 1 7 4 0 0 8 4 1 1 9 3 1 0 10 2 1 0 You can restructure it into long format with the following or something like it VARSTOCASES /ID=id /MAKE cond FROM low high /INDEX=Index1(cond) /KEEP=id1 max /NULL=KEEP. (id variable cannot be called "id" in SPSS VARSTOCASES for some reason, so I changed it into id1)
