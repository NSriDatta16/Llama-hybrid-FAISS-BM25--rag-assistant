.Net: Empty string is not clear space character?

I've always use String.IsNullOrEmpty to check for a empty string. It recently come to my attention that a " " count as not a empty string. For example, Dim test As String = " " If String.IsNullOrEmpty(test) Then MessageBox.Show("Empty String") Else MessageBox.Show("Not Emtpy String") End If It will show "Not Empty String". So how do we check for " " or " " in a string? edit: I wasn't aware that " " count as character.
