How to load an eclipse plug-in

I have recently developed an Eclipse plugin, however the plugin does not seem to load in Eclipse (3.4.2). If I go to Help > About Eclipse Platform > Configuration Details I see the pluging listed file:/C:/Program Files/eclipse/ganymede/plugins/de.vogella.plugin.htmlconverter_1.0.0.jar However it does not seem to work. I know the plugin has been implemented correctly as if I right click on the project ( de.vogella.plugin.htmlconverter ) and select Run Eclipse Application then a new Eclipse is launched and the popup menu that has been implemented works. So why does it not work when I export the project from Eclipse and place it in the plugins directory. I have tried this on both Windows XP and Mac OS X to no avail, if I inspect the JAR I see all the required artifacts. META-INF/ META-INF/MANIFEST.MF de/ de/vogella/ de/vogella/plugin/ de/vogella/plugin/htmlconverter/ de/vogella/plugin/htmlconverter/handler/ src/ src/de/ src/de/vogella/ src/de/vogella/plugin/ src/de/vogella/plugin/htmlconverter/ src/de/vogella/plugin/htmlconverter/handler/ de/vogella/plugin/htmlconverter/Activator.class de/vogella/plugin/htmlconverter/handler/Convert.class plugin.xml My MANIFEST.MF also looks like this Manifest-Version: 1.0 Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2 Bundle-Name: Htmlconverter Plug-in Bundle-SymbolicName: de.vogella.plugin.htmlconverter;singleton:=true Bundle-Version: 1.0.0 Bundle-Activator: de.vogella.plugin.htmlconverter.Activator Require-Bundle: org.eclipse.ui,org.eclipse.core.runtime,org.eclipse.co re.resources;bundle-version="3.4.0",org.eclipse.jdt.core;bundle-versi on="3.4.0" Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment: J2SE-1.5 Import-Package: org.osgi.framework;version="1.3.0" Export-Package: de.vogella.plugin.htmlconverter;uses:="org.osgi.framew ork,org.eclipse.ui.plugin",de.vogella.plugin.htmlconverter.handler;us es:="org.eclipse.core.commands,org.eclipse.core.resources,org.eclipse .core.runtime" I have tried lazy activation and eager activation, but still nothing. Whats really confusing is that it works when I debug and launch a separate Eclipse application. Any ideas what I am doing wrong. Are there other Eclipse plugins out there that can perform some form of diagnostics and tell me what is wrong. Final point, if I look at the Eclipse error log I see no errors. However, if I edit the MANIFEST.MF and put in some rubbish strings, it reports and error validating the MANIFEST.MF so I know Eclipse sees the plugin Can anyone help?
