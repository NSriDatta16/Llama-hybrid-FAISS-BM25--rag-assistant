Bayesian vs Frequentist: practical difference w.r.t. machine learning

I know that Bayesian and frequentist approaches differ in their definition of probability. Practically, in machine learning a model is a formula with tunable parameters. Then the difference between Bayesian and frequentist is: That the parameters are assumed to be fixed numbers in frequentist setting and the parameters have their own distributions in the Bayesian setting. Am I missing anything here or anything is mis-interpreted? I am not asking theoretical arguments, just what is the practical manifestation of frequentist vs Bayesian w.r.t. Machine learning models and their optimization/fitting.
