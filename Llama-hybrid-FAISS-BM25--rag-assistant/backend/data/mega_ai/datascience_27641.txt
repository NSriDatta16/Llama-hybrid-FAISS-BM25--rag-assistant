There are bunch of things to take care of before you can solve the problem. How is the label distribution in the training? If the distribution is not appropriate, then you need to sample the training data appropriately. With regards to the approach: Using random forest is appropriate. But as features to the random forest it would be better to use word vectors as input to the model. That would take into account products with same labels to have a very strong similarity score based on their names. I have used this before almost for the exact problem and I saw a big boost in my results.
