Don't use scriptlets (those things). JSP is a template technology for HTML. You don't need all those nasty out.println() things for HTML. Just write HTML plain in JSP. So, instead of Inventory Item "); %> just do Inventory Item (note that this results in invalid HTML, there should be only one tag in a HTML page and only one in the , but that's a different problem, the w3 HTML validator should give a lot of hints and answers, also get yourself through some HTML tutorials) JSP offers EL (Expression Language, those ${ } things) to access backend data, i.e. the data which is present as attribute in page , request , session and application scopes. It can be accessed using the attribute name. So, instead of use ${invenItem} and instead of "); %> use Stock ID: ${invenItem.stockID} JSP also offers taglibs like JSTL to control the page flow and output. So, instead of use JSP also offers tag to include page fragments. So, instead of use (and rename it to .jsp ) And the exception will disappear. See also: JSP tag info page How to avoid Java code in JSP files? Java web development, what skills do I need? Unrelated to the concrete problem, almost all of the links in this answer was already (in)directly given to you in your previous questions. Take them serious. To become a great programmer (as you ever stated in a question/comment), take some time to get yourself through those links (and the links in the links).
