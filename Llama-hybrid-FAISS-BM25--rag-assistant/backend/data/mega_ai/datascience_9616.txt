How to create US state choropleth map

I have a value associated with each US state (let's pretend it's the average temperature in January for each state). I want to display this data as a heat map of the United States. To be clear, it would be a map of the US with each state having a color from a color gradient that corresponds to a quantitative value. I don't know what this plot type is called, so I'm having trouble figuring out how to do this in MATLAB or another program, but does anyone know an easy way to do this? I have a vector of data (of length 50) and just need to make a US map plot.
