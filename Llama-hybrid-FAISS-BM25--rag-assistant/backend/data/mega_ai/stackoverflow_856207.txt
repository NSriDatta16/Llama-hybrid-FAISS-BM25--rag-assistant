Models for developing WCF applications

Do you know any blueprints for organizing a WCF application in a way similar to Service Factory? The problem is that although Service Factory is well organized, my application is a medium-sized one and it would be an overkill to use the factory - some of the sub-projects that the factory creates for me, I wouldn't ever use. So what are the common models/architectures/blueprints/patterns for organizing the structure of a WCF application for a mid-sized project? Thank you.
