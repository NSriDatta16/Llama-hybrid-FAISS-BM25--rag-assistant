How do I make an auto-scrolling dynamic txt field with actionscript 3?

I'm trying to add scrolling text to a small mp3 player application I'm working on and I'm running across some problems. Namely, that I'm not that well versed in movie clips. I was wondering if anyone knew of any good actionscipt 3 tutorials for auto-scrolling text or basic movie clips stuff (frames etc.). I've found lots of tutorials but the all seem just a bit out of my reach. Thanks for your attention, Dan
