Recommended open source java mailing list software

Can anyone recommend a based open source mailing list software ? The following would all be desired if possible: Java as the underlying language, as we have people who are experienced with Java Something which is packaged as a war and can be dropped into a Tomcat server A sleek interface Underlying data should be reasonably transparent Good support for groups - sometimes we want to send mail to everyone, sometimes only people working in a certain area etc. This is for a non-profit tax-payer funded research organization, so open-source (free) is a high priority. Thanks.
