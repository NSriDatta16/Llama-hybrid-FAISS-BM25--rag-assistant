Converting a single ordered list in python to a dictionary, pythonically

I can't seem to find an elegant way to start from t and result in s . >>>t = ['a',2,'b',3,'c',4] #magic >>>print s {'a': 2, 'c': 4, 'b': 3} Solutions I've come up with that seems less than elegant : s = dict() for i in xrange(0, len(t),2): s[t[i]]=t[i+1] # or something fancy with slices that I haven't figured out yet It's obviously easily solved, but, again, it seems like there's a better way. Is there?
