Ok found out how. This gave me the idea of what I should do: http://www.eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html in the View Position paragraph under the Step 3 section. When declaring the perspective, I added a placeholder to contain the view. It is shown in the following code: public void defineLayout(IPageLayout layout) { String editorArea = layout.getEditorArea(); IFolderLayout bottom = layout.createFolder("bottom", IPageLayout.BOTTOM, (float) 0.75f, editorArea); bottom.addPlaceholder("org.eclipse.ui.articles.MyView"); } Later on, I use: PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage().showView("org.eclipse.ui.articles.MyView") to show the view and it appears where I had declared in the Perspective and not at the default right-hand side. Hope it could help someone else. Thanks and regards, Krt_Malta
