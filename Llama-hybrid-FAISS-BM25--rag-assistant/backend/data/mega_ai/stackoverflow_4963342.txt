Floating Dynamic Multi-Line List Items into Two Columns

I have a dynamic list that I need to lineup nicely into 2 columns using CSS and I'm having a terrible time with it. The markup similar to this: A is for apples B is for bananas which are yellow in color C is for cupcakes .... When I simply give the li's a width and float them to the left they are clearing funny and end up formatted similar to this: A is for apples B is for bananas which are yellow in color C is for cupcakes D is for dirtbag I need the formatting to get the 3rd li directly under the first li - no matter the height of any one of the list items like this: A is for apples B is for bananas which C is for cupcake are yellow in color D is for dirtbag Each li's text is being pulled from a database and I have no control over how long each is. Clarification Update - The list may also come out of the database like so: A is for apples that grow on trees B is for boat C is for cupcakes D is for dishes - that sure don't wash themselves .... Requiring the formatting: A is for apples that B is for boat grow on trees C is for cupcake D is for dishes - E is..... that sure don't wash themselves /clarification My backup plan : The order is not particularly relevant so I have tried to split the list in half and print out the two columns in 2 separate 's that floats left with a defined width but with each having a variable height and the database returning between 2-15 items, using that method the bottom of the columns don't consistently look even. I'd just rather find a better option if possible :/
