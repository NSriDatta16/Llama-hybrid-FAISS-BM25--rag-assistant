Tricky transform of hash -> array

I have a structure like this: {:foo => ['foo1', 'foo2'], :bar => ['bar1']} Which I would like to have transformed into: [[:foo, "foo1"], [:foo, "foo2"], [:bar, "bar1"]] My current solution is imperative: result = [] h.each do |k,v| v.each do |value| result While this works, I am certain that there is a much more elegant way to write this, but I can't figure it out. I would like to know what a function-oriented solution would look like?
