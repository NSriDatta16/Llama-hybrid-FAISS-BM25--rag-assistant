When first learning CSS I used the parent-child floating method (funny story, I actually only used floats + width (now that I've read that it's not that funny)) but now I feel that it's just plain dirty. I mean where do you stop? Do you just float the hell out of everything? This would work of course but I've found that the more elegant solution is to apply floats where necessary (for lining elements up good n proper) and clear them appropriately. Heck these days I even throw a bit of position: absolute and position: relative in to the mix. Clear is made for the purpose of removing floats, and I'm not sure it's useful beyond that. Of course CSS is one somb1tch to learn properly so maybe everything I've just typed is pure conjecture and you shouldn't listen to any of my tongue waggling.
