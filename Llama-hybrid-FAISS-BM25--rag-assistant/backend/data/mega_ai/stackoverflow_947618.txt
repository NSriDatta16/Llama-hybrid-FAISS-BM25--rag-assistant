How to best store user information and user login and password

I'm using Mysql and I was assuming it was better to separate out a users personal information and their login and password into two different tables and then just reference them between the two. Note : To clarify my post, I understand the techniques of securing the password (hash, salt, etc). I just know that if I'm following practices from other parts of my life (investing, data backup, even personal storage) that in the worst case scenario (comprised table or fire) that having information split among tables provides the potential to protect your additional data.
