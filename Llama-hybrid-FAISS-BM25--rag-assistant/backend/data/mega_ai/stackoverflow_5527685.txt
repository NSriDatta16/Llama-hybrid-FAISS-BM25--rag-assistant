I see a buffer overflow: char hexIP[9]; /*...*/ sprintf(hexIP, "%02X%02X:%02X%02X", a, b, c, d ); Your format string will yield 9 characters but sprintf will include the nul terminator. Try making hexIP ten characters. And pay attention to what Joey Adams said or memset(IPV6, '\0', 40) before you try to put anything in it.
