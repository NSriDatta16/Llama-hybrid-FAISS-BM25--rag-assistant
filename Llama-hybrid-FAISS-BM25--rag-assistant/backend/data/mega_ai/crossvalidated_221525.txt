Inconsistent P-Value and Wald Confidence Interval in R Survey Package

I am using the svyglm function in the survey package in R to fit logistic regression models to a stratified, cluster survey. I want to calculate confidence intervals for my regression coefficients. The default method for confint.svyglm says that it creates Wald confidence intervals by adding and subtracting a multiple of the standard error. But the confidence interval this produces is not consistent with the p-value from the model - confidence intervals that do not overlap 0 still have p-values greater than .05. I tried to replicate the p-value and confidence interval calculations by hand. It appears the p-value is calculated using a t-test, with the df of the t distribution taken from the residual degrees of freedom from the model. So far so good. But the confidence interval provided by confint.svyglm is just coefficient +/- 1.96*standard.error. This seems wrong - for a 95% confidence interval, I think the multiplier for the standard error should be the .975 quantile of a t-distribution with the appropriate degrees of freedom (in my case 10), which can be somewhat different from 1.96 (the .975 quantile of a z-distribution). True? Has anyone else had this problem? I am relatively new to working with survey data. Is there a reason to always use the z-quantile instead of the t-quantile for complex surveys specifically, or is this just a bug in the package?
