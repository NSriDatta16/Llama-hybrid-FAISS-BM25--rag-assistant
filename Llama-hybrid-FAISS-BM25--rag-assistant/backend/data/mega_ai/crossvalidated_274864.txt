There are two distinct approaches to modelling seasonality . One uses seasonal dummies in conjunction with level shifts and deterministic time trends . The second embodies seasonal ARIMA . Both approaches also require down-weighting of anomolous data points detected via Intervention Detection schemes. Select a sample set of time series randomly and evaluate which of the schemes is most appropriate . Form a model comprehensive enough but not to comprehensive to determine a dominant approach . Estimate that modelling approach allowing for anomalies using step-down methods and review the results on a larger set of sample time time series ( randomly selected) to enable you to draw conclusions.
