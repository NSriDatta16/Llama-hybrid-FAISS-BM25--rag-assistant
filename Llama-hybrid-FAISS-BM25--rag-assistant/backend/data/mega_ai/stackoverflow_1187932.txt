admin/appname/modelname urls does not work with mod_wsgi in Django 1.1rc1

I'm using Django 1.1 rc1 and Apache 2.2.8 on Ubuntu with mod_wsgi 1.3.1 + Python 2.5.2. Everything worked fine with Django's internal testing web server, but after migrating to Apache mod_wsgi, all urls like /admin/appname/modelname/ began not to work. They shows 404 not found errors with the following log: ... ^admin/ ^$ ^admin/ ^logout/$ ^admin/ ^password_change/$ ^admin/ ^password_change/done/$ ^admin/ ^jsi18n/$ ^admin/ ^r/(?P \d+)/(?P .+)/$ ^admin/ ^(?P \w+)/$ The current URL, admin/account/userprofile/, didn't match any of these. Strangely, /admin/appname/ and all other parts including my custom urls just work fine. Is it a bug of Django or configuration issue? And how to solve it?
