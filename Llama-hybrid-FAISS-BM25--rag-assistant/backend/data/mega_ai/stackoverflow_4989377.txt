Can I cancel touch programmatically?

UIScrollView has a canceling mechanism, where it cancels the touch of subviews when it detects 'scrolling'. I wonder if I can cancel a touch event (which already has begun) programmatically. I have a draggable view inside a scroll view. I can let the draggable view receive touches, but I'm wondering how to stop receiving touch events when I want and give touch events to the scroll view.
