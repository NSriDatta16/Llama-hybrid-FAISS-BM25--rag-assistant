SKapsal's comment on a command line tool for executing SQL commands is a reference to osql (for SQL2000) or sqlcmd (for SQL2005+). You could save your script a file and run it from that command line using Windows Task Scheduler or something similar. SQL Agent is still the preferred solution, however, as it provides GUI controls for job creation, scheduling, logging and viewing job execution history/results.
