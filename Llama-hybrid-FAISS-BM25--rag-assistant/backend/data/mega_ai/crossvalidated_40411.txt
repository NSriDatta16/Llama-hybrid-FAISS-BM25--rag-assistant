I'm a novice at this myself, but I have gotten a lot of mileage out of Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial by Devinderjit Sivia and John Skilling. What I think you have described, however is Bayesian parameter estimation for a parameter $p$, say perhaps the probability associated with a coin coming up heads. The function $f_{X|Y}$ is the distribution of that parameter. If this is the case you would call $f_{Y|X}$ you likelihood function, which we could take as a binomial, since our evidence would be a series of coin flips. Note that the parameter of $f_{X|Y}$ is not so much "y" as it is the number of heads and tails thrown (i.e. $f_{X|Y}(x;\#heads, \#tails)$ as this is what you need to properly parameterize your binomial. As for $f_X$ it is our prior, which we could take to be uniform. $f_{X|Y}$ is our posterior, which ends up being a beta distribution for the case I just described. As for $f_Y$ it doesn't really matter if you are just trying to find the best value for the parameter, because it's a normalization factor. However if you need the distribution then it's the integral over the range of the possible values of $x$, in this case $[0,1]$. This article on Wikipedia may help as well. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checking_whether_a_coin_is_fair
