In terms of organization, looking at the POSIX APIs , especially pthreads will give you a good idea of how to organize C code. The basic rules of good C project organization are: Don't expose your structures. Use opaque types only. Use the library and data type names as prefixes for function names. Provide "create" and "destroy" functions for allocation/construction and destruction/deallocation. Pass in the opaque type as the first parameter to functions operating on that type. Implement the C APIs using either C or C++ (it's up to you). Obviously, use non-opaque types there.
