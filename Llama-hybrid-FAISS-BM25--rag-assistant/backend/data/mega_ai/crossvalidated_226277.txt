It may well be the case that the available covariates/predictors simply do not explain the response variable. What you need to do, rather than just looking at credible intervals, is a formal Bayesian variable selection. There is an R package that can do this very quickly using some priors that were developed for variable selection: Package ‘mombf’ If you prefer a simpler, rather informal, way of selecting variables, you can also use stepwise variable selection based on AIC or BIC (highly criticized) using the stepAIC() R command (BIC selection can be obtained after some small tweaks to this command).
