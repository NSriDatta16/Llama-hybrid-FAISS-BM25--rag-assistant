About anomalies detection, you have a bunch of methods. In the jargon they are called outliers, and Wikipedia's Outlier article is a very good start. Most answers from Time Series will advise to use an Exponential smoothing (in the Holt-Winters version to take care of the seasonality), or the *ARIMA (of which Exponential smoothing is a individual case). This may be good. However, for situation like this, Engineers are used to filter the sensor with a Kalman filter. The mathematical step is steeper, though.
