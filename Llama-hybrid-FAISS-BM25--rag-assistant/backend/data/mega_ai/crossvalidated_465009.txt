How are the convergence conditions/KKT conditions for the soft-margin SVM derived

With reference to CS229 lecture notes here , I do not understand these equations, which apparently signify the convergence conditions/KKT conditions for the SMO algorithm: I understand that the Lagrangian would be: And the dual optimization problem would be: And, previously, with hard-margin SVMs, I understand that if $\alpha_{i} \ne 0$ , it is a support vector, and only a small number of margins constitute the SV set. But, after the parameter $C$ was introduced, I do not understand how this new condition holds.
