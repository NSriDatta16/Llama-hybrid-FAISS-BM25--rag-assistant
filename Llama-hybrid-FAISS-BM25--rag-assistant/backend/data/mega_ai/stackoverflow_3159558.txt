Is it possible to generate an NRL file via the iManage API?

Using the Autonomy Interwoven products Desksite or Filesite, it is possible to drag a document out of the application onto the desktop, which creates a .NRL file. This file contains metadata including the name of the Interwoven server, the document id, version of the document etc. Assuming we have a reference to an existing IManage.IManDocument object, is it possible to generate one of these nrl files programmatically via the SDK?
