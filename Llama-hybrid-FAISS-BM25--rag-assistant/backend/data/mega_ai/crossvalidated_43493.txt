There is more than one possible cause here. Model overfitting is one for sure. I don't know how you fitted the model, with an SVM you tune the parameters by CV as well. If the tuning CV and performance estimation CV is the same (you should have two, with the tuning CV layered within the estimation CV) then yes, your model is probably overfitted. OTH this can simply be chance. It depends on the size of both your training and hold whether this is a plausible explanation. Even if your cv-estimated accuracy was absolutely correct, the test accuracy will still be binomially distributed around it, so you can check. But there is also uncertainty involved with the cv-estimated accuracy, so you also need to check the range of your confidence interval for that.
