If transfer speed and response times between EC2 and the database server are good enough, I see no problem with storing the session data as described, and passing the session_id along when transfering the user to a different server. -- Storing session data in a database is pretty common practice. "Storing data on a session" does not imply any actual storage method â€“ creating files on disk is simply PHP's default setting, since it doesn't require any setup.
