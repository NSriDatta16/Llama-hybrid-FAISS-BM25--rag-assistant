There are many web frameworks for java, some are better than others. For a fairly comprehensive reference, consider consulting http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks#Java . Python is indeed a fairly intuitive language and because it is frequently used as a server side scripting language, a lot of respectable web frameworks (like webpy and django) have emerged. It depends what tasks you are trying to implement. If your project requires a java applet, you may be able to embed it within a web page which you dynamically compose using a python framework. However, if you are looking for interoperability between java and python, you will wish to read more about Jython (and it's limitations) as lacqui has suggested. Personally, I'm a fan of webpy over cherrypy for quick, lightweight, practical and easy web development and templating, however, if speed is a major concern, you may wish to consider this before adopting a dynamically typed interpreted language. Python 3 is on average around 50 times slower than Java 6 over the JVM (http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32q/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=python3&lang2=java) For more information regarding the comparison of java versus python, take a look at http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/category/java-and-python/ .
