My "utilities" have their own package namespace and SVN repository. They are, in essence my own libraries: distinct projects which may be pulled in, shared, tagged, updated, whatever. The organization used within each of these "libraries" depends on the scope and function in question. Because I disagree with the structure being a slave to some potential class/JAR output: If you are concerned about "method bloat" in the classes and/or JARs, please use an automated tool to combat this. ProGuards is just one example and, while it can obfuscate, it can work equally well at just "dead code elimination".
