Back transforming reciprocal transformation for difference between means

Say I have the following datasets which concern normalised masses like this: Set 1: 3.08, 2.79, 3.62, 2.62, 2.85, 2.45, 2.80, 2.62 Set 2: 3.25, 3.14, 3.30, 3.13, 3.19, 3.17, 3.35, 3.35, 3.82, 3.13 Now sample set 2 violates the assumption of normality, so I reciprocally transformed it (it looked like it couldn't be resolved by log transformation, the Q-Q plots were almost vertical) and here is the transformed dataset: RecSet 1: .32, .36, .28, .38, .35, .41, .36, .38 RecSet 2: .31, .32, .30, .32, .31, .32, .30, .30, .26, .32 Now when I perform descriptive statistics in SPSS, I get the averages like this: Set 1: 2.853 Set 2: 3.281 RecSet 1: 0.354 RecSet 2: 0.305 All's fair. I perform a one way ANOVA now (data contains multiple sets, have only shown 2 for example), I get a mean difference between RecSet1 and RecSet2 (0.049), Standard error (0.015) and CI [0.018,0.078] of the transformed dataset. How do I back transform these? I can not just take 1/Mean difference = 1/0.049 because the resultinng value (somewhere in the 20's) does not make sense. What am I doing wrong? Do note that the results can not be explained by reciprocals (1/mass doesn't mean anything biologically in this scenario).
