V3 of GoogleMaps has a circle overlay option just give it a radius, some styling and bind it to a marker. If the marker is dragable the circle will follow it. Take a look at the demo here: http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/circle-overlay/circle-overlay.html I had it hooked up to a jQueryUI slider with an onChange event to set the radius of the circle and bound to a moveable marker to set the position.
