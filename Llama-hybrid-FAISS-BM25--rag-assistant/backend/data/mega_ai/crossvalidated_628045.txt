How to interpret interaction effect in ordinal (logistic) regression?

I ran an ordinal regression in R with the polr function from the MASS package as described in this tutorial , which is very good. However, the tutorial does not include interaction effects. Here another tutorial I found useful for the interpretation of main effects, but again, it does not explain interaction effects. Of course I googled around a bit and found an explanation for interaction effects with another binary predictor and a tutorial . My predictors are ordinal or categorical with more than two categories. This question has no answer yet. In my desperation I started to read posts from the Stata forum (either no answer or the model is wrongly specified) and SPSS . The data : the dependent variable (DV) ranges from 1 (not probable) to 7 (highly probable) to do action X. There are 1197 observations in the dataset. The predictor that interests the most is a categorical with 8 levels (different nudge types, unordered). The approach is building a base model with probability to carry out action X as outcome (DV) and nudge types as predictor (IV) and then adding a another predictor to check for an interaction effect. The dataset has additional predictors about socio-demographics and attitudes. They are categorical, ordinal or interval scaled. Below an example output for nudge type and sustainability values: EinstNH_RCBS_UmweltMean stands for sustainability values and is based on existing scale items. Higher sustainability values increase the probability of study participants to carry out action X. My questions: How much do sustainability values influence the different nudge types? I would expect that this influence varies. Is is possible to make a statement about how much the interaction effect influences log odds-ratio of participants selecting 5,6 or 7 on the outcome, i.e. for which nudge type sustainability values are particularly effective? According to the SPSS tutorial ordinal regression is based on logistic regression and thus the computation of interaction effects is the same. Knowing that there are ordinal regression experts on SE, I like to double check this and learn how I would proceed to calculate how much sustainability values impact nudge type? (preferably in R either the the MASS or rms package) This post mentions the contrast function from the rms package. Googling around and reading the CRAN vignette has not given me much explanation how I could proceed to answer my question, because: a) I don't know whether I the coefficient are already log odd-ratios or not (in polr the estimate values are not) b) how I would get from the summary output to a contrast analysis? This post mentions the package and refers to the vignette . Thanks for the advice! Up-date 2023/10/11 As suggested by Frank Harell I computed the ordinal (logistic) regression with the orm function from rms . This gives me values, but I am not clear how to correctly interpret them. Can I say that: a) Nudge 1 results in a 4.611255 log odds ratio (or 361% higher likelihood) of carrying out action X in comparison to the base condition (Nudge 0) b) Higher sustainability values (variable EinstNH_SVAL_UmweltMean) results in a 2.22 log odds ratio (or 122% higher likelihood) of carrying out action X. c) For individuals seeing Nudge 1, a unit increase in sustainability values decreases the likelihood of carrying out action X by 10% (log odds ratio 0.8991549) Below the summary statistics and a contrast for Nudge 0 and Nudge 7. Why are the results different? Below the code I have written that produced above results (and more plots). It might be useful to others. require(rms) require(ggplot2) dd Here are a couple of functions for visualisation: p
