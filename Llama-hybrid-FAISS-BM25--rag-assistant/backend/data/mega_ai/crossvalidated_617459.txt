Distribution Estimator dependent on sample size

I have a known distribution for my population, and it is very right skewed. Let's say Lognormal with mu = 0 and sigma = 3. The mean of this distribution is about 90, and the median is 1. For a given sample, I am interested in knowing the ratio of values in excess of a certain threshold (lets say 90) to the total sum of the sample. For example, if I had a sample of 3 values: 3, 10, 150, then this would be 60 / (150 + 10 + 3) = 0.368. If I sample many values and calculate this ratio, I get set.seed(2021) # large sample size x However, with a smaller sample size (10), the average value is much lower set.seed(2021) N Is there any other situation where the expected value of a estimator depends on the sample size? Is there a mathematical way to quantify this, and to estimate the expected ratio given a known distribution and sample size? EDIT Clarifying question: Is there a method to quantify how biased the estimator of the ratio presented above is based on the sample size?
