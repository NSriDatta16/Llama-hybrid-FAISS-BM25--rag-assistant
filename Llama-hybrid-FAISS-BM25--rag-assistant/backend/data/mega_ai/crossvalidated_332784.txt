Relationship between High Variance in Machine Learning and Statistics

In Statistics, High Variance represents that: Overall, elements of dataset are widely dispersed/different/spread out from the mean and from each other. In Machine Learning, it represents: Our parameters have over-fitted on the dataset and so we will get unnecessary curves and will not be able to predict on unseen data. How these two concepts can be compared? Or are these independent concepts with no direct relation?
