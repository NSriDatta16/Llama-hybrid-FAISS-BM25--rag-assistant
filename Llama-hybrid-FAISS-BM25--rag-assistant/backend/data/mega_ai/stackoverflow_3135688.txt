What is the best strategy to store user searches for an email alert?

Users can do advanced searches (they are many possible parameters): /search/?query=toto&topic=12&minimumPrice=0&maximumPrice=1000 I would like to store the search parameters (after the /search/? ) for an email alert. I have 2 possibilites: Storing the raw request ( query=toto&topicId=12&minimumPrice=0&maximumPrice=1000 ) in a table with a structure like id, parameters. Storing the request in a structured table id, query, topicId, minimumPrice, maximumPrice, etc. Each solution has its pros and cons. Of course the solution 2 is the cleaner, but is it really worth the (over)effort? If you already have implemented such a solution and have experienced the maintenance of it, what is the best solution? The better solution should be the best for each dimension: Rigidity Fragility Viscosity Performance
