The problem is that there is complete separation in the dataset so that you are essentially comparing $\log 0/t_i$ to $\log y_j/t_j$ . I.e. the maximum likelihood estimate lies on the boundary of the parameter space (minus or plus infinity on the log scale). If you assume that the rate ratio between the groups is not in truth infinite and you can quantify your prior beliefs, then a Bayesian approach may be attractive and is easy to implement (using e.g. the rstanarm R package). Using rstanarm , this is as easy as (just be aware of the inverse use for the dispersion parameter - see the rstanarm documentation): library(rstanarm) stan_glm(data = yourdata, y ~ fac, offset = log_time_offset_if_any, family = neg_binomial_2)
