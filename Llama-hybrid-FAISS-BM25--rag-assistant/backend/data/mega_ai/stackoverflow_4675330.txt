For the problem that you mentioned earlier, the mercurial package got installed within python under mercurial home but you are executing scripts under C:\python26. So you need to install and execute your script under mercurial python As seth mentioned earlier it is perfectly ok to multiple python homes in the same machine but you just to pay attention when installing python libraries to make sure that you are under the right home which means you set the path right before calling python.
