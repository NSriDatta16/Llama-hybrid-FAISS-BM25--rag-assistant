For heavens sake guys, just point people to the Memory Management Rules . Don't paraphrase them. Don't say "returns an autoreleased object" (which is not necessarily true, and is irrelevent even when it is true). Just point them to the rules. The rules are a sum total of 9 paragraphs! There is no need to paraphrase them, abrieviate them, or restate them. They are clear and concise and explicit. Read the rules, follow the rules, and you will have no memory management problems.
