The If-Modified-Since / If-Unmodified-Since HTTP request headers can be used to request a page if the condition given in them passes. The ETag response header can be used by the browser to tell if the data in a page has changed. These tags can be retrieved via a HEAD request. The Expires , Cache-Control , and Pragma response headers can be used by the server to let the browser know when they should attempt to fetch a new copy of the page instead of dipping into cache.
