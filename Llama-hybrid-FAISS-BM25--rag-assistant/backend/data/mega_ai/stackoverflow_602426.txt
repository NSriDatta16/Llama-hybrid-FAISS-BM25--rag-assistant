This is one of those requests that the subversion developers have on the radar, but have not yet implemented. As 'Nerdling' suggests, git or mercurial might be a better option, but you have a couple options in Subversion (since you are looking for something like SVN): There was a discussion and perl script on the SVN website that had some workarounds. It preserved the modified date on the initial commit... thereafter, it uses the commit time, but you could probably modify the script to use the modified time. It is perl, so your mileage on Windows may vary (I've not used cygwin and/or perl on windows): http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2006-10/1345.shtml You can change the svn:date property of each revision after the commit to match the modified time. This will change the modified time of every file in the commit, though, so if that's undesirable, be sure to commit the binaries on their own: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.properties.html and http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.props.html I think Tortoise SVN on windows may have some options to handle setting the date property on a commit. I've only heard this rumour, and not used it, so this is hearsay :-) None of these are particularly elegant, and require some extra effort on your part, but they will work if you want to stick with SVN, which is certainly a good product. If you decide to explore another SCM like git or mercurial, note that you CAN use them just like SVN and ignore their other features to help ease the transition.
