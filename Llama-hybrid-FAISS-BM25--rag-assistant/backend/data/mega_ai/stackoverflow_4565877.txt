It is safe to use, but in this case the parenthesis are required for disambiguation. The operator precedence rules of PHP mean that the second line will be executed as: if ($test = (array('key' => true) && $test['key'])) { .. } So test will not be an array but a bool. The practice of doing assignment in if statements itself is not really encouraging readability though, so you probably want to avoid doing this too much.
