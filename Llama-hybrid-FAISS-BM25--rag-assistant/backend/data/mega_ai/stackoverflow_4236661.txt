Charcter encoding and PHP

I'm building a multilingual website that uses PHP to load language files. Paragraphs in the language file are set in define() constants. After opening page in the browser I get a bunch of characters like "?". In the markup I have encoding set to utf-8. What can be done to make it work other than replacing all unknown characters with html character entities?
