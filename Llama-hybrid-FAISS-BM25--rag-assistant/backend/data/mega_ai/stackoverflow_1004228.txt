SSDs are only significantly faster for random access. Sequential access to disk they are only twice as performant as mainstream rotational drives. Many SSDs have poorer performance in many scenarios causing them to perform worse, as described here . While SSDs do move the needle considerably, they are still much slower than CPU operations and physical memory. For your 4GB hash table example, you may be able to sustain 250+ MB/s off of an SSD for accessing random hash table buckets. For a rotational drive, you'd be lucky to break the single digit MB/s. If you can keep this 4 GB hash table in memory, you could access it on the order of gigabytes a second - much faster than even a very swift SSD. The referenced article lists several changes MS made for Windows 7 when running on SSD's, which can give you an idea of the sort of changes you could consider making. First, SuperFetch for prefetching data off of disk is disabled - it's designed to get around slow random access times for disk which are alleviated by SSDs. Defrag is disabled, because having files scattered across the disk aren't a performance hit for SSDs.
