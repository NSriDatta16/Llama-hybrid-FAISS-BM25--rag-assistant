In the canonical implementation of random forest (R's randomForest package), there is a way to produce a local importance matrix that tells you which feature(s) have contributed to the model's prediction. library(randomForest) set.seed(71) iris.rf The rows of locImp are the features, columns the observations. So locImp[,1] gives, Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width 0.02564103 0.01025641 0.32307692 0.37435897 That says Petal.Width has the most weight in predicting setosa on the first observation.
