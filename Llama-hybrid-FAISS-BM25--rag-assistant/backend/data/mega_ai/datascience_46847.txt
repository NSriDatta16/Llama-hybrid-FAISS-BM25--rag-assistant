Since you have a binary target, you can use any classification algorithm, for example logistic regression, support vector machine or trees. It is therefore no problem at all if you have a binary target. As for the problem of having too many categories when using post code, you could omit the last one or two digits, so that one category includes a larger area than just a full digit post code. (That only works if the more digits you add to the post code, the more specific the region gets. IDK whether that works for all post code systems in the world)
