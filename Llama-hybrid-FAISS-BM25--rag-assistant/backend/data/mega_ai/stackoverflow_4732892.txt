How to add/reference .jar files in your project when you don't have an IDE

I am new to Java (basically a LAMP developer). I got this JAVA API to parse .pst files and show all the inbox messages. I tried executing a given .class file but it throws exceptions. I need to add/reference some .jar files provided by the API. I don't have any IDE for Java yet. Wikihow says When your Java project requires JAR libraries to function, you have to configure your project to include the libraries in its build path. Fortunately, Eclipse makes this process simple and easy to remember. The build used here is Eclipse Java - Ganymede 3.4.0. So, what configuration do I have to do? Or is it better to get Eclipse IDE? I just have a single .class file to be executed. A few other questions that I checked but could not get my answer - How to add external jar libraries to an android project from the command line How do I include external JARs in my own Project JAR
