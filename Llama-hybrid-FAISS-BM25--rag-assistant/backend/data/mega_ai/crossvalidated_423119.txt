Semi-conjugate inverse Wishart posterior, can we obtain the marginal?

In Hoff's text (A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods), he uses a semi-conjugate inverse-Wishart prior for the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal process. In equation 7.9, he has the following posterior for the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ : $\{\Sigma\vert \mathbf{y}_1, ..., \mathbf{y}_n, \mathbf{\theta}\}\sim \text{inverse-Wishart}\Big(\nu_0+n, [\mathbf{S}_0+\mathbf{S}_\theta]^{-1}\big)$ , where $\mathbf{S}_0$ is the prior scale matrix and $\mathbf{S}_\theta=\sum_{i=1}^n (\mathbf{y}_i-\theta)(\mathbf{y}_i-\theta)'$ . If I'm not wrong, this posterior can also be viewed as the posterior for $\Sigma$ given a diffuse prior for $\theta$ and an inverse Wishart prior for $\Sigma$ . My question is this: Since the posterior here depends on $\theta$ , is it possible to remove this conditioning by integrating out $\theta$ from the posterior inverse-Wishart distribution? This would yield some expression for $\{\Sigma\vert \mathbf{y}_1, ..., \mathbf{y}_n\}$ , or the marginal posterior for $\Sigma$ if we assume a diffuse prior for $\theta$ . I don't think this yields a closed form solution, is this the case?
