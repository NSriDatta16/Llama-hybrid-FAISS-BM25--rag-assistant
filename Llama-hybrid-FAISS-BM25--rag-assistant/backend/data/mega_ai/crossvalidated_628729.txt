Henrich, Heine & Norenzayan (2010, Behavioral and Brain Sciences ) and Henrich, Heine & Norenzayan (2010, Nature ) , later expanded into a book ( Henrich, 2021: The WEIRDest People in the World ) argue that most of psychological and sociological research is conducted on participants that are close at hand for the typical academic, and may even be strongly incentivized to partake in such research (e.g., by making college graduation contingent on having spent X hours as participants in studies): college students. These are not even representative of the society they live in, and far less so of "all humans". Henrich et al. coined the acronym "WEIRD" to describe them: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. Their publications describe how findings from such convenience samples, which are often presented as applying to all humans in general without noting the biasedness of the sample, can lead to conclusions that quite probably do not apply to people from radically different backgrounds. And, to cite the title of the Nature paper: "Most people are not WEIRD." To take an example from the Nature paper, on social behaviour related to fairness and equality: Here, researchers often use one-shot economic experiments such as the ultimatum game, in which a player decides how much of a fixed amount to offer a second player, who can then accept or reject this proposal. If the second player rejects it, neither player gets anything. Participants from industrialized societies tend to divide the money equally, and reject low offers. People from non-industrialized societies behave differently, especially in the smallest-scale non-market societies such as foragers in Africa and horticulturalists in South America, where people are neither inclined to make equal offers nor to punish those who make low offers ( Henrich et al., 2010 ). Thus, extrapolating from a WEIRD sample to "all humans" would (and did) give erroneous conclusions on how "humans" feel about fairness and equality in such situations.
