Large variation in cross-validation scores

I'm training a CNN with 5-fold stratified cross-validation. On the first fold, my accuracy is ~80%, on each subsequent fold the accuracy is ~50%. Finally, upon fitting the entire training set my accuracy jumps back to ~80%. I can see that on the folds with bad performance the accuracy and loss never really change. Is it simply that one fold received all/most of the signal from the dataset or is there something else going on here?
