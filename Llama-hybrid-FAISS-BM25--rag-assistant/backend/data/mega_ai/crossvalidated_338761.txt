Have you tried to cluster distributions using the approach described here (Irpino A., Verde R. (2006) A New Wasserstein Based Distance for the Hierarchical Clustering of Histogram Symbolic Data. In: Batagelj V., Bock HH., Ferligoj A., Å½iberna A. (eds) Data Science and Classification. Studies in Classification, Data Analysis, and Knowledge Organization. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg)? It is a clustering method implemented in the R package HistDAWass. It performs a clustering using the Squared Wasserstein distance. In the package, you find also K-means like methods.
