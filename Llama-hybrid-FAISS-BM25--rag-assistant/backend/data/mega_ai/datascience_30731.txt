In your random forest, this is due to the fact that your final model is overfitting. Sklearn's GridSearchCV has a default argument refit = True , that takes the model with the best performance based on cross-validation and retrains it in the whole dataset. Your accuracy score is very high due to the fact that it is only measured on your training data, and the best_score is a measure that incorporates how your model performs in models that it has not seen. To wrap up, in your random forest you are overfitting very badly, as there is a big gap between your validation and training error. Try to use refit = False and you will not see this gap anymore (but you still have a problem since you are still overfitting your training set with this model).
