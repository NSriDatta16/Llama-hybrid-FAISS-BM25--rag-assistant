From Head First Design Patterns : Remember, code should be closed (to change) like the lotus flower in the evening, yet open (to extension) like the lotus flower in the morning A DI-enabled object can be configured by injecting behaviors defined in other classes. The original object structure doesn't have change in order to create many variations. The injection can be made explicit by having a class request other worker-classes in its constructor, or it can be less obvious when using monkeypatching in dynamic languages like Python. Using an analogy of a Person class, you can take a basic human framework, pass it a set of organs, and watch it evolve. The Person doesn't directly know how the organs work, but their behaviors confirm to an expected interface and influence the owner's physical and mental manifestation.
