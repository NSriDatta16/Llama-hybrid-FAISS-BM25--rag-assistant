There is no real difference in discrimination between the mean squared error and the R-squared, when it is used on a test dataset as the R-Squared is just the MSE divided by the MSE of the prediction of the mean, which is a constant. So MSE and R-Squared are proportional to each other and the ranking will never be different between these two measures. This is not the case if the measures are averaged across different test dataset, as then the denominators of the R-Squared between the test sets are different. In this case, e.g. in 5-fold cross-validation, I would rather use the MSE. On the other hand, if the test datasets are not commensurable I would rather use the R-Squared, because it is rather comparable between inherently different datasets. I would also look at ranking measures like Spearman rho and Kendalls tau, as they are more robust against outliers than MSE and R-squared. Or at the median absolute error, or the median squared error.
