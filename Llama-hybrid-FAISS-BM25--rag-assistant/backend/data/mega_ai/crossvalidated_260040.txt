Yes, you can do this. This method will measure the squared Euclidean distance between a new point and its projection onto the subspace found by PCA. It will give large values for outliers along directions orthogonal to the principal axes (point 1 in the example below), but not to outliers along them (point 2). Insensitivity to this second kind of outlier may be desirable or undesirable, depending on your application. The reconstruction error will give continuous values, so you'd need a way to choose the threshold for what counts as an outlier/anomaly.
