Odds Ratio for Interaction Terms in GenLin in SPSS

I have a generalized linear model using SPSS to determine the relationship between certain variables (sex, race/ethnicity, geographical area, etc.) and whether or not they use a computer. Also, we wanted to see how the relationship between those variables and computer use changed over time. So the outcome (computer use) is a dichotomous variable, and the inputs are nominal variables with various levels (2-4), and the interaction variable is follow-up year (2012-2018). Here is my SPSS code: GENLIN BCompUse_Dichot (REFERENCE=FIRST) BY BIntvDt_year ASex RaceEthCond BMetro13_Cond2 BEducat2 BFmIncLv RecentTetraPara RecentAIS CurrAge_Split (ORDER=DESCENDING) WITH CurrAge /MODEL BIntvDt_year ASex RaceEthCond BMetro13_Cond2 BEducat2 BFmIncLv RecentTetraPara RecentAIS CurrAge CurrAge_Split BIntvDt_year*ASex BIntvDt_year*RaceEthCond BIntvDt_year*BMetro13_Cond2 BIntvDt_year*BEducat2 BIntvDt_year*BFmIncLv BIntvDt_year*RecentTetraPara BIntvDt_year*RecentAIS BIntvDt_year*RecentTetraPara*RaceEthCond BIntvDt_year*RecentAIS*RaceEthCond BIntvDt_year*CurrAge BIntvDt_year*CurrAge_Split INTERCEPT=YES DISTRIBUTION=MULTINOMIAL LINK=CUMLOGIT /CRITERIA METHOD=FISHER(1) SCALE=1 COVB=MODEL MAXITERATIONS=100 MAXSTEPHALVING=5 PCONVERGE=1E-006(ABSOLUTE) SINGULAR=1E-012 ANALYSISTYPE=3(WALD) CILEVEL=95 CITYPE=WALD LIKELIHOOD=FULL /MISSING CLASSMISSING=EXCLUDE /PRINT CPS DESCRIPTIVES MODELINFO FIT SUMMARY SOLUTION (EXPONENTIATED). A portion of the SPSS Output is shown below: Also, some information about the proportion of people of each race/ethnicity group, year, and computer use: I would like advice on how to interpret the output for the interaction terms, mostly in terms of the odds ratio (exp(B)). I understand for the non-interaction terms how to interpret them (i.e. the odds of using a computer in 2018 are 2.505x the odds of using a computer in 2012), but I don't understand which term(s) are being used to compare for the interaction terms. For example, I can't see how the math matches up when calculating the odds ratio of 2018 Hispanic compared to 2018 White, 2012 Hispanic, or 2012 White and am not sure how the reference variable is determined. Thanks for the help! EDIT 3/2/2020: The lower category is non-computer use (0) and the higher value is computer use (1). We used the cumulative logit model initially when some dependent variables had more than 2 categories, but we now have dichotomized all of them and using a binomial logistic regression results in the same parameter estimates, but makes the intercept easier to interpret as predicting computer use as David pointed out.
