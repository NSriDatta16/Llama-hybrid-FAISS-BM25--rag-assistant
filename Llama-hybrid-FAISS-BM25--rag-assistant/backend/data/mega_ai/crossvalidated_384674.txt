Isn't the key to answering this problem found in organizing the possible solution sets around the number of the rows in the data set (r) - no matter what that number is! - and then drawing inferences on what the data set values can be? "For the data set the geometric mean is 10..." means if there are "r" rows in the data set, the "geometric total" for column x is 10^r. Which then yields '10' as the rth root of the geometric total, or the geometric mean. Therefore, you're going to have values x(1), x(2), x(3),...x(r) which, when multiplied together, yield the geometric total of 10^r. That is 100, 1000, 10000, ... or some other power of 10. There is no x that, when multiplied by y <> 10, yields 10x. The only way to get “any number raised to a power of r” to equal “10 raised to a power of r” is for x to equal 10 (x^r = 10^r, therefore x=10 for all r.) So it's not just one x value = 10, but all x values = 10 (from every row in the data set) that satisfies the computation for the geometric mean (rth root of 10^r). But then also the sum of those x values (all x = 10), when divided by r, gives you the arithmetic mean. The only way to get SUM(i=1...r) of x(i) = 10*r would again, be for x=10. ((x*r) / r) = r√(x^r) iff x=10. And with { x(1) + x(2) + x(3) + ... + x(r) } also being a multiple of 10 (r*10), when divided by r we get a mean of 10 as well. It’s just that every x = 10, and there’s no variation / deviation from the arithmetic mean. This works also if you’re dealing with r number of values in a set, rather than r rows in a table. Finally, if negatives are included (specifically, -10) then the arithmetic mean is unknown. Even with knowing the value of r (number of occurrences), the number of positive and negative 10’s don’t have to balance, and you could end up with an imaginary root (in the case of an odd r), and/or a case of a sum that is not evenly divisible by 10.
