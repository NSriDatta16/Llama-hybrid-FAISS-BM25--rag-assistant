What state-space representation of VARMA is commonly used for fitting

What state-space representation of VARMA is commonly used for fitting? Is Kalman filter + MLE approach used for fitting VARMA model as a common practice? Does the choice of which state-space representation to use affect fitting performance? BACKGROUND I'm new to time series modeling. I'm trying to use a VARMA model to fit some multivariate data. (for now I use artificial data generated using dse) library(dse) n = 1000 AR I've tried to fit the model by following steps: Convert the model to state-space model using Harvey's approach . Use FKF to kickoff a MLE optim. The 1st part was pretty natural, I just replace each $\phi$, $\theta$ with their matrix counterparts. However the 2nd part was tough. FKF's likelihood calculation will 'stall' as soon as Ft become non- positive-semidefinite . (I assume Ft is a covariance matrix) After that, with doubt in whether my conversion is correct, I tried dse 's toSS function, which by it's document: If the order of the AR polynomial equals or exceeds the MA polynomial (and the input polynomial) then the model is converted by state augmentation. I have no idea what state augmentation is, and the output matrices looks very different. I'm seeking for answers and advices, thanks in advance!
