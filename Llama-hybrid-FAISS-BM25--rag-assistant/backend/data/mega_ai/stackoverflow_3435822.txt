Does the server actually get the requests, and are you handling the host name (alias) properly? after adding to my .hosts file Check your webserver log, to see how the request came in... curl has options to dump the request sent, and response received, it is called trace, which will will be saved to a file. --trace If you are missing host or header information - you can force those headers with the config option. I would get the curl request working on the command line, and then try to implement in PHP. the config option is -K/--config the options that are relevant in curl are here --trace Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, including descriptive information, to the given output file. Use "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout. This option overrides previous uses of -v/--verbose or --trace-ascii. If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. -K/--config Specify which config file to read curl arguments from. The config file is a text file in which command line arguments can be written which then will be used as if they were written on the actual command line. Options and their parameters must be specified on the same config file line, separated by whitespace, colon, the equals sign or any combination thereof (however, the preferred separa- tor is the equals sign). If the parameter is to contain whitespace, the parameter must be enclosed within quotes. Within double quotes, the following escape sequences are available: \, \", \t, \n, \r and \v. A backslash preceding any other letter is ignored. If the first column of a config line is a '#' character, the rest of the line will be treated as a comment. Only write one option per physical line in the config file. Specify the filename to -K/--config as '-' to make curl read the file from stdin. Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file, you need to specify it using the --url option, and not by simply writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look similar to this: url = "http://curl.haxx.se/docs/" Long option names can optionally be given in the config file without the initial double dashes. When curl is invoked, it always (unless -q is used) checks for a default config file and uses it if found. The default config file is checked for in the following places in this order: 1) curl tries to find the "home dir": It first checks for the CURL_HOME and then the HOME environment variables. Failing that, it uses getpwuid() on UNIX-like systems (which returns the home dir given the current user in your system). On Windows, it then checks for the APPDATA variable, or as a last resort the '%USERPROFILE%\Application Data'. 2) On windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home dir, it checks for one in the same dir the curl executable is placed. On UNIX-like systems, it will simply try to load .curlrc from the deter- mined home dir. # --- Example file --- # this is a comment url = "curl.haxx.se" output = "curlhere.html" user-agent = "superagent/1.0" # and fetch another URL too url = "curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html" -O referer = "http://nowhereatall.com/" # --- End of example file --- This option can be used multiple times to load multiple config files.
