i have recently come across the package. I tested the function you reffer to obtained from https://github.com/Mottl/hurst . I tested it on synthetically generated fractional gaussian noise and fractional brownian motion. Indeed when the differencing step is ommited the estimation for the hurst exponent of the fBm series is wrong. However for fGn the estimation is somewhat correct. Bellow you can see the results of this process, for each hurst exponent i generated around 100 fBm and 100 fGn series, using this package https://pypi.org/project/fbm/ , and averaged the estimated Hurst exp. I think the problem is related to stationarity of the series. In this paper https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a4db/ac0f41d17f1fc3fc4d22cbc59cbe1784dcf0.pdf the authors explain that fBm is non-stationary, however it incremental process Z(t) = Y(t) - Y(t-1) is stationary. On the other hand fGn is stationary.
