I'm running 1.4.1.1 and noticed a similar issue with a custom product attribute. If you filter a collection by an attribute that attribute has to have a value for the default store as well as the store you're interested in. You can see why if you do the following Mage::Log($collection->getSelect()->__toString()); When you look at the query in the log file you'll see that magneto does an inner join onto the attribute table for store_id 0, so if you haven't created a value for store zero it can't give you a result. Seems like a bug to me, I think Magento should do a LEFT JOIN.
