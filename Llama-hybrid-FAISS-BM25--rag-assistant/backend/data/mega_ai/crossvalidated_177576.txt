SVM vs. Ranking SVM?

I'm having a hard time visualizing Ranking SVM and would love help "drawing it out". Rank SVM is a multi-label multi-classification learning method, and Support Vector Machine was originally intended for single-label learning. What are the differences imposed in rank SVM that allows for the novel structure of multi-label datasets?
