How to speed up the training in neural network when mini-batch training is used?

Can anyone give me some ideas on possible techniques to speed up the training process of multilayer artificial neural network if the training involves mini-batch? So far, I understand that stochastic training probably leads to a faster convergence, but if we have to use mini-batch training, is there any way to make the convergence faster? (Some pointers to relevant papers will also help!) Thank you!
