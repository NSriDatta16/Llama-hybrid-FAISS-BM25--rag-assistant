I have recently been wondering about this too. Some Apple apps (Pages, Numbers) put it into an acknowledgements page in their section of the settings app, though I have not yet figured out an easy way to do this - each paragraph of text has to be a "Group" element, which is a little hard to get setup. This is the option I use, see this question to see how I do it: best way to add license section to iOS settings bundle Other apps put it in the itunes connect license agreement section, which is a lot simpler. A third option (used by the ebay app amongst others) is having an "about" screen hidden somewhere in the application, with a "legal" subpage.
