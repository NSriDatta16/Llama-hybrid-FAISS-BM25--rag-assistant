Is there already a popular open-source script to do that? The Python library GPT Index (MIT license) can summarize a large document or collection of documents with GPT-3. From the documentation : index = GPTTreeIndex(documents) response = index.query(" ", mode="summarize") The “default” mode for a tree-based query is traversing from the top of the graph down to leaf nodes. For summarization purposes we will want to use mode="summarize" . A summarization query could look like one of the following: “What is a summary of this collection of text?” “Give me a summary of person X’s experience with the company.” The documentation includes a notebook with complete examples: https://github.com/jerryjliu/gpt_index/blob/main/examples/paul_graham_essay/TestEssay.ipynb Another Python library: https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain (MIT license). From the documentation : from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="map_reduce") chain.run(docs) FYI {1,2} are two great papers looking at GPT-3 performance for summarization, but they only looked at short texts. Update 2023-02-23: the next version of GPT may allow 32k tokens: Update 2023-11-15: Interesting leaderboard for summarization of relatively short documents: https://github.com/vectara/hallucination-leaderboard References: {1} Goyal, Tanya, Junyi Jessy Li, and Greg Durrett.
