Logistic regression with serial correlation and/or glmm with arma in R?

Problem Using R, how can I build a logistic regression model with serial correlation or a general linear mixed model with ARMA? I cannot use linear regression because I have serial correlation. I cannot use ARMA because I have binary predication target. I consulted with a statistician and they told me this is my situation. It is a multivariate time series with a univariate, but binary predictor. Simply said, I have multiple independent variables such as heart rate, GIS zone, zone rating, participant id, temp and I want to predict a binary variable called fatigue which is 0 or 1. I'm finding some material in SAS, but need to use R to solve this. Having suggestions where to start would be immensely useful and how to define the model. Right now for logistic, I am thinking of something like: model However, this in no way is taking into account my serial correlated data.
