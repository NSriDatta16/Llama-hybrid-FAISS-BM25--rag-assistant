Isn't an oblique rotation against the whole spirit of principal component analysis?

I am studying principal component analysis (PCA) as a method to deal with multicollinearity. And when studying the rotation method -- which, if my understanding is correct, is the center of the PCA -- I read that two different rotations can be applied : either an orthogonal rotation using the varimax procedure or an oblique rotation using the promax procedure. Now my question is a conceptual question : the orthogonal varimax procedure creates independent components based on a cluster of several variables ... while the oblique promax procedure creates several components that are potentially all linked to the all of the original variables ... isn't that last procedure against the whole spirit of the PCA procedure whose aim is to create totally independent principal components ?! PS. If the question shows too little studying, I of course welcome a simple link to any source you think is reliable.
