I believe VC also supports #pragma message ("note to self") But as the system grows and grows, and you get a nightly build 30 developers work on simultaneously, it takes days to read all the notes to self, even in that amount that self is going to be do nothing but note reading and finally going to break under the stress not being able to keep up and have to resign... No really, the amount of warnings is quickly going to grow if you allow them, and you won't be able to spot the really important ones (uninitialized variables, this pointer used in constructor, ...). That's why I try to treat warnings as errors: most of the time, the compiler is right warning me, and if he isn't, I document it in the code and prepend #pragma warning ( push ) #pragma warning ( 4191 : disable ) // violent code, properly documented #pragma warning ( pop ) I just read they have a warning ( N : suppress ) pragma, too.
