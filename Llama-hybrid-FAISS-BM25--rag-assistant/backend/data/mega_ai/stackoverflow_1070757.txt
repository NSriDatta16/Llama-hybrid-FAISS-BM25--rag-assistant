MySQL fulltext search isn't matching as expected

I have a pretty simple query that doesn't seem to be giving me the results I'd like. I'm trying to allow the user to search for a resturant by its name, address, or city using a fulltext search. here is my query: SELECT ESTAB_NAME, ESTAB_ADDRESS, ESTAB_CITY FROM restaurant_restaurants rr WHERE MATCH (rr.ESTAB_NAME, rr.ESTAB_ADDRESS, rr.ESTAB_CITY) AGAINST ('*new* *hua*' IN BOOLEAN MODE) LIMIT 0, 500 New Hua is the restaurant that exists within the table. However when i do a search for ' ting ho ' i get the results I would expect. Does anyone have any idea what What is going on? I'm using a MyISAM storage engine on MySQL version 5.0.41
