Java application inside tomcat?

I have a standalone java application which uses java based TCP NIO to collect some information from various clients (not on web/HTTP but through some indigenously developed middleware). Now I have to develop a front-end for the users to perform a lot of querying through HTTP. So is there a way to put this application inside tomcat, so that servlets can invoke required functions on this application ??? The thing is it has to listen on that middleware outside tomcat too and at the same time service servlets inside tomcat. How to do this ?? Putting this application outside tomcat and using RMI is an option but I donâ€™t want to do that. Can embedding tomcat inside my application is an option ???
