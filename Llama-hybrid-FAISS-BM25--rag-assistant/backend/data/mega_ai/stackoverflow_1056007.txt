C# has a free implementation in Linux under the Mono project, and it arguably is a very marketable skill unless you're completely anti-Microsoft. My favorite C# book is Pro C# 2008 and the .NET 3.5 Platform, Fourth Edition. If you're really want exotic, F# is an OCaml style language that runs on the .NET platform and mono, and is getting a lot of attention these days. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/fsharp/default.aspx Books for F#: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=f%23
