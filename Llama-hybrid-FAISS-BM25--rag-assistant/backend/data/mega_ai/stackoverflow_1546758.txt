You could compare the embed code actually used on the YouTube page (as opposed to the one they offer for quick copy & paste) with the one you are using, as there are quite some different ways to embed a video. I would expect them to use the SWFObject for embedding, which is a tiny bit more effort to use on your page, but usually works a lot more reliable than the 'old fashioned' embed tag offered for quick copy&paste. You might also try requesting the YouTube page faking the user agent of the Palm Pre, as they might deliver something different for those, but that is pretty unlikely.
