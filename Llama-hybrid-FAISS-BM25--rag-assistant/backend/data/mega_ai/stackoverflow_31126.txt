you could always write one yourself: def iterattr(iterator, attributename): for obj in iterator: yield getattr(obj, attributename) will work with anything that iterates, be it a tuple, list, or whatever. I love python, it makes stuff like this very simple and no more of a hassle than neccessary, and in use stuff like this is hugely elegant.
