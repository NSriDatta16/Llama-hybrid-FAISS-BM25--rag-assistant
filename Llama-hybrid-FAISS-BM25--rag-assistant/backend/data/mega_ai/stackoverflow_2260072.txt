Create chart/statistics for selected mysql table through python

I'd like to start by asking for your opinion on how I should tackle this task, instead of simply how to structure my code. Here is what I'm trying to do: I have a lot of data loaded into a mysql table for a large number of unique names + dates (i.e., where the date is a separate field). My goal is to be able to select a particular name (using rawinput, and perhaps in the future add a drop-down menu) and see a monthly trend, with a moving average, and perhaps other stats, for one of the fields (revenue, revenue per month, clicks, etc). What is your advice - to move this data to an excel workbook via python, or is there a way to display this information in python (with charts that compare to excel, of course)? Thanks!
