What about artificial intelligence appliance on this problem? Well! Let me say that starting from scratch could be really funny to use a network of clients with their own "intelligence" and finally collect client results on a central "intelligence". Each client could produce his own "user ratings" based on user habitudes (as already said: average listenig, listenig count, etc...). Than a central "intelligent" collector could merge individual ratings into "global ratings" showing trands, suggestions and every high level rating you need. Anyway to train such a "brain" means that you have to solve the problem in an analytical way first, but really could be funny to build such a cloud of interconnected small brains to produce higher level "intelligence". As usual, as I donÂ´t know your skills, take a look to neural networks , genetic algorithms , fuzzy logic , pattern recognition and similar problems for a deeper understanding.
