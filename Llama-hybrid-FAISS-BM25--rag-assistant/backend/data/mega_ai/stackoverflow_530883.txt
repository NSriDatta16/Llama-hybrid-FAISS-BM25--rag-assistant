HTTP Filer Server: Single file, cross platform, drag drop and start

I asked a previous question here but after reading the answers realised I hadn't done a very good job of defining my requirements. Here's what I'm after: Cross platform Drag, drop and start Preferably a single file So to sum up I want something that I can just drag into a folder, start up and then it will start servering over http the contents of that folder. Hope someone knows of something. Cheers, Chris
