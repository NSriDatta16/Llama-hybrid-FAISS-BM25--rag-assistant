Multiple dependent variables

Suppose there are 3 advertisers who want to show an ad on a site. If a user clicks on an ad and makes a purchase the host of the site makes a certain percentage of the purchase. Suppose we have historical data on all 3 ads for a set of individuals, and we have variables: conversion(0/1: the user clicked on the ad and made a purchase) gender(male/female) the amount of time since the last visit, etc. The owner of the site wants to know what ad to show to a particular person with a given set of characteristics(variables in historical data). What would be a good model for this? It seems that there is no "single" response variable. I was thinking of building a logistic regression where conversion(0/1) is dependent variable, and type of ad(3 values) is independent variable but I am not sure if this is correct. Do you have any suggestions on what a good modeling paradigm would be?
