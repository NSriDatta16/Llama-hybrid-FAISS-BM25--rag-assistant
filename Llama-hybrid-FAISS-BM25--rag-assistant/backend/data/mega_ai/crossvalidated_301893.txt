When they say "per Cell", generally in my experience people mean per cell in the larger NxM table created by adding your covariates. This is however a very rough and informal guideline - as you're finding, logistic regression is fairly mechanically reliable, and can be made to do a great many things it probably shouldn't before running aground on convergence issues. For example, having one cell that violates that rule might not be a big deal, whereas having many may very well create problems. There are two hazards with what you're currently doing: The model is essentially being asked to smooth over places where there isn't very much data, which carries the risk of missing things that exist in your exposure-disease relationship. It's possible (though not a problem in your example) that a cell size of zero is not merely due to stratification, but because something is impossible , and the regression model will also miss that.
