Testing for mean differences in time series

I've checked the past posts in the forum, but none of them was satisfactory for my problem. I have to divide a time series into sub-intervals, then I have to test for mean differences between these intervals. The problem is that since it is a time series, there is autocorrelation, therefore I cannot use the classical Anova and t-test (or Wilcoxon or others) which require independence. I need a test to make pairwise comparisons (such as the t-test) and one for multiple comparisons (such as the Anova) which don't require Independence (and preferably also for non-normal data and non-constant in variance data). Do you have any suggestion? It must be hypothesis testing not other procedure, thanks for your help.
