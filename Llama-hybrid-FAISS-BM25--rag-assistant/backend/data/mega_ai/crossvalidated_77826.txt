Find curve pattern of simple time series

I have time series data of credit card transaction volumes for different companies. For example: week1: \$5000 week2: \$6000 week3: \$6200 week4: \$7000 week5: \$9000 ... Is there a simple method in R to determine if the number series has a linear trend upwards, downwards or like a normal distribution (rising first then dropping)?
