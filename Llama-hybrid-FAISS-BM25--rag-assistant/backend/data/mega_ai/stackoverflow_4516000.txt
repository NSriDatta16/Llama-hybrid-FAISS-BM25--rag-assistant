jQuery AJAX Request Strips Joomla Email Protection Script

I am using $.ajax to load the content of pages in my Joomla installation into the page. This is working well, but I have some email addresses on the page, and Joomla's email cloaking plugin automatically scrambles them and replaces them with JavaScript to discourage spambots. When I load the page with jQuery, the tags aren't loaded/executed and I am left with: This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it . When the code that should be executed is: // Some email display code document.write( ' ' ); document.write( addy10641 ); document.write( ' ' ); This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it // Some email display code . My code is as follows: $.ajax({ url: fetchUrl, type: "GET", dataType: "html", timeout: 4000, error: function() { location.href = fetchUrl; }, success: function(response) { $("#content *").fadeOut(function() { $("#content *").remove(); parsedResponse = $(response).filter("#content")[0].innerHTML; alert(parsedResponse); // This DOES NOT show the tags $("#content")[0].innerHTML = parsedResponse; }); } }); Any ideas as to how to solve this?
