A few years ago I heard a talk by a grad student, Stacey Hancock , during a local ASA chapter meeting and it was on "structural break estimation" of time series. The talk was really interesting and I spoke with her afterwards and she was working with Richard Davis (of Brockwell-Davis ), then at Colorado State University, now at Columbia. The talk was an extension of Davis et al. work in a 2006 JASA paper called Strutural Break Estimation for Nonstationary Time Series Models , which is freely available here . Davis has a software implementation of the method that he calls Auto-PARM, which he made into a Windows executable. If you contact him you may be able to get a copy. I have a copy, and here is example output on a 1,200 observation time series: ============== RESULTS =============== ISLAND 1 SC= 1910.58314770669 Breaking point/AR order 1 1 351 1 612 3 ====================================== Total time: 5.812500 So the series is AR(1) in the beginning, at observation 351 the AR(1) process changes to another AR(1) process (you can get the parameters), and then at observation 612 the process changes to AR(3). One interesting setting I tried Auto-PARM on was looking at weekly ATM withdrawal data that was part of the NN5 competition . I recall the algorithm finding structural breaks in late November of a given year, e.g. the beginning of the US holiday shopping season. So, how to use this algorithm via existing implementations? Well, again, you could reach out to Davis and see if you can get the Windows executable. When I was at Rogue Wave Software I worked with Davis to get Auto-PARM into the IMSL Numerical Libraries. The first language it was ported to was Fortran , where it is called Auto_PARM, and I suspect Rogue Wave will release a C port soon, with Python, C# and Java ports to follow.
