Normally SQL Server does a good job at deciding what index to use if any to retrieve the data in the fastest way. Quite often it will decide not to use any indexes as it can retrieve small amounts of data from small tables quicker without going away to the index (in some situations). It sounds like in your case SQL may not be taking the most optimum route. Having lots of badly created indexes may be causing it to pick the wrong routes to get to the data. I would suggest viewing the query plan in management studio to check what indexes its using, and where the time is being taken. This should give you a good idea where to start. Another note is it maybe that these indexes have gotten fragmented over time and are now not performing to their best, it maybe worth checking this and rebuilding some of them if needed.
