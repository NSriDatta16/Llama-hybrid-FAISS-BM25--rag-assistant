How can I estimate the phase difference between two periodic time-series?

I have 2 daily time-series, each 6 years long. While noisy, they are both clearly periodic (with a frequency of ~1 year), but appear to be out of phase. I would like to estimate the phase difference between these time-series. I've considered fitting curves of the form $a\sin(\frac{2\pi}{365}t - b)$ to each time-series and just comparing the two different values for b, but I suspect there are more elegant (and rigourous!) methods for doing this (perhaps using Fourier transforms?). I would also prefer to have some kind of idea of the uncertainty in my phase difference estimate, if possible. Update : The shaded regions are 95% CIs. Sample crosscorrelation between the two time-series:
