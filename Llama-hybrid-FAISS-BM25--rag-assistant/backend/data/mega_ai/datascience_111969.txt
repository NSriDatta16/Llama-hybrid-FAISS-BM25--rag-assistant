To reduce position change, it is crucial to know how t-SNE works. t-SNE is a projection from a high-dimensional space to a lower one, generally 2D or 3D. For simplification purposes, let's take a 2D low-dimensional space. This 2D low-dimensional space evolves with every iteration until finding a balance that represents the high-dimensional space as well as possible. The low-dimensional space is a space of probability with just a relative distance meaning between points. Consequently, if you fix some key points like the gravity centers of each cluster from the first result, and reuse their position in the new t-SNE generations' 2D low-dimensional map, the new data should organize themselves according to those fixed points. All you have to do is to take every new interaction and modify the position of the key points to keep them fixed. The other points should progressively move according to those key points, and you should get at the end comparable results.
