Elegant way to store anonymous users with nick names in django?

I have a simple Post model in my django app: class Post(models.Model): category = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=choices) message = models.CharField(max_length=500) user = models.ForeignKey(User, editable=False) I'd like to implement the feature of having anonymous users create posts with nick names. Unfortunately django doesn't allow you to save an instance of AnonymousUser as a foreignkey to the Post class. I was thinking of adding a "dummy" user record into the db that represents the anonymous user(id=0, or some negative number if possible) that would be used for all posts without a user. And if it is present a nullable name field would be used to represent the nickname of the anonymous user. This solution seems a bit hacky to me. Is there any cleaner more effecient solution?
