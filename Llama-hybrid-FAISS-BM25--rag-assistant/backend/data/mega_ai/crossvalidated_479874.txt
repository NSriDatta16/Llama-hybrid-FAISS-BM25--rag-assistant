Machine-learning technique to predict children's wealth

In our study we analyze wealth inheritance over 10 generations. We have wealth data for each individual and their respective ancestors and descendents. Now I want to expand the analysis in a way that I can predict for each family their expected income. As data I just have wealth for each family z in generation t, t-1, t-2, ...t-10 for 7000 different families. Furthermore I have the years and the family names. What kind of machine learning technique would you suggest for this prediction?
