I think it is not possible to answer your question as it stands, but maybe it is possible to make some comments that might assist your investigation. Design. You are making two kinds of comparisons and they are structurally different. So your design will not be a simple two-factor ANOVA with three levels of each factor. Let's look at the sub-designs within your grand experiment. (a) Across time. Consider one of your three groups. Each subject will have an exam at three time points: pre, post, and follow-up. When you compare pre vs. post, you should be looking at the difference between pre and post for each subject in the group. If you compared only pre and post, that would amount to a paired test (a paired t test, if your test scores are nearly normal). The generalization of 'pair' is 'block'. So each subject can be considered a block with three scores. Within each group, we have a a block design as a sub-design for the grand experiment with three groups. (If scores are not normal, a Friedman test might be used for the comparing time periods across blocks.) (b) Among groups. Now consider comparisons among groups. To simplify initially, suppose each subject in each group has one score which is the average of pre, post, and follow-up scores. Because different groups involve different subjects, this part of the analysis will consider three independent groups. If there were two groups (with normal scores) it would like a 2-sample t test. The generalization of a 2-sample t test to three groups is a one-factor ANOVA will three levels of the factor. (If scores are not normal, a Kruskal-Wallis test could be used to start investigating differences among groups.) (c) Synthesis. In analyzing the data, I would probably want to do (a) and (b) first, and if circumstances permit, make a larger design for the whole experiment. If data are normal and variances across groups and times are about the same, then you could make a partially-hierarchical ANOVA design that includes comparisons among methods, comparisons among times, and possible interactions between methods and times. [A priori, it is conceivable be that the AVITAR group could show huge differences across time while the Treatment group shows smaller differences (or none). That would be a group-by-time interaction. If present, it might complicate overall comparisons among groups. So it is worthwhile to design and perform the more complex ANOVA, if possible.] Computer analysis. I see no feasible way to do the analysis of your experiment by hand. Preliminary bits and pieces, perhaps. But not the whole thing. So the prospectus for your experiment will have to discuss the steps and pieces of the analysis and how they might be done using software. To some extent, you will have to have a good look at your data before you can know exactly what kinds of tests to perform initially. And then to see whether a grand ANOVA design is feasible, and if not, what can be used as a substitute. You say you don't want to use SPSS, and I would never argue with anyone wanting to avoid SPSS (or any other specific software). But you will have to learn how to do the analysis using some kind of software, or find someone who can do it for you. [I did an analysis roughly similar to the one required here about 30 years ago; fortunately, suitable software had been available for at least 20 years at that time.]
