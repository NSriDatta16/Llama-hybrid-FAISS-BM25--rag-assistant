The documentation for ctsem says it can handle time-dependent and time-independent exogenous variables. Here is some of the documentation, there is much more. Hierarchical Bayesian Continuous-Time Dynamic Modeling https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310747801_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Continuous_Time_Dynamic_Modeling See page 6. Subject level latent dynamic modelThe subject level dynamics are described by the stochastic diﬀerential equation: $$dη(t)=Aη(t)+b+Mχ(t)dt+GdW(t)$$ (1) In Equation 1 the time-dependent predictors χ(t) represent exogenous inputs to the system, such as an intervention, that may vary over time and are independent of ﬂuctuations in the system
