Distortion/Water in WebGL

I'm relatively new to WebGL, and OpenGL too for that matter, but in recent days I've filled up most my time writing a little game for it. However, when I wanted to implement something like heat waves, or any sort of distortion, I was left stuck. Now, I can make a texture ripple using the fragment shader, but I feel like I'm missing something when it comes to distorting the content behind an object. Is there any way to grab the color of a pixel that's already been rendered within the fragment shader? I've tried rendering to a texture and then having the texture of the object be that, but it appears if you choose to render your scene to a texture, you cannot render it to the screen also. And beyond that, if you want to render to a texture, that texture must be a power of two (which many screen resolutions do not quite fit into) Any help would be appreciated.
