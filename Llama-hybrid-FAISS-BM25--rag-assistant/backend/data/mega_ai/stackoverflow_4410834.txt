Recursive function taking ages to run

I profiled my code and found that my program spent roughly 85% of the time executing this particular recursive function. The function aims to calculate the probability of reaching a set of states in a markov chain, given an initial position (x,y). private static boolean condition(int n){ int i = 0; while ( n >= i){ if( n == i*4 || n == (i*4 - 1)) return true; i++; } return false; } public static double recursiveVal(int x, int y, double A, double B){ if(x> 6 && (x- 2 >= y)){ return 1;} if(y> 6 && (y- 2 >= x)){ return 0;} if(x> 5 && y> 5 && x== y){ return (A*(1-B) / (1 -(A*B) - ((1-A)*(1-B))));} if(condition(x+ y)){ return (recursiveVal(x+1, y,A,B)*A + recursiveVal(x, y+1,A,B)*(1-A)); } else{ return (recursiveVal(x+1, y,A,B)*(1-B) + recursiveVal(x,y+1,A,B)*B); } } I was once told that 99% of recursive functions could be replaced by a while loop. I'm having trouble doing this though. Does anyone know how I could improve the execution time or rewrite this as a iterative loop? Thanks
