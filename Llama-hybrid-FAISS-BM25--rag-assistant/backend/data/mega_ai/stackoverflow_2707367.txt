My Perforce Eclipse Plugin works only partially

I installed Perforce plugin version 3.4 on Eclipse Ganymede, configured my connection and workspace. My perforce perspective works just fine. However, when I work in the Java perspective, and I right-click any file in the project explorer, the "Team" context menu does not display the perforce options to check-out, sync etc. It only has the options "Apply patch" and "Show local history". This is super-annoying! Help, anyone?
