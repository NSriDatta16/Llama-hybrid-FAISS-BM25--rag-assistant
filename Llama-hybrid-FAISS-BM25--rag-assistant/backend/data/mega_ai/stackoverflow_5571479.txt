"using namespace ...." Why?

I am new to C++ programming and we make use of Turbo C++ (old IDE) to compile our programs. The problem is that in Turbo C++ we never make use of namespaces or even std::cout while programming. We just type cout Recently, I began using Visual C++ 2010 to write my programs and we supposedly have to use 'using namespace std' or 'std::' here. But, I got the output even when I used just cout Therefore, I am failing to understand the use of namespaces. Could someone help me out ? Regards!
