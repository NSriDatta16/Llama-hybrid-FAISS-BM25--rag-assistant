iPhone: Can I split a ViewController's implementation into more than one file?

So say I have: MyViewController.h MyViewController.m I'd like to have: MyViewController.h MyViewController1.m MyViewController2.m (or however many I need) Kind of like partial classes in .NET, it just makes it easier to organize things... So is there a way to split an implementation up to more than one file? If so how do I do this? and note that my viewcontroller has a .xib associated with it. Thanks
