Did you try running PEVerify on the exe/dll to see if there are any issues? Did you try running ngen on it to see if ngen fails? Can you post the failing code or a small repro of your issue? And a few things to look for: Is the lambda in a gigantic method? (that is, is it closing over a lot of values?) - Try to move it out so that this is not the case Are you using a delegate type that has a COM object in the params or output? (I've had issues with that in the past)
