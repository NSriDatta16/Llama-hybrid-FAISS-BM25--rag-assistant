Your brain is the best drawing tool. I prefer to develop a database schema in a simple text file. At first it contains just the table names, attributes and foreign keys: company: company_name ... employee: name age company_name -> company ... ...: The syntax is not important. It just needs to be clearly arranged and easy to change. Later I add types and CHECK() constraints, so the text file gradually transforms into valid SQL code. Using a drawing tool in that early stage is just distracting, because it encourages to waste your time with moving reactangles. Instead, let your brain build a picture of the schema in the same way it creates fantasy pictures while reading a book. As the schema grows, it becomes necessary to support the brain by creating an overview . Here, however, pencil and paper are faster than any drawing software. Also note that there is no need to clutter an overview with unimportant details. Just sketch the table names and the most important relationships (foreign keys). Any further details will decrease the value of this overview. However, if you really feel more comfortable with extremely detailed graphics than with text files and overview graphics, you might want to try DBDesigner4 or WWW SQL Designer .
