Using jquery grid or another grid product with Azure

I have an azure cloud application where my data is kept in tablestorage. I've been using home made grids to access the data but I would now like to try out using another product such as jquery grid or the jquery ui grid product. Has anyone tried using these? How well do they fit with the tablestorage model. Hope someone can help me. Thanks, Mariko
