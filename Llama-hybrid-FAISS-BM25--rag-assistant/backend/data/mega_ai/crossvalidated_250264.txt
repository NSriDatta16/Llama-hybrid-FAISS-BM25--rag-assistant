Covariate in a MCMC regression

I am using MCMCglmm ( vignette is here ) and am willing to add a covariate. If I were to be doing a standard linear model, I would for example choose a type 1 Sum of Squares and place my covariate in first position to make sure successive variables are computed on the remaining variance but I don't know if the same type of logic applies to a MCMC regression. Ultimately, my question is how can one add a covariate to a MCMC regression? Of course, an answer that is specific to the function MCMCglmm is very much welcome.
