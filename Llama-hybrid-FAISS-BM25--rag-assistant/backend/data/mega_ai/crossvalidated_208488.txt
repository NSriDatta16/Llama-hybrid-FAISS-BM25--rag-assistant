Two reasons come to mind, aside from the MSE explanation above (the commonly accepted answer to the question): Managing risk Efficient testing Risk , roughly, is the sense of how much something can explode when certain conditions aren't met. Take superefficient estimators: $T(X) = \bar{X}_n$ if $\bar{X}_n$ lies beyond an $\epsilon$-ball of 0, 0 otherwise. You can show that this statistic is more efficient than the UMVUE, since it has the same asymptotic variance as the UMVUE with $\theta \ne 0$ and infinite efficiency otherwise. This is a stupid statistic, and Hodges threw it out there as a strawman. Turns out that if you take $\theta_n$ on the boundary of the ball, it becomes an inconsistent test, it never knows what's going on and the risk explodes. In the minimax world, we try to minimize risk. It can give us biased estimators, but we don't care, they still work because there are fewer ways to break the system. Suppose, for instance, I were interested in inference on a $\Gamma(\alpha, \beta_n)$ distribution, and once in a while the distribution threw curve balls. A trimmed mean estimate $$T_\theta(X) = \sum X_i \mathcal{I} (\|X_i\| Efficient testing means you don't estimate the thing you're interested in, but an approximation thereof, because this provides a more powerful test. The best example I can think of here is logistic regression. People always confuse logistic regression with relative risk regression. For instance an odds ratio of 1.6 for cancer comparing smokers to non-smokers does NOT mean that "smokers had a 1.6 greater risk of cancer". BZZT wrong. That's a risk ratio. They technically had a 1.6 fold odds of the outcome (reminder: odds = probability / (1-probability)). However, for rare events, the odds ratio approximates the risk ratio. There is relative risk regression, but it has a lot of issues with converging and is not as powerful as logistic regression. So we report the OR as a biased estimate of the RR (for rare events), and calculate more efficient CIs and p-values.
