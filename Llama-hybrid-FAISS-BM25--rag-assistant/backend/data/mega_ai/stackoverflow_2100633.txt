Actually writing my own middleware was easy enough: from django.http import HttpResponse class NoCacheMiddleware(object): def process_response(self, request, response): response['Pragma'] = 'no-cache' response['Cache-Control'] = 'no-cache must-revalidate proxy-revalidate' return response Still doesn't really behave like i wanted but so neither does the @never_cache decorator
