Why won't this println command start a new line?

Here's the relevant code: public static void printBoarders (Territory x) { int t = 0 ; int n = 0 ; for (int i = 0; i When I run this, I get everything on one line without a line break. Why isn't the System.out.println (" ") ; creating a line break? Here is an example of what the output winds up being: Northwest Territory, Alberta, Kamchatka, hidavid-names-macbook-pro:~ davidname$ EDIT: the problem was that this method was never being invoked. A different one which i was replacing was. All is well.
