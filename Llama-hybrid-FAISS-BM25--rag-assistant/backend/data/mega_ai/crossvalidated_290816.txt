I would look at what this is doing to your predictions! Since Reservation and Dinner are both dummy variables, the coefficient for Reservation:Dinner will only subtract from your predicted value when both variables have a "1". So the interpretation here would be: "For groups that have a reservation (specifically) for dinner, we expect the amount spent per person to be $.0125 less on average than groups that did not have a reservation (inclusive) or were eating lunch"
