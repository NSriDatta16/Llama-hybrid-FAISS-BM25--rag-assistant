I tryed to give an answer to similar question in What skills do I need to become a data scientist? And how to show them? , there are a lot of online courses and they are pretty usefull but if you feel like they are oversimplified you can try other courses from Stanford and Mit for example, like: Stanfords Machine Learning Class Introduction to convolutional neural networks for visual recognition Also, Data Science performs better when you have basic knowledge of the subject area, Digital Image Processing from Rich Radke will give you the basics to understand CV algorithms, he also has a course in Computer Vision for Visual Effects that is marvellours. Udacity and other online courses come from universities. Is important to note that Data Science is academia is still getting confy and until there the courses will discuss a lot about that is really relevant to teach. Don't get me wrong, books are lovely but if you look for rigorous books such as Bishop's you might be a little outdated, while if you only use books such as Data Science from Scracth and Data Smart your knowledge might still be a bit shallow. I suggest you try simplied crash courses such as Google's Machine Learning Crash Course but after that don't fall into the illusion you know everything. Most of theses shallow courses will get you ready for basic tasks and you can improve your knowledge gradually by making Kaggle's competitions and more deep courses later. If you don't get your hands on doing you might feel a bit disapointed and lose motivation. It is good to learn everything from the beggining but that is after you get knowledge of high level stuff. YOU SHOULD NEVER DO SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS FROM ZERO WHEN YOU ARE WORKING . Don't be offended your code will surelly be bad and unefficient at first, so unless popular libraries are REALLY lacking in functionality you need, use them. Note: You should try to get your hands on with OpenCV and Algorithms such as Random Forests and such. Don't fall for Deep Learning yet, it is easy for you bud really expensive for computers and organizations since they usually take long to train and if you're a good programmer you know that most things don't work in the first time around.
