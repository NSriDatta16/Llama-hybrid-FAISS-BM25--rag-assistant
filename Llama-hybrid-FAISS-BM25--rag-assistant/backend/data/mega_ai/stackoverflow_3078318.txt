Use a derived table... SELECT myvalue FROM ( SELECT something+this+that AS myvalue FROM mytable ) foo WHERE myvalue = 10 Or use a CTE which looks more elegant but is the same ;WITh myCTE AS ( SELECT something+this+that AS myvalue FROM mytable ) SELECT myvalue FROM myCTE WHERE myvalue = 10 Or a computed column so it's usable normally ALTER TABLE MyTable ADD myvalue AS something+this+that
