Do I need to use window.onReady() after embedding a script asynchronously?

I'm implementing functionality that loads a script asynchronously. After the XHR has completed, I insert the code into the document and call a callback method. The callback method uses that dynamically loaded code. What I am wondering is that does my callback get called before the appended script is parsed? Do I need to use window.onReady() and let the browser engine parse the appended script and fire window.onReady() and just then call my callback method? Please do not tell me to use , because I am doing this to learn. Edit: Or, should I insert a script element with the src and async set, and listen to the script element's readystatechange event?
