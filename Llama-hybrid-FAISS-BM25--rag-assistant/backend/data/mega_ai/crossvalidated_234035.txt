Averages of the same population but different samples

Let's assume I have a finite population N and that I draw two samples from it n1, and n2. A single sample can belong to both samples. Calculating the averages for each sample and the confidence intervals is simple enough. I want to know can I combine the two samples somehow to obtain a tighter confidence intervals on the average.
