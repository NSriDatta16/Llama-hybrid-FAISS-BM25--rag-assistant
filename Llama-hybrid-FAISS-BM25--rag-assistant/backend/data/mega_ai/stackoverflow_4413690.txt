Magento product attribute + custom properties?

I'm trying to set up a hotel reservation system using Magento, and I'm a bit lost with the following issue: Each room has the attribute values for MaxOccupancy, MaxAdults, MaxChildren and MaxBabies set up by the administrator, detailing how many people can stay in some room (For instance, in some cases, even if MaxOccupancy is not exceeded, the hotel has rules for how many children can stay in any room). I also need to allow the customer to specify how many people s/he's trying to reserve for. I think it should be done using custom options (eg, dropdowns for Adults/Children/Babies), but it looks like connecting all that (including that the dropdowns need to be populated using only valid ranges for the current room) will be huge. My question is: is there an easier way, or my idea is the only way of solving this? In any case, if somebody's has gone through the same, I'd appreciate some hints... Thanks!
