How to get ul structure from HTML

I am making a configuration page, that splits a category tree over 3 columns for easy browsing like: **Column 1** **Column 2** **Column3** Category1 Category3 Category5 *SubCategory1* Category4 *SubCategory5* Category2 *SubCategory4* *SubCategory6* *SubCategory2* etc. *SubCategory3* I am using jsp, jquery, and struts2. What I am trying to do is configure the order in which categories/subcategories are displayed. Now I show the structure like that, and I am able to drag them from a column to another, sort the categories of a column and sort the subcategories, using jquery and modifying directly the HTML, but I don't realize how to get the data of the modified structure to persist it over my DB.
