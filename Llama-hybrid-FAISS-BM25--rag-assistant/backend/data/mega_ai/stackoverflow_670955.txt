What kind of code size are we talking about? If you only have 10-20 classes, you probably don't need to (and shouldn't) over-organize your code into packages just for the sake of it. As your project grows, the first distinction you want to make is to separate user-interface code from the underlying data model and the logic. Having cleanly separated layers is crucial in order to be able to do proper unit testing. If you're having trouble in getting rid of the circular dependencies, it is probably the case the the classes are actually interdependent, and should reside in the same package. Getting the abstraction layers right is probably one of the most important aspects when designing the overall code structure.
