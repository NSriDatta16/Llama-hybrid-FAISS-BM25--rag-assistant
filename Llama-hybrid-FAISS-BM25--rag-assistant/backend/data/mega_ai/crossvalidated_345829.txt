How would a frequentist solve this?

I think i understand what bayesian viewpoint is and what frequentist viewpoint is. But i always feel like i am missing something. I think there is a blind spot. so as an attempt :- Can somebody explain how would a frequentist solve this? Suppose there is a mixed school having 60% boys and 40% girls as students. The girls wear trousers or skirts in equal numbers; the boys all wear trousers. An observer sees a (random) student from a distance; all the observer can see is that this student is wearing trousers. What is the probability this student is a girl? ref I do not think given just this much a frequentist can solve this. But, I don't know btw if a frequentist cannot solve this why have i not heard Bayesian interpretation touted louder than frequentist interpretation. It has always been 'it depends on you whom you want to be.'
