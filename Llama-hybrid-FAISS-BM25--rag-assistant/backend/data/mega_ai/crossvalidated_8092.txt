A standard approach would be to do PCA and then show a scree plot, which you ought to be able to get that out of any software you might choose. A little tinkering and you could make it more interpretable for your particular audience if necessary. Sometimes they can be convincing, but often they're ambiguous and there'a always room to quibble about how to read them so a scree plot may (edit: not!) be ideal. Worth a look though.
