I don't know anything about Mac OS X kernel programming, but that "raw data array" you posted is instantly recognisable as ASCII text. It is the string /Volumes/storage/test2.dmg . (The usual "UNIX way" to pass a file from userspace to the kernel is for the userspace application to open the file and pass the file descriptor in).
