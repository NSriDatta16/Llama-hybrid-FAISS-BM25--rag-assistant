Find max value of random forest regressor output

I was wondering, for scikit learns regressors (extra trees, random forest regressor etc), how can i find the combination of inputs that would give me the max value of the target variable? Other than brute forcing all possible inputs,is there a smarter way? There's no documentation on this on scikit learn and would like to know more :) Thank you! EDIT: @gurg , What i mean is, say i have train = pd.read_csv(blah) dataset,target = splitDatasetTarget(train) # split to target and label data clf = ExtraTreesRegressor() clf.fit(dataset,target) #lets ignore the train test split part now i have a model that is able to predict for a certain input (row), i have an output (value). How would I be able to find for which values of inputs do i get the max value of my target variable? (Assuming the target variable is bounded finitely) The only way i can think of is randomly trying different combinations of: clf.predict(data) then seeing which data gives me the largest output
