Creating new variable and new data rows for country-conflict-year observations

I'm very new to R, still learning the very basics, and I haven't yet figured out how to perform this particular operation, but it would save me lots and lots of labor and time. I have a dataset of international conflicts with columns for country and dates that looks something like this: country dates Angola 1951-1953 Belize 1970-1972 I would like to reorganize the data to create variables for start year and end year, as well as create a year-observed (call it 'yrobs') column, so the set looks more like this: country yrobs yrstart yrend Angola 1951 1951 1953 Angola 1952 1951 1953 Angola 1953 1951 1953 Belize 1970 1970 1972 Belize 1971 1970 1972 Belize 1972 1970 1972 Someone suggested using data frames and a double for-loop, but I got a little confused trying that. Any help would be greatly appreciated, and feel free to use dummy language, as I'm still pretty green to the programming here. Thanks much.
