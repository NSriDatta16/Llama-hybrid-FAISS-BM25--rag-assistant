Multi-threading strategies? (Modifying a scene in a multi-threaded engine through an Editor)

I'm trying to write an editor overtop a multi-threaded game engine. In theory, through the editor, the contents of the scene can be totally changed but I haven't been able to come up with a good way for the engine to cope with the changes. (ie delete an entity while the renderer was drawing it). Additionally, I'm hesitant to write code to manage locks at every instance I use an entity or resource that can be potentially deleted. I imagine there has to be a relatively more elegant solution. Does anyone have any ideas or strategies I can start looking at? Thanks!
