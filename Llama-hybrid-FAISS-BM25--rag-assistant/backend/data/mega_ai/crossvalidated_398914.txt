In order to predict the observed series ....... The goal of ARIMA modeling is to separate the observed data to signal and noise .....this flowchart is useful to understand the why's and wherefores of ARIMA MODELLING. https://autobox.com/pdfs/ARIMA%20FLOW%20CHART.pdf The noise component is what has to be stationary i.e. invariant with constant expectation and variance. if not "THEN REMEDIAL ACTION IS REQUIRED TO MAKE IT SO OR APPROXIMATELY SO" by adding or subtracting structure/components. As the flow diagram indicates deterministic structure e.g. seasonal pulses , level/step shifts , time trends and depending upon the type of data daily effects, holiday effects et al need to be identified and used to adjust/condition the original data into a set of values that will be subsequently analyzed for auto-regressive structure. Quoting the reflection by AdamO Interrupted Time Series Analysis - ARIMAX for High Frequency Biological Data? ..."The correlogram (ACF/PACF) should be calculated from residuals using a model that controls for intervention administration, otherwise the intervention effects are taken to be Gaussian noise, underestimating the actual autoregressive effect." The aforementioned adjustments allow one to compute the acf and pacf ( in reality regression and partial regression coefficients) statistics in order to n impute the ARIMA model form via pattern recognition (decay,cutoff etc ) . This is an iterative process much like peeling back an onion and correctly done can lead to a useful model. Now the forecast equation is used to project forward based not only on any needed deterministic structure BUT the stochastic ARIMA structure. Hope this helps ....
