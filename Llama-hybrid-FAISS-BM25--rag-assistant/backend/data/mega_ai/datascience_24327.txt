How to implement a convolutional autoencoder?

I would like to implement a convolutional autoencoder in Tensorflow, but it is not clear how the decoder part should work. Each layer of the encoding, is a convolutional layer with activation function and then a pooling layer. But how will the decoding work? I know that I have to add padding in each layer, but what will be the reverse of the convolution? How will it reproduce the original data from much less variables and the padding?
