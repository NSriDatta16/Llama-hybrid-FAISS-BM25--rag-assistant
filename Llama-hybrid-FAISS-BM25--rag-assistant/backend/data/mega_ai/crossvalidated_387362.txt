My aim is to predict if a house to going to be sold in the coming year. So your aim is classification . For such problem you can use logistic regression to predict the probability that it is going to be sold, or other classification algorithm (e.g. random forest, XGBoost, kNN etc). For hints what to use with imbalanced classes, check questions tagged as unbalanced-classes , but logistic regression doesn't have problems with imbalanced classes. This would be a regression problem if you were going to predict things like the price for the house, or other numeric value. If you were going to predict the time that you are going to wait until it gets sold, you would be possibly using survival analysis .
