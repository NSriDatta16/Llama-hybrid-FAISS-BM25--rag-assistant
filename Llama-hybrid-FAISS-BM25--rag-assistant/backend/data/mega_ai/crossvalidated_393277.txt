Is the grid in a self organizing map static?

I'm trying to write my own SOM in python, and after reading material from several sources (and watching video tutorials) I think I understand all the steps. There is however one issue that I want to make sure I understand correctly - once I decide on a grid (let's say a rectangular N*M grid with a distance between grid points of d ) - is this grid static, for the sake of calculating the neighbors of each neuron/node? is d always the same? As the neighbors radius shrinks (every iteration or epoch) do I still go back to the same 2D map with the exact same N*M positioning and d distances between them? Edit for clarification - when I say static I mean static in the 2D space of the grid itself.
