Nice idea, can't see how it would benefit from being done in a relational database though. I think if you are in SQL you pretty much have to use standard keys, otherwise what is the point of the expensive storage you have? Perhaps it would be better suited to file based storage where each table is in a different file. Or, have it as an additional column but don't put a primary key on it. P.S. Wouldn't it fall over if two users are in the same groups? Ryan
