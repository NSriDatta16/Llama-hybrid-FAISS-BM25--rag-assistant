UITableView's indexPathsForVisibleRows incorrect?

When I check for a table's visible indexPaths with ' indexPathsForVisibleRows ' during UIScrollViewDelegate's scrollViewDidScroll and scrollViewDidEndDragging , it seems to be accurate. But sometimes just when scrolling and dragging is ending and ' cellForRowAtIndexPath ' is invoked, the call to ' indexPathsForVisibleRows ' returns 0. There are rows visible on-screen so I know it can't be 0. As soon as this happens, I can invoke UITableView::visibleCells and get a non-zero value. Why does this discrepancy exist?
