For notation we'll use $k$ for the number of successes. Remember that the 95% confidence interval of $k$ is not the interval where the population average lies. The 95% confidence interval shows us that if you repeat your experiment many times we expect 95% of the sample means to lie in that interval. If you want a confidence interval of $\frac{k}{100-k}$ you have to deal with one problem first. If you repeated the experiment many times there is a chance that you get $k=100$, this gives you an undefined value which you cannot say is inside or outside a confidence interval. To fix this just define $\frac{100}{0}=\infty$. Now we can say that it is outside of any finite interval. You are lucky, the relationship between $k$ and $\frac{k}{100-k}$ is a special case where we have that one value increases only when the other increases. This means that your idea was correct. If you repeated the experiment many times you would find 95% of values for $k$ are in $(25.9,45.3)$, for the special case this implies that 95% of the values for $\frac{k}{100-k}$ are in $\left(\frac{25.9}{100-25.9}, \frac{45.3}{100-45.3}\right)$
