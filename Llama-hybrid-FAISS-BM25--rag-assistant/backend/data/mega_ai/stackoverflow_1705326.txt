1) The rate of change of the signal You can easily calculate the rate of change of the signal with respect to time by either differencing or doing a polynomial fit and differentiating. You might also want to think about some sort of time averaging, because differentiation tends to make functions "jumpier", since the continuity is one order less than the function from which it's calculated. 2) An extrapolation/prediction of what the signal value will be in X seconds/minutes time Once you have the answer to the first part, it's an easy matter to extrapolate. Just beware - extrapolation is always a dangerous thing, especially if the derivative is changing rapidly in time. Some sort of smoothing, averaging, or filtering is your friend here. Another approach might be to take an FFT and do a term-by-term differentiation of the result.
