When to divide data into training & test set in logistic regression?

I am using Logistic Regression in a low event rate situation. Overall universe: 46,000 Events: 420 Conventional logistic regression models divide the data into training and test sets and compute the error rates. The final coefficients and threshold levels are chosen and a model is created. OTH, I'm just trying to prove that so and so coefficient is significant and has positive association with the event in study. I'm not developing a model as of now. I don't focus on error rates (too many true negatives!) and chose my threshold level ~ hit rate. Should I consider dividing my universe into 2 samples, the conventional way? With such a low event rate, I'm worried that doing this to bias my coeff. estimates.
