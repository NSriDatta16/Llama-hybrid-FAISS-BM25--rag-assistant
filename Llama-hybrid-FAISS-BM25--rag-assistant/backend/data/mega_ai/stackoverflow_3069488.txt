A String (System.String) is a type defined inside the .NET framework. The String class is not mutable. This means that every time you do an action to an System.String instance, the .NET compiler create a new instance of the string. This operation is hidden to the developer. A System.Text.StringBuilder is class that represents a mutable string. This class provides some useful methods that make the user able to manage the String wrapped by the StringBuilder. Notice that all the manipulations are made on the same StringBuilder instance. Microsoft encourages the use of StringBuilder because it is more effective in terms of memory usage.
