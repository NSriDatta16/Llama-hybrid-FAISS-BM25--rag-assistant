Bayesian Statistics - How to weight a Poisson distributed response

I have a Bayesian GLM where the response that I'm interested in is count data. I want to weight the the response by the variance to account for uncertainty in the measurement. If the response was normally distributed (or well above zero), I would use this formula in a Bayesian model coded in JAGS: N[i]~dnorm(muN[i], tau.psd[i]) tau.psd~pow(psd[i],-2) muN[i] Where N[i] is my observed data at each site i, psd[i] is the standard deviation of the observed data at each site i and fixed[i] is the fixed effect I'm interested in. Because count response is bounded by zero, and values are often low and close to zero (range 0-15), predictions from this model give unobservable negative values. However the poisson distribution (dpois) only take the mean as a parameter: N[i]~dpois(lambda[i]) log(lambda[i]) How would you weight this distribution by the variance?
