No, collinearity and autocorrelation are not the same thing. Collinearity is a relationship among different independent variables. In exact collinearity one IV is a linear combination of other IVs. In approximate collinearity, it is nearly so. Usually, collinearity isn't present to a problematic degree. Autocorrelation is the relationship of a variable to an earlier version of itself. I am not expert on time series, but I would say that autocorrelation is the rule, rather than the exception. It's hard to think of a variable where the value at time T would not be related to the value at time T-1.
