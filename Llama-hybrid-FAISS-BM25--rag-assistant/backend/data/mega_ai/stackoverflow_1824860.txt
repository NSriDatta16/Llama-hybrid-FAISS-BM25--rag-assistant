Implement two filters in one condition - SQL

I am creating a report. In that I am displaying total no of leads, leads sent via Fax and Leads sent via SMS. I wrote a procedure to fetch the records . Here I have to check an condition that both Leads sent via SMS and Leads sent via Fax should not be zero. If both are zero I should not fetch the record. If one of them has any value i should fetch the record. Is it possible implement it through SQL Query. FROM OP comment to astander SELECT C.ClientID , C.ClientName , C.OrganizationName, C.FirstName , S.SMSOverageRate , '' as Cost , Count(*) as TotalLeads , Sum(CASE DeliveryViaFax WHEN 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FaxCount , Sum(CASE DeliveryViaSMSEmail WHEN 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS SMSCount FROM CMN_LeadSaleDetails S INNER JOIN CMN_LeadClients C ON C.ClientID = S.BuyerID WHERE C.SellerTenantId = @TenantId AND S.SellerJournalID = CASE @JournalId WHEN 0 THEN S.SellerJournalID ELSE @JournalId END GROUP BY C.ClientID , C.ClientName , C.OrganizationName, C.FirstName , S.SMSOverageRate
