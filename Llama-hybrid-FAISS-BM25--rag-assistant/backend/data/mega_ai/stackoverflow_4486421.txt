Building on Adil's answer, this is what I came up with and seems to work. It doesn't seem to quite pick up every single point if you try and draw a continuous line of points so it needs some further optimization but it does get the job done: @Override public void run() { mDrawing = Bitmap.createBitmap(mWidth, mHeight, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888); Canvas tempCanvas = new Canvas(); tempCanvas.setBitmap(mDrawing); Canvas c = null; while(mIsRunning) { int size = mPoints.getSize(); for(int i = 0; i
