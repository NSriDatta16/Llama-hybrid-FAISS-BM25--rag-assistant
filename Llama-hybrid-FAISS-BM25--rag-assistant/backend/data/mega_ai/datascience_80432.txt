So the question asks if you can retrain the model after adding another feature. Answer is yes but you need to instantiate a new model which can accept a 3-feature/dimensional input. This is due to the mechanics of neural networks whereby in the 1st layer, the features in your original model would be multiplied by a ( $2 x n$ ) matrix where $n$ represents the number of hidden neurons in the second layer of the model. Therefore by multiplying a ( $3 x 1$ ) input with the weight matrix will throw an error.
