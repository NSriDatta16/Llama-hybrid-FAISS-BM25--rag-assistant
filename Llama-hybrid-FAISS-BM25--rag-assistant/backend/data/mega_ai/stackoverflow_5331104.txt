If I understand those terms correctly the difference is the one between a literal (like "asdf" or 1.0f ), being a "physical" constant that might either be substituted during the compilation or saved in a special storage, and a constant variable ( const char* or const float ) which is a logical one. You can't distinguish those in your program and definitely shouldn't try to :)
