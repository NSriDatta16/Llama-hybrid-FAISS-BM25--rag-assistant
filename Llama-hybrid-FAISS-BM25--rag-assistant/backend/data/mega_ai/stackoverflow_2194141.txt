Including a fragment of WSX file

I am separating out logical sections into fragment *.wxs files, but how do I include them in my main Product.wxs using Votive and Visual Studio? I am referencing the component in the main wxs file but receive and error that the component is not found. I'm assuming I'm not linking these correctly. Error 13 Unresolved reference to symbol 'Component:RegistryEntries' in section 'Product:{A5CA93A2-91B2-46CA-B681-07451DCCCDCB}'. RegistrySettings.wxs ... Product.wxs Privileged 1
