Short Answer Yes, logistic regression is a regression algorithm and it does predict a continuous outcome: the probability of an event. That we use it as a binary classifier is due to the interpretation of the outcome. Detail Logistic regression is a type of generalize linear regression model. In an ordinary linear regression model, a continuous outcome, y , is modeled as the sum of the product of predictors and their effect: y = b_0 + b_1 * x_1 + b_2 * x_2 + ... b_n * x_n + e where e is the error. Generalized linear models do not model y directly. Instead, they use transformations to expand the domain of y to all real numbers. This transformation is called the link function. For logistic regression the link function is the logit function (usually, see note below). The logit function is defined as ln(y/(1 + y)) Thus the form of logistic regression is: ln(y/(1 + y)) = b_0 + b_1 * x_1 + b_2 * x_2 + ... b_n * x_n + e where y is the probability of an event. The fact that we use it as a binary classifier is due to the interpretation of the outcome. Note: probit is another link function used for logistic regression but logit is the most widely used.
