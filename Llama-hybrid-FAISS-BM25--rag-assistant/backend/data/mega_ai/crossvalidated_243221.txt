Recursive neural network implementation in TensorFlow

Is there any available recursive neural network implementation in TensorFlow TensorFlow's tutorials do not present any recursive neural networks. Most TensorFlow code I've found is CNN, LSTM, GRU, vanilla recurrent neural networks or MLP. I am most interested in implementations for natural language processing. Example of a recursive neural network: The tree structure may vary between different inputs. I.e., I do not want the tree structure to be fixed.
