Unless you want to visualize a scenario when they are fixed to particular values, you basically need to integrate out the other dimensions. The simplest, generally applicable method for approximating integrals is Monte Carlo . Gaussian Process is a probabilistic model, you can easily sample from it. To approximate the integral, just take many samples and average the dimensions you don't care about.
