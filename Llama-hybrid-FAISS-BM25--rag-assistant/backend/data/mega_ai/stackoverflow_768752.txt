I think there are basically three reasons for this: Organic Growth - Have you ever used GWT? I don't know about most people, but for me, none of the marketing material on the GWT site was very convincing. Then I ran into a little small personal project that required integration with Google maps and app engine. I decided to try GWT since the tools made it so easy. Using it once, even for an extremely modest project has completely changed my mind. I suspect this means there has been a lot of word of mouth propagation of the framework over the past 6 months. Maturity - The early versions weren't used by Google all that much (little dogfooding) and were a bit rough around the edges. The latest releases seem to have solved most of the growing pain issues (though compile times are still too high, imo) and have turned it into a solid, usable framework. Styling - They've started including a set of default skins. I think this has helped their demos to look quite a bit more impressive for recent releases, whereas some people were confused in the past by the "no-styling out of the box" approach that the project had taken. I'd be really shocked if any of these apply outside of Java shops, though. I haven't seen GWT making inroads into non-Java environments at all, and I think their current direction makes non-Java success even more unlikely.
