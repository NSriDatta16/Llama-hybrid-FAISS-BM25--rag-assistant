Does the restrict keyword provide significant benefits in gcc/g++?

Has anyone ever seen any numbers/analysis on whether or not use of the C/C++ restrict keyword in gcc/g++ actual provides any significant performance boost in reality (and not just in theory)? I've read various articles recommending / disparaging its use, but I haven't ran across any real numbers practically demonstrating either sides arguments. EDIT I know that restrict is not officially part of C++, but it is supported by some compilers and I've read a paper by Christer Ericson which strongly recommends its usage.
