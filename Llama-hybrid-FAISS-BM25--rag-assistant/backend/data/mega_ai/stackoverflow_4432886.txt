Jailbroken iPhone 3G with iOS 4.2.1 can't be debugged with XCode

I'm trying to debug my applications with XCode 3.2.5 and jailbroken iPhone 3G with iOS 4.2.1. When I start debug with enabled breakpoints, application can't start (it stucks on 'Default.png' screen) and I get Data Formatters temporarily unavailable, will re-try after a 'continue'. (Can't find dlopen function, so it is not possible to load shared libraries.) message in GDB. When I start debug without enabled breakpoints, application starts without problems. I tried to do steps decribed there , but without any results. When I used iOS 4.1 there was a problem with reboots . On every connect of the iPhone Organiser displays this message: **Unknown iOS detected** Xcode does not have debugging information for the version of iOS on the device named “iPhone”. Xcode can collect debugging data from the device to enable development with this version of iOS. This process only needs to be done once per iOS version, and will take several minutes. Thanks for any help!
