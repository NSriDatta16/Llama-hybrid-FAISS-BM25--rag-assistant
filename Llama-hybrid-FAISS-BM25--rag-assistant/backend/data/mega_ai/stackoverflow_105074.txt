UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifier), also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifier), according to RFC 4122 , are identifiers designed to provide certain uniqueness guarantees. While it is possible to implement RFC-compliant UUIDs in a few lines of JavaScript code (e.g., see @broofa's answer , below) there are several common pitfalls: Invalid id format (UUIDs must be of the form " xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx ", where x is one of [0-9, a-f] M is one of [1-5], and N is [8, 9, a, or b] Use of a low-quality source of randomness (such as Math.random ) Thus, developers writing code for production environments are encouraged to use a rigorous, well-maintained implementation such as the uuid module.
