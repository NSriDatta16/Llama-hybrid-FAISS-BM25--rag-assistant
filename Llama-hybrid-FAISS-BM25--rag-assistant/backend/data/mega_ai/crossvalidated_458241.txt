Don't. A hypothesis test aims to test an hypothesis, or rather the null hypothesis (this is beside the point here). But you know that your models are different because, as you write, you have different machine-learning models. I guess what you want to know is something like whether approach A is consistently, or on average, better than B. That is what the numbers (mean and se) tell you. More importantly, they also tell you how much better A is than B. You don't get any further information from knowing the hypothesis-test results. Side note: As AUC approaches 1, estimates become non-normally distributed, making the sem less useful than the confidence interval. Also, sensitivity to differences decreases as AUC approaches 1, and I have seen people compare $e^\text{AUC}$ rather than AUC itself in this situation.
