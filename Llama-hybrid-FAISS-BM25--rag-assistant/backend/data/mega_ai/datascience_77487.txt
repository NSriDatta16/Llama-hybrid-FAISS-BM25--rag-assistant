You will observe a lack of blogs because post above points Libraries don't have a very simple implementation. So, need to get your hand dirty yourself. I am assuming, you are thinking to move into Computer vision. - Object detection - Object segmentation - Object recognition - Try all of the above using some custom data. - Face detection/Recognition - Get the knowledge of Classical Image processing . You don't need DL every time. - Learn OpenCV - Video data analysis - Follow latest research paper Or Commercial products on CV Jason Brownlee and Adrian Roserbrock have suggestions for CV on their blogs. To add to this I would like to point to a very beginner friendly blog which helped me to get an overall understanding -> blog This covers the basics of computer vision from where you can have a better understanding of how to use CNN in image processing.
