Securing a REST API

I am in the middle of developing a PHP social media web application which will be supported by various web services each operating a REST API. Web services will probably be implemented in Java with MySQL data layer but the whole point of what I am trying to do is make it really easy to implement modules in different languages/data stores depending on what is approriate. So for example when the user logs into the application via a login form the PHP code connects to a web service and POSTs the username and password to check if they should be authenticated. I would normally at this point start a session and store it in a session data store. Another example could be if a user sends a private message to another user. The message would be POSTed to the private messaging web service which would take care of all the storage. Similarly the web service could be contacted to retrieve messages for a user. Although I understand how to implement the REST web service in Java and make the connection to it in PHP I am totally unsure as to how to secure the data being passed and make sure that it is the users data being returned. If for example I want to get all of user As private messages how does the web service know to return that users. I could pass that users identifier as part of the GET url but then surely any old user could just figure out the GET url and use it to look up other peoples messages. I thought maybe I could pass over the session identifier and IP address which would allow me to check the session data store and make sure it is the correct user? To secure the data that is important - like the username/password I thought I would just pass it over SSL. Hope this explains my problem better. Thanks
