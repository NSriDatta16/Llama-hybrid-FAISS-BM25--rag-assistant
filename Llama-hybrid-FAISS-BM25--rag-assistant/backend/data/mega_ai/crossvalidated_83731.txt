Would a Bayesian admit that there is one fixed parameter value?

In Bayesian data analysis, parameters are treated as random variables. This stems from the Bayesian subjective conceptualization of probability. But do Bayesians theoretically acknowledge that there is one true fixed parameter value out in the 'real world?' It seems like the obvious answer is 'yes', because then trying to estimate the parameter would almost be nonsensical. An academic citation for this answer would be greatly appreciated.
