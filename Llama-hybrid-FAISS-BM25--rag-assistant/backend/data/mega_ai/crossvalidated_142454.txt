From what I understand, the PCA is used to reduce the dimension of your problem. Example: Let's say you have 10000 features to train a Neural Network. This would take too much time to train. So you use Princial Component Analysis to find relations between the variables and you reduce the feature number to 1000 (which now they are not exactly the same features as before, but a projection in other plane). In this process you lose some information and you can calculate this using the variance explained here Hope this helped! Tiago
