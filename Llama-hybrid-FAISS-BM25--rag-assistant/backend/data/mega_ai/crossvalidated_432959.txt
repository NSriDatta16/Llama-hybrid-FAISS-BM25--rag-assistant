Presenting results of estimation with sub-sampling

I have a dataset that we can partition between three groups: Controls, Treated 1 and Treated 2. I want to run regressions that include the whole Control and Treated 1 groups, but I draw a random sample from Treated 2 of the same size as Treated 1. Then I regress my outcome on dummies for Treated 1 and Treated 2, together with controls. I repeat this procedure several times, drawing a new sub-sampled for Treated 2 each time. For the moment, I present the results indicating the average coefficient of Treated 1 and Treated 2, together with their average p-values. Is this the most meaningful way to present the results? What I would like to highlight is that Treatment 1 is, in general, not significant, whereas Treatment 2 is significant.
