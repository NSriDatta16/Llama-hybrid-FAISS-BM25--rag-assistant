In the book that I have it says that only recently some papers have begun to explore multivariate regression where one or more variables are circular. I have not checked them myself, but relevant sources seem to be: Bhattacharya, S. and SenGupta, A. (2009). Bayesian analysis of semiparametric linear-circular models. Journal of Agricultural, Biological and Environmental Statistics , 14, 33-65. Lund, U. (1999). Least circular distance regression for directional data. Journal of Applied Statistics , 26, 723-733 Lund, U. (2002). Tree-based regression or a circular response. Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods , 31, 1549-1560. Qin, X., Zhang, J.-S., and Yan, X.-D. (2011). A nonparametric circular-linear multivariate regression model with a rule of thumb bandwidth selector. Computers and Mathematics with Applications , 62, 3048-3055. In case for a circular response you have only a single circular regressor (which I understand that is not the case for you, but maybe separate regressions would be of interest as well) there is a way to estimate the model. [1] recommend fitting general linear model $$\cos(\Theta_j) = \gamma_0^c + \sum_{k=1}^m\left(\gamma_{ck}^c\cos(k\psi_j)+\gamma_{sk}^c\sin(k\psi_j)\right)+\varepsilon_{1j},$$ $$\sin(\Theta_j) = \gamma_0^s + \sum_{k=1}^m\left(\gamma_{ck}^s\cos(k\psi_j)+\gamma_{sk}^s\sin(k\psi_j)\right)+\varepsilon_{2j}.$$ The good thing is that this model can be estimated using the function lm.circular from the R library circular .
