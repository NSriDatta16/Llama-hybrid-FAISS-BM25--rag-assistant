Share & track code snippets in-house?

Is there an online tool to share and track code-snippets between a team of developers? My team mate is sitting right next to me and GTalk isn't really adequate for pasting larger snippets. How can I "copy-paste" or drag a source file or snippet to share between coders? It should remember all previous snippets and be available to the whole team. I'd rather not resort to email. Or do I need to roll my own?
