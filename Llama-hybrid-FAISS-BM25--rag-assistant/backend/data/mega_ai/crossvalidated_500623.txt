How to count the number of independent parameters in a Bayesian network?

I'm currently going through Prof. Daphne Koller's probabilistic graphical models course on Coursera and had a question regarding an exercise problem. The problem is as follows: How many independent parameters are required to uniquely define the conditional probability distribution of $C$ in the graphical model below, if $A$ , $B$ , and $D$ are binary, and $C$ and $E$ have three values each? My approach is that since $C$ is dependent on $A$ and $B$ (i.e., the CPD of $C$ is $P(C\ \vert\ A, B)$ ) and $A$ , $B$ , and $C$ each have 2, 2, and 3, values, respectively, we can write $2 \times 2 \times 3$ . But we have to subtract $1$ since knowing all but the last values of $P(C\ \vert\ A, B)$ automatically determines the last. Therefore, we get $(2 \times 2 \times 3) - 1 = 11$ independent parameters. Where am I going wrong? Any tips are appreciated, thanks.
