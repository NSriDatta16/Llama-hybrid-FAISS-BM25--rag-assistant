For a Bernoulli likelihood, the variance is a function of the mean such that: $$\text{var}(Y) = E(Y)(1-E(Y))$$ It turns out that a sigmoid function, also called the "inverse link" (for a logistic regression) function: $S(x) = \frac{\exp(x)}{1+\exp(x)}$ has the property that: $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} S(X) = S(X)(1-S(X))$$ It turns out this property holds for all GLMs using canonical parametrizations for exponential families.
