You are using a confusing terminology. Alotugh there are several way to express the same concept, note that one observation is one instance. One instance can have multiple characteristics/features/columns/variables/... Now for what it concerns computing the average of classes, the mathematical formula would be: \begin{equation*} \mu_i = \frac{1}{N_i} \sum_{x \in \omega_i} x \end{equation*} for the class average and for the global average: \begin{equation*} \mu = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^C N_i \mu_i \end{equation*} Where $\omega_i$ denotes a class label, $N_i$ are the class sizes and $n$ the total number of samples. In your JAVA related situation, if you have 10 classes but only 3 instances per class, expect poor results. Anyway, class average for class 1 would be computed as (if your columns are the features and the rows the observations) as: avg = [(a1+b1+c1/3),(a2+b2+c2/3),(a3+b3+c3/3)] And that would be a three dimensional vector, not a single scalar. As you are working with multi dimensional data you cannot expect that the mean is a single number only.
