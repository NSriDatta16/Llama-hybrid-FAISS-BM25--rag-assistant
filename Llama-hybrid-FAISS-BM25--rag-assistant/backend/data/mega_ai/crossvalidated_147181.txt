Mixed models: wrong random intercepts and interpretation issues

I have a dataset of individuals that participated in several races, but not all individuals did every race. Of every individual I have their average speed. My goal is to have a measure of how difficult the race was (under the assumption that the average speed of all individuals is lower for more difficult races). My intuition was to build a mixed model where I specify a random intercept for every individual. Then I also added a fixed effect for ‘race’. I hoped that coefficients of the factor ‘race’ would be additive on the random intercept, where negative values would mean on average a more difficult race (slower speed) and positive values an easier race (higher speed). My current model looks like this (I use the R package lme4 ): fit = lmer(Av_speed ~ (1|individual) + race, data = df) But then I still have a fixed effect when I look at the summary. I also tried to suppress the fixed intercept: fit = lmer(Av_speed ~ (1|individual) + 0 + race, data = df) But then I have fixed effects for every race. (The value of the race coefficients looks like the mean speed for that race.) What am I doing wrong? Is a mixed model the right solution for this problem? What do the random and fixed effects in my model mean?
