Taken from this website The simple answer is to use the net user /add (/domain) , however it is possible to automate not only the addition of the user, but also his/her addition to groups and the creation of a template user account directory structure. Many organizations have a basic structure with word, excel directories and some template files. This can be automated with a basic script. For example REM addnew.bat net user %1 password /add /homedir:\\ \users\%1 /scriptpath:login.bat /domain net localgroup " " %1 /add REM repeat for local groups net group " " %1 /add /domain REM repeat for global groups xcopy \\ \users\template \\ \users\%1 /e nltest /sync /server:BDCname REM repeat for all BDCs you might be authenticating to sleep 20 cacls \\ \users\%1 /e /r Everyone REM remove the everyone permission to the directory cacls \\ \users\%1 /g %1:F /e cacls \\ \users\%1 /g Administrators:F /e
