You are correct that the cost function of linear regression is convex, meaning it has a single global minimum. In theory, this property ensures that gradient descent algorithms, such as ordinary least squares, should converge to the global minimum, even in the presence of multicollinearity . However, multicollinearity can still pose challenges for gradient descent : Slower Convergence: Multicollinearity leads to high condition numbers in the design matrix, making the cost function very steep. Gradient descent can become slow in these cases because it takes smaller steps to converge. The algorithm may require more iterations to reach the minimum. Numerical Stability: Severe multicollinearity can make the problem numerically unstable. The gradients may become extremely large, causing numerical instability and making it difficult for the algorithm to converge. Ill-Conditioned Matrices: When multicollinearity is severe, the design matrix can be close to singular, causing issues in matrix inversion or solving linear systems of equations during gradient descent updates. This may lead to convergence problems. To address these challenges when using gradient descent in the presence of multicollinearity , you can consider the following approaches: Feature Selection or Dimension Reduction: If you suspect severe multicollinearity , consider feature selection techniques or dimension reduction methods (e.g., principal component analysis ) to reduce the number of highly correlated features. Regularization: Regularization techniques, such as Ridge (L2) or Lasso (L1) regression, can help mitigate multicollinearity by adding penalty terms to the cost function. These methods encourage coefficient values to be small and can stabilize gradient descent . Data Preprocessing: Standardize or normalize your input features to ensure they are on a similar scale. This can help gradient descent algorithms converge more quickly and accurately. Advanced Optimization Algorithms: Consider using more advanced optimization algorithms like L-BFGS, which can handle ill-conditioned problems more effectively and converge faster than vanilla gradient descent. In summary, while the convexity of the linear regression cost function theoretically ensures convergence in the presence of multicollinearity , the practical challenges associated with steep cost surfaces, numerical stability, and ill-conditioned matrices can slow down or complicate gradient descent.
