you should take the average of the accuracy of 10 results to give a specific value? Which metric(accuracy, specificity,sensitivity,area under ROC curve) you want to show in the results generally depends on the objective of the problem. Sometimes it's better to go for accuracy or Area under the ROC curve and sometimes people would like to have good sensitivity as the criteria.For highly imbalanced data people prefer area under the ROC curve instead of accuracy because getting a high accuracy with imbalanced data will not be a problem.
