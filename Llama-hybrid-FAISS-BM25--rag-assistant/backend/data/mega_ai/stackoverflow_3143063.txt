If you have viewstate enabled you do not need to handle the NeedDataSource event when expanding a nested view. When a GridDataItem is set to expanded the DetailTableDataBind event fires and binds the data for the nested view. I had the same issue and broke the retrieval of my data into two steps to accommodate the RadGrid.
