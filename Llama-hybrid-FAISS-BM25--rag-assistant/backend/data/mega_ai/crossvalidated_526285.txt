I think what I would do is run PCA both ways, or even three ways: Just use the first visit of each person Average each person's visits into a single entry Use all data And then compare the results from each approach. If the numbers come out roughly the same, allowing you to draw the same conclusions, then it didn't matter. But if they differ it forces you to learn something interesting about the data. Are the people who did more visits qualitatively different in some way? (E.g. competitive sporty types who decided they were going to go away and train for the arm strength direction they were worst at, then come back and be tested again.)
