You noted that there is superresolution, which is a kind of "information adding" to images. The opposite is quite possible but not very useful since lowering resolution can be achieved by many non-machine learning techniques. You can try: Get your high resolution images and camera specifications to use basic image processing to transform images to a result similar to the one of another camera. Camera Resolution: Is easy to do with proper image resizing, try different interpolation algorithms. Sensor Specifications: how sensitive to light is the sensor? what is the bit depth for color/intensity? Those are things to consider. Sensor Amplifier and Other Lightning Condition: Basically, ISO, White Balance and such. Try changing these conditions to achieve the desired result Notes: If there is difference is sensors construction (For Example one is CMOS and the other is CCD) it might be useful to use "underresolution" that you want to create, since there is large difference in response to light saturation and such. When training, check for image alignment since this can yield absurd differences for least-square image similarity (you should try using SIMD)
