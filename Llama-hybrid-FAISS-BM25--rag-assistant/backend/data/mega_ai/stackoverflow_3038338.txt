Command line tool in python in a fixed root directory

I would like to install my python application as a command line tool that should work entirelly inside the install directory (for example C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\application) The problem is I would like to reffer in runtime to the submodules and resources from within the application directory three. If I install the app with [console_scripts] option the default path is the current directory. Is there a elegant way to keep the current execution path of the application to the site-packages directory? Thanks
