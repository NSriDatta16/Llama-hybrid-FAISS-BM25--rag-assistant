You can add the XML file into resources of your application. You do that by dragging to resources directory in Xcode, and in popup select copy file to project. When your application run you open the file by referring to it by it's name, read in the XML, parse it with NSXMLParser and extract required data. No need to convert to plist. This assumes that the xml data is static and you don't indent to update and save it.
