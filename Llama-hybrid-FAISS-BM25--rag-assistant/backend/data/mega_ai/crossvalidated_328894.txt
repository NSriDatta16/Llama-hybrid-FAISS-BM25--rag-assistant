You need some how to be able to represent numbers for each region which is saying that the violence in the last X years decreases or better then , I will take your current example and will try to think with you together : The difference/change between numbers/number of violence in ea year : region1 : 10,-220,230 region2 : 387,147,201 Now , Lets take the number of times there was positive/negative change and the total change size: region1 : 2 positive = 230+10= 240, 1 negative = 220 region2 : 4 positive = 387+147+147+201 = 882 , 0 negative = 0 Now we can average and say something about each region : region1 in the last 4 years had ~ 240/2= 120 positive changes and ~220 negative changes. region2 in the last 4 years had ~ 882/4 = 220 positive changes and ~0 negative changes. conclusion : The total change for region 1 : ~120-220 = -100 The total change for region 2 : ~220 region 1 is more violent then region 2. Now....I know this is not exactly what you are looking for but this can give you some sense about which way you should look for (:
