InterlockedIncrement works by using machine level instructions to increment and store a value in an atomic manner. Meaning no operation can be performed on the value and the storage location during the process. It is of concern any time multiple threads or processes or accessing the same value. So a shared variable in a multi-threaded application, or shared memory for multiple processes. I don't believe the instruction disables interrupts, at least on x86 type hardware.
