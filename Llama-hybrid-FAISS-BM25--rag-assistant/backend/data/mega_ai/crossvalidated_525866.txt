Biased estimates in logistic regression due to class imbalance

I was asked by a reviewer to evaluate the robustness of the results of logistic regression, given that estimates can be biased by class imbalance in the outcome. To contextualize, I have run three different models, where the outcome all have a probability of about 25% (I wouldn't even say that this is imbalance). The objective was to analyze the association between the outcome and some covariates, not to predict future observations. I saw related questions, but none helped me formulate an answer to this argument. Should I refute it, by saying that the outcome is not really imbalanced? Or, as @whuber wrote, pointing out that Logistic regression tends to work well and give values reasonably close to the correct parameters even when the outcomes are imbalanced. Any tip or reference is appreciated. Thank you!
