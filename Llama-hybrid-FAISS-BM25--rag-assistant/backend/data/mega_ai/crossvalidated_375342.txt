Your assumption on Silhouette is wrong: The silhouette of a one elemental cluster leads to a division by zero (there is no average distance to other members of the same cluster). The authors defined the value of one-elemental clusters to be 0. So when k -> N then Silhouette tends to 0 by definition .
