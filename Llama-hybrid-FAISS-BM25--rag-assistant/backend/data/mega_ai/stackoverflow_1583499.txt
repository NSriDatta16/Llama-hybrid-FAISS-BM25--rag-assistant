I second Python, and Ruby too. Re-read Design Patterns... then learn Python, and realize quite a lot of design patterns are actually stopgaps trying to patch a defective language like C++. When classes are first-class objects, for instance, the Factory pattern becomes obsolete. Just pass the class, it is after all an instance factory. Python classmethods are also an extremely powerful tool, and the inheritance works. Many design patterns are workaround for languages that lack closures, builtin delegates, etc... For instance, in Javascript : button.onclick = function(){ some code } Simple, elegant, and powerful... in C++ you'd have a lot more work !
