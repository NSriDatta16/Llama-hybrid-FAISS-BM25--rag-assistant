its clear to me that the data is sent in an array. In order to fix that i created function that rewrites the array. $brands=$data['brand_id']; $t=count($brands); $inhoud=""; $i=1; foreach ($brands as $brand){ if ($t == $i){ $inhoud.=$brand; } else { $inhoud.=$brand." , "; } $i++; } //echo $inhoud; // $br=array('brand_id'); $br=$inhoud; $data['brand_id']=$br; the DATA saved in the database would look something like this: 104 , 106 , 107 , 108 i do this cos i read somewhere that this was necessary to do so. How ever when i open my edit field the only one which shows : selected="selected" is the brand with the value 108 (the last one) this is a problem because i need all 4 of them to be shown as selected. Has this something to do in the way how i save this data ...not sure if the data should be saved as an array to show all selected="selected" fields in the edit by the way the expert_id is something else and not an issue here i know the sql should be somewhere else but since i am still learning magento this was a quick a dirty method to fix a problem i had earlier... all i want to know is how to store the array to show all values as an selected="selected" field in the edit form...Txs.... Ok i fixed the problem the data should be saved as 106,108,114,99 now everything is selected in the edit field strange nothing of this is to be found here on the internet hopefully it will be helpfull to other people dealing with the same problem
