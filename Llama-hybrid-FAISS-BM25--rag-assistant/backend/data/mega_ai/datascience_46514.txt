How to convert binary classifier to multiclass classifier?

I am a biggener student in Machine learning, and I want to ask if is it possible to convert a binary classifier label (y) by applying some condition on column1 to get a third situation. I.e. Instead of having just 2 cases "Easy" and "Difficult" as output, I need to apply a condition on an additional feature in order to get as output "Easy", "Normal", "Difficult". and I need also some keyword that can I use on Google as a request to look for solution.
