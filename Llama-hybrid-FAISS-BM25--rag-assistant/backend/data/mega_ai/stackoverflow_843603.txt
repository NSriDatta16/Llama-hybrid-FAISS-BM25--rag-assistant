To restate your problem, you need to determine which interface broadcast UDP packets were received on. If you bind to the wildcard address you receive the broadcasts, but there is no way to determine which network address the packet was received on. If you bind to a specific interface you know which interface address you are receiving on, but no longer receive the broadcasts (at least on the Linux TCP/IP stack.). As others have mentioned, there are third party raw sockets libraries for Java such as RockSaw or Jpcap , which may help you determine the address of the actual interface.
