Should I use logistic mixed effects? How?

I've run an experiment in which different subjects had to make a number of decisions, which are stored in the dependent boolean variable Y (0 or 1). I have multiple independed variables which may influence the outcome, namely an ordinal variable containing integers running from -4 to 4 (o1), two nominal variables which may have three values (n1 and n2) and the ID number of the test subject (ID), which is of course nominal. Now the obvious question is how Y depends on o1, n1 and n2. I figured that because Y is a boolean, you want to make a logistic regression model to calculate the chance of the outcome being 1. Because both nominal and ordinal independend variables are used you would use multinomial logistic regression. (Right?) Someone in my lab suggested to use a mixed effects model, because the intercept might vary per subject. He had me look up linear mixed effects. But would it not make more sense to use a logistic mixed effects? Then, my next question is: how can I make this model using software? I plan to use either SPSS or Matlab/octave. I apologise if this is a duplicate question, but an internet search did not answer my question.
