Java web start app crashes with OutOfMemoryError

I have extended a genomics viewer with some features requested by the Johns Hopkins Lab. When I run the app from the command-line I seem to have no memory problems - the app has been started with -Xmx750m. However, when I run the same app as a web-start app with the following heap settings: after a while the app crashes with an OutOfMemoryError thus: ERROR [2011-01-12 16:28:22,437] [DefaultExceptionHandler.java:42] [AWT-EventQueue-0] Unhandled exception java.lang.OutOfMemoryError at java.util.zip.Inflater.init(Native Method) at java.util.zip.Inflater. (Unknown Source) at java.util.zip.Inflater. (Unknown Source) There is no difference between the local app and web-start app except that I have signed the jars which are called out in the web-start jnlp file. I have tried to attach to the web-start app with both JConsole and YourKit Java profiler. In each case, I have turned on the HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError property by invoking the setVMOption operation of the HotSpotDiagnostic MBean; but when the app crashes, no heap dump is generated. It seems to me that the crash is related to running under web-start. I have tried very hard to cause an OutOfMemoryError on the desktop app - by reducing the memory (-Xmx250m); this causes the app to pause for long periods of time (as much as 5min) while presumably garbage collection is done. But the app always resumes after the pause - never crashes. Can anyone tell me of a way to capture a heap-dump on an OutOfMemoryError under web-start? Though, I suspect that I may not be actually running out of heap at all. But at least it would be a place to start. I am at my wit's end - any help would be greatly appreciated. I am running Java 1.6.0_20-b02 on Windows XP-SP2.
