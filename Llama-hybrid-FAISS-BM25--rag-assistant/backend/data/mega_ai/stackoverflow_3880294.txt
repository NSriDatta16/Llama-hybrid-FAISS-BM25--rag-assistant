Module-specific Controller plugins in Zend Framework

My Zend Framework project is divided into certain Modules. Each Module has some specific Controller Plugins. Now, the problem is that all plugins get loaded and registered (and thus, called) - no matter which module the user is trying to access. I could test in which module we are and stop execution directly in the plugins, but I would have to do this in each and every plugin... Is there an elegant way to register only module-specific plugins? Or am I trying to solve the wrong problem here?
