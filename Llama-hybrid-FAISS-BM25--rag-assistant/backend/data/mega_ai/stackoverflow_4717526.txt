When you want to migrate TSQL to Oracle, I advise that you first rewrite your SQL code in the most Orcale friendly way. First observation is, that you declare all string parameters as varchar(max). What would you do, if your code has to run on SQL-Server-2005. Would you chose varchar(8000), nvarchar(4000), text or ntext? Would varchar(4000) or nvarchar(4000) be aceptable ? This is not a question of length, but a question of datatypes. Do you need ugly CLOB parameters or can you go with nice varchar2? Good news: Oracle doesn't care about the length of varchar2 parameters. You don't play the game. We just increased the column size of column_x by 10 ( we don't want to waste storage you know) and now you can adjust these 10 stored procedures using the column. Second Better remove all square brackets [] from your TSQL, if you depend on them, you surely will have some trouble, when migrating to Oracle. Third Ask yourself tree times, If you really want to use dynamic sql. After a short glance at your code, I think I would try to rewrite it as direct TSQ, perhaps using some if else logic. You probably ask why. The answer is for the sake of performance. I only mention the keywords: bind variables, context, shared pool. Oracle has a limited resource, called shared pool, which tends to become a bottleneck, when you migrate dynamic sql from sql-server the easy straight forward way. Believe me better tune your SQL not to use dynamic sql than to take care of Oracle's special needs. Forth Use constructs which are similar in both systems analytical functions common table expressions (referred to as Subquery Factoring in Oracle documentation)
