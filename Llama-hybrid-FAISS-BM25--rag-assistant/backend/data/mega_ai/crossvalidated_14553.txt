If you are estimating an unknown probability $p$, then, assuming i.i.d. nature of your events, the count $X$ is Binomial, with variance $np(1-p)$, where $n$ is the total number of events. The estimated proportion is $\hat p = X/n$ with variance $p(1-p)/n\le 0.5 \cdot 0.5 / n = 0.25/n$ for any $p$. For a given margin of error $m$, you can say that, approximately, $\mbox{Prob}[ |\hat p-p|>m ] \le \mbox{Prob}[ |Z|>m/(0.5/\sqrt{n}) ]$ where $Z$ is the standard normal variate. (You can do exact calculations with pbinom if you really need to.) For a 5% tail probability, we have $m/(0.5/\sqrt{n})=1.96$; $n=(1.96/2m)^2$, so for 3% accuracy, we have $n=(1.96/(2\cdot0.03))^2 = 1067$. This gives you an answer to an unrelated question: Why are polls always conducted for the sample size of 1000 or so? (Answer: to get this 3% accuracy with 95% confidence.) You can of course approach this from the point of view of Bayesian updating with say a Jeffrey's prior $\propto [p(1-p)]^{-1/2}$ (i.e., $B(\frac12, \frac12)$ distribution), and getting your data in until variance of the posterior (also a Beta distribution) is small enough. The above derivation, essentially, assumes a flat prior, $B(1,1)$.
