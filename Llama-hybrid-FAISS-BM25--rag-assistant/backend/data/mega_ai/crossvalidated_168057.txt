For each fold, you are building a classifier that makes predictions for the observations. The classifiers within each fold have slightly different training sets and different weights, but they are all attempting to estimate the same underlying model. So yes, you can combine the predictions. If you have multiple predictions for one observation, you could take the average prediction of several folds, or weight the predictions so that the more accurate models have more influence than less accurate ones. This applies to any "ensemble learning" system. Predictions for different observations should be made on the same scale (e.g. from -1 to +1 or 0 to +1) so I can't think of any reason not to combine them.
