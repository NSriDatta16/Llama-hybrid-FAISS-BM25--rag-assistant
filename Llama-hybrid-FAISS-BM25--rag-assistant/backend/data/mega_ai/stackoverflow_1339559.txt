I recently tried out oxid eShop which I liked very much. It's pretty basic, yet very flexible and extensible. It's very easy to understand and comes with a nice AJAX interface. Also it's design can be changed with an interface editor that doesn't require you to know anything about programming. If you want to have a first look at it without installing it here's the link to the store and to its admin area . The login for the admin area is admin/admin(user/pass). It might not be as feature-complete/professional as for example Magento which is a full-fleged shop-system, but I'm pretty sure that's exactly what your friend needs. It also has been featured in the july's issue php|architect .
