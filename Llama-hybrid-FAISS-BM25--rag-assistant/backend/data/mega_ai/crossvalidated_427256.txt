Interpretation of p-values in ARIMA model

I am starting my journey in time series analysis and forecasting and I'm currently facing some doubts. If I fit an ARIMA model to my data and I get for example an ARIMA(2,1,2) in which the p-value for the second AR term is >0.05, should I re-estimate the model without that term? Also, I must note that I'm using an automatic algorithm that estimates the parameters through maximum likelihood. Could this mean that I misconfigured the algorithm? Thanks in advance for any help.
