Given that Java's objects methods are virtual by default, I do not see any use for upcasting at all. Where have you seen tutorials reporting that upcasting was necessary? That is the first time I hear of it for Java. (Note that it has a meaning in C# or C++ - but it is usually a mark of bad design.)
