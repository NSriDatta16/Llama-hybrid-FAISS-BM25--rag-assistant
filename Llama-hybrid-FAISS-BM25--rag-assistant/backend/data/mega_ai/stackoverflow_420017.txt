Even when running windowed, you need to create a primary surface, only it is not a flippable surface. //full screen settings hr = DirectDrawCreate(NULL, &m_pDD, NULL); hr = m_pDD->SetCooperativeLevel(m_hWnd, DDSCL_NORMAL); ddsd.dwSize = sizeof(ddsd); ddsd.dwFlags = DDSD_CAPS; ddsd.ddsCaps.dwCaps = DDSCAPS_PRIMARYSURFACE; Besides of creating a surface, most likely you will want to create a clipper for the window. For a complete sample see paragraph Running windowed in this GameDev article .
