Obviously it wouldn't be the recommended method of storage, since one is LIFO and the other is FIFO. To queue, you would push your integer onto the stack. To dequeue, you would have to pop all integers off the stack, get the last integer, and push all other integers back onto the stack. Have a temporary stack where you push all the integers as you pop them off, get your answer, then pop all integers off the temporary stack back onto your main storage.
