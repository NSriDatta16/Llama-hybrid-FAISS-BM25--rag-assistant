Building and controlling a scheduled task or service from a web application

I'm building a web application that will need to import data from other database servers when it starts. I would like to have this import done automatically at regular intervals. I would also like to be able to start and stop the import process from my web application. What would be the best implementation for the import agent - a Windows Service? Something else?
