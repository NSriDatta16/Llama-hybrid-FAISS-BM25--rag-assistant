Game theory is quite involved in the context of Multi-agent Reinforcement learning (MARL). Take a look at stochastic games or read the article An Analysis of Stochastic Game Theory for Multiagent Reinforcement Learning . I would not see GT as a prerequisite for RL. However, it provides a nice extension to the multi-agent case.
