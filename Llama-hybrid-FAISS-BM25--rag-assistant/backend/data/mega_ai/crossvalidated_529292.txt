Why Assumed Density Filtering is also called Moment Matching?

I am learning about Assumed Density Filtering (ADF) and Expectation Propagation in the context of bayesian deep neural networks. I have seen in some textbooks and papers that ADF is also called moment matching. Is it called moment matching because we always solve it by minimizing KL Divergence by showing the moments of two distributions match? is this the reason behind it?
