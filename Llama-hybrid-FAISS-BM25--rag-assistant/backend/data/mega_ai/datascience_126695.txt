As stated, the question is underspecified. You're essentially asking, "what modeling approach will always work?" Use the XGBoost regressor and you won't go far wrong, even if you're unwilling to put much thought into model selection. It will identify usefully informative features, whether continuous or (one-hot) categorical, and produce a plausible answer. Devoting more thought to the strengths of different model families and the peculiarities of your input data may suggest to you even better models for your (undisclosed) use case.
