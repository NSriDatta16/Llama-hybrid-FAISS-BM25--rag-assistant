At least in what you just showed, there are syntax errors: if form.has_key("firstname") amd form["firstname"].value !="": print " Hello", form["firstname"].value, " " else: print " Error!Wrong! amd should be and , and both print statements should be indented deeper than the if and else keywords that control them. If you fix your syntax and try again, what exactly do you see in the browser (and what do you see if you use your browser's "show source" functionality)? Edit : One more syntax error: you're missing a closing " on the second print . It's really tiresome to spot all your syntax errors one by one, and Apache (or whatever your web server is) doesn't seem to be helping -- cgitb can't take control until the whole script is successfully parsed, so syntax errors are the one reason it can't show! And one more: missing colon at the end of the def main line. Why don't you just run it with python yourscript.py at the command line until you've made syntax-error-free, and only then try again to run it as a CGI? E.g. after fixing the two errors I spotted earlier but not the two I've just spotted, you'd be seeing (if python is on the PATH and the shell prompt is $ ): $ python acgi.py File "acgi.py", line 6 def main() ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax because of the missing " at the end of the previous line and missing colon at line 6. Fixing the last two errors (total of four in the code you originally posted) you finally see: $ python acgi.py Content-type: text/html Error!Wrong! of course it says "wrong" because the field storage is empty, but this shows you can NOW (with all four errors fixed) sensibly try to run it as a CGI script at last;-)
