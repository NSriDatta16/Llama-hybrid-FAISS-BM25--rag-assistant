Possible to block form fillers?

I have a Delphi (5) application that uses a log-in screen (standard user name/password) and have just found out recently that password storage applications can identify the log-in fields in the screen, even if they are obfuscated, and offer to save the information for the user. Due to the high security nature of our program, we don't want to allow that. So far, I have not been able to find any information on how to block these applications from detecting the fields or telling them not to try. Is either of these options possible? If not, is there another option available?
