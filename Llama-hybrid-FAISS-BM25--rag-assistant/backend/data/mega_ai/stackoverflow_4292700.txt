Worst case for quick sort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort, but quicksort is faster on average. As to why, it will take time to explain and thus i will refer to Skiena, The algorithm design manual. A quote that summarizes the quicksort vs merge/heapsort: When faced with algorithms of the same asymptotic complexity, implementation details and system quirks such as cache performance and memory size may well prove to be the decisive factor. What we can say is that experiments show that where a properly implemented quicksort is implemented well, it is typically 2-3 times faster than mergesort or heapsort. The primary reason is that the operations in the innermost loop are simpler. But I can’t argue with you if you don’t believe me when I say quicksort is faster. It is a question whose solution lies outside the analytical tools we are using. The best way to tell is to implement both algorithms and experiment.
