How to build a NN for classifying custom timeseries data?

I'm trying to learn a little bit of machine learning and it occurred to me that my own household produces a lot of interesting data. Specifically, the ModBus-enabled digital power meter installed a few years ago, does. I've done quite a bit of professional work manually producing ground truth for an OCR system, but I've never done any programming in this space. I do know Python, but no NumPy or anything like it. My question is threefold: Are my assumptions thus far valid? (Especially about being able to "label" or "tag" the data as shown below...) Is " Timeseries Classification " the thing I want to be doing (and is Keras the right tool for this project or is there a more suitable one)? And then, most importantly: How do the training data have to be treated to be able to train on them and then have unknown data classified or "tagged" like the GT? From what I believe to already understand about neural networks, the meaning of the input or output data does not matter much, just the way it's structured. Here's a short sample (incomplete, but all columns are numbers): timestamp powerl1 powerl2 powerl3 ... 1688379471 49.79 0 120.98 1688379472 51.29 0 134.26 1688379473 50.32 0 0 1688379474 3282.83 3843.32 3694.20 My goal is to train a neural network to be able to recognize which devices are currently running. I know that it's possible to infer this knowledge from the data I have available because there's prior work (most notably nilmtk , who seem to be trying to solve the problem with a much wider scope than just a single household, but also Adrien Petralia, a PhD student at Électricité de France; see this and this GitHub repo as well as this paper). For the above samples, to turn them into GT to be used for training, my idea is to add another column to them like so: ... devices_running aquarium_lights, gaming_PC aquarium_lights, gaming_PC aquarium_lights aquarium_lights, flow_type_heater (So perhaps someone was using the gaming PC, then switched it off and began taking a shower. All the while, the aquarium lights were on.) From the Keras tutorial linked to above, I understand I need to: read the data in (I know how to do this) standardize them ( does that mean evenly spaced periods of time? Can I just use the code from the tutorial for that?) build a model (in this step, what will be different with my data as compared to the tutorial?) train the model (that part seems like it'll always be the same once you have a model) I realize this question may not be specific enough to the StackExchange format. Please let me know in the comments if I can do anything to improve it.
