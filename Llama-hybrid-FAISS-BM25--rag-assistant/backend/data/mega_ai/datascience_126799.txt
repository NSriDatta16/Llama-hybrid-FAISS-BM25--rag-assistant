Minimize $\sum_i||Y_i-AX_i||^2$

I have N data vectors $X_i$ and N target vectors $Y_i$ where $i$ indexes the sample. I would like to learn a linear map $A$ between the data and the target i.e find the matrix $A$ that minimize $$\sum_i^N||Y_i-AX_i||^2.$$ Is that a well know machine learning problem ? What would be the equivalent model in scikit-learn ? I thought this is a linear regression, but in scikit-learn the documentation of the linear regression states LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients w = (w1, …, wp) to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation. So it seems like scikit-learn's linear regression learns a list of coefficients w = (w1, …, wp), not a matrix A.
