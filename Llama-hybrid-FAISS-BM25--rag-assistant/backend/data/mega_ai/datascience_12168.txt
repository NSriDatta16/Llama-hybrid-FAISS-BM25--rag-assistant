NLP Library or routine for Quantitative relationships

I'm searching for generalized methods and libraries to extract quantitative relationships between concepts in natural language. For instance Exam score greater than 90% Exam scores of 90% or greater Should extract to a structure like Exam Score,>=,90% I began with a simple regexp / dictionary method, but it feels very primitive.
