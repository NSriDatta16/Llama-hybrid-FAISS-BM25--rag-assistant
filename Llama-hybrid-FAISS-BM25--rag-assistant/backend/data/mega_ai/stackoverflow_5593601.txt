UIImageView won't load the image

I'm trying to explore UIImageView so I added an image "Logo.jpg" to my projet (I'm new to iPad programming) which is LoadImageProject but iI can't get this image load to my view? In my Interface builder ( LoadImageViweController.xib ) I drag a UIImageView and added it then connect it to the File's owner My code : LoadImageViweController.h { IBOutlet UIImageView *image; } @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIImageView *image; @end and in the implementation file LoadImageViweController.m i added this to the viewDidLoad method : - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; //declare the Image UIImage *logo = [UIImage imageNamed:@"Logo.jpg"]; // init the UIImageView with the logo image [self.image initWithImage:logo]; } When iI run it iI got always get blank screen? Why? Thanks.
