Should we compare the individual monthly forecasts with actual values?

Hi I am using Linear and exponential forecasting models to do sales forecasting. In the model itself, we use the forecasts of period t to get next forecast and so on. While analyzing the accuracy of the forecast using Mean Absolute Percentage Error, I get good results. But when I compare the intermediate forecast values of the model against the actual time series data, I can see some big Percentage Errors like MAPE might be 15%, but some of the intermediate percentage errors might be as high as 80% and some will be pretty low. So the MAPE averages out to low. I wanted to know 1) Is it wise to compare these intermediate forecasts with actual values? 2) Can we use these high intermediate forecast values to say that forecasts for so and so month might be unreliable?
