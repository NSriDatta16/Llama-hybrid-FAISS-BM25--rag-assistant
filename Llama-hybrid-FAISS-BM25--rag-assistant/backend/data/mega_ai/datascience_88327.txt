OpenAI has not released the weights of GPT-3, so you have to access it through their API. However, all other popular models have been released and are easily accessible. This includes GPT-2 , BERT , RoBERTa , Electra , etc. The easiest way to access them all in a unified way is by means of the Transformers Python library by Huggingface. This library supports using the models from either Tensorflow or Pytorch, so it is very flexible. The library has a repository with all the mentioned models, which are downloaded automatically the first time you use them from the code. This repository is called the "model hub", and you can browse its contents here .
