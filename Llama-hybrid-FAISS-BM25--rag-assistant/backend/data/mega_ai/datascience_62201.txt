Why does adding random pixels stop my model learning in cnn?

I am using a very simple model to classify a 224x224 RGB image. For a test, I have labelled my images (2 labels "Green" or "Red", 2,000 images of each) based on colour of a single fixed pixel from upper part of image. My simple model achieves very high accuracy and very low loss, until I add more "random" pixels to lower part of image. Why is my model getting confused? The model easily copes with: But, when I add more pixels in lower part of image - it achieves only 50% accuracy and high loss: These project is a bit facile but I am researching a simple image structure I can control. def VerySimpleNet(): model = keras.Sequential([ keras.layers.Conv2D(16, kernel_size=3, activation=tf.nn.relu, input_shape=(224, 224, 3)), keras.layers.Dropout(0.4), keras.layers.Flatten(), keras.layers.Dense(3, activation=tf.nn.softmax) ]) return model EDIT 1 Is it possible to add a bonus to Data Science questions to encourage more answers? EDIT 2 I would really be interested if anybody was keen to have a more interactive chat(email,txt?) with me on this question.
