You could implement your own session org.apache.catalina.Manager and swap it into Tomcat's configuration , although the interface looks rather lengthy - so perhaps look at extending ManagerBase or StandardManager first. As an alternative, register a HttpSessionAttributeListener to be notified whenever a session attribute is added/removed/updated. This won't change the default storage mechanism - the session data will still be kept in-memory as well - but it would let you persist the data with an alternative mechanism as well.
