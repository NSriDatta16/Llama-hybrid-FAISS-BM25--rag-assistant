Question 1 Recall the definition of the binomial distribution: a frequency distribution of the possible number of successful outcomes in a given number of trials in each of which there is the same probability of success. Compare this to the definition of the Poisson distribution: a discrete frequency distribution which gives the probability of a number of independent events occurring in a fixed time . The substantial difference between the 2 is the binomial is in $n$ trials, Poisson is over a time period $t$. How can the limit occur intuitively? Lets say that you have to keep running Bernoulli trials for all eternity. Moreover, you run $n = 30$ per minute. Per minute you count each success. So for all eternity you are running a $Bin(p,30)$ process every minute. Over 24 hours, you have a $Bin(p,43200)$. As you get tired, you are asked "how many successes occurred between 18:00 and 19:00?". You're answer might be $30*60*p$, i.e. you provide the average successes in an hour. That sounds a lot like the Poisson parameter $\lambda$ to me.
