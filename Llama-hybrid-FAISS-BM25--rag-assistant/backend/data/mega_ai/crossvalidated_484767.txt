Stationarity and Ergodicity - links

In time series analysis stationarity and ergodicit y have different definitions and meanings: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_process Essentially stationarity deals with the stability of an entire distribution (in a strict sense) or the first two moments (in a weak sense) given a temporal shift . However, ergodicity is need in order to give us the possibility of inferring population characteristics from just one finite sample. More precisely, ergodicity, for some moments, warrants that these sample moments converge to exact moments. Is possible to write examples where stationarity hold but ergodicity not. In Hamilton â€“ Time Series Analysis (1994, page 47) there is an example where the process is stationary (weakly and strictly) but not ergodic for the mean. So the sample mean is a biased estimator for the exact mean. Also from this example we can realize that ergodicity implies finite memory of the process. However this example is given in order to underscore that this sentences (same page): For many applications, stationarity and ergodicity turn out to amount to the same requirements. This conflates the two concepts, rather than keeping them separate. However, in my experience the stationarity condition is much more widely known and considered by practitioners than the ergodicity condition. In fact, several tests for stationarity are widely used, but I have never seen (a direct) test for ergodicity. For example, in the widely used $AR(1)$ process $$y_t = \theta_0 + \theta_1 y_{t} + \epsilon_t$$ the weak stationarity condition ( $0 ) implies ergodicity for the mean also. Is not rare to read that stationarity implies low persistency, see white noise vs random walk example. We can extend this rule on the general class of ARIMA models (see here: Why is ergodicity not a requirement for ARIMA models besides stationarity? ). Therefore stationarity seems to deal with memory also. Question : considering that ARIMA models represent the cornerstone of time series analysis, the simplification/conflation above seem me much more than an detail. Does there exist a relevant class of time series model where stationarity and ergodicity, in some form, are implied from clearly different conditions? Are there are some examples on real data? Are there graphs which could be useful for developing some intuition?
