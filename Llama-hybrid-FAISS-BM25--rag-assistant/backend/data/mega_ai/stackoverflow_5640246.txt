I won't explain exactly how to do this, but since you are doing something that involves some good understanding of windows, programming and administering I will simply give you a link to the source code that you can adapt into your project to manage the WMI security: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/system/WmiSecurity.aspx Basically what you should note is the following paragraph: So at this point, some examples should suffice to illustrate the use of the utility. Suppose you wanted to add the domain HelpDesk group to the CIMV2 and subsequent namespaces on the S223001 computer. Further, suppose this group should have the ability to remotely connect and read WMI objects. To do this: WmiSecurity /C=S223001 /A /N=Root\CimV2 /M=MyDomain\HelpDesk:REMOTEACCESS /R Hope that it can help. Cheers.
