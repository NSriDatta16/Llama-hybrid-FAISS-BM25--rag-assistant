The argument is a no-win. If you do manage to find a vulnerability, your co-workers will just change the SafeDBString function to account for it and then ask you to prove that it's unsafe all over again. Given that parametrized queries are an undisputed programming best practice, the burden of proof should be on them to state why they aren't using a method that is both safer and better performing. If the issue is rewriting all the legacy code, the easy compromise would be to use parametrized queries in all new code, and refactor old code to use them when working on that code. My guess is the actual issue is pride and stubbornness, and there's not much more you can do about that.
