Does anyone know how this visualization was made?

I've been tasked with implementing a visualization something like this one from the New York Times: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/05/sports/olympics/the-100-meter-dash-one-race-every-medalist-ever.html?hp Mine doesn't have to be nearly this amazing and sophisticated, but I'd like to capture at least some of the presentation elegance. I can't find any sort of behind-the-scenes discussion of this graphic. Does anyone have any idea how this might have been done?
