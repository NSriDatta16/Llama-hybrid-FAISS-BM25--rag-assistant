Ah, you've hit one of the common Python gotchas: default values are computed once, then re-used. So, every time __init__ is called, the same list is being used. This is the Pythonic way of doing what you want: def __init__(self, l=None): self.l = [] if l is None else l For a bit more information, check out the Python docs (especially about three paragraphs after that heading). Edit : There is a much better description in another answer .
