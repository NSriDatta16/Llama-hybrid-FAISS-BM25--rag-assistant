When you computed the tSNE representation of the data, presumably you used all of the data and so the data in your CV hold-out set was actually considered in your training data. It is built into the tSNE components. I do not believe that there is any way to predict the tSNE coordinates of new data points, so this method does not seem to be useful for building a classifier. PCA is another story. You could compute PCA on your training folds and then project new data onto the principal components (from training data only). As long as you do not compute the principal components using all of the data before applying other methods, this should be OK
