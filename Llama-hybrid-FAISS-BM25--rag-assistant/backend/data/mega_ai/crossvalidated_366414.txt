Group of word representations

For word representation baseline people use bag-of-words or word embedding. Here, I want to understand all approaches that can be used for word representations. For example: -Bag-of-words (tfidf, n-gram,etc.) -word embedding (GloVe, word2Vec, skip gram, etc.) etc. Is there any source/article that explains all of the word representation group? Does anyone have a good understanding and explain it here? thanks.
