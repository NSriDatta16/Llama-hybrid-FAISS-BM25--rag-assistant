Is there a tool to properly organize tag attributes for asp files?

I realize that VS200X can ident asp files properly, however, for the sake of ease in finding attributes, is there a tool that will also organize the attribute order within a tag alphabetically? I'm always scanning around a tag visually and if the attributes were sorted alphabetically, asides maybe from ID and runat which should remain first, I would have a much easier time.
