to set "Publisher" for JApplet

I have generated the keystore and its inner key. Then I signed my test applet. But each time I start my jnlp applet I can see the Internet browser security Warning dialog which shows that... Publisher: UNKNOWN From: http://localhost:8080... What I could missed? Please help me to set the Publisher. Any useful comment is appreciated :)
