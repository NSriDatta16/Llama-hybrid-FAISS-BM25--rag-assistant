Inference on random graph, with an application to mobile sensors

I've attended a course on Machine Learning and another one in Network Analysis, and I wonder if this two topics already intersect, in particular I'm interested in the following model: we have a mobile network (that is, the nodes perform a random walk in some area, then sending a message within some assigned range, let's say with radius r, communicating with every other node that in that moment is in that range). we take the point of view of a node and would like to infer as much as we can about the whole network (under suitable assumption, for example knowing or not knowing the total number of nodes, etc.), possibly in order to perform some achieved probabilistic version of well known distributed algorithm. Are there results with respect to this scenario?
