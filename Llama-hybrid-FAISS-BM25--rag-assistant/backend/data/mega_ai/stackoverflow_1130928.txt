Can I assume that the scripts are being executed from an onLoad event, so that the user isn't sitting at a blank page while it runs? If yes, then I'd recommend breaking the scripts into separate functions, creating an array of those functions, iterating through that array and evaling the functions, and updating your progress indicator after every N functions. And if it's a public-facing website, try to minimize the amount of JavaScript that's absolutely necessary to experience the page. And the amount of initialization that each widget needs. To paraphrase Agent Smith: what good are accordian-fold trees, if nobody waits to see them?
