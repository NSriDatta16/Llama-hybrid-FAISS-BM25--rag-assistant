MOSS 2007: How do I move Project Pages from the C: drive to another drive

I have two drives on my server, C: & D:. I am out of storage on my C drive and need to validate that the multiple project pages I have created are being stored on C. The URL string does not point to any specific folder on the server. How do I validate where project pages are stored, and if they are on my C Drive, can I move them to D without reinstalling the entire application? Note, my SQL and Office applications are on D.
