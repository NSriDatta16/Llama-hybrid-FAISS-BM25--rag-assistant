Remeasuring "bad" values

We have a large number of samples whose concentration we measure twice, averaging the two values. Typically, the coefficient of variation (cv) for each sample is My question is, how to use the three measurements to achieve the "best" estimate of the true concentration? Average all three measurements? Pick the two with the lowest cv? Or...? Many thanks for any insights or pointers to literature.
