There are several techniques to deal with imbalanced datasets. You can take a look at imbalanced-learn (a python package) documentation to explore several oversampling and undersampling techniques that may help you. These techniques increase the representation of the minority classes in the dataset so that the ML model does not predict that all records belong to the majority class. When dealing with decision trees (and therefore with random forest) it is also possible to define class weights, so that wrong predictions for the minority classes records are more penalizing. Therefore, the ML model is "forced to pay attention" for the minority classes records. Using sklearn package in python, it can be done by defining class_weight parameter as the output of compute_class_weight function .
