As I see it the limitations of your proposed analysis are: The data are not, in fact, paired the first day post-intervention takes place a year and a half after the first day pre-intervention. You do not account for seasonality in time series data The Wilcoxon does not actually quantify the differences in rates pre/post modification The Wilcoxon does not handle small, unmeasured sources of dependence in the data (repeat crossings by same animal). The Wilcoxon, even with Pratt correction, downweights/discards zero observations which is undesirable when such observations are very informative regarding the actual rate of crossing. All of these issues can be solved by fitting a quasipoisson GLM. I can let an ecologist correct me if I'm wrong in my thinking here. The intervention can be handled with a pre/post indicator. You can adjust for seasonality using fixed effects.
