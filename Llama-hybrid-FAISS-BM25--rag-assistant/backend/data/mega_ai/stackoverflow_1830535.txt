If you are on windows take a look at the agents library in VS2010 this is a core scenario. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492627(VS.100).aspx i.e. //an unbounded_buffer is like a queue unbounded_buffer buf; //you can send messages into it with send or asend send(buf,1); //receive will block and wait for data int result = receive(buf) you can use threads, 'agents' or 'tasks' to get the data out... or you can link buffers together and convert your blocking semantic producer / consumer problem to a data flow network.
