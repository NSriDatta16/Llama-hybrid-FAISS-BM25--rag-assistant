Data approximation with unequal intervals

For some sampled function of real variable, defined on [a, b], how can [a, b] be split into subintervals of unequal width, so that for each interval one can say, "On this interval, function is approximately equal to ..."? Formally speaking, function is to be approximated with several rectangles in some optimal way (e.g., with number of bins defined with Bayesian Information Criterion and with ranges and their values defined using minimum sum of squares) like this: Do some methods or algorithms exist to accomplish this task? Is "formally spoken" paragraph legitimate?
