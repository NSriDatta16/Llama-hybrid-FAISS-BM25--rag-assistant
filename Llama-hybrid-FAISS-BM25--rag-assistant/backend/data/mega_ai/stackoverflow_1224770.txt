dimensional and unit analysis in SQL database

Problem: A relational database (Postgres) storing timeseries data of various measurement values. Each measurement value can have a specific "measurement type" (e.g. temperature, dissolved oxygen, etc) and can have specific "measurement units" (e.g. Fahrenheit/Celsius/Kelvin, percent/milligrams per liter, etc). Question: Has anyone built a similar database such that dimensional integrity is conserved? Have any suggestions? I'm considering building a measurement_type and a measurement_unit table, both of these would have text two columns, ID and text. Then I would create foreign keys to these tables in the measured_value table. Text worries me somewhat because there's the possibility for non-unique duplicates (e.g. 'ug/l' vs 'µg/l' for micrograms per liter). The purpose of this would be so that I can both convert and verify units on queries, or via programming externally. Ideally, I would have the ability later to include strict dimensional analysis (e.g. linking µg/l to the value 'M/V' (mass divided by volume)). Is there a more elegant way to accomplish this?
