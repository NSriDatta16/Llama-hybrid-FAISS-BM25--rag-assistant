Yes. The slope of one line is $r s_y/s_x$ and the other is $r s_x/s_y$ where $s_y$ is the standard deviation of the $y$'s and $s_x$ is the standard deviation of the $x$'s. From these two slopes, along with the fact that standard deviations are positive, you can easily eliminate the (unknown) standard deviation terms and solve for $r$. Because this sounds like a classroom or textbook question, I will leave you the enjoyment of working out the solution. Incidentally, the lines must intersect at the point of averages and, once you have computed $r$, you can find $s_y/s_x$. Thus you can obtain four pieces of information about the five lowest bivariate moments of the data (the first and second moments). Clearly that's the best one can do, because the available information is invariant with respect to a uniform rescaling of $(x,y)$ around the point of averages.
