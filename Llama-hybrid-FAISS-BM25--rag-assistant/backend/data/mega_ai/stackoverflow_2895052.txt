C# Possible to partial class "program" class for a console application?

I was wondering if its possible to change the default "program" class that gets created for any console application to a partial class. I want to do this because I want better organisation rather than have all methods in 1 file categorized by region. It would make more sense for me to have certain method categories sitting in separate files. My understanding of a partial class is that it is a class definition in multiple files that during a compile merges the class files into 1 class unit. I could be wrong, or there could be a better way for me to achieve better organisational structure. Any suggestions would help, and thanks
