You find yourself in a common case where you have measured a certain outcome in response to various parameters. This can be analysed using a generalized linear model, a fairly wide category of statistical models (that, for instance, also include ANOVA). This types of model will create a linear relationship between your output and the variables (regressors). In this case, as the outcome is discrete, I would use a logistic regression; as you measured the same subject twice we will have to use a mixed effect (repeated measures) logistic model, including the subject as a random effect I'm sorry, but I don't know anything about SPSS, so I will give you an example in R. Let's make some mock data: # Make data reproducible set.seed(51280) # number of the experimental subject subject data will look something like (first 10 rows only): subject gender trial outcome 1 1 M 0 green 2 1 M 1 green 3 2 M 0 green 4 2 M 1 red 5 3 M 0 green 6 3 M 1 green 7 4 M 0 red 8 4 M 1 red 9 5 M 0 red 10 5 M 1 red If we inspect the data using table we get > table(data$outcome,data$gender) F M green 19 19 red 21 21 > table(data$outcome,data$trial) 0 1 green 24 14 red 16 26 Now we can use the lmer (linear mixed model) function of the lme4 package to generate a model which linearly connects our outcome (red/green) with the regressors (sex and trial), considering the nuisance factor (subject). We use the formula outcome ~ gender * trial which tells glm to use outcome as the independent variable and gender and trial as regressors, counting their interactions. We don't just want to know if outcome is different between men and women and between the two trials (case in which we would use + instead of * ), we want to know if it is different when the two factors are considered together. require(lme4) logit.model Finally, summary(logit.model) will tell us that in this case there are no differences in the outcome (as expected from random data).
