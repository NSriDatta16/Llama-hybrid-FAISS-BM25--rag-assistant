Is 'width' applicable to a textarea?

Is the CSS 'width' property applicable to a ? In practice, people say that they use it successfully , for example using a rule like this: textarea { width:100%; } What's confusing me is that the CSS 2.1 specification for width says, This property specifies the content width of boxes generated by block-level and replaced elements. This property does not apply to non-replaced inline-level elements. I thought that a textarea is an inline-level element, because e.g. markup like this ... This is some more text: Text in the text area And even more, more text. ... creates a single paragraph block with text to the left and right of the , and that therefore according to the spec the width shouldn't be applicable.
