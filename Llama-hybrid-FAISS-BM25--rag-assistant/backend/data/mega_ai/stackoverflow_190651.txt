Are there any APIs which you use which aid threading? You mean appart from java.util.concurrent ? FunctionalJava got some constructs which aid in concurrent programming, as described in a multipart tutorial that starts here . Have you used threads in a manner which doesn't conceptualise as thread being a process? Yes, to the extent that threads doesn't conceptualise at all. Take an asynchronous task-runner for instance. It uses threads under the covers but I don't see them and I don't care about them. They are fully managed by the task-runner. Under the covers, it is all just threads, but when we stop caring about the individual thread and just think about them as a number of slots where you can somehow put code in and have it run for a period of time, then that is when we start to reach for a higher level of abstraction. Agents/Actors is a common way to do this. An Actor is like a thread that has a lump of state, and then you can send it some code and say "do this to your state when you have time" or something along those lines.
