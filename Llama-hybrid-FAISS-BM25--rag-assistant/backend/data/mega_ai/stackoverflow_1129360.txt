You can probably fix the first issue by having your draggable not allow the container of the upload button to be a handle using the cancel option . So if your html is something like this: whatever Then your initialisation scripts should look something like this: var dragger = $(".drag").draggable({ cancel: ".upload" }); var uploader = new YAHOO.widget.Uploader( "upload", "assets/buttonSprite.jpg" ); As for your second issue, I'm not really sure... sorry (although it is possible that the above might fix that too if there's some weird event swallowing going on).
