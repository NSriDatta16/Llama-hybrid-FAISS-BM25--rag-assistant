SQL Query Time Coverage

I don´t now if this is the right place for such a question, but I´ll try it :) I have got several sql db entries which represents time periods E.G. Datefrom datetill 2010-10-01 2011-01-01 2011-02-01 2011-05-16 2011-08-08 2011-09-01 I need to test if a given time period ist fully covered from the entries. Is there a smart way to figure that out? My first idea was to check the min date and the max date, but how about the "holes" in the time periods? Maybe there are some SQL Pros that are willing to help me... Excuse my english, it´s nt my mother language.
