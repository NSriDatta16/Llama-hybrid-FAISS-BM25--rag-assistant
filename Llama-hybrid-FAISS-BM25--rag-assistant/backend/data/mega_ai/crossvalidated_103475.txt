Classifier vs model vs estimator

What is the difference between a classifier, model and estimator? From what I can tell: an estimator is a predictor found from regression algorithm a classifier is a predictor found from a classification algorithm a model can be both an estimator or a classifier But from looking online, it appears that I may have these definitions mixed up. So, what the true defintions in the context of machine learning?
