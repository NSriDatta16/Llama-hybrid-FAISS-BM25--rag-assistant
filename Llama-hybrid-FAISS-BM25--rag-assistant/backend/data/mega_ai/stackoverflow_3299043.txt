Have you looked at the log files? You can copy them off your iPhone if you plug it in, load organizer (Windows->Organizer in XCode) and select device logs. If you see a log for the time your application crashed, it should include the call stack (which should include the function causing it to crash) Alternatively it could be that you're stuck in some code run at startup - and if your application doesn't start in a timely manor (within 30 seconds IIRC) iOS kills it.
