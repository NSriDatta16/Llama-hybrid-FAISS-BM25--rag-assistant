I don't know whether it affects search engine rankings or not (probably does). You can tell in Google Webmaster which query string parameters to ignore (see Site Configuration/Settings). You can also add this to robots.txt: User-agent: * /news/archive/*/*/*/?*o= This is block the crawler even if you have other query parameters, as in /news/archive/2010/05/16/?direction=asc&o=date
