Tuning Random Forest results in max_features parameter taking a value of 1. Why?

I did a bayesian optimization tuning for parameters of random forest. With 200 iterations, it seems like 70% of the times, very low values (read 1 or 2) of max_features seems to produce better (marginally, 10 bp. , but still) recall scores. I did tuning and evaluation using 3 fold cross validation. Is there an over/under-fitting here? I tried Bayesian optimization with 3 fold cross validation with 200 iterations. The sample size is 100K observations. max_feature space was [1:36].
