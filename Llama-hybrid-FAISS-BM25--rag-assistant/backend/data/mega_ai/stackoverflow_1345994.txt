On the old Apple branded external keyboards, the menu button is to the right of the space bar ( Alt Gr , on PC style keyboards). Looking at the newer keyboards, and the Mac Book Pros, it doesn't seem to be there (guess it went the same way as the Home , End , Page Up , Page Down and Delete keys). Having a poke around the Preferences -> Keys preference page , I don't think there is a way of revealing the entire context menu. Many of the sub-menus are available from the keyboard - the ones I have committed to muscular memory are: Alt + ⌘ + T - refactoring menu, and the various refactorings available from the keyboard, using the modifiers Alt + ⌘ Alt + ⌘ + S - Source menu, and various operations beginning with Shift + ⌘ - including organize imports, reformat. Shift + ⌘ + T - open type Shift + ⌘ + R - open resource If all else fails, it is usually worth looking at Shift + ⌘ + L - which shows all current keyboard mappings in a hover on the side of the screen. With these shortcuts, I would recommend learning one a day. Their culmulative effect is considerable. I appreciate that this does not answer your question, but I hope it solves your problem.
