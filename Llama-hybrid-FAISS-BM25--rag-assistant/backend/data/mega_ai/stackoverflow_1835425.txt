The fact that the table has indexes built on GUID values, indicates a possible series of problems that would affect performance: High index fragmentation: since new GUIDs are generated randomly, the index cannot organize them in a sequential order and the nodes are spread unevenly. High number of page splits: the size of a GUID (16 bytes) causes many page splits in the index, since there's a greater chance than a new value wont't fit in the remaining space available in a page. Slow value comparison: comparing two GUIDs is a relatively slow operation because all 33 characters must be matched. Here a couple of resources on how to investigate and resolve these problems: How to Detect Index Fragmentation in SQL Server 2000 and 2005 Reorganizing and Rebuilding Indexes How Using GUIDs in SQL Server Affect Index Performance
