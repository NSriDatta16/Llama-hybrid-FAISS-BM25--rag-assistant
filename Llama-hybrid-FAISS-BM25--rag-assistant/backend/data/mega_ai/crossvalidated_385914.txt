Evaluating ecological community over time with NMDS?

I have sampling data of insect communities per month for 7 months. The sampling occurred in the same location with the same methods once a month. I want to be able to see community changes over time using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Given the repeat-measure sampling in the data how would this be possible? I have looked around and seen some people running the NMDS analysis on the entirety of their data and then using vectors to from one time period's point to another. If that is in fact the way to analyze the data how would one do that using the R package vegan? Here is the data for those who are interested : df UPDATE* I was able to figure this question out if people are ever in the same situation. I ultimately ran an NMDS analysis on the species X site matrix. I then calculated centroid positions in this multidimensional space from clusters based on time periods. These centroids were then plotted with arrows/vectors in chronological order. The direction and length of these vectors were then used to identify the changes in beta diversity between communities at certain time points (e.g. shorter vectors represent lower levels of change in community structure).
