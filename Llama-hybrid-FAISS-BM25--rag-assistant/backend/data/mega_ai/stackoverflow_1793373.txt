Jquery: iphone "slide to unlock"

I want to create a jquery script that works like the iphones "slide to unlock" bar. i want to have 2 divs, the container, and the slider. i want to be able to drag the slider to the right, and when the slider reaches the very right of the container, have it do something. i don't want to use jqueryUI in doing this, that library is too bloated, i've seen some other drag and drop scripts out there but a lot of what i've tried has utterly failed, so now i'm back to step 1 wondering if there's a really simple way to drag a div and when it reaches the very right of it's container, to 'do something'. i would REALLY appreciate any help at all, i think my hair is falling out over this. nick
