Pattern Recognition Problem

I have the following questions: Suppose we have the following chart, which represents the relationship between faculties and types of objects; for example CTE represents Computer Technologies, and the intersection between CTE and Wood says that at the CTE faculty there are 56 types of wood. My question is: Can I use this table as a tool for PCA analysis? Or can I represent these data in matrix form and perform a principal component analysis from this data table? I need it for pattern recognition rate problems. I know Matlab well and linear algebra as well; I just need advice.
