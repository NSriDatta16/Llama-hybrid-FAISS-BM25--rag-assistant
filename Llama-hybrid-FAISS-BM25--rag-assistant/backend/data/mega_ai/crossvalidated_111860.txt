Remember that you used maximum likelihood estimation which optimizes the likelihood function. Use this to your advantage - it is the gold standard statistical measure, with only penalized likelihood or Bayesian analysis (which also uses the likelihood) being better. Compute the proportion of the total likelihood ratio $\chi^2$ statistic for the model that is due to each variable in the model. You can do this by running a series of anova() commands. To get this easily using the more approximate Wald $\chi^2$ statistics instead of likelihood ratio $\chi^2$ statistics, use something like: require(rms) f
