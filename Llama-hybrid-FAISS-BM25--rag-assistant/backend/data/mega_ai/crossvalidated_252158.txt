The meaning of any categorical coefficient in linear regression such as this is there is a difference in the average predicted dependent variable between the category and the omitted category, with a size of the coefficient . Using this data, females have a non-significant average predicted balance of 9.55 less than males, controlling for the other covariates. Since this is a difference between the categories, changing the omitted category would give the exact same non-significant result, with a flipped ($+$) sign. Males will have +9.55 more than females. If you want to test this on your data (I can't use the data given since it's not reproducible) you can change the omitted (reference) category of any factor in R using the relevel() function: caseStudyData2$Gender And run the model again.
