Oracle, especially with AMM, will use every bit of memory on the machine you give it. If it doesn't have a reason to de-allocate memory it will not do so. It is the same with storage space: if you delete 20 GB of user data that space is not returned to the OS. Oracle will hold on to it unless you explicitly compact the tablespaces. I believe a simple test should relieve your concerns. If it's 32 bit, and each SQL Developer session is using 100MB+ of RAM, then you'd only need a few hundred sessions open to cause a low-memory problem...if there really is one.
