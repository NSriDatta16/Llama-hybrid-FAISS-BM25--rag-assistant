I suggest installing the command line tool exif . You can get it through Mac Ports by executing port install exif as root. Here's an example of the exif info stored in a photo I took on an iPod Touch: bash:$ exif Oct\ 9\,\ 2010/IMG_0038.JPG EXIF tags in 'Oct 9, 2010/IMG_0018.JPG' ('Motorola' byte order): --------------------+---------------------------------------------------------- Tag |Value --------------------+---------------------------------------------------------- Manufacturer |Apple Model |iPod touch Orientation |right - top x-Resolution |72.00 y-Resolution |72.00 Resolution Unit |Inch Software |4.1 Date and Time |2010:10:06 17:43:43 YCbCr Positioning |centered Compression |JPEG compression x-Resolution |72.00 y-Resolution |72.00 Resolution Unit |Inch Exposure Time |1/120 sec.

I don't think the iPod Touch has the same capabilities as an iPhone regarding GPS. It looks like an iPhone will have the data 'GPSImg Direction' as well, which sounds like what you want. I don't think you have to do anything special to enable it, as I haven't found much info on this through searching.
