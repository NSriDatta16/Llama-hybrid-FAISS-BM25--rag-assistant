You should post some real strings you want to parse (the question makes little sense with the code you post since you already have the data in the $language variable). Whatever, in PHP you can use parse_url() to split the URL into its components and then: substr(..., -2) to extract the trailing letters (if fixed) explode('/', ...) and end() to obtain the last fragment The exact details depend on what your data looks like. BTW, your JavaScript code will change /data/en into /sitenameta/en :-?
