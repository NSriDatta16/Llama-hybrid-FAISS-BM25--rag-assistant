Visualizing Time Series Data

I hope this question isn't out of place here. I have some time series data from a Zooz power plug that I'd like to visualize. Excel works fine to a point, with small sets of data, but it's not easy to move the data window, to zoom in on particular moments, for example. Are there any free data visualization apps that accept time series data and implement controls for viewing it dynamically? I'm happy to pay for something, too, if it works well, but this is for a personal hobby project, so I'm trying to spend my money carefully :) Looking for off-the-shelf solutions before I dive into R. Thanks.
