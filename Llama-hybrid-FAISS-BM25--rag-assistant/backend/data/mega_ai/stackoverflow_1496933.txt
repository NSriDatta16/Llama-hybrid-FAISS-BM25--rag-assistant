Netbeans has inbuilt support for designing GUIs using the Matisse GUI builder. This is the closest you'll get to the drag & drop style form design that's available with environments such as VB. (Personally I'm not a huge fan of this approach though as it autogenerates a lot of code that quickly becomes unmaintainable, especially if not everyone in your development team is using Netbeans.)
