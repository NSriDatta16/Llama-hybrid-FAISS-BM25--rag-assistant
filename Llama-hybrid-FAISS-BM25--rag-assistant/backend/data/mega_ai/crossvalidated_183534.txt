Neural network model does not converge

I am using function neuralnet in the package neuralnet to build the neural network, and I see the error: algorithm did not converge in 1 of 1 repetition(s) within the stepmax The neural network has 20 inputs and 1 output. The problem is, with the same data and same set of inputs, I ran linear regression or random forest without any problem. So what should I look to for debugging my problem?
