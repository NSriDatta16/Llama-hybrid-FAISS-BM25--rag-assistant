Supervised dimensionality reduction

I have a data set consisting of 15K labeled samples (of 10 groups). I want to apply dimensionality reduction into 2 dimensions, that would take into consideration the knowledge of the labels. When I use "standard" unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, the scatter plot seems to have nothing to do with the known labels. Does what I am looking for have a name? I would like to read some references of solutions.
