Can Ruby tell when a USB memory stick is plugged into a USB port on Linux?

I'm working on a utility that will scan USB ports and mount any Mass Storage devices it finds. I can poll for changes ( with a patched version of Ruby-USB ) but would much rather get a notification, or subscribe to some event. Is there a way for Ruby to be tickled when a USB stick is inserted?
