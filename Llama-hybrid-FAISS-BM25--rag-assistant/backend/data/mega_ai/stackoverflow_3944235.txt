Still having some problems, but getting closer maybe. I tried this, but still no luck. I am partially drawing on the code from http://digdog.tumblr.com/post/252784277/mapkit-annotation-drag-and-drop-with-callout-info - (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView didSelectAnnotationView:(MKAnnotationView *)view { NSLog(@"Annotation was TAPPED!"); if ([view.annotation isKindOfClass:[PushPin class]]) { ((PushPin *)view.annotation).title = @"test"; } [self willChangeValueForKey:@"subtitle"]; // Workaround for SDK 3.0, otherwise callout info won't update. [self didChangeValueForKey:@"subtitle"]; // Workaround for SDK 3.0, otherwise callout info won't update. [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotification:[NSNotification notificationWithName:@"MKAnnotationCalloutInfoDidChangeNotification" object:self]]; } Good news is that, I figured out my casting problem, for others who may be curious. ((PushPin *)view.annotation).title = @"test";
