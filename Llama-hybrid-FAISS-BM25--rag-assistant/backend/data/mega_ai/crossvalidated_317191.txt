Maximum likelihood estimation of a Dirichlet distribution multivariate parameters

Is it necessary to find the 'maximum likelihood estimates' of prior dirichlet parameters after finding their initial values through the 'method of moments ' to find posterior probabilities through bayesian analysis (using dirichlet -multinomial conjugate pairs)? If yes, I need to know an easy way to find the maximum likelihood estimates of dirichlet parameters. I did the bayesian analysis with the initial guess made through the 'method of moments ' without finding MLE . Is it correct to do so? Eg. Let A,B,C be the three dependent variables with a prior probability of occurrence (Pij's). So, j = 1,2,3 for the three variables. I have three observations of three different time periods for each variable A,B,C. So, i = 1,2,3 for the three observations.(The data given below is only an example; not original). j=1 implies the variable A. j=2 implies the variable B. j=3 implies the variable C. Let 0.1, 0.4 , and 0.2 be the three observations (for i=1,2,3) of variable A. Then 0.6, 0.5, and 0.7 be the three observations of variable B. Then 0.3, 0.1, and 0.1 be the three observations of variable C. I fitted this data with a dirichlet distribution. With this prior Pij's I made the initial guess of dirichlet parameters (alphas) by the 'method of moments' from a reference. In the reference they use this intial guess of alphas to find the 'maximum likelihood estimates' of alphas. But I skipped the MLE method and did the bayesian analysis with a multinomial data as my likelihood function (frequency counts of each variable) and used the initial guess of alphas to estimate the posterior probability of occurrence of the three dependent variables. Is MLE necessary for prior alphas?
