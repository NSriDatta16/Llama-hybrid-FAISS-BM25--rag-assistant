Fisher's exact test does deal with zero cells without any problem. Adding 0.5 to all cells is a commonly done to remove improve the small sample properties from the Chi-square test (and it asymptotically removes the first-order bias from the estimate of the log-odds ratio). This is (for a simple 2x2 table) equivalent to maximum-a-posteriori estimation using the Jefferys prior (=a Beta(0.5,0.5) prior for each proportion), as well as Firth's penalized likelihood logistic regression (for stratified tables these two approaches no longer match to adding 0.5 to each cell). Doing so penalizes the effect size (and test decision) towards no effect. If you have prior information, a Bayesian approach with informative priors may be another option.
