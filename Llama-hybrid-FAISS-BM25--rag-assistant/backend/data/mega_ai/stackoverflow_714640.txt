Silverlight MVVM Isolated Storage

I've tried to use IsolatedStorageSettings in my ViewModel, but these are not getting retained across browser refreshes (F5). for example; //look in the IsoStore for remembered details IsRememberMe = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings.Contains(Constants.LOGIN_REMEMBERED_USERNAME); if (IsRememberMe) { UserName = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings[Constants.LOGIN_REMEMBERED_USERNAME] as string; } Do I need to do something differently in my MVVM ViewModel's?? EDIT It's worth noting that this code is sitting in a referenced project - so ultimately a seperate XAP file to the parent XAP that is loaded in the browser - might this cause the settings to be lost on each refresh? THanks, Mark
