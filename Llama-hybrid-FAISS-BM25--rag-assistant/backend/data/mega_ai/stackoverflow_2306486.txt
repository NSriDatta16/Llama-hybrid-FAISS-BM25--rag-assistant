When it comes to "applied" data mining, for the starters, you may not need to think about math at all. Weka is product of a university machine-learning project and offers 100+ algorithms . Contrast that with Microsoft SQL server SSAS which offers nine algorithms -- and they do not even bother to explain the math. They both offer association, clustering, attribute selection, some kind of neural network. So, the trick is to understand what you are trying to achieve, not necessarily the math below. Try reading about Microsoft algorithms (good documentation) and see if you can figure out principles that SSAS and Weka have in common -- this should help you focus on basic principles and get you started. There is a list of a few Weka tutorials here .
