Let's try to find the probability that type A towers (collectively) have at least one outage within the next month. With 51 outages over 5 years (60 months) the estimated monthly outage rate for type A towers is $\hat \lambda = 51/60 = 0.85.$ If we assume the outage rate is constant and can be used for future months, then the number $X$ of outages in the next month has $X \sim \mathsf{Pois}(0.85).$ Thus $$P(X \ge 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^{-0.85} = 0.5726.$$ 1 - exp(-0.85) [1] 0.5725851 1 - dpois(0, 0.85) [1] 0.5725851 (Computations use R.) The value $\hat \lambda$ for the monthly outage rate is an estimate. A 95% confidence interval for the five-year outage rate $\lambda_{60}$ is of the type $$ X_{60}+2 \pm 1.96\sqrt{X_{60} + 1},$$ which computes to $(38.87, 67.13).$ Thus a confidence interval for the monthly rate is $(0.648, 1.119).$ The best guess is that the probability of a type A tower outage in the next month is 0.5726 (as above), but that probability was based on an estimate. Using the upper confidence limit for $\lambda,$ we can be reasonably confident that the actual probability is below $0.6734.$ 53 + c(-1,1)*1.96*sqrt(52) [1] 38.86624 67.13376 (53 + c(-1,1)*1.96*sqrt(52))/60 [1] 0.6477707 1.1188960 1 - dpois(0, 1.119) [1] 0.6733938 Note: There is discussion what style of CI to use for the Poisson rate. Two other possibilities are: (a) The traditional Wald interval $X \pm 1.96\sqrt{X},$ which is known to have bad coverage properties (especially for small $X).$ For type A it gives the interval $(0.617, 1.083)$. (b) A frequentist interval based on a Bayesian argument with an 'improper' (non-informative) prior uses quantiles .025 and .975 of $\mathsf{Gamma}(51,1).$ Its results are often similar to the interval I used above in the main part of my answer. For type A it gives $(0.633, 1.099)$. (51 + c(-1,1)*1.96*sqrt(51))/60 [1] 0.6167133 1.0832867 qgamma(c(.025,.975), 51, 1)/60 [1] 0.6328808 1.0986461
