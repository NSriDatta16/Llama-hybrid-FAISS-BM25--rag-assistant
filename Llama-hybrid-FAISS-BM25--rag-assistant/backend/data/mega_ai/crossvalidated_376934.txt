Optimizing $\chi^2$ using MCMC

I have measurements of an object. Let's say I have its length $L$ , mass $M$ , and age $t$ : $$\mathbf y = (10~\text{m},\ 0.01~\text{g},\ 5~\text{s}).$$ I also have the uncertainties on my measurements $$\boldsymbol \sigma = (0.1~\text{m},\ 0.001~\text{g},\ 2~\text{s}).$$ The measurements aren't independent so I actually have a covariance matrix $\boldsymbol \Sigma$ . I am numerically simulating these objects using some complex non-linear physical theory, we can call it $\mathbf f$ . Given some initial conditions $\mathbf X = (X_1, X_2, X_3)$ , where $\mathbf X$ are parameters of my model, I can generate $\mathbf f(\mathbf X)=(L, M, t)$ . Now I want to find the $\mathbf X$ (and their uncertaintes) that generated my observed $\mathbf y$ , a common problem. Specifically, I think I should optimize the $\chi^2$ : \begin{equation} \chi^2(\mathbf X) = \sum_i \frac{(y_i - f_i(\mathbf X))^2}{\boldsymbol \sigma^2} \end{equation} ...but since the measurements aren't independent, it's actually: \begin{equation} \chi^2(\mathbf X) = \mathbf R'\boldsymbol\Sigma^{-1}\mathbf R \qquad \text{where} \qquad \mathbf R = \mathbf y - \mathbf f(\mathbf X). \end{equation} Since $\chi^2(\mathbf X)$ may be multi-modal with many solutions, I think I should use MCMC to find the posterior distributions of $\mathbf X$ . Thus, I need to minimize the negative log likelihood. My question is, do I minimize $$-\log \frac{\chi^2}{2} \qquad \text{or} \qquad -\chi^2/2\text{ ?}$$ Or something else?
