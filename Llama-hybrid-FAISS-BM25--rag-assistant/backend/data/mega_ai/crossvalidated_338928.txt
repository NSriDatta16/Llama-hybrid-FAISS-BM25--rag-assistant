What is the loss function for a probabilistic decoder in the Variational Autoencoder?

In a VAE with Gaussian output the loss function is usually:$$\sum{(\hat x - x)^2} + KL,$$ so the sum of squared errors plus KL divergence. When I also want to predict the variance of the reconstructed input I need 2 outputs for each dimension of x: mean and variance. But in this case how should I calculate the reconstruction error? Should I sample from a normal distribution with the mean and variance I have as current output and calculate sum of squared errors for that sample?
