Question about t-test interpretation

I tried to compare the samples of the movie ratings that cast award winning actors and those that have not casted awarded actors. Then I grouped the averages per year for both awarded and non awarded movies and calculated the mean per year. Then I applied the t.test() function in R for both samples, here are the results: It looks like we can almost surely say that this higher mean of the sample of awarded movies is not accidental and that movies with award winning cast score higher. But then, for example, the golden globe sample consists only of 76 rows, wouldn't that make this test unreliable? Also, I see that the confidence interval is negative, which seems a bit weird. Does it mean that most years movies had an average score of 5.3 or lower? Also, would it be possible to run randomly generated sample that consists of 76 numbers from 0 to 10 and replicate it 10,000 times and then say whether the globe's mean is just accidental or reliable? [UPDATE] Here I did what one user suggested ( My interpretation of the suggestion) and got different t test results. And my code: XX $averageRating, size = 30, replace = TRUE))) YY averageRating, size = 30, replace = TRUE))) t.test(XX, YY) Here the t-value is very large so we cal assume that the awarded actors influence the results. I just want to make sure whether my code looks legit and also what could be the best visualisation for these data that could make it appearant that the data are different. Thanks in advice!
