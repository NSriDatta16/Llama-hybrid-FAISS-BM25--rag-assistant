You can make TableServiceContext , but your problem is going to be with your TableName constant. Unless you can guarantee that the table name is always the same name as the class of your generic, then it doesn't look good. But if you can make that guarantee, it would look something like this: public class TableServiceContext { public TableServiceContext(string baseAddress, StorageCredentials credentials) : base(baseAddress, credentials) { } public string TableName { get { return typeof(T).Name; } } public IQueryable Table { get { return this.CreateQuery (TableName); } } }
