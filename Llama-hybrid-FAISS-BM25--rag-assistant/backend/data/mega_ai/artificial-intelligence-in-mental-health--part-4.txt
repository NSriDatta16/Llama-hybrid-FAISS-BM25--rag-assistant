s have a responsibility to ensure that these explanations are available and comprehensible. Privacy and data protection: The use of AI in mental health care must balance data utility with the protection of sensitive personal information. Ensuring robust privacy safeguards is essential to building trust among users. Lack of diversity in training data: AI models often rely on datasets that may not be representative of diverse populations. This can lead to biased outcomes and reduced effectiveness in diagnosing or treating individuals from underrepresented groups. Provider skepticism and implementation barriers: Clinicians and health care organizations may be hesitant to adopt AI tools due to a lack of familiarity, concerns about reliability, or uncertainty about integration into existing care workflows. Responsibility and the "Tarasoff duty": In cases where AI identifies a patient as a potential risk to themselves or others, it remains unclear who holds the legal and ethical responsibility to act particularly in jurisdictions with mandatory duty-to-warn obligations. Data quality and accessibility: High-quality mental health data is often difficult to obtain due to ethical constraints and privacy concerns. Limited access to diverse and comprehensive datasets may hinder the accuracy and real-world applicability of AI systems. Bias in data: Bias in data algorithms means placing preferences of certain groups of people over others which is unfair. AI models are constructed with such biases leading to wrong treatment, incorrect diagnoses and harmful medical outcomes. Because of such bias, groups from diverse backgrounds could be at risk of being underrepresented. Most AI systems are trained on western populations data that can also be a cause of algorithmic bias. If AI systems cannot be trained on inclusive data, it risks increasing racial disparities and mental health issues. Current AI trends in mental health As of 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had not yet approved any artificial intelligence-based tools for use in Psychiatry. However, in 2022, the FDA granted authorization for the initial testing of an AI-driven mental health assessment tool known as the AI-Generated Clinical Outcome Assessment (AI-COA). This system employs multimodal behavioral signal processing and machine learning to track mental health symptoms and assess the severity of anxiety and depression. AI-COA was incorporated into a pilot program to evaluate its clinical effectiveness. As of 2025, it has not received full regulatory approval. Mental health tech startups continue to lead investment activity in digital health despite the ongoing impacts of macroeconomic factors like inflation, supply chain disruptions, and interest rates. According to CB Insights, State of Mental Health Tech 2021 Report, mental health tech companies raised $5.5 billion worldwide (324 deals), a 139% increase from the previous year that recorded 258 deals. A number of startups that are using AI in mental healthcare have closed notable deals in 2022 as well. Among them is the AI chatbot Wysa ($20 million in funding), BlueSkeye that is working on improving early diagnosis (£3.4 million), the Upheal smart notebook for mental health professionals ($10 million in funding), and the AI-based mental health companion clare&me (€1 million). Founded in 2021, Earkick serves as an 'AI therapist' for mental health support. An analysis of the investment landscape and ongoing research suggests that we are likely to see the emergence of more emotionally intelligent AI bots and new mental health applications driven by AI prediction and detection capabilities. For instance, researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee, US, have developed an ML algorithm that uses a person's hospital admission data, including age, gender, and past medical diagnoses, to make an 80% accurate prediction of whether this individual is likely to take their own life. And researchers at the Universi
