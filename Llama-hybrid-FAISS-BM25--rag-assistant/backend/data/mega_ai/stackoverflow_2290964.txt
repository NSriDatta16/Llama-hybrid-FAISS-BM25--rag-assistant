How should I set up my DBIx::Class result classes in this simple case?

Let's suppose I have a the following simplified example database consisting of three tables: CREATE TABLE people ( person_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, person_name VARCHAR(100) ); CREATE TABLE events ( event_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, event_name VARCHAR(100), event_creator INTEGER CONSTRAINT fk_event_creator REFERENCES people(person_id) ); CREATE TABLE event_attendees ( event_id INTEGER NOT NULL CONSTRAINT fk_event_attendee_event REFERENCES events(event_id), person_id INTEGER NOT NULL CONSTRAINT fk_event_attendee_person REFERENCES people(person_id), role CHAR(1), -- O: organizer, P: performer, S: speaker, G: guest CONSTRAINT pk_event_attendees PRIMARY KEY (event_id, person_id) ); Given an event_id , I might want to query for the names of all organizers, given a person_id I might want to find names of all events where this person is a guest or creator of the event so on and so forth. I know how to do all that using simple SQL. Could you tell me which result classes I need to set up and what kinds of relationships I need to specify when using DBIx::Class ?
