As you are representing users, disregard the rendezvous unless you have either an engineering requirement to maintain simultaneous behavior or your agents are processes and not human users and these agents are governed by a clock tick. Humans are chaotic computing units with variant arrival and departure windows based upon how quickly one can or cannot read, type, converse with friends, etc... A great book on the subject of population behavior is "Chaos" by James Gleik (sp?) The odds of your 100 decoupled users being highly synchronous in their behavior on an instant basis in observable conditions is zero. The odds of concurrent activity within a defined time window however, such as 100 users logging in within 10 minutes after 9:00am on a business morning, can be quite high. As a side note, a resume with rendezvous emphasized on it is the #1 marker for a person with poor tool understanding and poor performance test process. This comes from a folio of over 1500 interviews conducted over the past 15 years (I started as a Mercury Employee on april 1, 1996) James Pulley Moderator -SQAForums WinRunner, LoadRunner -YahooGroups LoadRunner, Advanced-LoadRunner -GoogleGroups lr-LoadRunner -Linkedin LoadRunner (owner), LoadrunnerByTheHour (owner) Mercury Alum (1996-2000) CTO, Newcoe Performance Engineering
