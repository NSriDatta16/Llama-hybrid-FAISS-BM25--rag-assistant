Yeah, you don't want to delete your whole DBML file. Open it in the designer, and delete the table that changed. Then drag'n'drop it again from the "Server Explorer" (in the view menu). This will load an updated copy of teh database... Note that if server explorer is already open while you make the change to the SQL schema, you'll need to refresh server explorer so it has the latest versions. The drawback to this approach is that if you do customizations to the table in the DBML, those need to be redone. This is an infrequent case for me.
