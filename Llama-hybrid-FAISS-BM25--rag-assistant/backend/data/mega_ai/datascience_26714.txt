Is PCA considered a machine learning algorithm

I've understood that principal component analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique i.e. given 10 input features, it will produce a smaller number of independent features that are orthogonal and linear transformation of original features. Is PCA by itself considered as a learning algorithm or it is a data pre-processing step.
