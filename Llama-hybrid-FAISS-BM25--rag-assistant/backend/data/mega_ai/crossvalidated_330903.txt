EDIT. I just finished a book on time series analysis so i am updating this with the best found answer. The main class of models for doing time series modeling are called auto-regressive (AR) models. The most commonly used are ARIMA models ( Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average ) which also incorporate noise terms. These models are of the form: $$f(x_t) = \alpha_1 x_{t-1} + ... + \alpha_p x_{t-p} + w_t + b_1 w_{t-1} + ... + b_q*w_{t-q}$$ Where the $w_{i}$'s are noise values, the $x_{i}$'s are previously seen values in the sequence. The constants of the model would be learned by minimizing the error between the predicted value of the model and the observed value: $ \alpha_1,..,\alpha_p,\beta_1,..,\beta_q = \text{argmin}_{\alpha_1',..,\alpha_p',\beta_1',..,\beta_q'} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{t=max(p,q)}^T (x^{(i)}_t - f(x^{(i)}_t))^2 $
