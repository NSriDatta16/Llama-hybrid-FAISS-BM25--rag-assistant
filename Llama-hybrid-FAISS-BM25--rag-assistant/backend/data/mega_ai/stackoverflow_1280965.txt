I ran into this issue, saw your thread. In my case, I handling the lower level mouse events, not click. I found that on jQuery's mousedown ( http://docs.jquery.com/Events/mousedown#fn ) I could suppress Firefox's special behavior calling event.preventDefault ( http://docs.jquery.com/Events/jQuery.Event#event.preventDefault.28.29 ) on the incoming mouse event. I was calling it on other event handlers, but I suspect just mousedown() is sufficient to stop browsers from doing their custom drag behavior.
