Variable not correlating with other variables - reason for deletion in PCA?

When I run PCA on a set of variables, I notice that there is one variable that has very low correlations with the other variables and also most of the correlations are not statistically significant. Should this variable be the first to be deleted and then run PCA with the other variables or would this be a mistake to do?
