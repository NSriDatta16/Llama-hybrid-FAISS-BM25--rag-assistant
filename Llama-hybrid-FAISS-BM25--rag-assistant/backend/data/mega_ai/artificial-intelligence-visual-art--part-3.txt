that are used in GPT-2 and GPT-3, OpenAI released a series of images created with the text-to-image AI model DALL-E 1. It is an autoregressive generative model with essentially the same architecture as GPT-3. Along with this, later in 2021, EleutherAI released the open source VQGAN-CLIP based on OpenAI's CLIP model. Diffusion models, generative models used to create synthetic data based on existing data, were first proposed in 2015, but they only became better than GANs in early 2021. Latent diffusion model was published in December 2021 and became the basis for the later Stable Diffusion (August 2022), developed through a collaboration between Stability AI, CompVis Group at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and Runway. In 2022, Midjourney was released, followed by Google Brain's Imagen and Parti, which were announced in May 2022, Microsoft's NUWA-Infinity, and the source-available Stable Diffusion, which was released in August 2022. DALL-E 2, a successor to DALL-E, was beta-tested and released (with the further successor DALL-E 3 being released in 2023). Stability AI has a Stable Diffusion web interface called DreamStudio, plugins for Krita, Photoshop, Blender, and GIMP, and the Automatic1111 web-based open source user interface. Stable Diffusion's main pre-trained model is shared on the Hugging Face Hub. Ideogram was released in August 2023, this model is known for its ability to generate legible text. In 2024, Flux was released. This model can generate realistic images and was integrated into Grok, the chatbot used on X (formerly Twitter), and Le Chat, the chatbot of Mistral AI. Flux was developed by Black Forest Labs, founded by the researchers behind Stable Diffusion. Grok later switched to its own text-to-image model Aurora in December of the same year. Several companies, along with their products, have also developed an AI model integrated with an image editing service. Adobe has released and integrated the AI model Firefly into Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and Illustrator. Microsoft has also publicly announced AI image-generator features for Microsoft Paint. Along with this, some examples of text-to-video models of the mid-2020s are Runway's Gen-4, Google's VideoPoet, and OpenAI's Sora, which was released in December 2024. In 2025, several models were released. GPT Image 1 from OpenAI, launched in March 2025, introduced new text rendering and multimodal capabilities, enabling image generation from diverse inputs like sketches and text. MidJourney v7 debuted in April 2025, providing improved text prompt processing. In May 2025 Flux.1 Kontext by Black Forest Labs emerged as an efficient model for high-fidelity image generation, while Google's Imagen 4 was released with improved photorealism. Tools and processes Approaches There are many approaches used by artists to develop AI visual art. When text-to-image is used, AI generates images based on textual descriptions, using models like diffusion or transformer-based architectures. Users input prompts and the AI produces corresponding visuals. When image-to-image is used, AI transforms an input image into a new style or form based on a prompt or style reference, such as turning a sketch into a photorealistic image or applying an artistic style. When image-to-video is used, AI generates short video clips or animations from a single image or a sequence of images, often adding motion or transitions. This can include animating still portraits or creating dynamic scenes. When text-to-video is used, AI creates videos directly from text prompts, producing animations, realistic scenes, or abstract visuals. This is an extension of text-to-image but focuses on temporal sequences. Imagery There are many tools available to the artist when working with diffusion models. They can define both positive and negative prompts, but they are also afforded a choice in using (or omitting the use of) VAEs, LoRAs, hypernetworks, IP-adapter, and embedding/textual inversions. Artists can tweak sett
