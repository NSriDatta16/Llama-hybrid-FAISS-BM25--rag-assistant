The problem is related to byteserving. See the Byteserving section of http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/misc/known_client_problems.html The Adobe Acrobat Reader plugin makes extensive use of byteranges and prior to version 3.01 supports only the multipart/x-byterange response. Unfortunately there is no clue that it is the plugin making the request. If the plugin is used with Navigator, the above workaround works fine. But if the plugin is used with MSIE 3 (on Windows) the workaround won't work because MSIE 3 doesn't give the Range-Request clue that Navigator does. To workaround this, Apache special cases "MSIE 3" in the User-Agent and serves multipart/x-byteranges. Note that the necessity for this with MSIE 3 is actually due to the Acrobat plugin, not due to the browser. This is also an issue in Lighttpd and is documented at http://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/show/171 with a workaround (tested and works) at note 8 .
