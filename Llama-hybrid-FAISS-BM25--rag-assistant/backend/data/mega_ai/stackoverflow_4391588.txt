Changing color of jQuery UI Buttons

Is there an easy way to change the color of a jQuery UI Button? Modifying the css is discouraged from the documentation and doing so anyway is tricky. They say, "We recommend using the ThemeRoller tool to create and download custom themes that are easy to build and maintain." I understand how to change the theme, but then how do you get different colored buttons on the same page?
