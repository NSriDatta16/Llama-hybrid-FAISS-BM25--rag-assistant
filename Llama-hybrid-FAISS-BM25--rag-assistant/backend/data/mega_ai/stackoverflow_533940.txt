All OO programming languages support reflection to a lesser or greater extent. Some encourage its use ( e.g. Smalltalk, at one end of the spectrum) and some discourage it ( e.g. C++, at the other). The relative frequency of use of those two languages to implement the software you use every day may tell you something about the desirability of making heavy use of reflection. Please note this is not an attempt to start a language war - I am actually something of a Smalltalk fan & intend to do some Squeaking later on this evening.
