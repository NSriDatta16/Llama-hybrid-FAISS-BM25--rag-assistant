How to get updated innerHTML with javascript

I have this page contains 3 draggable divs. I'm using JQuery to drag these divs on the page. Now when I drag them to different positions. their attributes values should be changed to the new positions. for example when the page loads the first div value: after I drag the box it should be changed to new position. the should show updated innerHTML but it seems not to be working. and no I dont wanna use the findposition function because this is only a sample and I have wide range of attributes/objects. so what I need is to get the updated innerHTML of . is there any way to do this with javascript? thanks
