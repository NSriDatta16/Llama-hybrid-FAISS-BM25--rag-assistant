Regarding #1: Company A and Company B are equal in your analysis as long as you assume that companies, on average, enter and leave the market equally often (a pretty good assumption, unless there's something strange about the market structure). You can ignore the age of the company if all you care about is the raw number of contracts. Treat the counts equally. Regarding #2: Sample equally from Spain and Germany. What you want to show is that, all else constant, contracts for Spain are greater than contracts for Germany, so you don't want to vary the ratio of samples between Spain and Germany, because you're assuming there are not effects present from there being a much higher number, say, of Spanish versus German contract-seeking firms. It's also more difficult to interpret your results if you have twice as many German firms in your sample. Edit: I'm assuming YOU are assuming "all else equal". If you have a suspicion that German firms fall out of the marketplace faster, and therefore are less representative, or you suspect that since Spain has 10x number of contract-seeking firms than Germany they must have an advantage, then you have to tailor the analysis to test those specific effects. Anyway, it's still a good starting point to test the all-equal hypothesis.
