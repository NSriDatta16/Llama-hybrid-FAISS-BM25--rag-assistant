Feature that is numeric if true, or single value if false

In regards to feature engineering for machine learning models. I would like to engineer a feature that encodes the following: value can be true and if so it will measure a numeric (maybe continuous) e.g. 'weeks since transaction', 'time since marriage' however, it is possible that this event never occurred or this value doesn't apply. e.g. transaction never occurred, person never married How might I design this feature. I can see a couple of options: Have a continuous positive variable, but a negative value for the 'false' values Have a continuous variable with NA for the 'false' values Use two separate features in some way. My guess is 1. runs afoul of the mechanics of most algorithms, 2. doesn't work well with logistic regression without imputing something for the NA, and I don't know about 3. (Is there a name for this type of variable?)
