I'll address question 2. If you fix a distribution supported on a finite set, the Markov chains which have that distribution as a stable distribution form a polytope. You can interpolate between any two by following one rule with probability $p$ and the other with probability $1-p$ and the convex combination will also preserve the stable distribution. Another way to look at the polytope is the space of maximal flows in a network with a source and a sink for each state, and complete (bipartite) connections between the sources and sinks, so that the capacity of each source/sink is the probability of the corresponding state in the distribution. The Markov chains where total balance is satisfied are the intersection of this polytope with a subspace. Given any cycle of length $2n$ in this complete bipartite graph and a maximal flow so that the even edges all carry at least $c \gt 0$, you can produce another maximal flow by reducing the amounts carried by the even edges by $c$, and increasing the amounts carried by the odd edges by $c$. The new flow generically does not satisfy detailed balance even if the original does. So, this is a way to produce Markov chains with the same stable distribution which do not satisfy detailed balance.
