I don't think that Robert Harvey's answer is actually responsive to your question. What you need to do is: calculate the maximum length of the values in each column, AND figure out, based on the font in use, how wide the column should be. Note that you may not actually want to set it to the maximum width if the value exceeds a certain threshold. I don't know to do the second taks, but I suspect Stephen Lebans has already done the work on it. You might want to search his website for it.
