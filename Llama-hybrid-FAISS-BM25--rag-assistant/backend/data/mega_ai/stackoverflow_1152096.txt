See my answer to this question: How to decide where to store per-user state? Registry? AppData? Isolated Storage? to quote from there: Files in the User's "Roaming" folder in Vista or "Application Data" in XP move around with the user - so any settings and data should be stored there. Files under "Local" and "LocalLow" in vista and "Local Settings" in XP do not, so it's a good place for temp files, things that are tied to the specific computer or data that can be recalculated. In Vista, as part of the new security features we all know and love, you can have programs running in "low integrity mode" (for example IE in protected mode), those programs are running with reduced privileges and can't access files in the user's profile - except for files under the "LocalLow" folder. So, in conclusion, files stored in "LocalLow" are inherently insecure and files in "Local"/"Local Settings" are likely to be unavailable in some large companies - so unless you have good reason and know exactly what you are doing go with "Roaming"/"Application Data". UPDATE: When profile roaming is used (big cooperate environments) the content of Local and LocalLow can (and will) disappear without notice. Those are all per-user settings, if your server runs under a diffrent account than the user (for example, system or network) they will get diffrent copies of those folders.
