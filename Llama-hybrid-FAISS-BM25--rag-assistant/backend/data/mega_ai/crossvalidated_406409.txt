CNN for image classification, new image representation as input

i'm trying to classify image pattern with CNN; I started to optimize a neural network with image represented in cartesian coordinate. If I use image represented in polar coordinate should i totaly change my neural network? Since my image will have the same size, but characteristic will change (for exemple density in an area of the image will change for a given pattern in the new representation)
