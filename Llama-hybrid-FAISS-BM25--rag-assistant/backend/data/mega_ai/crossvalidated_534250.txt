Converting weighted value to probability

For a disease classification problem I have trained a deep learning model to predict the probability score of the disease based on images only. During training time I had access to labeled images only without any other patient related data. The model gives a probability score (in range 0 to 1) based on an input image. Now, I want to make the prediction more robust by incorporating expert knowledge as a subjective probability. For that reason we have created a set of questionnaires that will be asked to the patient to assist the image based analysis. We have collected opinion from human experts (doctors) and they already assigned weights to the answers (in range [-1,3], where, -1 means low probability of the disease, 3 means high probability). A sample is shown in following table: Now, during actual classification I can get a weighted value based on the answer of the user using following equation: where, Symptom can be either 0 or 1 (present or absent). The result will be in the range [-1,3], but I want to convert it to a probability score in the range [0,1]. Is it sufficient to convert the obtained value to [0,1] range using: OldRange = (OldMax - OldMin) NewRange = (NewMax - NewMin) NewValue = (((OldValue - OldMin) * NewRange) / OldRange) + NewMin Or is there any other better approach? So, in the end, I want two probabilities: one from image based deep learning model, another from subjective expert knowledge based on questionnaires and make the final prediction based on these two probabilities. Thanks in advance for your feedback.
