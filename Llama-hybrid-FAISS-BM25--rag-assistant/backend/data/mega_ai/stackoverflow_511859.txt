So, you bulk-load flat files of raw data, you use SQL Server 2005 to process them and get a separate bunch of processed flat files, and then dump the data? Well, if this is correct, SQL backups won't help since you seem to be saying the data doesn't stay in the DB. Your only option is efficient compression of the input and/or output files coupled with good organization of the batches in directories. I would recommend an aggressive compression program, that has scheduled batch functionality, but be careful to not get to esoteric with the program you use for the sake of avoiding being locked in to one program...
