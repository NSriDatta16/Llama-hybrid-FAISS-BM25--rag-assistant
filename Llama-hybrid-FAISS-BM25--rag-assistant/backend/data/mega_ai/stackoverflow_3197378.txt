In medical context, lossy compression is somewhere between not encouraged and forbidden. If you'd insist on cropping existing datasets the standard demands you to form at least new image & series UIDs. The standard does allow losless compression in the form of jpeg2000, but it is quite rare - if I had to bet I'd say your dataset is uncompressed altogether. In my experience it is significantly better to compress a medical dataset as a solid archive - that is, unify all the images into a single stream. This makes a lot of sense, as there is typically a lot of similarity between nearby images and this is the way to take advantage of that similarity (a unified compression dictionary). This is available as a command line option both to rar and gzip compressors.
