How can I test whether 1 category is discontinuous in a linear relationship?

I have a large-scale biophysical neural network, and I record the amount of spikes the cells fire during a stimulus window. There's 2 conditions: one is control and in the other one the addition of GABAzine is simulated, which blocks transmission of GABA-ergic receptors. The cells I record are under the effects of inhibition by another cell type and their synapses uses GABA, so the addition of GABAzine disinhibits my recorded cells. I calculate the difference in activity between the gabazine and control conditions for a certain cell type that has 4 dendrites which can each be connected to only 1 other cell. These presynaptic cells either transmit the input stimulus or they don't; so in the end in this input stage of the network the recorded cells can belong to 1 of 5 categories: 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 dendrites connected to the stimulus. Cells that receive more stimulus fire more when disinhibited, so there's a linear relationship between stimulus strength and disinhibitory effect. I've noticed however that there is a trend for the cells with 3 active dendrites to be less disinhibited and want to investigate. I have 20,000 runs with the following combinatorial design: 20 trials per condition (x20) with and without gabazine (x2) 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 active dendrites (x5) Faster/slower stimulus in 20 steps (x20) Coherence between inhibitory feedback and stimulus in 5 steps (x5) In the end I take 10,000 pairs of runs with and without gabazine and count the difference in spikes fired during the stimulus window. I end up with 100 series of this difference reported across the active dendrite categories, with 100 samples per category (5 coherence levels x 20 trials). Per sample there's 8 sources of Poisson distributed background noise on each of the 4 inhibitory and excitatory synapses that converge on the modelled cell, and the stimulus is each time drawn from a custom distribution to model a physiological "air puff" stimulus on the whiskers of a mouse. All involved biophysical models like the cells and synapses are deterministic. The cells fire about 0-5 spikes in control condition and 3-9 spikes in gabazine condition. The diff usually ranges from 1-5. Is there anything that can confirm that category 3 is not part of the linear relationship, like drawn in this amazing boxplot? The red line being the linear relationship between 1, 2, 4 and the change in activity due to GABAzine across all trials, and 3 being less than the expected linear relationship across all trials. I followed a univerisity course on statistics that can sadly be boiled down to a decision making tree of what tests to select, but I'm very interested to learn more, so aside from the name of the test that I'd need I'd also like to learn from the answer :)
