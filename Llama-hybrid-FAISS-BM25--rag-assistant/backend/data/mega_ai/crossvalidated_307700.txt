Applications typically have the sliding time window much shorter than the overall data length. If you want to get the integral between one time and another for a period longer than the sliding time window, you'd have to carry over the integration result from earlier data than the period covered by a time window. That's inconsistent with the SG idea of just using data withing the time window. Conceptually, SG operation is like a general form of moving average in ARMA terms, only dependent on input values, not on any SG output. But integration, if you're doing it going from one time to another, inherently depends on the output of the previous integration step (more like the "autoregressive" in ARMA models). Why not just use the SG smoother to estimate values (not derivatives) using the polynomial order of your choice and then integrate the smoothed values using your integration method of choice after SG smoothing?
