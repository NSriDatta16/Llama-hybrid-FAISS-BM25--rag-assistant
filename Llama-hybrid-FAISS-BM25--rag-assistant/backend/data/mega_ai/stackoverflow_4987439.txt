IE8 standards mode meta tag

A web application we have for an organisation that is officially upgrading its standard browser from IE6 to IE8 (queue celebrations), we've set all our DOCTYPEs to be (as well as fixed other html code) and I thought that in IE8 this would cause the page to be rendered in IE8 Standards Mode. However, it is still shown in IE7 Standards mode. I've added the into the section and it still fails to default to IE8 Standards mode. I'm presuming at this stage that there must be a setting (perhaps Group Policy etc) that is forcing the mode. After reading a hack on an MSDN forum that if you put the meta tag before the tag, it correctly displays as IE8 Standards mode, and this worked for me. Is there another way to do this? It just looks terrible seeing the meta tag there... Here's roughly how each page is made up: Page Title
