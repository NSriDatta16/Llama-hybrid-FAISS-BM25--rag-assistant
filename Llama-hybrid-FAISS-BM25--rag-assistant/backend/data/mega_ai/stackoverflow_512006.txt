C# (or VB6) Convert Word doc to Tiff

I'm working on a VB6 application that is used by over a hundred users. It generates a Word document, then saves a TIFF image of the document in a database. Currently, it simply sets the printer to Microsoft Office Document Image Writer, "prints" the document to a set location, then imports the resulting TIFF file into the database. However, the organization is in the process of upgrading everyone to Office 07, and this means that Microsoft Office Document Image Writer is going away. So, I'd like to know how hard it would be to programmatically convert from Word to TIFF. We're already bringing in a C# (.NET 3.5) control library as COM, so that seems like a good place to put the functionality. At some point I'll be converting the whole app to 3.5, so I'd prefer that any new code be already there so there's less to convert. EDIT: I appreciate the suggestions, but I'd really like to try and do this without using expensive third-party components. It's just hard to get the money guys to see the merit of spending thousands of dollars to fix something that used to work for free. Plus, I'm genuinely interested in what it would take to roll it myself. A bit masochistic, I know, but I got into programming because I'm cursed with a desire to know how things work... :) Thanks for all your help!
