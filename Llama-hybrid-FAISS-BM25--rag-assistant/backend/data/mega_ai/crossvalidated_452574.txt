I agree the terminology is misleading -- perhaps a more precise naming would be (un)directed latent variable generative models. So a "directed latent variable generative model" is any model in the form $P(x) = \int P(x|h)P(h) dh$ , where $h$ is the latent variable. This includes VAEs, GANs, and flows. The slide you shows probably just splits GANs off into a separate category because it's such a large topic. But in the strict sense yes, an autoregressive model is indeed a directed graphical model.
