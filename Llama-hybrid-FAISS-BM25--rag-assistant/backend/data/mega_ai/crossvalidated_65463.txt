Intuition Behind binomial (logistic) GLM

This is a question regarding using logistic regression, and relating it to gaussian distribution or a binomial distribution. model My understanding of binomial is that it is theta=chance of success z=trails ending in success k=trials ending in failure (theta^z)*(1-theta)^k And something Gaussian is theta = standard deviation x = success u = mean Y = [ 1/σ * sqrt(2π) ] * e -(x - μ)2/2σ2 So I understand how to do GLM with R, I kind of understand what binomial and gaussian means, but I have no understanding of how you relate binomial or gaussian to logistic regression, and how binomial and gaussian are different in this context. Question 1- Can someone explain the intuition behind how "family='binomial'" is used when building a model with GLM? Question 2- Given that the shapes of a binomial distribution and a Gaussian distribution look very much the same (they both peak in the middle and gradually go down towards the ends), how does choosing either binomial or Gaussian lead to different models built from GLM?
