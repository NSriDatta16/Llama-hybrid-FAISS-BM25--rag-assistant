I may be wrong about this, but surely there is no possible way to economise the amount of data returned. The returned array will always use the the amount of bytes needed to store the same number of strings as there are files in the directory. The only ways I can see to reduce memory usage are to use some complex string compression technique or just organise your files into folders and then use the list method on only the ones you need to. Hope that helps.
