Well it depends on your client/boss/etc .. do they require it be validating XHTML? Some people say there are a lot of workarounds - and depending on the sceneraio, they can work great. This includes adding classes, leveraging the rel attribute, and someone that has even written their own parser to extract JSON from HTML comments. HTML5 provides a standard way to do this, prefix your custom attributes with "data-". I would recommend doing this now anyway, as there is a chance you may use an attribute that will be used down the track in standard XHTML.
