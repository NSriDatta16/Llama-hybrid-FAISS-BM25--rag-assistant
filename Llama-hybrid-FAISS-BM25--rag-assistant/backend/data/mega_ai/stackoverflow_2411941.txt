If what you really want is a private method, that is, you don't want the method to be in the header file, then I like to use a Category to accomplish this. I just define the category above my implementation. // Enforce private methods by putting them in a category. @interface YourClass (PrivateMethods) +(void)authenticationRedirectTo:(NSURL *)url WithRelayState:(NSString *)relayState AndSAMLResponse:(NSString *)samlResponse; @end @implementation YourClass +(void)authenticationRedirectTo:(NSURL *)url WithRelayState:(NSString *)relayState AndSAMLResponse:(NSString *)samlResponse { ... } @end Now, it doesn't matter what the order of your methods in your implementation is which is nice so you can properly "#pragma mark"
