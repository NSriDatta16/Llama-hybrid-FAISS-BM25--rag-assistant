You re-use the textual id you gave to the organisation in the fixture (which is just an identifier in the YAML file, it has nothing to do with how it ends up in the database). Since org_id and (I presume) loc_id are auto-generated, you leave them out. Like this: Organisation: apple: org_name: "Apple" banana: org_name: "Banana" Location: apple_loc_1: loc_name: "Apple Location #1" org_id: apple apple_loc_2: loc_name: "Apple Location #2" org_id: apple banana_loc_1: loc_name: "Banana Location" org_id: banana
