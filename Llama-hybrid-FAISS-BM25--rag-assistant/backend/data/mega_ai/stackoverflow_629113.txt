Can you publish the table schema and the index definitions? What do you queries look like? The amount of Reads would hint at massive I/O operations - so maybe due to your table and index setups and/or the way you query, even though you have indices, they're not being used. Do you regularly run maintenance plans on the database? E.g. do your indices get reorganized and/or rebuilt when index fragmentation gets too high? You could always use SQL's Database Tuning Advisor to try and get hints about how to optimize certain queries - or better yet, collect some real-life usage data using a SQL Trace and analyze that for potential tuning steps.
