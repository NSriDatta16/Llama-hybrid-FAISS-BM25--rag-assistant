How to store large amounts of email message bodies

I'm creating a project, with web-mail functionality among others. We have MongoDB as main DBMS, but on huge amounts of emails, it becomes overloaded with message bodies. We've tried to store message bodies on server HD and on S3 node, but it's not very efficient. Is there any good solution for key-value storing of huge number of files (possibly cloud storage, or some NoSQL DBMS or anything else)?
