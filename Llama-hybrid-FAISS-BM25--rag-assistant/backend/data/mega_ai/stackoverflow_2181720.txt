Since you said "in theory", that implies you are interested in reading a lot of academic papers on the subject, because I think there's plenty of theoretical work out there, usually supported by proof-of-concept experiments. I took a class on this 3 years ago, so my knowledge is both introductory and out-of-date, but try searching for something like "neural network language evolution" on Google Scholar*. The simulations in those papers should give you some ideas of what other researchers have tried. Then, a good place to start is to replicate one of the experiments that you find interesting. Disclaimer: I had to do just that for the class, and it sucked. I decided that I preferred working programs to theoretical experiments. But you said "in theory" so this might be the kind of thing you really like. *Sorry, I can't remember the exact papers we read.
