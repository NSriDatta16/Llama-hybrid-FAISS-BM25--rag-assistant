How to change the distribution of classes?

I have two classes [0,1] and I want to evaluate algorithm on different distributions of classes. I did label flipping incrementally such as 0%, 10%,20%,....,90%,100%. Does label flipping change the distributions of classes or just add noise to the dataset. I attached figure for label flipping with different percentages 10%,30%,50%,70%,90%,100% . The purpose of doing this is to evaluate algorithm on different distributions of dataset. I have a weak knowledge in machine learning and distribution. Thank you for any help you can offer.
