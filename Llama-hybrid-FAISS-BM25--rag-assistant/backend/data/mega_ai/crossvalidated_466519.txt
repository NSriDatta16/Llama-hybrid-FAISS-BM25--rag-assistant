I think you are mixing up the different dependent variables you can have in your analysis. One thing is is to see how the different swimming conditions affect cycle time or stroke length. This implies 2 different models in my mind: $$ C = \alpha_1 + \beta_1 I_{condition=2} $$ $$ S = \alpha_2 + \beta_2 I_{condition=2} $$ Where $C$ is cycle speed and $S$ is stroke length and $I$ an indicator function. However, to the question you seem to be asking, these models will not be very useful in answering. How can you judge $\beta_1 > \beta_2$ , since they are in different units? What you seem to be implying is that $Y = f(S, C)$ where $Y$ is time until lap completion, which means that different cycle time and stroke lengths will lead to different different lap times. Since you have multiple subjects (swimmers) and multiple laps I suggest you the following approach. This is simplified, since there should be a few more caveats to make it suitable for the hypothesis your are studying. Let $Y_{i,t}$ be the time until completion of the $i$ th swimmer to finish lap $t$ . $C_{i,t}$ , Let $S_{i,t}$ be the cycle speed and stroke lengths, respectively, during that swimmer's lap. Also, let $I_{i,t}$ indicate the condition that swimmer $i$ was fast (condition 2) during lap $t$ . $$ Y_{i,t} = \alpha + \beta_1C_{i,t}+\beta_2S_{i,t} + \beta_3I_{i,t}C_{i,t}+\beta_4I_{i,t}S_{i,t} $$ With this model, you can see that the effect of a higher cycle speed on speed for some one in condition 1 is $\beta_1$ , and for a swimmer in condition 2 is $\beta_1+\beta_3$ . Additionally, with this model you can test if $\beta_3 > \beta_4$ which is equivalent of asking "is the effect on time until completion of a lap of a higher cycle speed greater the that of stroke length for individuals who are in condition 2?". Now for some caveats. 1) the variable $Y$ , time until lap completion is strictly positive, so a generalised linear model with a gamma link should be more appropriate than a linear model. 2) the average swimmer's time until lap completion can be different due to other reasons other then the modelled condition/stroke lenght/cycle speed. And you should attempt to control for that. Some things come to mind, a) there can be some swimmers who are faster then others, b) the average time to completion should be different across laps. Conditioning on the last lap seems different than the first. This suggests that $t$ should be covariate in the model. To address all this problems and to test the hypothesis you are after, I would go after hierarchical models (aka multilevel models, repeated measures models, or longitudinal analysis models).
