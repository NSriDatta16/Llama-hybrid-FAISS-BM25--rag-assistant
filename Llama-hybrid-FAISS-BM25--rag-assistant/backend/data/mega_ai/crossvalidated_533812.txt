You are right that views and clicks from the same user are not independent events, and this violates the assumptions of classical tests like a t-test on proportions. This grouping behavior in the data could be addressed by, for example, using a mixed effects logistic regression with a random intercept for each cookie, or a bootstrap or permutation test stratified by cookie (so that the unit of re-sampling is all of the views and clicks for each cookie). However, you can keep going in this direction virtually forever. For example, the cookies are also not independent samples -- cookies correspond to real people who know each other and share links, different people who use the same device, cookies from one geographic region may be correlated (perhaps it was rainy so users stayed inside and were more active), etc.. As George E P Box said, "all models are wrong, but some are useful", and so your goal should be to find a model that is useful for understanding the signal in your data.
