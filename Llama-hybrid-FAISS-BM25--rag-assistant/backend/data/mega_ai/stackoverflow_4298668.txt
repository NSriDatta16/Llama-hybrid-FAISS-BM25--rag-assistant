You are correct that the & is optional. Functions, like arrays, can be automatically converted into pointers. It's neither compiler-specific nor the result of different language standards. From the standard, Section 6.3.2.1 , paragraph 4: A function designator is an expression that has function type. Except when it is the operand of the sizeof operator or the unary & operator, a function designator with type "function returning type " is converted to an expression that has type "pointer to function returning type ".
