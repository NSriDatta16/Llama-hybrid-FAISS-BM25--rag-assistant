SQLite3 storing String which contains only numbers

I have to run a very simple query like this in SQLite3. INSERT OR REPLACE INTO tblPhoneList(Phone, PeopleId, StorageType) VALUES('+91912345789', '1','1'); But whatever I do, the number is stored as 91912345789. The + prefix is ignored. The field Phone is a String . Why does it ignore the + prefix? Is there anyway to avoid this? P.S. This code is run inside Android EDIT: This is the schema of the table CREATE TABLE tblPhoneList(Phone STRING PRIMARY KEY ON CONFLICT REPLACE, StorageT ype INTEGER, PeopleId INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY(PeopleId) references tblPeople(id));
