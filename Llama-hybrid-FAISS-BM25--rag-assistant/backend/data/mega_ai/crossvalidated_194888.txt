Difference in Difference vs repeated measures

Hi I am trying to understand the difference between Difference in Difference analysis and a repeated measures ANOVA. My DiD data set is made up of 32 treated and 32 non treated subjects each with 2 observations per subject (pre and post), just like a repeated measures ANOVA. In my data set treatment was not assigned randomly so this is not an experiment but My understanding is a regression model in R for the DiD would be y ~ treatment + time + treatment:time Where treatment is a dummy = 1 if treated, and 0 otherwise. Time is a dummy = 1 if post, and otherwise. The interaction term is the average treatment effect. But given the repeated measures on each individual, should I use y ~ treatment + time + treatment:time + Error(subject/time) ?
