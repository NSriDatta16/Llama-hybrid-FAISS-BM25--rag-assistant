I have never used the lm_robust function before, but I would suggest a logistic regression model for this study, which you can do with the glm() function. It would allow you to compare mixed groups to both types of non-mixed groups (question 1) and allow you to analyze the predictors of changing beliefs (question 2). Set up your data in an $n by 5$ data frame with variables $Pair=\left\{1,...,n\right\}$ , $Type 1=\left\{0,1\right\}$ , $Type 2=\left\{0,1\right\}$ , and $Change=\left\{0,1\right\}$ , where $Pair$ is an identifying variable, $Type 1$ describes if they were in a Republican/Republican group, $Type 2$ describes if they were in a Democrat/Democrat groups, and $Change$ describes whether their beliefs changed. For example: Pair Type 1 Type 2 Change 1 0 0 1 2 0 1 0 3 1 0 1 4 1 0 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . This would make mixed groups your reference group, such that for mixed groups $Type1=0$ and $Type2=0$ . Now, use R to do a logistic regression and analyze it: mod=glm(Change~Type1+Type2,family='binomial') summary(mod) confint(mod) exp(coef(mod))/(1+exp(coef(mod))) This creates model, summarizes it, gives confidence intervals, and gives odds ratios. The odds ratios are one way to answer both your questions. Probabilities are also another way to answer both your questions.The probability of changing beliefs is given by $$\pi(change=1)=\frac{exp(\beta_0+\beta_1*Type1+\beta_2*Type2)}{1+exp(\beta_0+\beta_1*Type1+\beta_2*Type2)}$$ Thus, for mixed groups, the probability of change is $$\pi(change=1|Type=Mixed)=\frac{exp(\beta_0+\beta_1*0+\beta_2*0)}{1+exp(\beta_0+\beta_1*0+\beta_2*0)}=\frac{exp(\beta_0)}{1+exp(\beta_0)}$$ and the probability of change for a Republican/Republican group is $$\pi(change=1|Type=RR)=\frac{exp(\beta_0+\beta_1*1+\beta_2*0)}{1+exp(\beta_0+\beta_1*1+\beta_2*0)}=\frac{exp(\beta_0+\beta_1)}{1+exp(\beta_0+\beta_1)}$$ and the probability of change for a Democrat/Democrat group is $$\pi(change=1|Type=DD)=\frac{exp(\beta_0+\beta_1*0+\beta_2*1)}{1+exp(\beta_0+\beta_1*0+\beta_2*1)}=\frac{exp(\beta_0+\beta_2)}{1+exp(\beta_0+\beta_2)}$$
