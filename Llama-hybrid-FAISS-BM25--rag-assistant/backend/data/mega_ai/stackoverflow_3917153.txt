Populate a class from Linq to XML

Ok, so I have an XML file that pretty much looks like this: 00X500000011iTSEAY 00550000000mfOU 00550000000mb3pAAA 00G50000001PiHz AccountExecutive SalesLead SalesManager With that, what I'm trying to do is to populate some classes that can make sense of that. So the first thought I had was something like this for the To Elements: public class EmailRecipient { public ToRecipient To {get;set;} public CCRecipient CC {get;set;} } public class ToRecipient { public string Key {get;set;} public string Type {get;set;} } Not entirely elegant, but this is my rough draft. I'm trying to use Linq to XML for this since I know what TemplateId I have, and then I can just populate the class with the values. Here's where I'm at...and stuck in this test app: var results = from x in xmlDoc.Descendants(XName.Get("Template") where x.Element(XName.Get("TemplateID")).Value == "00X500000011iTSEAY" select new EmailRecipient() { ToRecipient = }; With all of that being said, I'm looking to get a collection of "Tos" where each "to" can a "type" value. Any help would be greatly appreciated, I've done more in with XML in the past 3 days than have in the past 3 years, and that ain't much. Thanks so much for any help.
