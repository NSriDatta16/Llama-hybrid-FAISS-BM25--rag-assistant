The easiest way I can think of would be to deploy your service twice: one with the low/medium endpoints and then a completely different instance with the high endpoint. As Endian said in his answer (which I voted for BTW), you could physically seperate them, but you could also have them running on the same box is you who two instances using different ports. This is the way I would do it (or REALLY push for) if I had to do it. You're other (unappealing) option is to create a custom channel that is capable of manipluating the messages and putting them in a seperate "VIP" line, and a corresponding operation behavior that can pull from the "VIP" line when the service operation is ready to recieve a message. This doesn't really buy you anything over the first option because all you're doing is making sure your service runs in one "set" of service instances. I'm guessing that in your situation this doesn't buy you much. As far as stopping and re-starting the service is a higher priority request comes in, there be dragons. I would avoid it if at all possible. If not, you might want to consider creating your service as a WF workflow and using some of it's process start/stop functionality, but you'll still need some a custom channel and some custom behavior to make that work. At this point, you might want to think about BizTalk.
