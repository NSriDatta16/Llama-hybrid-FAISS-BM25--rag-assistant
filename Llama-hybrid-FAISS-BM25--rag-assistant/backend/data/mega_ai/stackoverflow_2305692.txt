Gray or green are used for comments, as the other colours have more desirable properties and so are reserved for more impactful areas of the code. For example, tight loops are often in red to make them go faster, and code for children is often blue (for the same reason they learn handwriting in blue), to make it less difficult and more familiar. Blue is often also used for language keywords and APIs to make them easier to understand. Very important code or comments are in green, due to the increased ability of the human eye to discern green. Black and grey are used for tedious and boring areas of the code, to encourage you to look elsewhere, such as the bright and exciting interfaces and documentation (which are in blue and green as above). Viruses, trojans and the like are always written in white, so they can evade detection by the majority of desktop themes.
