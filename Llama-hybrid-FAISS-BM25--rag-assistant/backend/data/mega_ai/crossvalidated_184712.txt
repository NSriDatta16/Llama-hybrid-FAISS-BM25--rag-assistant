Scale predicted probability in logistic regression

I am trying to 1) classify a bunch of [0,1] ratios into two groups Group 0: Ratio = 0, Group 1: Ratio != 0. 2) predict the actual response with multiple predictors in R. My question would then be: Q1: Can I use the scaled predicted probability as the predicted response? Q2: Should I classify the group before the regression before running the regression to solve the warning message? Would the data structure/predicted be affected? I thought of achieving Goal 1 and Goal 2 separately but I can't seem to find a way to fit a unbalanced [0,1] non-censored data with good prediction. Basically my response is something like this y and y is strictly between 0 to 1. I then fit it with a logistic regression and get the predicted probability: fit I used the probability to make classification model (Goal 1) class =cutoff]=1 table(fit.pred,class) However, I also want to predict y from new data set, this is probably wrong, but here's what I did se and I used this to be the prediction interval for y. Is there any other way to do it other than this?
