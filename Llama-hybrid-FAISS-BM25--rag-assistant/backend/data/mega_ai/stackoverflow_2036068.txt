JS+Regexp: Match anything except if it's between [[ ]]

I've got a that will be basically a list of names, so I set a function to replace the spaces between the names for a new line. Now I need to specify that two or more spaces between names are in fact part of the same element. IE: John Lucas [[Laurie Vega]] [[Daniel Deer]] Robert Should turn to John Lucas [[Laurie Vega]] [[Daniel Deer]] Robert So now my regexp $("textarea").val().toString().replace(\ \g, '\n'); is broken as it will add a new line before Vega and Deer. I need to replace anything that's not in between [ and ] . I just made the opposite and tried to negate it, but it doesn't seem to work: // Works $("textarea").val().toString().match(/\[([^\]]*)\]/g)); // Am I using the ! operand wrong? $("textarea").val().toString().match(/!\[([^\]]*)\]/g)); I'm a little lost. I tried matching and then replacing, but that way I won't be able to recover my original string. So I have to match anything outside double brackets and replace the space.
