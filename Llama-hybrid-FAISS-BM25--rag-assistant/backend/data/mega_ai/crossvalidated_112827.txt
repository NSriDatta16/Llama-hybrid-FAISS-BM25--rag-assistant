Analytic or sample standard deviation with binomial data

I've been looking for recommendations on whether it's better to use the sample standard deviation (SD) for a binomial distribution or use the analytic SD (or variance). It's for experiments with accuracy data so each subject contributes several binomial (correct or incorrect) responses resulting in an accuracy score between 0 an 1 (Ncorrect / Ntotal). I get the mean across subjects. Assuming each one contributes the same amount should I used the sample SD of the individual accuracy scores or use the analytic equation ( sqrt(pq / n ) where n is the number of responses / subject)? This is a query for descriptive purposes only. I could use a multi-level logistic regression to model but I'm just looking for simple descriptives. Example: Each subject gets 20 tries at the task and there are 6 subjects with accuracy 0.95, 0.80, 0.80, 0.65, 0.90, 0.70 . The mean accuracy would be 0.8 and therefore the analytic SD of that accuracy is sqrt(0.8 * 0.2 / 20) = 0.089 . However, the SD of those six numbers calculated on the sample is 0.114. Which is the better SD estimate to use?
