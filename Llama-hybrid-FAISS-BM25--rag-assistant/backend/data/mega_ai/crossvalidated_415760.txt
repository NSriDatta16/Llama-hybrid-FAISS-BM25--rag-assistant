The plot() function can be very useful here. In fact, you can do something like this to change the labels that appear on the plot. The plot of the RandomForest will show error rates, and are very useful for analyzing the performance of the algorithm, for the different number of trees. I recently used this: cat(paste0('Here is a plot of the random forest for this grade, and its error rates\n')) plot(model1, main = paste('Grade ', g)) In this case, the variable 'g' is the grade level of the student, and this is a looping variable, believe it or not. Each time through the loop, g begins at 1 and ends at 12. Hope that helps!
