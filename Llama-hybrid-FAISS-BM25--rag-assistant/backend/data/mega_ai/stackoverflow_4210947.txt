When using xhprof profiling PHP code, how to prevent it from destroying the Ajax call from the JavaScript client?

When I am using xhprof profiling PHP code, it works fine. I reference the documentation written by Lorenzo Alberton, http://techportal.inviqa.com/2009/12/01/profiling-with-xhprof/ . But you know that we always have many Ajax calls in a web application. When I try to include header.php and footer.php in this article, how can I prevent it from destroying the Ajax call from the JavaScript client?
