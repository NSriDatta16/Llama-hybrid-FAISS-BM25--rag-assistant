Force Initialization of an enumerated type in Java

I am attempting to find a way to force Java to load/initialize an enumerated type (which is nested within a class that contains a static Map). This is important to me because the enumerated type has a constructor that populates said map, and without an explicit way to initialize this enum, the map will remain empty. I have attempted to use Class.forName , but this does not seem to work. I suppose I could create an instance of the enum (and store it in soem other collection or something), but I would like to know if there is an elegant way to do this.
