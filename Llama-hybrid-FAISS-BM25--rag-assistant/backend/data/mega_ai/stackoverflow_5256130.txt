jquery: click on a P, its color changes, click on another p, it's color changes. when clicking 2nd P, change the first P color?

i'm trying to access the previously clicked paragraph/element. The user will click a paragraph, and the bg-color changes from white to blue, visually what this means for the user is that the P they clicked is now selected. When they click on a different paragraph, the previously selected paragraph's bg-color changes from blue back to white. Is there a way to select the previously clicked paragraph? preferably without adding and removing classes. Obviously my code below doesn't work, but i've explained how I think the answer might work? $('p').bind('click', function () { //checks if an item was previously selected, if so, sets background back to white $(previouslySelected).css({'backgroundColor':'white'}) //change the current background blue, then store this item for the next click $(this).css({'backgroundColor':'blue'}) var previouslySelected = $(this) })
