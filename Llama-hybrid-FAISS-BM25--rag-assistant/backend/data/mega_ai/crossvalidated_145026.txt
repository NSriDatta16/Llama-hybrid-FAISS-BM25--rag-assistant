How to best analyze several time series of speed data? Comparing regression analysis?

So I have several time series of AIS data, aka time, speed and geographical position at that moment for thousands of ships. They all have that in mutual that they are arriving at the same spot, but have different origin. How could I use these to generalize the speed (in parts of the journey) for the vessels heading to the same sport? Do a regression analysis over all these different time series, then compare the regression analysis for these? Edit: I want to give an generalization of how the typical speed through a journey is based on the journey of all the vessels. Is the speed high in the first 50% of the journey, then lower in the last 50%? Is it varying a lot? Ideally I want kind of continuous graph showing the speed on different parts of the journey (maybe down to single &), but I am really unsure if thats the best to describe how the speed along the journey for all these vessels are. These vessel can travel just a couple hours or across the globe. The idea is to get a good "oversight" over the general data, before I start any hypothesis testing.
