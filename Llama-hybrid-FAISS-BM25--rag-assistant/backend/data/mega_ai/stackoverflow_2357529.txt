Session variables clearing on response.redirect ('page.aspx",false)

I have an webforms app that loses it's session variables on response.redirect. I've read Bertrand Le Roy's blog about this and still can't get it to work. The page works in production. However, when I try in the VS2k8 IDE, the session variables are there right before response.redirect and on the first line of the next page, the variables are nothing. I've confirmed the session id is the same so I'm not skipping sessions. The target page is relative so the web server doesn't think we're changing sites (as confirmed by the sessionid). Here is the line I'm using: Response.Redirect("menu.aspx", False) Ideas?
