Does it means a high accuracy of model will have high confidence score

I am trying to select a model from different CNN trained models based on some parameter. Initially, I was considering using model confidence score to decide which model is better. Now I am considering using accuracy for the selection of a good model among other models. I need to ask is there a relation between accuracy and confidence score, does it means high accuracy leads to high confidence score and vice versa. Thanks
