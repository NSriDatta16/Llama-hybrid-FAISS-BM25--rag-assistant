ACF and PACF can be used to determine the autoregressive and the moving-average orders of an ARMA model. It will be easy in cases of pure AR or pure MA model, i.e. either ARMA($p$,0) or ARMA(0,$q$). (You should be able to find detailed examples in a time series textbook or elsewhere on Cross Validated.) Meanwhile, the order of an ARMA model with both $p$ and $q$ being nonzero may be difficult to read just from ACF and PACF. I doubt that auto.arima indeed systematically tends to overfit. The algorithm behind the function has been empirically proven to work alright in many cases. For example, it delivers relatively high forecast accuracy on the M competition dataset consisting of some 3000 time series with their characteristics varying a lot. Also, note that you can choose between AICc (default), AIC and BIC for model selection in auto.arima . AICc will be optimized for forecasting, but BIC may be more suitable if you want the model selection to be consistent (I intentionally put it a little vaguely because the topic of AIC against BIC is too wide to cover here; you may see, for example, Burnham & Anderson "Multimodel Inference: Understanding AIC and BIC in Model Selection" ). If you are modelling stock prices, there is little chance they will be anything else than a random walk, i.e. ARIMA(0,1,0), plus perhaps a GARCH-type pattern in the variance of the series. Also, there should be no seasonality in stock prices so you do not need to adjust for day-of-the-week effects; hence, you can just delete the days with no observations. However, if you take a long enough period, there might be some cycles and auto.arima might deliver something else than ARIMA(0,1,0). But from the subject-matter perspective it would be quite problematic for the stock prices to exhibit systematic patterns and to be predictable. It could perhaps be safer to just asssume an ARIMA(0,1,0), although I am not saying that this is unconditionally the best solution.
