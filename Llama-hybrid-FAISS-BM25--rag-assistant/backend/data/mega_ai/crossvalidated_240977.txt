Better classification performance when using an RBF kernel function in high dimensional space?

I'm learning about SVM's and understand that boosting something into a higher dimension can sometimes help separate the data better. However, if I were to perform 1 nearest neighbor with the RBF kernel, is it possible that the classification performance is better in the higher dimensional space than the lower dimensional space?
