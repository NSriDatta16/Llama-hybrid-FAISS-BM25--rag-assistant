You have at least one, and possibly two, problems. Firstly, you should use dojo.place to place the HTML fragment in the page, not innerHTML . Secondly (and you may not be doing this) you shouldn't ever run the parser over a part of the DOM where the parser has already been run. If you do you'll end up with the error 'Tried to register a widget with if 'foo' but that id is already registered'. Basically, just like IDs have to be unique for DOM nodes, they have to be unique for widgets too. You have a couple of options: Don't return a document fragment/HTML text from your JSP. Instead, use JSON or similar and construct the new form elements programmatically in the load() callback. Do what you're doing (but make sure you've got unique IDs) but rather than using innerHTML use dojo.place() . Then keep track of the new table node you're creating and only parse that. For example: Apples Oranges Pears I agree Add new fields using HTML dojo.xhrGet({ url: '_data/mockBackendForXhrBuildDomExample.php', handleAs: 'text', preventCache: true, load: function(data) { // This is a little contrived, but hopefully you get the idea console.log(data); var container = dojo.byId('container'); var newTable = dojo.place(data, container, 'last'); dojo.parser.parse(newTable); }, error: function(error) { console.error(error); } }); dojo.require("dijit.form.FilteringSelect"); dojo.require("dijit.form.TextBox"); dojo.require("dijit.form.CheckBox"); dojo.require("dijit.form.Button"); dojo.addOnLoad(function() { }); I've added an example of this working at http://telliott.net/dojoExamples/dojo-xhrBuildDomExample.html . The HTML returned by the AJAX call can be found at http://telliott.net/dojoExamples/_data/mockBackendForXhrBuildDomExample.php (it uses the PHP time() function, so don't hit the button more than once a second!).
