Well, if a disgruntled employee leaves, you can easily remove them from all your repositories, especially if you are using the Organizations - you just remove them from a team. In the event that someone deletes a repository maliciously that still had access for some reason, we have daily backups of all of the repositories that we will reconstitute if you ask. So you would never lose more than one day of code work at worst. Likely someone on the team will have an update with that code anyhow. If you need more protection than that, then yes, you can setup a cron'd fetch or something that will do mirrors of your code more often.
