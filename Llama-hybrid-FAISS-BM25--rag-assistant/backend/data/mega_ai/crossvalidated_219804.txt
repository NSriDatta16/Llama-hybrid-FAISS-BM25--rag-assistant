Odds Ratios can be tricky to interpret sometimes, and I could try and explain it to you but I think this link would do the explanation better justice that I would: How do I interpret odds ratios in logistic regression? As for the probability (which I am assuming you obtained through your log odds ratio), I think you need to delve into your data to see why you're seeing such a peak, it is most likely related to that. And also, you could calculate the change in log odds and change in odds for your independent variable to help you understand the changes per unit increase (also explained in the link above). Hope that helps!
