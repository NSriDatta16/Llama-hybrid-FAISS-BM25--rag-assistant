(Whats a VPS?) That aside, do you really need to maintain your own bug tracking installation? We have moved our system from an inhouse Bugzilla to Assembla (www.assembla.com) and it is great! I have a lot more time to do my actual job these days instead of dealing with multi-tool integration problems. For the record I think Trac is part of Assembla's integration. We are a small organization so the Assembla fees are pretty light, I think we're up to maybe $25/mo (including all of our SVN hosting) so that's about 10 minutes of my time (wink;) and I was easily spending 1/2 day a month on tools issues. You'd have to scope it out to see if their offering makes sense for your organization. (BTW I don't work for Assembla!) My apologies to give you a non-technical answer to your technical question.
