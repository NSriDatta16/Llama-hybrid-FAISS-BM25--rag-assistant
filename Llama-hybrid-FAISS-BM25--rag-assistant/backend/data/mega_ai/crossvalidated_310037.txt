t-SNE dimensionality reduction for classification

Reading about t-SNE, and looking at the pretty plots, it seems to be very good at separating things that we "expect" to be separate in low dimensions. Why wouldn't we use this to do dimensionality reduction before using some sort of classification algorithm (something data-hungry like a DNN for example)? EDIT: to rephrase and generalize slightly further, since t-SNE preserves separatbility so well when it is nicely tuned, why not go for t-SNE in 2 or 3-D and then a nonlinear classifier, instead of a standard $k$-dimension reduction like PCA or ICA?
