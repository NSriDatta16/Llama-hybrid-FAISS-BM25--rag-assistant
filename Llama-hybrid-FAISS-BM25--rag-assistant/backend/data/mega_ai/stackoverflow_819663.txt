Reading RFC2616 it specifies Location: absoluteURI where absolute URI is defined by RFC2396 Tracing the definition of absoluteURI, the # character is not part of the URI definition, this is confirmed by section 4.1 4.1. Fragment Identifier When a URI reference is used to perform a retrieval action on the identified resource, the optional fragment identifier, separated from the URI by a crosshatch ("#") character, consists of additional reference information to be interpreted by the user agent after the retrieval action has been successfully completed. As such, it is not part of a URI, but is often used in conjunction with a URI. In short, the #fragment is not part of the URI, and is being stripped by the browser as not part of the Location: header.
