You want to consider using Lua's coroutines for each autonomous agent, instead of a completely separate VM. Coroutines are a more lightweight solution, but may or may not be suitable for your application. If you can't change the architecture, you might try LuaJIT .

It also offers a simple way to communicate between the creator (master) and the created (slave) states." Pluto : "Pluto is a library which allows users to write arbitrarily large portions of the "Lua universe" into a flat file, and later read them back into the same or a different Lua universe."
