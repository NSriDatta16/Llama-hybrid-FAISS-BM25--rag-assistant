There are two elements to your question: What tools do you need Where do you get the skills you need? The tools are free, and the links above are fine, though I would probably start here In any case, you do need some form of Visual Studio 2010 but we have a free version especially designed for the phone. All you need besides that are the (free) Windows Phone 7 Developer Tools, though I strongly recommend picking up the documentation and guides. As for learning WP7 programming, you have many choices. Many of the best are discussed in the Windows Phone Team Blog . In addition, we have numerous videos on Silverlight.net and I have an couple of on going mini-tutorial series (one targeted at Silverlight programmers and one at iPhone Programmers) on my blog . There are also lessons, and much more coming out every week. Best of luck with it and let us know how it goes -Jesse Liberty Senior Community Program Manager - Silverlight and Windows Phone 7 Microsoft
