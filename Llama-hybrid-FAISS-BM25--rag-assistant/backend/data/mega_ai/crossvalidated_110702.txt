Why are there more bayesians than frequentists in astrophysics?

I heard somewhere that in astrophysics, there are more bayesians than frequentists (although in general, I think that bayesian community is smaller). Is there something special about "astro" data what makes it more suitable for bayesian methods? EDIT : The motivation for my question was also this kaggle competition , where the bayesian approach outperformed others. Therefore it seems that there could be something special about astro data.
