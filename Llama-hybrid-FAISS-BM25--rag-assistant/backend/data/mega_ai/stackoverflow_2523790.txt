Custom header using PHP soap functions

I am having a problem getting a custom soap header to work with PHP5. Can anybody guide me please. What I require is something like this myusername mypassword What I get is : myusername mypassword I would like to remove the namespace tags. The code I use to get this is: class Authstuff { public $USER; public $PASSWORD; public function __construct($user, $pass) { $this->USER = $user; $this->PASSWORD = $pass; } } $auth = new Authstuff('myusername', 'mypassword'); $param = array('Authstuff' => $auth); $authvalues = new SoapVar($auth,SOAP_ENC_OBJECT); $header = new SoapHeader('http://soapinterop.org/echoheader/',"null",$authvalues); Null doesn't seem to pass.. with 'null' I still get name space as in second example.. how to exclude this NS... thanks for your help in advance.. $headers = array(); $headers[] = new SoapHeader(null, 'USER', $username); $headers[] = new SoapHeader(null, 'PASSWORD', $password); $client->__setSoapHeaders($headers); try { $result = $client->getAvailableLicensedDNCount('ASX01'); print_r($result); Fatal error: SoapHeader::SoapHeader(): Invalid parameters. Invalid namespace. in /usr/home/deepesh/SoapCalls/deepesh7.php on line 29
