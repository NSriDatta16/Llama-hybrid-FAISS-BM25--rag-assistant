Rank-sum test and conditional probability

Consider three samples, i.e. three different lists of numbers, A, B and C. The sample sizes of the respective samples might be different. How can I calculate the probability that a draw from sample A exceeds a draw from sample B given that a draw from sample A exceeds sample C? I am looking for an elegant an resource saving method as proposed here . With the reply to this question, which was also posted by myself, I hoped to figure out the rest by myself, but I was wrong in that. Any helpful comments are appreciated!
