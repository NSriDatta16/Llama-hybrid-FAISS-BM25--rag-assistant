Improve performance of SVM

I have written some code for an SVM and the final output isn’t brilliant. The data is linearly separable so I don’t understand why the data isn’t perfectly separated. Here is the code: from matplotlib import pyplot as plt, numpy as np x = np.array([[-2, 4, -1], [4, 1, -1], [1, 6, -1], [2, 4, -1], [6, 2, -1]]) y = np.array([-1, -1, 1, 1, 1]) def svm_sgd(X, Y): w = np.zeros(len(X[0])) # Parameters eta = 1 epochs = 100000 # Update rules for epoch in range(1, epochs): for i, x in enumerate(X): if (Y[i] * np.dot(X[i], w)) The bottom portion just uses matplotlib to print the data, so it’s not part of the SVM algorithm, and can therefore be ignored. The problem ~ can anyone explain to me, based on my code, why the line doesn’t separate the data more perfectly?
