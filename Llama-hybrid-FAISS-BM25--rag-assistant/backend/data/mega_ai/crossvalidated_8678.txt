Surprisingly, as a search of Google Images indicates, such graphs do not appear to be in common use to study or explain multiple correlations. That's a pity, because I'm sure much of this theory can be reduced to simple operations on graphs. Nevertheless, this graphical method to display correlations (or their mathematical equivalents, cosines of angles) has been in use a long time ( at least 75 years ) in the form of a Coxeter-Dynkin diagram . For instance, the A3 diagram 0--0--0 represents three variables X , Y , and Z where X and Z (the outer nodes) are uncorrelated and the correlations between X and Y and Z and Y are both -0.5. In the usual applications of these diagrams, certain special "correlations" (angles) are important, so a special method of labeling the edges with the correlations is used, but this functions no differently than using other forms of labeling such as colors. When you use a "distance" metric monotonically related to correlation, then any 2D MDS calculation can be (and usually is) thought of as embedding this graph in the plane so that Euclidean distances reflect the correlations. This illustrates the intimate connection between correlation-based clustering methods and graphs of correlation. As another example in this vein, a dendrogram , when it is derived from a correlation-based similarity matrix, is another network-based way of displaying correlations. (However, it uses vertical position in an essential way to display similarity, and so is not a purely network-based method.)
