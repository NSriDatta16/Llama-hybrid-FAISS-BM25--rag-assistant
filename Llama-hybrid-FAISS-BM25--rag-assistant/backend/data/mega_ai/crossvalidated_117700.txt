The main aim of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is to look for the directions on $\mathbb{R}^p$ that maximize the variance of the projected random vector $X=(X_1,\ldots,X_p)$. Specifically, the first PC can be defined as the unit vector $v_{(1)}\in\mathbb{R}^p$ such that $$v_{(1)}=\arg\max_{v\in\mathbb{R}^p,||v||=1}\mathbb{V}\mathrm{ar}\big[v^TX\big].$$ If you allow vectors that are not of unit norm in the maximization problem, then you will not get a proper solution, since variance of the projection can become arbitrarily large as long as the norm of the vector increases. For example, if $w=\lambda v$, with $v,w\in\mathbb{R}^p$ and $\lambda\to\infty$, then $$\mathbb{V}\mathrm{ar}\big[w^TX\big]=\lambda^2\mathbb{V}\mathrm{ar}\big[v^TX\big]\to\infty\quad (\text{if }\mathbb{V}\mathrm{ar}\big[v^TX\big]\neq0).$$ This is the reason why you need an standardization of unit norm to constraint the search and avoid improper solutions.
