In Flot, is it possible to eliminate or hide grid ticks without eliminating the corresponding label?

The Flot API documentation describes the library's extensive hooks for customizing the axes of a graph. You can set the number of ticks, their color, etc. separately for each axis. However, I can not figure out how to prevent Flot from drawing the vertical grid lines without also removing the x-axis labels. I've tried changing the tickColor, ticks, and tickSize options with no success. I want to create beautiful, Tufte-compatible graphs such as these: http://www.robgoodlatte.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/tufte_mint.gif http://www.argmax.com/mt_blog/archive/RealGDP_graph.jpg I find the vertical ticks on my graphs to be chart junk. I am working with a time series that I am displaying as vertical bars so the vertical ticks often cut through the bars in a way that is visually noisy.
