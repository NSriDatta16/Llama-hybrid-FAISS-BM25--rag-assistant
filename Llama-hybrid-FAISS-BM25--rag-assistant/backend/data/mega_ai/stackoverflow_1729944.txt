ASP.NET MVC, JSON post to controller action with FormCollection parameter

I have a bunch of controller actions mostly used for saving data to backend storage. For now most of them use a signature like this: // // POST: /WidgetZone/Create [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public ActionResult Create(FormCollection collection) as you can see, it accepts FormCollection. This works fine with classic user views. Now I want to JSON- enable these actions. And I do it using JsonPox action filter like this: // // POST: /WidgetZone/Create [JsonPox] [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public ActionResult Create(FormCollection collection) Will this work when the action expects FormCollection? For instance this work without issues (of course I construct Json object in my JavaScript client-side to pass it into this action): // // POST: /WidgetZone/Create [JsonPox] [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public ActionResult Create(string id, string description) It is all about a task of converting postback UI into asynchronous one, so that saves and updates would be done async. Am I on the right track? I do think that developing separate Json, XML or classic ViewResult actions is not the best way to go. Help appreciated
