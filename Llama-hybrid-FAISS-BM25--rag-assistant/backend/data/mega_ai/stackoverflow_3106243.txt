With the way you phrased your question, this is how you read a plist that has been included in the bundle before build: NSString *propertyListPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:SomeString ofType:@"plist"]; If you want to access the directories that each app has as a unique storage area for a file that you create AFTER build, you use this: #define kFilename @”data.plist” - (NSString *)dataFilePath { NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES); NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0]; return [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:kFilename]; } Then you can check for it and do some data handling here: NSString *filePath = [self dataFilePath]; if ([[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:filePath]) { // do something with data here } You would save yourself a lot of trouble if you bought/read Beginning iPhone 3 Development specifically chapter 11 where he goes over data persistence (which is where this example came from). It's a great book.
