Machine Learning Approach for Aerodynamic Design?

I am new to ML so please excuse my ignorance. I am trying to use machine learning to enhance the design of turbomachinery components. Traditionally, a component such as a compressor is parameterized via maybe 30 or so parameters and then these parameters are tuned by hand using an iterative process involving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to evaluate potential designs. The engineer uses his/her judgment to guide the design until it is satisfactory with regard to efficiency, stress etc. Essentially the engineer is trying to find the best combination of the input variables. This process is quite tedious when done by hand, and I would like to develop a machine learning tool to speed it up. An optimization routine could be used, and I have done this, but then it would require successive, expensive design evaluations to optimize the design. I would like to train an ML model produce an ‘optimal design’ without expensive iterations. I am OK with an expensive training phase. Essentially I would like the computer to act as an engineer would: take the state of the surroundings (the complete fluid dynamic information from a CFD simulation) and adjust the design variables until an ‘optimal’ solution is found. Essentially, I just want the best combination of all variables. Any thoughts on what ML strategy I should consider? I initially thought reinforcement learning would be a good fit, but all the examples I can see seem to have a time element, that is the changes in the inputs need to be done in a certain order. For my problem, there is no order, the results have no memory. Maybe a GP surrogate model would be good? But I would like the tool to develop a generalized strategy for when it sees this type of flow structure to make this type of change to the geometry. I am not sure a GP surrogate model could do this. Thanks,
