Doubt with SVM math

I have a question about SVM that some of you may help me with… I know that y(xi), by convention, would be -1 or 1 depending on which class the Xi belongs to. But I don't fully understand why it's stablished that the hyperplane equation should be: w·xi + b >= 1 or w·xi + b Where do those "1" and "-1" come from? Shouldn't it be that, for any point, depending on its classification, the hyperplane equation would be like this? w·xi + b >= yi * margin/2 (yi = -1 or 1) There is no 1 or -1 anywhere… Thanks in advance
