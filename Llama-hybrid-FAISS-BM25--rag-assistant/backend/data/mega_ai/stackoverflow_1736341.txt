Which object, or view, did I touch?

Working in a ViewController that has a few views which were added to it as subviews and I have a touchesBegan method: UIImageView *testImage = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"test.png"]]; testImage.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 480, 280); [self.view addSubview:testImage]; - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint point; UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; point.x = [touch locationInView:self.view].x; point.y = [touch locationInView:self.view].y; if ( point.y >= 280 && point.y = 0 && point.x = 161 && point.x = 321 && point.x My question is how in that method can I discern which view was clicked? I've been doing it with those screen coordinates, but that won't work if I also move those views at runtime. Is there a way to see which view was clicked in the touches or event or in this code from above: UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; Any help appreciated // :)
