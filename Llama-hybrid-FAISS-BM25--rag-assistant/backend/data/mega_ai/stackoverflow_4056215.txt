Based on the new understanding of your problem. You are creating a system that checks a remote URL every 30 seconds to monitor a fragment of content. For this I recommend a CRON which can either be server based: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron or web based if your host does not permit it: http://www.webbasedcron.com/ (example).
