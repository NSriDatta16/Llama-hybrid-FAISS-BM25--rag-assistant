My guess, without digging through the rails code, is that that magic parsing that rails does with the date returns nil when an invalid string is assigned to a Date column. If you do t = Date.parse("2010-12-39") in the rails console then you get: ArgumentError: invalid date from /usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/date.rb:931:in `new_by_frags' from /usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/date.rb:975:in `parse' from (irb):2 from :0 I am guessing that rails traps this error and sets the value to nil . Thus firing off the validation.
