The answer by @probabilityislogic is on the right track. The beta distribution is in the two parameter exponential family . The simple GLM models described by Nelder and Wedderburn (1972) do not include all of the distributions in the two parameter exponential family. In terms of the article by N&W, the GLM applies to the density functions of the following type (this was later named exponential dispersion family in JÃ¸rgensen 1987 ): $$\pi(z;\theta,\phi) = \exp \left[ \alpha(\phi) \lbrace z\theta - g(\theta) +h(z)\rbrace +\beta(\phi,z) \right]$$ with an additional link function $f()$ and linear model for the natural parameter $\theta = f(\mu) = f(X\beta)$. So we could rewrite the above distribution also: $$\pi(z;\mu,\phi) = exp \left[z(f(\mu)\alpha(\phi)) +h(z)\alpha(\phi) - g(f(\mu))\alpha(\phi) +\beta(\phi,z) \right]$$ The two parameter exponential family is: $$ f(z;\theta_1,\theta_2) = exp \left[T_1(z)\eta_1(\theta_1,\theta_2) + T_2(z)\eta_2(\theta_1,\theta_2) - g(\theta_1,\theta_2) +h(z) \right] $$ which looks similar but more general (also if one of the $\theta$ is constant). The difference is clear, and also putting the beta distribution in a form as a GLM is not possible. However, I lack sufficient understanding to create a more intuitive and well informed answer (I have a feeling that there can be much deeper and more elegant relationships to a variety of fundamental principles). The GLM generalizes the distribution of the error by using a single variate exponential dispersion model in place of a least squares model and generalizes the linear relationship in the mean, by using a link function. The best and most simple intuition seems to be the dispersion-$\alpha(\phi)$-term in the exponential, which gets multiplied with everything and thus the dispersion does not vary with $\theta$. Whereas several two parameter exponential families, and quasi-likelihood methods, allow the dispersion parameter to be a function of $\theta$ as well.
