BPE and word pieces are fairly equivalent, with only minimal differences . In practical terms, their main difference is that BPE places the @@ at the end of tokens while wordpieces place the ## at the beginning. Therefore, I understand that the authors of RoBERTa take the liberty of using BPE and wordpieces interchangeably.
