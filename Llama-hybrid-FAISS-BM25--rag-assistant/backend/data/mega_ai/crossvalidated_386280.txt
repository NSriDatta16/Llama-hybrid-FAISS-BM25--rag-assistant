Multiscale inputs in the context of deep learning usually refer to using several copies of the same image with reduced resolution. For example, the default image may be 400x400 pixels large. It is then rescaled to 200x200 pixels, 100x100 pixels and 50x50 pixels. Now you have the same image represented on four "different scales" because the size of one pixel in each version capture differently large part of the physical world. The blurring is performed to better preserve the information lost during the downscaling of the images. This is also called image pyramid :
