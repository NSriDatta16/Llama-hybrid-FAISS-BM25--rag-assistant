SUTSE DLM on daily mean water & air temperature TS

I have two time series: (1) daily mean water temperature from 1988 to 2014 and (2) daily mean air temperature from 1968 to 2010. The water temperature time series has missing data, occurring on individual days and for periods of consecutive days (e.g., data for all of 1993 is missing). The air temperature data has data missing from 1990-02-01 - 1991-09-30. The data are plotted below: I want to use the air temperature series to inform missing values in the water temperature series. From my understanding, this could be achieved using a state-space or Dynamic Linear model (DLM). I’m imagining a Seemingly Unrelated Time Series Equations (SUTSE) DLM in which both temperature series follow a stochastic linear trend and annual seasonal component. So far (I’m only learning DLM), I have managed to fit a simple 2nd order stochastic linear trend SUTSE DLM to the water and air time series (both reduced to the same period 1986-08-19 to 2010-04-15) as follows (I’m afraid a data-sharing agreement forbids me to provide the data): # the 'base' univariate model uni which results in the following fits: While it is encouraging to see that the fitting has worked, the 1993 water temperature estimates look poor / too low relative to the surrounding values. Here are my questions: Am I taking the right approach, or is there a better / simpler way to estimate missing water temperature data from air temperature? How do I extend the above code to include a seasonal trend, with (presumably) a frequency of 365 (even though leap years are present)? Should I be considering trigonometric functions, e.g., dlmModTrig? Has anyone seen this attempted before, and if so, where can I read about it (preferably with an R example)? Thanks in advance for any help.
