In Python, the Anomaly Detection Toolkit (ADTK) provides really a nice interface and suit of functions. This talk from 2019 provides a walkthrough of the features , but essentially the same material can be found in the examples in the docs . The package provides 13 built-in methods for detection ranging from the very simple, e.g. thresholds, to the complex e.g. PCA residuals or changes in variability: There are also nice plotting abilities and functions to deal with typical things like seasonality.
