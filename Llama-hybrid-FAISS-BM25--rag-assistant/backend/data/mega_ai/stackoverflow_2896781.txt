From the last line: xhr.send("NameCell1="+NameCell1,"NameCell2="+NameCell2,"NameCell3="+NameCell3,"NameCell4="+NameCell4,"NameCell5="+NameCell5,"NameCell6="+NameCell6,"NameCell7="+NameCell7 ); This isn't the way to concatenate a String in JavaScript. Since you're using JSP, you should know Java as well. You should concatenate the String in JavaScript the same way as you would do in Java: xhr.send("NameCell1=" + NameCell1 + ",NameCell2=" + NameCell2 + "etc..."); That said, this should however have errored in the JavaScript console. Did you pay attention to this? Anyway, for better JavaScript debugging I suggest you to grab Firebug and for less verbose/opaque and more crossbrowser compatible Ajax handling and HTML DOM traversal, I strongly recommend you to have a look at jQuery . With jQuery and the Ajax Form Plugin you would have been ready with only the following lines: $(document).ready(function() { $('#formId').ajaxForm(function(response) { $('#prjsel').html(response); }); }); This way you don't need to worry about browser specific details and how to send the request properly.
