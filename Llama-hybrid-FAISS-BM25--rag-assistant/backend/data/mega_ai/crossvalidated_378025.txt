You don't need to do anything special to handle this. The only thing you need to change is to not take any illegal actions. The typical Q-learning greedy policy is $\pi(s) = \text{argmax}_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \hat q(s,a)$ and the epsilon-greedy rollout policy is very similar. Simply replace the action space $\mathcal{A}$ with just the legal actions $\mathcal{A}_\text{legal}(s)$ .
