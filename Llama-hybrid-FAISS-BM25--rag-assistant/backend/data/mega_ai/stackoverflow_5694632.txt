Magento - UPS "Sorry, no quotes are available for this order at this time."

I have two Magento stores...one is US based with Minnesota as a shipping origin. In this store UPS works just fine. The second store is based in Europe with Italy as the shipping origin. In this case I can't get UPS to work no matter I try. I've turned on debugging and have managed to solve a few different errors including: 2011-04-16T19:37:40+00:00 DEBUG (7): Cannot retrieve shipping rates 2011-04-16T19:39:58+00:00 DEBUG (7): This measurement system is not valid for the selected country. 2011-04-16T19:47:13+00:00 DEBUG (7): XML Rating and Service Selection Service Unavailable 2011-04-16T20:49:22+00:00 DEBUG (7): Can't convert rate from "USD-EUR". 2011-04-16T22:20:40+00:00 DEBUG (7): Cannot retrieve shipping rates Now I'm at this point and I'm baffled and Google has been of no help. Does anyone here perhaps have a thought as to what might be the issue? 2011-04-17T15:55:03+00:00 DEBUG (7): Array ( [request] => Array ( [accept_UPS_license_agreement] => yes [10_action] => 4 [13_product] => GNDRES [14_origCountry] => IT [15_origPostal] => 20144 [origCity] => Milan [19_destPostal] => 28026 [22_destCountry] => ES [23_weight] => 16 [47_rate_chart] => One Time Pickup [48_container] => 00 [49_residential] => 01 [weight_std] => kgs ) [result] => UPSOnLine5%Unsupported country specified%6920 [__pid] => 8232 )
