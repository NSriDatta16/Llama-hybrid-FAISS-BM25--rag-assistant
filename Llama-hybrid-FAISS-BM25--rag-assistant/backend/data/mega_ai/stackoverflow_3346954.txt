NUnit 2.5.6 + PartCover 2.0/4.0 = My Classes Not Shown

Summary: I can run unit tests and code-coverage, but the report only includes NUnit classes, not my application classes. I have successfully used PartCover in the past. Not so this time. I tried the latest PartCover (4.0), downgraded to the next latest (2.0), both with NUnit 2.5.6. I created a simple .NET 4.0 class library (also tried this with a web application that has a project that's a class library) with a single class in some namespace, and two test methods in another library in another class. NUnit/PartCover installed correctly; I can run the NUnit tests both in NUnit, and through PartCover (I can see them running and saying "2 passed"), but the report only shows me NUnit namespaces. (Yes, I'm using +[ ] as my coverage rule.) Any ideas? As much as I like NUnit, I'd like to see coverage for my own classes :o) And I also tried aligning the test-DLL and code-DLL namespaces, to no avail. Edit: I tried re-running my previously working code-covered sample from a year ago; all the tests run, but the actual project namespaces don't appear. There's a hint here, which seems to imply that it depends on the NUnit version you use: http://sourceforge.net/projects/partcover/forums/forum/605222/topic/3308367 (and yes, I already tried the appdomain-reporting checkbox) I've tried NUnit 2.5.5.x and 2.5.6.x and both give me the same results. Edit: It seems this fork of the official 4.0 version seems to work, albeit sporadically (google for PartCover fork, I can't add more hyperlinks)
