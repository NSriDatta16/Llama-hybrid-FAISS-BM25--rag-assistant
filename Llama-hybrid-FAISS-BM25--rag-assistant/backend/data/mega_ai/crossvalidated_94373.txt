It looks like I was mistaking what sort of problems correlated data introduce to the estimation process. I had it in my head that there was a bias problem with correlated data since FE probit/logit are biased. But this bias, it seems, comes from the errors (incidental parameters problem) and thus the focus on the errors in GEE population-averaged estimates makes sense. CRE methods deal with incidental parameters problem by using a modified RE model that doesn't have same incidental parameters problem that a FE probit has ( see this paper by Bell and Jones ). Then it deals with assumptions about the correlation between explanatory variables and errors by modeling some of this dependence with subject-specific parameters a la Mundlak 1978.
