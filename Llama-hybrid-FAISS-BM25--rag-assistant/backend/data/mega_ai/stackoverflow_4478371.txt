What is the purpose of django tempate tags in the MVC model?

It is my understanding that template tags are a way to organize presentation logic, is this correct? What I want to do is load/read a bunch of my model objects, but show them in different areas of the template according to a filter. The first thought was to implement a tag get_myobjects_by_filterx but then I have to implement it for each filter I have, and I would use it by calling the tag on the areas of my template where I want them to show up. So the second thought was to move the filterx into the tag itself, so the call would be get_myobjects_by "X" (passing the filter as string) then in the tag filtering and returning. Is this the prefered way? What if I need to pass another object not just a string? Could I use a filter instead? Little more detailed what I want to do: Load a kind of my objects and filter it by some of its fields, depending on which filter is applied, show it in different areas of my template. For example I want "if objects filtered by X show all of those in the column x else in column y and so on". How do I solve this kind of question with django? Thanks.
