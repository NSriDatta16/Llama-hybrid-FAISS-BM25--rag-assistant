Can someone explain the RBF Kernel to me?

I have read every explanation out there on this but nobody seems capable of explaining this in a way that I am able to understand. For an SVM RBF Kernel we often say that: But what does x and x' represent here? Let's say my input data x is of shape 5x100 (5 features aka dimensions aka columns) and 100 rows, and output y is 1x100 rows, then what is x and x' in relation to this?
