You could try rasterizing it (painting it to a BufferedImage at 300dpi) and then printing that image. Hacky, and bad for performance (huge rasterized file sent to printer instead of vector data), but at least you won't have font problems. To rasterize it, create a BufferedImage that is 4.17x (300/72) the size of your on-screen panel and scale its graphics object be the same abount, and then paint the panel onto the buffered image's Graphics2D object. Disclaimer: this isn't elegant and I know it. If someone knows how to convince every make and model of printer to receive fonts from a Java printing process, please chime in!
