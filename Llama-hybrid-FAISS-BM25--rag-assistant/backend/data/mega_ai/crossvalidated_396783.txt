Take any reasonable word-level RNN model (or character if truly necessary), download the Wikipedia corpus or really any large text corpus. Then form a training set of sentences where the RNN predicts whether there should be a period or not. In other words take a batch of sentences and remove he periods, and then have the RNN predict their locations.
