Optimal MySQL-configuration (my.cnf)

The following is my default production MySQL configuration file ( my.cnf ) for a pure UTF-8 setup with InnoDB as the default storage engine. [server] bind-address=127.0.0.1 innodb_file_per_table default-character-set=utf8 default-storage-engine=innodb The setup does the following: Binds to localhost:3306 (loopback) instead of the default *:3306 (all interfaces). Done to increase security. Sets up one table space per table. Done to increase maintainability. Sets the default character set to UTF-8. Done to allow for easy internationalization by default. Sets the default storage engine to InnoDB. Done to allow for row-level-locking by default. Assume that you could further improve the setup by adding a maximum of three (3) configuration parameters. Which would you add and why? An improvement would in this context mean either a performance improvement, a reliability improvement or ease-of-use/ease-of-maintainability increase. You can assume that the machine running the MySQL instance will have 1000 MB of RAM.
