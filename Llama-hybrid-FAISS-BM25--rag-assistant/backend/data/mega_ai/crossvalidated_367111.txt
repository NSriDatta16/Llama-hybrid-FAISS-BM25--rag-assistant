I provided a proof of the Eckart-Young theorem in my answer to What norm of the reconstruction error is minimized by the low-rank approximation matrix obtained with PCA? . Let's take a look at the first steps of this proof: We want to find matrix $A$ of rank $k$ that minimizes $\|X-A\|^2_F$. We can factorize $A=BW^\top$, where $W$ has $k$ orthonormal columns. Minimizing $\|X-BW^\top\|^2$ for fixed $W$ is a regression problem with solution $B=XW$. Plugging it in, we see that we now need to minimize $\|X-XWW^\top\|^2=\ldots$ This seems to use your formulation #2. But what would change if we use formulation #1? Matrix $A$ of rank $\le k$ can still be factorized as $A=BW^\top$ where $W$ has $k$ orthonormal columns; if $\text{rank}(A) So nothing at all changes in the proof after that. The best approximation of rank $\le k$ turns out to have rank $k$.
