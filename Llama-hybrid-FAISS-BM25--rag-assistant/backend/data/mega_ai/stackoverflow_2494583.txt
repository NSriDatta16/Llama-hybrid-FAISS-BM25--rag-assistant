From Sani's post: Open Active Directory Users and Computers. Find the name of the file server, right-click on it and hit properties. Go to the Delegation tab and select "Trust this computer for delegation to specified services only" and choose Protected Storage and Common Internet File System. I would also check out Remote Decryption on File Shares . This has some details about Using Encrypting File System
