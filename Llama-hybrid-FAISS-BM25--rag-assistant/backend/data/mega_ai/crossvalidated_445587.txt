What exactly is $p(x,y)$ in the context of iid assumption in machine learning?

In machine learning iid assumption means that examples in the dataset are independent and drawn from the same probability distribution (i.e., identically distributed). Here, the probability distribution is denoted by $p(x,y)$ where $x$ is vector and $y$ is a scalar. I have a confusing understanding $p(x,y)$ . Are both $x$ and $y$ random variables? When people say iid, are they referring to $x$ or $y$ or both? Or do we have here a single random variable?
