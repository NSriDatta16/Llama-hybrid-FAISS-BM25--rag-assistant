How pixel value range is satisfying in CNN

gray-scale images have pixel value range [0,1]. In most imaging task such as Denoising, deblurring, and inpainting we usually calculate mean square error of observed image and denoised image. However, it is not clear for me how CNN can understand that the pixel value should be in [0,1] for output without defining additional constraints in optimization problem? Is this because of using batch normalization and activation function (for example leaky ReLU) in each layer?
