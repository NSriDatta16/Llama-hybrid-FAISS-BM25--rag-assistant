'Statistics' by Freedman, Purvis et al. has a number of examples in the first couple of chapters. My personal favorite is that ice cream causes polio. The confounding variable is that they are both prevalent in the summertime when young children are out, about, and spreading polio. The book is "Statistics (Fourth Edition) 4th Edition, Kindle Edition- by David Freedman (Author), Robert Pisani (Author), Roger Purves (Author)"
