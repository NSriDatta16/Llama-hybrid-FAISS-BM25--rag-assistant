Easy way to convert a string of 0's and 1's into a character? Plain C

I'm doing a steganography project where I read in bytes from a ppm file and add the least significant bit to an array. So once 8 bytes are read in, I would have 8 bits in my array, which should equal some character in a hidden message. Is there an easy way to convert an array of 0's and 1's into an ascii value? For example, the array: char bits[] = {0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0} would equal 't'. Plain C Thanks for all the answers. I'm gonna give some of these a shot.
