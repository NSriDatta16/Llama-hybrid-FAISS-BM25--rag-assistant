LanguageR/ lme4: any help on p-values for models with random correlation parameters?

I use the package languageR for mixed effect models with the syntax at the end of this posting. I can use pvals.fnc to get p -values for models 1 and 3 ( hd_lmer1 and hd_lmer2 ). Using this with model two gives the following error message: p2 = pvals.fnc(hd_lmer2) Error in pvals.fnc(hd_lmer2) : MCMC sampling is not yet implemented in lme4_0.999375 for models with random correlation parameters I would be grateful if any one could help me out on how to get p-values for such models. Models: hd_lmer1
