An Ideal Folder Structure for .NET MVC

When I started in .NET Webforms I didn't have much trouble finding a folder structure to follow since VS offered you application folders like "App_Code" and most app examples put "BLL", "DAL" inside there and so on. But now in MVC, every example I check uses different structure, like no standards this time and I haven't found a good solution on Google or SO. So, maybe we can share how we organize our MVC projects, may help others to make their own mind. Here is the structure for small to medium projects I use: App_Data Areas Admin Controllers Models Views MyAccount Controllers Models Views Content Images Scripts Styles Controllers HomeController.cs Helpers ExtensionMethods // I.e. based on HtmlHelper, use "helper" suffix MenuHelper.cs // to be called as html.Menu() Utilities.cs // Other generic (static) libraries, no suffix used Models ViewModels // for passing models to Views RegisterViewModel.cs // use "ViewModel" suffix Customer.cs // to extend models like adding Model Validation Repositories CustomerRepository.cs // use "Repository" suffix Services CustomerService.cs // use "Service" suffix, to move code away from controllers Views Home Index.cshtml Register.cshtml Shared // Site Layouts (Master templates), also put partials here SiteLayout.cshtml What about yours?
