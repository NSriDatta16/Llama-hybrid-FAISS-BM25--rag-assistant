Charniak-Johnson Reranking The source code for the Charniak-Johnson (CJ) reranking parser is freely available, you can download a copy here . The reranker is a separate code module that takes as input n-best lists of parses, so it's trivial to decouple it from the parsing front end. SVM-rank Alternatively, the package SVM-rank , from Thorsten Joachim's lab at Cornell, is a general purpose ranker. It might be easier to go with this package, if what you want to do deviates significantly from what's being done by the Charniak-Johnson parser.
