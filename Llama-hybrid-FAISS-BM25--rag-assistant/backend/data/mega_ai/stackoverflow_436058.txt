unfortunatly, it doesn't change the behaviour :( but thank you very much for this hint what it does & should do: this front_mc is horizontally scrolling a menu if the mousesY is 90 and 250 (its row of buttons is longer than the stage) the buttons and their common timeline are nested as menu_mc inside the front_mc. if I go sidewards over the menu and its scrolling left/right & I hit a button the content is drawn, but when I head back to the menu and it's scrolling, so does the drawn content, analogue to the menu (synched). I must have organized it wrong. front_mc.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE,f); var t:Timer=new Timer(30,0); t.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER,moveF); function f(e:MouseEvent) { if(root.mouseY > 90 && root.mouseY front_mc.x+(1-speed) (stage.stageWidth-front_mc.width) root.mouseX/stage.stageWidth; back_mc.x = speed back_mc.x+(1-speed)*(stage.stageWidth-back_mc.width)*root.mouseX/stage.stageWidth; if (Math.abs(front_mc.x- (stage.stageWidth-front_mc.width)*root.mouseX/stage.stageWidth) } e.updateAfterEvent(); }
