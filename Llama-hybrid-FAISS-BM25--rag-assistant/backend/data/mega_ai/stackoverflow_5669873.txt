How do you create a Subversion tag in Xcode 4?

I can't figure out how to create a Subversion tag in Xcode 4. I would think it would be in the Organizer -> Repositories interface, but I can't seem to find a way. In Xcode 3, you could browse the SVN repository, click the "Copy" button in the window's top bar, and then specify the tags/ SVN directory. I don't see the same type of option in Xcode 4. Help? My workaround for now is the command line: svn copy trunkSourceUrl tagsDestinationUrl -m "My tag message."
