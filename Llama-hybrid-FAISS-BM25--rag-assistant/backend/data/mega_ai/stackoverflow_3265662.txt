No, basically. Well, you could do something with compiler warnings via [Obsolete] and #pragma , but that would be excessive. You could probably do it with tooling, but eventually you need to trust people not to do stupid things. After all, do you have special rules about: while(true) { } or do you just put that down to "don't be stupid"? ;p
