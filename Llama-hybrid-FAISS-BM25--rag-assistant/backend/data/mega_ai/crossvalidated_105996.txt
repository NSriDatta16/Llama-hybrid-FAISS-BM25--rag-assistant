Example number 1 seems to be nice if you have different minimum thresholds among the categories. As pointed by Glen_b and whuber, it seems that examples number 2 and number 3 do not show the ranges of your categories, but just one unique statistic (it could be the median, or the maximum values) at the top of the horizontal bars. The example number 4 is a little bit strange because the bell curve does not represent the distribution of the bars (for example, the blue light dot 'average paid' is the average of the bell curve, not the average of quantities shown in the bars). It is not "visually compelling yet immediately understandable" to me. As you asked for another option, I would suggest the boxplot , which shows: outliers (the dots), minimum and maximum values without considering outliers (the end of the whiskers) 1 , first and third quartiles (the edges of the box), and median (the horizontal bar inside the box). Each box is a category. Order the boxes from left to right starting with the category with greatest median. The example number 1 is simpler to understand, so it will depend if a boxplot will really help. 1: see whuber's comment for clarification.
