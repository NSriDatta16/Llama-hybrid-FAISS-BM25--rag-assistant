Resize a list of images in line command

I would like to resize a list of images, all in the directory. To achieve that, I use convert from imagemagick. I would like to resize image1.jpg image2.jpg ... into image1-resized.jpg image2-resized.jpg ... I was wondering if there is a method to achieve this in a single command line. An elegant solution could be often useful, not only in this case. EDIT: I would like a non script-like solution, ie. without for loop.
