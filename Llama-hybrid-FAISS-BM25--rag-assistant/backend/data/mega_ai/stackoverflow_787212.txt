Scrolling with two fingers with a UIScrollView

I have an app where my main view accepts both touchesBegan and touchesMoved , and therefore takes in single finger touches, and drags. I want to implement a UIScrollView , and I have it working, but it overrides the drags, and therefore my contentView never receives them. I'd like to implement a UIScrollview , where a two finger drag indicates a scroll, and a one finger drag event gets passed to my content view, so it performs normally. Do I need create my own subclass of UIScrollView ? Here's my code from my appDelegate where I implement the UIScrollView . @implementation MusicGridAppDelegate @synthesize window; @synthesize viewController; @synthesize scrollView; - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application { // Override point for customization after app launch //[application setStatusBarHidden:YES animated:NO]; //[window addSubview:viewController.view]; scrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(720, 480); scrollView.showsHorizontalScrollIndicator = YES; scrollView.showsVerticalScrollIndicator = YES; scrollView.delegate = self; [scrollView addSubview:viewController.view]; [window makeKeyAndVisible]; } - (void)dealloc { [viewController release]; [scrollView release]; [window release]; [super dealloc]; }
