Difference between multinomial and one vs rest schemes in logistic regression

I am dealing with multiclass classification problem where I have 10 classes to predict. I came across Logistic regression model in scikit-learn which can be applied to multiclass settings as well. The parameter 'multi_class' in logistic regression function can take two values 'ovr' and 'multinomial'. What's the difference between ovr (one vs rest ) and multinomial in terms of logistic regression. I am using logloss as my evaluation metric. I applied both 'ovr' and 'multinomial' to my problem, so far 'ovr' gives less logloss value. But I really want to know how both works.
