I think what might help you given your problem is Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique for Regression (SMOTER). It will generate synthetic observations for the regions of interest in your response variable. In your case, high values. I might suggest the paper cited below for context. If you're more interested in a practical solution, the first author has an R implementation available on her Github page. https://github.com/paobranco/SMOGN-LIDTA17 If you're a Python user, I recently open-sourced an entirely Pythonic implementation of the SMOGN algorithm that is now available on PyPI and Github. https://github.com/nickkunz/smogn I hope this helped!
