Currently, a large volume of the COBOL code (I'd estimate well over 90%) is untestable. No one knows what it really does. They know that -- minimally -- it does the expected job most of the time. And when it doesn't, the bugs are known. Worse, some percentage of COBOL is just workarounds for bugs in other parts of the COBOL. Therefore, if you subject it to any scrutiny, you'll find that you don't know what's really going on. You can't create test cases. Indeed, you'll find that most organizations can't even agree on what's "right". But they're willing to compromise on what's available. The cost and risk of examining the core business processing is unthinkable.
