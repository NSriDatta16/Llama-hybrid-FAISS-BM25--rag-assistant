In my experience it depends on what kind of problem you are tacking. In my experience it's difficult to beat BizTalk 2006 R2 for bang for the buck but it does imply the use of a Microsoft technology stack. Websphere MQ seems to be an easier sell to larger corporates and it probably seen greater use at the enterprise level. Both provide good instrumentation but it's really up to you as a developer to customize this to suit your customer's requirements. In some cases I've found that a bespoke solution is most appropriate or leveraged technologies such MSMQ to keep costs down.
