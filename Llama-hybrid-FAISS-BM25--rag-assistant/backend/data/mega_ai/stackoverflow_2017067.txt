According to http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-real-time-linux/ , even non-RT linux on a decent processor can deliver on-average 20μs timer interval, which corresponds to 50kHz. The same article mentions that high-resolution timers in 2.6 kernel w/ some RT mods can deliver 1μs intervals, or 1000kHz. So I don't think it is unreasonable to expect a RT kernel to be able to deliver 40kHz reliably.
