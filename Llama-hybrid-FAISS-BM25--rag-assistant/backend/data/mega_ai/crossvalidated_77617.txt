Shanken (1992) correction for t-statistics

I have done a cross-sectional regression of time-series average returns on estimated Betas (over the same time horizon) to determine average premiums. So far so good. But I was told that the standard t-statistics can be biased, due to the fact that betas are estimated. There is a solution by: Shanken (1992) - On the estimation of beta-pricing models [Review of Financial Studies]. It does some small adjustments to the formula of the estimated covariance matrix. However I don't understand how to implement this in R. The paper is also very mathematical, but the solutions are supposed to be easy if you look e.g. at Cochrane Asset Pricing, chap 12 or Lozano "Estimating and evaluating the Fama-French & Carhart models" (2006). I cannot find anything close to that in the original paper though. I think the notation is very different. Does anyone know how to do it, or has done it already? I needed the adjusted formula in my context (in-sample regression), or even better the R-code.
