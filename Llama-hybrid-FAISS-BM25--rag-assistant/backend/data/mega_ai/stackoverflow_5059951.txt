Deleting JS Object Properties a few levels deep

I have an object like this: var myObj = { first: { sub: { level: "some text", level2: "some more text" }, sub2: { level3: "Something" } }, second: { stuff: "More stuff...lots of stuff" } } what I want to be able to do is say delete myObj.first.sub.level But I won't know what is being passed, or how many levels deep I need to go in order to remove the correct property, meaning it could simply be: Storage.removeItem('myObj.first'); // This is currently working Or something more complex: Storage.removeItem('myObj.first.sub2.level3'); // This doesn't work because I'm more than 1 level into the object. I'm kind of stuck, because I can get to the point where I have the key "level3" and it's property "Something", but I can't figure out how to back-step correctly in order to delete the full section of that object. I need to replicate it's place in myObj so I can delete the full passed object. 'myObj.first.sub.level3' If that makes sense...
