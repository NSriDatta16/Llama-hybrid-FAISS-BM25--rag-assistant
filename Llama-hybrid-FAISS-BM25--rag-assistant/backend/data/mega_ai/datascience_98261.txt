Try: from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers = [('encoder', OneHotEncoder(),[1,2])], remainder ='passthrough') X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X)) Note that you are passing [1:2] as the list of indices to apply the transformation on the ColumnTransformer but it should be [1,2]
