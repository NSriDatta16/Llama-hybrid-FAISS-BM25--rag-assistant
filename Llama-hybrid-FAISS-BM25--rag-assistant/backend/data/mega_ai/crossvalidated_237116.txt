Without knowing exactly what you did the following will be part speculation but: With a nonlinear kernel SVM generates its own nonlinear features internally. This may be telling you the features it inferred are better than the handcoded ones - $F_{nl}$. However SVM can overfit, and by augmenting the data with redundancy, i.e. attaching $F_{nl}$, you are inviting it to do so. With the last two paras, you should check what your code is doing. Getting the exact same numbers is a yellow card for me, especially when the last entry is a somewhat unexpected. Random Forest doesn't usually overfit. So you typically won't do any worse by adding sensible additional features.
