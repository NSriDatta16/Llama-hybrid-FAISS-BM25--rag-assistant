standalone library for OpenOffice formula renderer?

Is there a standalone library of OpenOffice's formula renderer ? I'm looking for something that can take plain text (e.g. E = mc^2 ) in the same syntax as used by OpenOffice, and convert to png or pdf fragments. (note: I don't need the WYSIWYG editor, just the renderer. Basically I would like to work in OpenOffice to interactively edit my formulas, and then copy the source text for use in other contexts w/o needing OpenOffice to render them.)
