Actually I guess you are making mistake about the second part. The point is that in CNN s, convolution operation is done over volume. Suppose the input image is in three channels and the next layer has 5 kernels, consequently the next layer will have five feature maps but the convolution operation consists of convolution over volume which has this property: each kernel will have its width and height, moreover, a depth. its depth is equal to the number of feature maps, here channels of the image, of the previous layer. Take a look at here .
