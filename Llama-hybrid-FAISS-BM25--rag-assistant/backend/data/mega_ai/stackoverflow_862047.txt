Select All Checkbox in XAML using trigger?

I'd like to implement a select all checkbox in xaml. I have several (templated) checkboxes in a listview. Then I have a checkbox outside of the listview, which I want to have a "select all"-behaviour. I could easily solve the problem in my ViewModel, however, I think it would be more elegant to do this in xaml, since the select all checkbox doesn't (directly) have anything to do with my ViewModel. The code looks something like this: As you see the IsChecked Property of the SelectSingle is already bound to my ViewModel. So I reckon I need a trigger to manipulate the state of the checkbox. Now I already tried sth like this: or sth like this: I also tried the same thing within a style, but to no avail. I always obtain an error, sth along the lines of "static member "IsCheckedProperty couldn't be found in type "ContentPresenter"". Now that sounds as if the Target/SourceName binding wouldn't work, but why? Is there something that I am missing?
