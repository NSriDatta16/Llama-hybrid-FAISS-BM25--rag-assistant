How to calculate/profile percentage of parallelized C# Code

Greeting, I'm working on performance improvement for my application by enabling the multi-thread. I learned from the " Amdahl's law ", it requires >50% of parallelized code to achieve 2x speedup in 8 cores processor. Hence I just wondering is there any tool in the market provides parallelized code coverage or profiling that can help me to improve the performance?
