The header value tells you this: =?gb2312?B?uLGxvmhlbrixsb5nLnhscw==?= "=?" introduces an encoded value "gb2312" denotes the character encoding of the original value "B" denotes that B-encoding (equal to Base64) was used (the alternative is "Q", which refers to something close to quoted-printable) "?" functions as a separator "uLG..." is the actual value, encoded using the encoding specified before "?=" ends the encoded value So splitting on "?" actually gets you this (JSON notation) ["=", "gb2312", "B", "uLGxvmhlbrixsb5nLnhscw==", "="] In the resulting array, if "B" is on position 2, you face a base-64 encoded string on position 3. Once you decoded it, be sure to pay attention to the encoding on position 1, probably it would be best to convert the whole thing to UTF-8 using that info.
