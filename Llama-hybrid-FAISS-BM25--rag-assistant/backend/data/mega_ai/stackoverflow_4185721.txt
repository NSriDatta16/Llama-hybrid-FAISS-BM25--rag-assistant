Read/write data with blocks on Boost cached pages

I have a module that supplies a block. The block is set to BLOCK_NO_CACHE, and its content is pulled from a function. It lets a site admin create a 'message' to display on the site, kind of like CNN, where a breaking update is displayed at the top, and a user can close it by hitting X. When they close it, the action is written and UUID written to their cookie so they don't see that message again. I am getting reports from Boost users that when someone closes a message, it closes it for everyone. I assume this is because Boost is caching the page and serving a cached page after someone closed the message. How can I make my module work for people using Boost? I thought maybe hook_boot might work, but, then again I am not sure if there is a better way to address this.
