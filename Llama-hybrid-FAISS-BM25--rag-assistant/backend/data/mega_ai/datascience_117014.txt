Redundant feature after one hot encoding

I have a numerical feature called $x$ and a categorical feature called $y$ . $y$ is an ordinal feature (A,B,C,D,E,F). I am using label encoding for my y feature and when I am seeing the correlation using matrix heatmap it shows that my $x$ feature has 0.95 correlation with $y$ . I am using logistic regression algorithm. Should I drop one of them?
