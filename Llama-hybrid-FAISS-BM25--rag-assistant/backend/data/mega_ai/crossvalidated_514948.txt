What could possibly be the reason why my CNN achieves abnormally high validation loss for some epochs?

I am training a CNN for a simple binary classification problem and for some reason, I am getting abnormally high validation_loss at some epochs while still achieving good validation_accuracy. What am i doing wrong here? I am trying to do a simple transfer learning using EfficientNetB0 as the base model. I am writing in Tensorflow + Keras.
