How to select best control series among many for comparion?

I want to analyse the effect of a treatment on certain individuals. To make it more clear, here is the context: There are a few individuals that are going to partake in a certain treatment soon There are more than 200 other individuals that may serve as controls Each individual has a time series that consists of 22 observations What I want to do is: for each one of the soon-to-be treated series, select the X individuals (series) from the 200 possible controls that mostly resembles the soon-to-be treated one. I've tried computing the R2 for each of the candidates and ranking them in terms of best fit, but I'm not sure if the result is that good. Is there any other approach I can try? Don't know if clustering would do it, or if there's some other way that better suits time series. Thanks in advance!
