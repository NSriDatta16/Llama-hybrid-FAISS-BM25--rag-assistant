the whole matter of the inefficiency of:... What inefficiency? Those instructions will result into an extremely fast fragments of assembly code. I am completely sure that there is nothing to be gained by trying to "optimize" this. Even if you come up with something faster, it will be at a significant complexity cost. Unless you do have positive evidence that this code is affecting your performance, you should use the simplest approach that solves your problem.
