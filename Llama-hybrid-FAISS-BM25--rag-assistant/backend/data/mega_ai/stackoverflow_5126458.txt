dbg:tracer visualizing recursive functions e.g. by indenting

I have the problem debugging an complicated recursive function I'm using the idiom: dbg:tracer(),dbg:p(all,c),dbg:tpl(Mod,Fun1,x),dbg:tpl(Mod,Fun2,x)... This gives me a flat list of calls to all functions where it is very hard to find out which return belongs to which call. Is there a easy way to make this more readable e.g. by indenting. I could just post process the text produced and indent for each call, and outdent for each return, but this sounds not very elegant to me.
