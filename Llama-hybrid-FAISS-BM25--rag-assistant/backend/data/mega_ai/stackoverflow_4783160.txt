Embed login details in APK file, different for each user (or other options?)

We've been asked to create a thin web client on Android for a company with an existing web site, existing users. They want to send an mms to their users, giving each user their own download URL. This URL will point to an Android apk file that has been created specifically for that user - it will include that user's login, and password, to the website. i.e. the APK file would have embedded login details. This would be done in J2ME by storing info in the JDK file. I can see a simlar question on How to update resources file in apk - but not fully answered. So: is there a way to store an "asset" in the apk file that will be a text file, and easily editable by unzipping, editing, rezipping the apk file? (looks like answer is no) do you know of any similar problems, or have worked on similar apps? is there advice on how best to accomplish this application? Any sort of embedding of customer info on an automated level would be of interest... would the best option be to set the app to build with an Ant script, and have the client actually customize the source code and build a new app per user? (this has the con that the client gets the source code, which we'd rather not have) I have scanned apk tagged questions and can't seem to find a solution to this. Many thanks, Richard
