Are you thinking of the dto going into the action, or the one(s) coming out? The one going in will be used directly against a repository, a service or some other collaborator. I would mock those instead and place my expectations there. Your test code will also have full control on creating the ingoing dto. If you like to use the outgoing dto, I would just grab that one from the ViewResult and verify it is the expected one. How you do that is up to you: You could mock the repository or talk to your persistence storage of choice.
