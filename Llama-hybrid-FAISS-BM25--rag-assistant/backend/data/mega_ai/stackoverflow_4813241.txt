xcode Organizer "Validate" fails with the "No other information is available about the problem." message

I have built an OSX application, it builds and runs using Xcode no problem, I have signed the code and done all the pre-submission things required by Apple. However, when I try to Validate my application in Organizer (or Submit), I get this nasty error: "The operation could not be completed. No other information is available about the problem." The Bundle Identifier was registered on Apple's website and it matches the one I provide in the applications .plist file. I can't even think of a way to find a problem. I ran the installer check on the bundle, and this is what I got. Perhaps the problem is with the bundle? However, according to the apple instructions, I can't add Installer Signing Certificate until I am in the submission process. installer: Warning: PMBundle.pkg is not signed for store submission installer: Installation Check: Passed installer: Volume Check: Passed installer: Bundle com.xxx.yyy will be relocated to /Users/xxx/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Archived Applications/4612642F-468C-49B8-9331-A148DF9E20E6.apparchive/yyy.app installer: Starting install installer: Install 0.0% complete installer: Install 9.1% complete installer: Install 100.0% complete installer: Finished install (I shortened bundle id to 'com.xxx.yyy' and app name to 'yyy' in the example) Any ideas would greatly help.
