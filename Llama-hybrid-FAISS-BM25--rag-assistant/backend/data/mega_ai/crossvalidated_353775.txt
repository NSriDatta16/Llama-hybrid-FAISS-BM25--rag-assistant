Framework for simulation study to validate bayesian models

I am looking for a framework that would allow to take JAGS/bugs model and on many sets of simulated data test if there is a bias (or not) in the parameter estimates (the real parameters would be known because the data are simulated). Is there any such framework? I've seen only run.jags.study() in R package runjags , but this is focused on crossvalidation. I need to check the bias in parameter estimates. Do you know such framework? If not, I am especially interested how to evaluate the bias across the generated data sets. How would you do that? Thanks in advance!
