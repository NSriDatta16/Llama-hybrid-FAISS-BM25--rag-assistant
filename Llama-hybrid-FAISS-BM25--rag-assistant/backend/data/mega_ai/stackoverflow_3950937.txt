Which programming language/framework shall I choose for this project?

I have two projects ahead and I'm pretty new at Ruby and Ruby on Rails. It's real fun! =) Besides, I count myself fluent in C++ and Java (and JavaEE), but have very very few experience with C#.NET and Ruby. Also, I'm pretty eager to learn Ruby, but don't really want to waste time to develop skills on C# - which is pretty similar to Java (at least for me). PROJECT 1: I will be developing an enterprise web application which should scale well with 100.000 hits per day. Which technology should I go with? Options are: 1) Java, JSP, Servlets - experienced 2) Java, JSF, JPA - kind of new at this but have a grasp of it. 3) C#.NET - new at this 4) Ruby and Ruby on Rails - new at this - though I am very eager to discover what RoR is like! Among all of these, which one do you think would scale the best? (Am I going to have issues with scalability if I go with RoR?) Easier and faster to develop and maintain? More secure? More programmer-friendly? PROJECT 2: Another project is a desktop application (with somewhat basic UI elements) that will try to schedule something. The algorithm behind will involve some AI and Machine Learning techniques and very heavy computation. The program, once started, is expected to take 7-20 hours to output a decent schedule. Options are: 1) C++ - fluent with C++ but UI will be very painful. Also, I wanna try something new - been programming with C++ all the time! 2) Java - fluent and UI will be easier. 3) Ruby - very new at this. But very eager too. Will Ruby be able handle heavy computations? Is it going to be very different in terms of performance? Both projects are due end of Spring term - so no hurries. I just want a decent product, an A and valuable experience at the end! for both. All comments and answers are appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.
