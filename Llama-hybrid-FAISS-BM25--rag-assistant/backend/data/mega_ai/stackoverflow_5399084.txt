"Smart" / Economical Data Storage Techniques?

I would like to store millions of data lines that looks like this: key , value key is an integer in the range of (0 to 5,000,000); all values are unique; value is an unsigned int16 value (0 to 65535) the key is to store the data while taking the LEAST AMOUNT OF DISK SPACE, and yet, be able to query the data. can you think of any algorithms / smart schemes for data storage that would be helpful? just in case it matters, I use Linux.
