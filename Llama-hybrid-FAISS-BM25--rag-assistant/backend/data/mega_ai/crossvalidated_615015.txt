Differencing, taking logs or squaring does not fix nonstationarity. What to do?

I want to test for correlation in a time series model. However, all four independent variables and the dependent variable are non-stationary. I tried taking first, second and third differences but my dependent variable remains non-stationary. I also tried transforming it into a squared variable or logarithm, but the altered variables were still non-stationary according to the augmented Dickey-Fuller test. What else can I do? Raw data regarding: My dependent variable the intra-EU trade share (exports) An independent variable, the number of EU Civil law regulations An independent variable, the number of EU Healthcare regulations An independent variable, the number of EU Environment regulations An independent variable, the number of national court judgements in which EU regulations were used.
