I don't know if there is a rule of thumb or not. You use time series regression for several reasons. One is when autocorrelation is indicated (there are many tests to determine if it is). Or when you think that X influences Y now (t(0), and at points in the future t(1), t(2)...). Or when the impact of X on Y changes over time. Note that slopes and R squared values will be distorted (they will be higher) when you are measuring the relationship of two variables with each other over time unless there is cointegration (this may be a problem even with cointegration which in any case requires a specific form of time series).
