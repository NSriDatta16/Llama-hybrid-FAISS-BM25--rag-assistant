Books on Bayesian seemingly unrelated regression

I want to study seemingly unrelated regression using Gibbs sampling for many equations. Can someone suggest some books on Bayesian approach for seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) with R examples. I am a beginner in Bayesian statistics and learn well with lots of examples.
