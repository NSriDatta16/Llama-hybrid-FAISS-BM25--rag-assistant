How to wipe out current browser session memory on page refresh

I have been building a large mostly javascript based mapping system using OpenLayers and I have slimmed the initial page load of data on our largest client account down from 400 MB to about 150 - 180 MB by nulling out ajax json returns when done with the data and removing unnecessary html. On the initial page load, the memory monitor in my browser shows a good number down around 150. As I use the site it builds up a bit, which is expected. BUT, if I refresh the page, the browser clings to a bunch of the previous memory and then nearly doubles by the time the refresh is done loading. I have added onunload="map = null" where "map" is a javascript var to our mapping library. I've added the php lines as such to the header: header("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); // Date in the past header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT"); header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate"); // HTTP/1.1 header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false); header("Pragma: no-cache"); I've added the meta lines to the header: But I still can't get rid of the resident memory. When I first launch the browser it's using 35MB roughly on loading the blank page. I would have expected that if I refresh the page, the browser should dump the memory of that page (given the lines above) and start over from the 35MB mark. Does anyone have a solution to this irritating problem? Thanks!
