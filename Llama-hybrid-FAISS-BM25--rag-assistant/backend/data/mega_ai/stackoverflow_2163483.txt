The center of mass is the average position of each particle weighted by the mass of that particle. Since your particles are of the same mass, you only need to take the average position. That is: center_x = 0 center_y = 0 for p in particles: center_x += p.x center_y += p.y center_x /= len(particles) center_y /= len(particles)
