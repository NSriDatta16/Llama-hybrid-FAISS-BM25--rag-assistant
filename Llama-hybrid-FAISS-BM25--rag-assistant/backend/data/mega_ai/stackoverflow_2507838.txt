Is the usage of Isolated Storage in Silverlight 3 a security concern

I am using Silverlight 3 on my website. I have a Login Page for role based authentication, that routes users with different privileges to different parts of the website. I want to use something analogous to the Session Variables available in standard ASP.Net applications. I intend to use Isolated Storage to achieve this. But I am skeptical about security in this option, as the Isolated Storage exists on the client side, and can be manipulated on client side. I am new to the Isolated Storage concept and don't know about the security options provided by it in terms of Encryption and server-side validation etc. If any of you have used it or are aware of the security provided in this case, could you please shed some light on the same. Thanks
