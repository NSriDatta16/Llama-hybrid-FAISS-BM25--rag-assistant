Finding character in String in Vector

Judging from the title, I kinda did my program in a fairly complicated way. BUT! I might as well ask anyway xD This is a simple program I did in response to question 3-3 of Accelerated C++, which is an awesome book in my opinion. I created a vector: vector countEm; That accepts all valid strings. Therefore, I have a vector that contains elements of strings. Next, I created a function int toLowerWords( vector &vec ) { for( int loop = 0; loop that splits the input into all lowercase characters for easier counting. So far, so good. I created a third and final function to actually count the words, and that's where I'm stuck. int counter( vector &vec ) { for( int loop = 0; loop That just looks ridiculous. Using a two-dimensional array to call on the characters of the vector until I find a space. Ridiculous. I don't believe that this is an elegant or even viable solution. If it was a viable solution, I would then backtrack from the space and copy all characters I've found in a separate vector and count those . My question then is. How can I dissect a vector of strings into separate words so that I can actually count them? I thought about using strchr, but it didn't give me any epiphanies. Solution via Neil: stringstream ss( input ); while( ss >> buffer ) countEm.push_back( buffer ); From that I could easily count the (recurring) words. Then I did a solution via Wilhelm that I will post once I re-write it since I accidentally deleted that solution! Stupid of me, but I will post that once I have it written again ^^ I want to thank all of you for your input! The solutions have worked and I became a little better programmer. If I could vote up your stuff, then I would :P Once I can, I will! And thanks again!
