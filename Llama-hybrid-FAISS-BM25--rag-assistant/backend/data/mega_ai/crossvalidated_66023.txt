To clarify, ACF and PACF are not statistical tests. The ouput of the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) functions help you decide whether you want to model a time series using an autoregressive (AR) model, a moving average (MA) model, or an autoregressive moving average model (ARMA, a linear combination of AR and MA models). Furthermore, the behavior of the ACF and PACF help you determine the parameters of these models. For instance, if your ACF drops off sharply after two lags and your PACF drops off after one lag for a particular time series, you might want to use an MA(2), AR(1), or an ARMA(1,2) to model your time series. (You may also model time series using auto regressive integrated moving average, or ARIMA models.) Once you have modeled a time series several different ways, you can inspect the AIC value to help you decide between models. The AIC takes into account goodness of fit and model simplicity. Generally, the smaller the AIC, the better. In R, you can build models using the arima() function, and evaluate their performance using the tsdiag() function.
