Conditionally assign C# var: As elegant as it gets?

I understand that the C# keyword var implies the type at compile time and therefore requires the declaration and assignment in the same place, making the following construct illegal: var something; if (condition) { something=1; } else { something = 0; } Even though the C# compiler could principally determine that all assignments in the current scope result in the same type, it (presently) does not and therefore generates a compile time error. In using var with LINQ, I sometimes want to initialize my result variable slightly differently depending on program conditions. The approach I have found is to use the ?: operator, as in: var participants = (email == null ? (from part in db.Participant where part.SequenceNumber == seqNr select part) : (from part in db.Participant where part.EmailAddress == email select part)); That works well enough if I just have two possible assignments, but quickly becomes unwieldy if there are multiple possible assignments. Is there a more elegant approach to this?
