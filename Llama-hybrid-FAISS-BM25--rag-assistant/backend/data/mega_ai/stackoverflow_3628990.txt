Programming Neural Networks with Python?

I'm a College student (Economics) and I want to program some monetary models using Neural Networks. I want those models to be able to predict future values of some variables using economic data, but I really don't know how to "model" the program itself. Is there any good Python module for that? I mean, a module for NN and a module for economic analysis? P.S.: I'm using Python 3.x, but I can switch to 2.7.x if needed...
