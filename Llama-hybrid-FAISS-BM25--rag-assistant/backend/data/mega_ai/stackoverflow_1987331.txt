Note that Robert's answer is correct, and it works in sh as well. You can (portably) simplify it even further: for i in "$@" is equivalent to: for i I.e., you don't need anything! Testing ( $ is command prompt): $ set a b "spaces here" d $ for i; do echo "$i"; done a b spaces here d $ for i in "$@"; do echo "$i"; done a b spaces here d I first read about this in Unix Programming Environment by Kernighan and Pike. In bash , help for documents this: for NAME [in WORDS ... ;] do COMMANDS; done If 'in WORDS ...;' is not present, then 'in "$@"' is assumed.
