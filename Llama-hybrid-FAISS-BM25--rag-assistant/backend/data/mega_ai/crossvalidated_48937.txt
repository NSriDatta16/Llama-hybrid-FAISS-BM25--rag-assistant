You have a couple of options. Try it anyway: Let the imperfect data stay and see what the forecast turns up. Delete the values for the end of the month, and try to forecast. For Option #1, I really like Prof. Hyndman's forecast package. I use its ets and forecast options always as a starting point. If you are digging deeper, then be sure to look into auto.arima() as well. For your data, I made it into a csv file. df = read.csv('data/so_timeseries_q.csv') #if you want the Date in a POSIX-friendly format dte 70 # Add one for zero-offset ---> 71 #make it a ts object tsdata Which produces: Caveat: ets can't really handle frequency greater than 24. But for doing a purely Time Series analysis, you don't have to tell it whether it is daily or hourly or any other regular time interval (so long as it is metronomic). ** The x-axis shows the fraction of the year. Option 2: R can handle missing values, if you use the xts or zoo packages. This vignette is a good place to start. So basically, you'd drop those end-of-the-month values, and run forecast methods. Hope that gets you moving forward.
