Consider two methods of prediction: Using the mean training value of lpsa, i.e., use the average lpsa value from the training set as your predicted value (you are not using predictor values here), and Using the linear model fitted to the training set, i.e., $E(Y|X)$ is linear in betas. If $\bar Y$ is the mean training value of lpsa, then base error rate is $\sum(Y^*_i - Y_i)^2$. If the mean prediction error does not improve the base error rate, then it is not an adequate model.
