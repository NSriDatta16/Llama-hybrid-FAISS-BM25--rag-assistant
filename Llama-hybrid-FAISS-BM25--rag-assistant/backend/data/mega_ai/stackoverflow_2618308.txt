That's a typical homework question. Generally this operation is called FLATTEN (which flattens lists on all levels). (mapcan #'copy-list '((a b c) (d e f) nil (g h))) The APPLY variant has the problem that it may run into the CALL-ARGUMENTS-LIMIT when there are more sublists than CALL-ARGUMENTS-LIMIT. See for example also http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Flatten_a_list#Common_Lisp
