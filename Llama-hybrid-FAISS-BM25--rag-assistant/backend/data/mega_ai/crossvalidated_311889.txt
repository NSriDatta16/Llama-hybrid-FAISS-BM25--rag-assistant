For an exponential family like the Normal distribution, the sample average $\bar{x}$ is know to achieve the Cram√©r-Rao lower bound , that is the minimal possible variance among all unbiased estimators of the mean. It is thus no surprise that another estimator such as the trimmed mean is found to be more variable than $\bar{x}$.
