Setup iPhone app login to PHP web application backend

I'm not an iPhone developer but I'm starting on a project that is based on a PHP back-end server supplying data to iPhone useragents and I'm wondering where to start with sessions/security. With browsers, I can simply pass a cookie (containing a session id) on login. However, I'm wondering if the iPhone is different. Do iPhone apps have access to storage space for something like a cookie/token? Are their anythings that I need to watch out for that make the iPhone app user agents special?
