Java API to Split Oggs

I'm looking for a Java API to split Ogg vorbis files. JCraft seems good for playing oggs; seems like there should be a good way to utilize that to split them, but I don't see any documentation on the topic, and wouldn't really know where to start to accomplish that in JOrbis. An all-java port of mp3splt would be most ideal. Does anyone know of any such libraries? Or maybe know how to leverage JOrbis to accomplish this? Thanks!
