Is there a way I can ensure that only one of these values can be entered inside the element? Yes, with an XML Schema Definition (XSD) containing an XML Enumeration . Here is an example one for currencies: This restricts the value of the element to one of the listed enumeration values and a length of 3. To use it, you have to pass your XML and XSD through a validator . An example of how to do this in .NET is here: HOW TO: Validate XML Fragments Against an XML Schema in Visual C#.NET http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318504
