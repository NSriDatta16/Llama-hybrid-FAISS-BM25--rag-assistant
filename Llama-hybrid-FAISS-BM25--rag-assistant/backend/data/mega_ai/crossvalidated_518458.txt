KPSS test: p-value greater than 0.05 but test statistic is less than critical values

I am using Python Statsmodels to find out if my time series is stationary or not. My time series (after the first level shift) passed the ADF test and it suggested that the time series is stationary. However, when I run the KPSS test, I get the following results, which is confusing to me: KPSS Statistic: 0.150119 p-value: 0.100000 Critical Values: 10%: 0.347 5%: 0.463 2.5%: 0.574 1%: 0.739 As you can see, the p-value is greater than 0.05, but the tstat is less than the critical values. the Arima ndiff also return 0, which suggest the time series is constant. Here is the code: for i in range(1): result = kpss(df['key'].values) if (result[1] I tried to detrend my time series (quadratic trend, linear trend) by it does not help with the kpss test. I appreciate it if someone please help me to understand if the result is expected or if I am doing something wrong!
