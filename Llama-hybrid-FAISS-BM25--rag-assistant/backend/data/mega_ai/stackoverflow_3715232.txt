I am not sure it is possible to get a full coverage, since issue 2939804 reports: EMMA always marks synchronized(..) as partially covered Examples: synchronized (lock) // partially covered (yellow line in EclEmma) { // ... } synchronized (this) // partially covered (yellow line in EclEmma) { // ... } Maybe a different tool ( like Cobertura ) would yield a different result? (I have not tested it recently). Update December 2012 (more than 2 years later): Nathan D Ryan reports : synchronized will light to green if the synchronized block contains code that waits on an object monitor, and a test interrupts the waiting thread. After a little experimentation, I was able to achieve complete coverage of the synchronized line if the synchronized block completed normally and completed abruptly due to an exception.
