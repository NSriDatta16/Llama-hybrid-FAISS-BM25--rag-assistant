Finding Sample Size for a proportion hypothesis test

I'm studying for a test and i got stuck at the following problem: If a coin is being tested for honesty ($H_{0}: p = .5$) and we desire the test to fulfill the following conditions: $P(\text{Reject } H_{0}|H_{0} \text{ is true}) \leq 0.05$ In other words, $\alpha$ (Error type I) must be equal or lesser than $.05$ $P(\text{Not reject $H_{0}$ when } |p -.5|\geq 0.1) \leq 0.05$ I understand this means we want a margin of error 0.1 with at least 95% confidence. What's the minimum sample size we need to fulfill all these conditions and what's the rule of decision (Critical region)? My doubt is really focused in this: I know we can isolate sample size in the margin formula as below, however as we do not know if the sample is sufficiently big so we can use a normal aproximation for the percentil, how can i use the available information to find the binomial percentile when $n$ is not known? $n = \frac{z_{\alpha/2}^{2}p(1-p)}{ME^{2}}$ EDIT: I found a way to deal with the problem without assuming normality. I'd like to know if this is a correct approach to it: $P\left(\left| \frac{\hat{P}-P}{\sqrt{P(1-P)/n} } \right| \geq x \right) \leq 0.05$ $P\left(\left| \hat{P}-P \right| \geq x\sqrt{P(1-P)/n} \right) \leq 0.05$ Now, we know the formula to the error margin thus we can substitute the term inside the probabilty by the desired value $P\left(\left| \hat{P}-P \right| \geq 0.1 \right) \leq 0.05$ My idea now is apply Chebyshev's Inequality as $P = E(\hat{P})$ $P\left(\left| \hat{P}-P \right| \geq 0.1 \right) \leq \frac{P(1-P)}{n 0.1^{2}} = 0.05$ When $H_{0}$ is true we have $p = .5$ so substituting, $P\left(\left| \hat{P}-P \right| \geq 0.1 \right) \leq \frac{.5^{2}}{n 0.1^{2}} = 0.05$ Isolating $n$ in the equality in the right side so we satisfy the initial restriction $n = \frac{.5^{2}}{.1^{2}.05} = 500$ Is this correct? Thanks for the attention.
