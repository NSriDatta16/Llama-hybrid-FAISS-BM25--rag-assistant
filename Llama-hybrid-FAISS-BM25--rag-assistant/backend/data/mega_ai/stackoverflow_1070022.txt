How to deploy JDBC client app via WebStart?

I know that this is a very helping community.. so i hope I will get an answer for my problemt. Actually, I have a swing app which contacts an oracle database via JDBC. Now I want to deploy this via WebStart. I have a text area in the application that prints out the log messages . all goes well, jnlp downloads my application jar at the client side. But suddenly, the log area says, It cannot connect to the database. I mean, I get an SQL exception while establishing a connection to the database. what might have gone wrong. Should i include any other jar/library when i deploy the app through web start. But i heard I can only download one jar file via webstart and a jar cannot contain another jar file. Please help. Here is my JNLP file CSV Import Client CRM Software CSV Import client Here is my Manifest.txt file I used to get the jar file.. Manifest-Version: 1.0 Main-Class: org.csv.Main
