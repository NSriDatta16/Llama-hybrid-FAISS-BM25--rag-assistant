IE7 extra padding/margin

http://www.wilwaldon.com/crossing/page3.html If you look at the page in IE7 there is an ungodly amount of space between the top paragraph and the bottom spotlight area. It works fine in all other browsers. If you know of any tricks or hacks to prevent this I'd greatly appreciate this :) Thank you!
