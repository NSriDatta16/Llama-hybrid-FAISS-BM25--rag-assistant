What is a suitable probability distribution for monetary amounts?

In my Bayesian model, I have a random variable representing the amount of money received due to a user's click on an affiliate link on a website. There are several such links with different payouts; in my model I want to capture the uncertainty due to the unknown behaviour of the user. The amounts are typically in the range of 0.30 EUR to 0.80 EUR. I am wondering: what is a suitable probability distribution for monetary amounts?
