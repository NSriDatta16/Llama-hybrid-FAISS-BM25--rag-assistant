33/100 is a periodic number in binary just like 1/3 is a periodic number in decimal. $ perl -e'printf "%.20f\n", 0.33' 0.33000000000000001554 Therefore, it would take infinite storage to store it as a floating point number. To avoid the problem, you'll need to store the number as a string, either early (in the query before it's a float) or late (by rounding).
