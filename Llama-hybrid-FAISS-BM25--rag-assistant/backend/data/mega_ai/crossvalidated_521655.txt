How to determine the correct amount of oversampling (in regression)

For my regression problem I splitted my dataset into a stratified train- and testset (70:30) and I now want to train my models (random forest, gbm, logistic regression) using the trainset. The dataset (~400 obs) contains performance data of subjects in different tasks and these performances should be used to predict a certain skill, hence are used to train the models. I want the models to perform especially good for predicting low-performer subjects. In the histogram below you can see what I consider a low-performer (red square) and I'm afraid that due to the imbalanced dataset the models fail to deliver good results for this "minority class". Therefore, I wrote a function to oversample the evaluation set while training the models using caret and UBL in R . However, I struggle to find any information on how to determine how much oversampling is okay/allowed/useful. Note: Hints to sources I can read regarding this topic are also very appreciated. Thank you!
