Please disregard my answer if it repeats what it has been suggested to you in linked posts... With log variables, your interpretation of the mfx $dy/dx$ becomes: $\frac{dy}{d\log x}$ which is equivalent to $\frac{dy}{dx/x}$ so the interpretation implies that 1% variation in $X$ causes a $\frac{dy}{d\log x}$ variation on $y$ In your case the std. deviation(2.79) is still an average variation of the log scale so: $\frac{dy}{d\log x}\Delta(\log x) = -0.029*2.79= -0.08 $ a 279% (2.79) variation (or one standard deviation) of $X$ causes the probability to decrease in $8\%$. A very small effect indeed.
