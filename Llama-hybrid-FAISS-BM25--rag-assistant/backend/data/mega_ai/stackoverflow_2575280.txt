Try using a random number generator from tr1 like std::tr1::mt19937 . The rand() function is usually implemented with a low quality random number generator. EDIT: Low quality may mean, for example, that even generating 2D points (x,y) in [0,100]^2 will lead to points that are not evenly scattered in the square. You may think that it's not supposed to behave that badly, but you will be surprised by how badly plain rand() actually behaves.(and this is sadly true in most languages). EDIT2: The method range*(rand()/RAND_MAX) is not a good one. It has issues with double precision that will not yield even results. Try the following and see if your program still gives you the results you are surprised of: std::tr1::mt19937 engine(thread_seed); std::tr1::uniform_int<> unigen(waitTimeMin, waitTimeMax); std::tr1::variate_generator >gen(engine, unigen); waitSec = gen(); EDIT3: (source: dilbert.com )
