What is the best way to manage user photos for a website?

My question is about displaying thumbnails and storage. Let's say I have a website where users can upload photos and view them in albums. How are the photos usually stored in this scenario? Are the images themselves or are the file paths usually stored in the database? If the photos are large and you want to display thumbnails, is it better to: save a copy of the image and a reduced size image, only displaying the larger if requested? use HTML to reduce the size?
