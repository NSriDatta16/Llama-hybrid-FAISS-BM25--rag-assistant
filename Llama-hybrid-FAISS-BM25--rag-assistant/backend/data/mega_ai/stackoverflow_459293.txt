You could create a window, then you could enumerate all Windows that have the style WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW , select the ones belonging to the application you want to house, then call SetParent on the window, setting the parent to the window you created. You could also use FindWindow to find a window by its title. All the windows inside the house can never leave the house window's boundaries, but they still follow all the same rules. You can still click-and-drag windows etc. The problem here is that if the application inside the house creates another window, its parent will most likely be the desktop window, not the house window.
