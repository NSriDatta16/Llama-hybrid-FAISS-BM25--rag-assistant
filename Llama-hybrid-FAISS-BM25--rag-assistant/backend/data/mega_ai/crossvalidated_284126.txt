How to extract features from variable duration time-series data?

I have 4 different data sets with samples of time-series measurements of different actions. The duration (# data points) of each measurement in the different sets is: Set # 1 = 40000 data points Set # 2 = 8000 data points Set # 3 = 5000 data points Set # 4 = 40000 data points My plan was to have a window size of 100 data points over which to calculate features such (mean, kurtosis, variance..etc); however, since the time-series measurements are of different lengths, would it be appropriate to adjust the window size for each set so that I will have the same number of features across all samples? Or is there a better approach? The purpose of these features is for multi-class classification using an svm or random forests model.
