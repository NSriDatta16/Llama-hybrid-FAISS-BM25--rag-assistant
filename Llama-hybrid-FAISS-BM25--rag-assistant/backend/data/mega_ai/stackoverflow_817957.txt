Redirect/Refresh to fragment identifier

Im using the iUI framework to create a site. If your not familiar with this you have one page made up of divs and you navagate the user between with fragment identifiers. The problem with this is if your user adds content it is not visible until they refresh. In my sistuation they add data to a list via jquery post but like I say they see nothing until a refresh and once you do a refresh it goes to the parent div as the #fragment has been lost. So I have managed to get the page to go to mywebsite.com/#_fragment after the update using window.location = mywebsite.com/#_fragment but it doesn't actually reload the page. Anyone have any clues has how to refresh a page to a fragment?
