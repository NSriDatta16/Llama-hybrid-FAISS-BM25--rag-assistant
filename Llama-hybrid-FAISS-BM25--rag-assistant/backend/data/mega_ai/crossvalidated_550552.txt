How to estimate moderators of persistence in a panel?

I have a panel dataset of $n$ groups ( i ), observed at a given time ( t ), where we observe a DV ( y ) and some IVs ( x1 , x2 ) at each time point. Data would look like i t y x1 x2 c_1 1 10 2 10 c_2 2 11 4 11 ... c_n T 15 4 9 I am interested in how the IVs moderate the effects of shocks to y . That is: Are groups who are currently higher in x more protected against shocks to y such that a shock is less likely to persist in the time series for y ? How would I go about modeling this?
