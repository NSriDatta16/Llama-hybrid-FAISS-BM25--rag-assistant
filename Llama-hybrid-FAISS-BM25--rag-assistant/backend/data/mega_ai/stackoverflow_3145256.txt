Following Dimitre answer, when I run this stylesheet: Doc Test With your update input document: This is an HTML paragraph And this is a preformatted block of text. I get this output on Firefox 3.5.9 (from "Inspect element" option): Doc Test This is an HTML paragraph And this is a preformatted block of text. Note : In Firefox, if your transformation didn't output a proper HTML or XHTML, it will output inside a transformix element. But this seems to have no relationship with preserved white spaces (at least in this version). Edit : The pre/@id belong to other input that I've tested for the '@*' template. Sorry
