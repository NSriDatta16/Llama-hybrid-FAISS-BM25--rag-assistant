Does anyone have a link to a plugin or tutorial that can make me a jquery/ajax image slider/carousel like this?

I really like how cnn.com implements this. I can REALLY use it on the website I am making. What makes it so cool is the page numbering, and the first, previous, next and last buttons. Notice how you get an image preview when you hover over a number...nice! Anyone with a link to a website that shows how to implement this? I will be calling images and other information from a database. Link to the cnn page: http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/02/10/egypt.protests/index.html?hpt=T1 Thanks in advance.
