Implementing preg_match_all in Python

I basically want the same functionality of preg_match_all() from PHP in a Python way. If I have a regex pattern and a string, is there a way to search the string and get back a dictionary of each occurrence of a vowel, along with its position in the string? Example: s = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" Would return: { 'u' : 1, 'e' : 3, 'a' : 6, 'i' : 8, 'a' : 11, 'i' : 13, 'i' : 15 }
