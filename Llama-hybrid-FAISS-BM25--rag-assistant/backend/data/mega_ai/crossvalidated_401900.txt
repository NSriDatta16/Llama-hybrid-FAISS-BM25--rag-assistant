Confusion between using ratio, bayes theory, or others

I am confused as to what I should be using to derive an appropriate metric. The objective here is to find out if knowing if a person has X, Y, Z can help indicate if they are in the binary bucket A or B. The total number of people in the experiment is let's say: 10000, of those 8000 are in A the others (2,000) are in B. [This is mutually exclusive] and there might or might not be a class imbalance I have ten thousand features that are not mutually exclusive, A and B can or cannot have some feature like HNS or FEX. For example, variable: Number in A that have variable: Number in B that have it: 1. HNS: 1,000: 500: 2. FEX: 100: 200: and like that.... So I want to see, Given a new person that has the variable what are the probability that I can categorize them in A or B? I can run a logistic regression using but this not a traditional problem. I guess I can do a multinomial logistic regression but exclude the changes that not in A or not in B. Alternatively, I was thinking of getting probabilities and I am confused which method is preferable. For example, looking at HNS, 1000/1500 people have it, therefore there is a 2/3 chance from A and 1/3 chance from B. Alternatively, one can say that out of the 8,000 people from A only 1,000 have it ==> 12.5% and out of the 2,000 people in B, 500/2000 have it ==> 25%, therefore for a new person that has HNS, you should classify them as 12.5%/37.5% = 1/3 for A and 25%/37.5% = 2/3 for B. A little confused on how to approach this problem and if this is more so a simple percentage or bayesian problem I can run a logistic regression using but this not a traditional problem. I guess I can do a multinomial logistic regression but exclude the changes that not in A or not in B. Alternatively, I was thinking of getting probabilities and I am confused which method is preferable. For example, looking at HNS, 1000/1500 people have it, therefore there is a 2/3 chance from A and 1/3 chance from B. Alternatively, one can say that out of the 8,000 people from A only 1,000 have it ==> 12.5% and out of the 2,000 people in B, 500/2000 have it ==> 25%, therefore for a new person that has HNS, you should classify them as 12.5%/37.5% = 1/3 for A and 25%/37.5% = 2/3 for B. output would be a probability score for A or B given variable numbers like HNS.
