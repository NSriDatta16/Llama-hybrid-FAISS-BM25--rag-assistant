In addition to exploratory data analysis (EDA), both descriptive and visual, I would try to use time series analysis as a more comprehensive and sophisticated analysis. Specifically, I would perform time series regression analysis . Time series analysis is a huge research and practice domain, so, if you're not familiar with the fundamentals, I suggest starting with the above-linked Wikipedia article, gradually searching for more specific topics and reading corresponding articles, papers and books. Since time series analysis is a very popular approach, it is supported by most open source and closed source commercial data science and statistical environments (software) , such as R , Python , SAS , SPSS and many others. If you want to use R for this, check my answers on general time series analysis and on time series classification and clustering . I hope that this is helpful.
