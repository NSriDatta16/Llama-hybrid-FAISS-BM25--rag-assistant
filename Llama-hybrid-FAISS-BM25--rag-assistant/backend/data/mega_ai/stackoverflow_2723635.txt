What you'll need to do is setup a method that checks login credentials for a particular agent. "SELECT * FROM agents where username='$username' and password='$password', if a row is returned, you know they have successfully signed in. From here, you must save some data to session variables like the username and id of the user. You'll use this ID to check for album ownership in the album table. When an agent tries to edit an album, it will check if the agent ID is consistent with the ID in the album table. When an agent creates an album, you must save their id as maybe "agent_id" in the albums table to relate to in your code.
