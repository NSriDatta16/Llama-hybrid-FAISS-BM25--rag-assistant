How can I automatically cast an Object reference to the instance type?

I am using the JCR API that uses method overloading like so: setProperty(String value) setProperty(Boolean value) setProperty(Integer value) ... I then have a Collection which may contain String , Boolean , Integer , etc. instances. I would like to iterate over this collection, passing each element to the correct setProperty implementation for that instance type. The obvious way is something like this: for (Object value : values) { if (value instanceof String) node.setProperty((String) value); if (value instanceof Boolean) node.setProperty((Boolean) value); if (value instanceof Integer) node.setProperty((Integer) value); ... } Now besides being ugly - and deviating from OO ideals - this solution simply doesn't scale. While it works for this particular case, it would quickly become unwieldy as the number of types grows. I really feel as though there must be some elegant trick or util for automatically performing this casting operation.
