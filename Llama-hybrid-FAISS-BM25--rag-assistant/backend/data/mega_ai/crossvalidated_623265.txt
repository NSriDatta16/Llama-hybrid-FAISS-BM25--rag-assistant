How to project kernel PCA?

I have an $m\times n$ matrix $X$ . To apply a Kernel PCA to my $X$ matrix I need to warp it into a function $K = \Phi(X)$ . The problem here is that $K$ get the size $m \times m$ . If I'm doing projection with PCA. % Average mu = mean(K); % Center data Y = K - mu; % PCA analysis abort = input(sprintf('The size of the matrix is %ix%i. Do you want to apply PCA onto it? 1 = Yes, 0 = No: ', size(Y))); if(abort == 1) [U, ~, ~] = svd(Y); else error('Aborted'); end % Projection W = U(:, 1:c); P = W'*Y; Then the projected matrix $P$ is going to have the size $c \times m$ . Question: I want the size of the projected matrix to have size $c \times n$ . My goal is to turn $X$ into a lower dimension $c$ but keep the remaining columns $n$ . Am I using kernel PCA wrong?
