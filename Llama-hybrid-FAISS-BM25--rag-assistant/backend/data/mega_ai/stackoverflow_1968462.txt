Its alright to call your Validation and Calculation in Setter, as long as it does not block the thread and goes into heavy cpu intensive calculations. If you have simple 5 to 10 math based statements without involving complex loops, its alright. For databinding and WPF, this is the only way, However there is one more implementation called IEditableObject which has BeginEdit, CancelEdit and EndEdit, where you can do your calculation and validation on "EndEdit" function. In BeginEdit, you can save your all values in temp storage, in CancelEdit you can bring back all values from temp and fire PropertyChaged event for all values those were modified and in EndEdit, you can finally update all variables and fire PropertyChanged for all those are updated. IEditableObject will be best for performance wise, but it may not display new values until it was cancelled or ended, however to display instantly the only way to do is the way you are doing it. In case of heavy cpu usage, you can invoke another thread to do calculation and set variables and at the end you can fire PropertyChanged, but yes technicaly you are just doing same thing while setting value in setter but asynchronously.
