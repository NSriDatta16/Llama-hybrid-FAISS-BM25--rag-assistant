Where to save classes of the web-application

I have to create a small asp.net-application. The last such web-application I have built was a while ago. At this time, I have saved my classes in the App_Code -folder. During setting up the web-solution in VS2010, I have seen that VS does no more propose to create the app_code directory (right click on the project, Add asp.net-folder). Is the App_Code folder no more the prefered location to save classes of the web-application and where is the new place to store them? Update Thanks to Oded I have received the answer to my question. If one has the same question as I had, probably he is also not aware (as I was), that there are two different types of projects with their own menu-points in VS: Web-Application and Web-Site . The organisation of these two types is different. For a web-application, the app_code -folder is not proposed in the asp.net-folder-menu . Maybe this information helps someone.
