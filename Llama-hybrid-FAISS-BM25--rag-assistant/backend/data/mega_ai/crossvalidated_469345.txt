Can the dependent continuous variable be transformed in a Logistic Regression so that $Y$ becomes bounded between $[0,1]?$

I want to use a Logistic regression and my dependent variable is continuous, it is a percentage. However, the percentage is technically not bounded between $[0,1].$ It can take a value up to $500\%.$ If i'm not mistaken, logistic regression can be used if $Y$ is bounded between $0$ and $1.$ I want to know if there is a transformation that I could apply to my dependent variable so that it becomes bounded? For example, let's say that my dependent variable's upper limit is $500\%;$ would it be appropriate to divide $Y$ by $5, $ which would make my new upper limit $100\%? $ Then I could use logistic regression and re-transform back my estimated $Y$ s by multiplying by $5.$ Does it make any sense?
