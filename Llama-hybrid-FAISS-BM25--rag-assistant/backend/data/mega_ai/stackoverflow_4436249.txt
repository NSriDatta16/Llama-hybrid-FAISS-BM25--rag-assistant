how can i track users without cookies

ok... im looking to have a good round of brainstorming here... say i was google... the adword/adsense/analytics division. i would be getting a little worried about the future, when users start to disable cookies (or at least delete them on a regular basis), use private browsing, roam on multiple devices. how could google alternatively track users without the benefits of cookies? some ideas to get started (please elaborate on these and any others): -track users using some other persistent local/client side storage -use user-agent string fingerprinting -test cache response - if user 304's an image, they were here -track mac address -any random/out of the box ideas?
