It also depends just how different your platforms are, and whether all the functionality on one platform is available on another. I develop tools that have versions available for Win32 platforms, Windows CE and mobile, and various embedded platforms. Some aspects of the product simply aren't pertinent to platforms that don't have the matching hardware. For example, I'm currently working on [link text]a field based land survey product 1 that works with a variety of measurement devices, such as GPS and Total stations, using a variety of communications media, such as bluetooth, RS232, and radio modems, on a wide range of platforms. The specific version I'm currently working on will be hosted onboard on a measurement device with a relatively small screen and keyboard, and very limited memory and storage. There is no point including the functionality relating to other devices, and it is highly beneficial to the user to keep the interface as simple and streamlined as possible. Streamlined user interfaces, small executables, and a zero tolerence to bloatware are still of paramount importance in some domains. Plenty of common source for sure, but also plenty of target specific source and conditional compilation.
