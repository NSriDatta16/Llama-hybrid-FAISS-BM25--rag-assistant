The difference between the mean and the median is not a good sign of outliers. Example: You have five students, four earning \$1 and the fifth earning \$6 dollars. Then, the median income is \$1 and the average income is \$2. In this example, the average is two times the median! But that doesn't imply we should exclude one student from our analysis.
