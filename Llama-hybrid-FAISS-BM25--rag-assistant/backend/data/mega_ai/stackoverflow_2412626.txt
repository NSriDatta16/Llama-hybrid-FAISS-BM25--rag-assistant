Marvin's answer is really elegant, although if you really wanted to go for performance you could do it with a little arithmetic. You could derive a formula/method to convert an arbitrary date to "days since some starting point" (probably 01.01.0000) and then the rest of the operations would be easy with that. Getting the day of week from such a number is as simple as subtracting and getting the remainder of a division. Actually, PHP had a Date class in its PEAR library which did exactly this.
