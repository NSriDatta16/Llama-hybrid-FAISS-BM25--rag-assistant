To generate N samples of length sizeOfVector you start out with rand as you suggested, and then continue as follows (calling the array average instead of Mat for readability): samples = rand(N,sizeOfVector); average = mean(samples,1); binWidth = 3.49*std(average)*N^(-1/3)); %# Scott's rule for good bin width for normal data nBins = ceil((max(average)-min(average))/binWidth); [counts,x] = hist(average,nBins); normalizedCounts = counts/sum(counts); bar(x,normalizedCounts,1)
