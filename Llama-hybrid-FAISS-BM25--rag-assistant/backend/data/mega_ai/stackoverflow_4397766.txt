XtraScheduler create appointment programmatically

I am (trying) to use the DevExpress XtraScheduler to - (don't ask why) to create an appointment without actually using the scheduler control in the form i have attempted to do that like this... conn = new SqlConnection("connectionstring"); conn.Open(); int ResourceId = 18; AppointmentsAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(); AppointmentsAdapter.SelectCommand = new SqlCommand("spGetAppointmentsForResourceById", conn); AppointmentsAdapter.SelectCommand.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; AppointmentsAdapter.SelectCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@ResourceID", ResourceID); DataSet ds = new DataSet(); AppointmentsAdapter.Fill(ds); SchedulerStorage store = new SchedulerStorage(); store.Appointments.DataSource = ds.Tables[0]; store.Appointments.Mappings.Start = "StartDate"; store.Appointments.Mappings.End = "EndDate"; //etc etc store.Appointments.CustomFieldMappings.Add(new AppointmentCustomFieldMapping("fkcase", "fkcase")); //.. etc etc AppointmentBaseCollection appts = store.GetAppointments(dateFrom, dateTo); this is working fine - ie. it returns me the appointments between the dates.. great.. but what i am actually trying to do is query all the appointments so that i can work out if a new one can be added at a particular datetime. id like to be able to do AppointmentsAdapter.InsertCommand = new SqlCommand("spInsertAppointment", conn); AppointmentsAdapter.InsertCommand.Parameters.Add("@Type", SqlDbType.Int); AppointmentsAdapter.InsertCommand.Parameters.Add("@StartDate", SqlDbType.DateTime); AppointmentsAdapter.InsertCommand.Parameters.Add("@EndDate", SqlDbType.DateTime); //...etc etc and then do Appointment apt = store.CreateAppointment(DevExpress.XtraScheduler.AppointmentType.Normal); apt.Start = DateTime.Today.AddHours(8); apt.Duration = TimeSpan.FromHours(1); apt.Subject = "Subject"; apt.Description = "Description"; store.Appointments.Add(apt); but it appears that the store - even though I have set up the mappings etc and the adapter refuses to actually add the new appointment. I imagine I am just doing something wrong, buit maybe I cannot do it this way? just to confirm, I don't actually have a scheduler control in the form, and dont want one. I am just trying to give the user a list of possible appointments for a particular resource/daterange and then once the user has picked one, actually save the picked appointment away.
