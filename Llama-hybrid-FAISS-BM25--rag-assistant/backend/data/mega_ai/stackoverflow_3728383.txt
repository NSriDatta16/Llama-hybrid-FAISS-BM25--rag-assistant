You cannot share web.config's OR .cscfg's across Roles in Azure, as there is no guarantee a role is in the same host, cluster, or even datacenter as another role. If you are simply trying to share items like connection Strings, app-specific variables, etc., I would simply create your own "config manager" class that would obtain some XML and parse it into a collection of settings. This way, you could store that config on Azure Blob Storage and changes would be as simply as updating that blob and signaling your apps to reload. (very easy using the Service Management API).
