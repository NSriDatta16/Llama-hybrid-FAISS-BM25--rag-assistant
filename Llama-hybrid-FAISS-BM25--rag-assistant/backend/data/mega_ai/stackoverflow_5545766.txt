What are examples of models used in stock market predictions or books on the subject?

I'm trying to do a survey of stock market prediction methods, how they work and compare, for a computer science project. I know about neural networks, my project was originally going to be based on them, but after looking at the responses to this question: Predict Stock Market Values I figure that it would be better to look at the whole field. Can anyone show me some good resources to research? I fear no math. Thanks.
