@smaclell: See http://dylanbeattie.blogspot.com/2008/12/fun-with-servergetlasterror-in-classic.html for a potential solution for you. Here's the relevant paragraph from the article: There was a very similar known bug in Vista which was supposedly fixed in SP1, but it looks like the same fix isn't part of Windows 2008 Server yet. There is a workaround, though - if you set the site's default error property (under IIS settings -> Error Pages -> Edit Feature Settings...) to the custom page, IIS will invoke this page whenever an error is not handled by an explicitly configured status-code handler (so your 404, etc. handlers will still work) - but for some reason, handling the error this way means Server.GetLastError() still works properly.
