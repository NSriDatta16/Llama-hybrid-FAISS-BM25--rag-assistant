Predict most probable document in a given set of documents by a given question

I would like to know / discuss which implementation would be the best solution to predict to a given question the document from a given set of documents which is has the highest probability of including the answer. Given the following documents: - The email address the school is school@school.com. - Marc Zuckerburg is the class teacher - The Website can be accessed under http://google.com - You have to do your work within your working hours - The email address of the teacher is teacher@school.com - Email addresses are an usual way to communicate nowadays - The message from the teacher arrived at the parent's house - To become a teacher you've to go to school before - If I would become a teacher I would like to teach my students well - The school is located near the moon Given the following question: - How can I reach out the class teacher? The result should map to the following document out of the set of given doucments: - The email address of the teacher is teacher@school.com What I have tried so far with modest results: Using Spacy document similarity api (i.e. loading each of the given document in a set of a document into spacy and using .similarity to compare each of the given documents to the given question) Using keyword similarity using KeyBERT (i.e. loading keywords for each of the given documents and compare the to the keywords of the question) Using BERTScore Question similarity using Question Generation (i.e. loading related questions to each of the given document and compare them to the given question) All these approchases don't perform well, around 50-60% accuracy. This question aims not to get a fully implemented code, all I want is to talk about architecture. Any ideas about how to realize this kind of problem to achive better results as I've seen so far?
