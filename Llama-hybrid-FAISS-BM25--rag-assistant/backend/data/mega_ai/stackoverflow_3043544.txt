First off the bat I would recommend letting the users choose how many repositories they want, it is totally irrelevant and can only serve to create awkward situations. The way I would organize it is inspred on the "Benevolent Dictator For Life" and Lieutenants model. The BDFL is the person who integrates the changes from the lieutenants repositories into the toplevel repository master branch. The lieutenants integrate the changes of the contributors in their repo. Preferably in some sensible branches. The developers push their working branch to the Lieutenant or the lieutenant pulls it from their repo, email a patchset, whatever works best. Note that these 'integrations' can be largely automated using a CI server like hudson. The contributors work in branches per task and merge regularly with the MASTER repository. Only in exceptional circumstances from the Lieutenants repo. (Now this only works when the speed moving up is fast enough). It is better to pull from the master to reduce the latency in the loop and to avoid 'unpleasantness' when one of the Lieutenants is sick.
