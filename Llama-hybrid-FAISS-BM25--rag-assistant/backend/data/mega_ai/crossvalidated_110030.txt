stationary time series example

Please, could anyone give an example of a stationary time series? I mean, if for instance $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, $x_{3}$, $x_{4}$, $x_{5}$ are the 5 first random variables of the series, what would be the joint distribution of ($x_{1}$, $x_{2}$,$x_{3}$, $x_{4}$, $x_{5}$)? And then what would be the joint distribution of ($x_{1}$, $x_{2}$)? And for $x_{1}$?
