Apple Events to Control Mouse Remotely

I'm not even sure where to begin with this question... I want to be able to send mouse-click events to another machine, as if the user had clicked on that machine. I can do it on the same machine via: CGEventSourceRef source = CGEventSourceCreate(NULL); CGEventType eventType = kCGEventLeftMouseDragged; CGPoint mouseCursorPosition; mouseCursorPosition.x = point.x; mouseCursorPosition.y = point.y; CGMouseButton mouseButton = kCGMouseButtonLeft; CGEventRef mouseEvent = CGEventCreateMouseEvent ( source, eventType, mouseCursorPosition, mouseButton ); CGEventSetType(mouseEvent, kCGEventLeftMouseDragged); // Fix Apple Bug CGEventPost( kCGSessionEventTap, mouseEvent ); CFRelease(mouseEvent); But how do I send that event somewhere else? Applescript? I've read some stuff with AppleEvents being app-app communication, but I'd like to just generate a system event on another machine? Totally unsure. Thanks, [Edit 11/1/10 7:30a] Just to clarify, I'm not looking to screen share. At least I don't think so. I've got a cluster of several mac pros linked together, each has like 4 monitors. I'm trying to use only 1 device to communicate "clicks" to each of the nodes. So if the device is over node 3, but the device is plugged into node0, node0 needs to tell node 3 that it needs to respond to a click. Thanks, [Edit 11/4/10 9:32am] Really? Nobody can give me a concrete code example of generating Apple Events Programmatically to create mouse events on remote machines in C/C++/Objc-C???
