I have always been a Java Windows developer, so I have never crossed into the Linux development side. My Windows Java IDE of choice has always been Eclipse for Java Developers . I strongly encourage you to try developing in Java on Windows. Come to find out if you don't like it or nostalgia kicks in, ( whichever comes first ) I recommend downloading Sun's Virtual Box , install Linux along with your preferred tools for developing and you can now start where you had left off while still using Windows as your operating system. Hope this helps.
