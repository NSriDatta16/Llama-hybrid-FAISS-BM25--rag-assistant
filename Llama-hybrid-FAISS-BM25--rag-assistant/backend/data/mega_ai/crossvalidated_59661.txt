Regular conditional Bayesian experiment

In "Elements of Bayesian Statistics" (1990), Florens, Mouchart and Rolin describe two basic forms of reduction of a Bayesian experiment: Marginalization and Conditioning (Ch. 1). I don't understand the conditioning reduction. More precisely, i struggle with the definition of a regular conditional experiment. I would appreciate an explanation, if possible in measure-theoretic terms. Thanks
