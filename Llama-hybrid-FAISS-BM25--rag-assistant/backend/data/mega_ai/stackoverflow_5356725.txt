"Ternary numbers can be used to convey self-similar structures like a Sierpinski Triangle or a Cantor set conveniently." source "Quaternary numbers are used in the representation of 2D Hilbert curves." source "The quater-imaginary numeral system was first proposed by Donald Knuth in 1955, in a submission to a high-school science talent search. It is a non-standard positional numeral system which uses the imaginary number 2i as its base. It is able to represent every complex number using only the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3." source "Roman numerals are a biquinary system." source "Senary may be considered useful in the study of prime numbers since all primes, when expressed in base-six, other than 2 and 3 have 1 or 5 as the final digit." source "Sexagesimal (base 60) is a numeral system with sixty as its base. It originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, it was passed down to the ancient Babylonians, and it is still used — in a modified form — for measuring time, angles, and the geographic coordinates that are angles." source etc... This list is a good starting point.
