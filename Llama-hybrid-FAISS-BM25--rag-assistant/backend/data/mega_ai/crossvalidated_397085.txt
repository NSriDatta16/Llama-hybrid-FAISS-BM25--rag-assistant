First step in time series modelling is the visual inspection. Eye can see things a model can't necessarily see (but be aware: may also see things of no existence). Hence what can our eye definitely see? Mean does no seem to change . The process seems to be zero-mean, hence there is no unit root. We can also see that the process is too erratic to be Gaussian. It is time series driven by (mildly) fat tailed noise (like a t-student 3 degrees of freedom). And correlations seem to be compatible to some ARMA models . It could be an ARMA(2,2) driven by t-noise. But we can't definitely know that just by visual inspection. Hence note, even though the eye can reject classes of models and speculate, it can not estimate and run diagnostics. You can attempt and fit what you may think are the most likely models (and avoid fitting unlikely ones) but statistical estimation and diagnostics is what would allow you get to a model closer (in certain respect at least) to the data generating process.
