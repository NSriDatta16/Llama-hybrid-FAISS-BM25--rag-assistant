How can I reduce page reflows when using JavaScript widgets?

A lot of JavaScript libraries have user interface widgets. Usually they are created after the page is loaded. The user sees a page re-flow and parts of the page shift around or change appearance. How can I reduce the amount of reflowing that occurs when a page loads, especially if I’m using several widgets? Here’s some examples. These are really basic so the reflow isn’t so bad, but it’s there, especially with a cleared cache and a slow Internet connection: YUI 3 : The main paragraph shifts down after the menu nav element loads. BBC Glow : The logos load as a vertical list and then change to a Carousel control. YUI 2 : The table appears plain and then suddenly changes appearance. jQuery DataTables Plugin : The whole table appears, plain, before being restyled and paginated.
