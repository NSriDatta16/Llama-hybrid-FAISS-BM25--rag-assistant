Do you mean in a template? If you want to know if a story has a field in a template, you can use either the get_field() or the get_value() method. Use get_field() if you just want to know if the field is present, as it returns a Bric::Biz::Element::Field object (I assume Mason templating here): if (my $field = $element->get_field('teaser')) { $m->print(' ', $field->get_value, " \n"); } If you want to know if a field has a value, you use get_value() : if (my $val = $element->get_value('teaser')) { $m->print(" $val \n"); } That method will return undef if there is no field object, and the value of the field object if it exists. Note that if the value is an empty string or 0 , nothing will be printed there, either. But it's important to note that Bricolage documents are organized in a tree structure of elements. The best way to create templates is one for each container element. The above example, might be in a top-level "story" element template, where $element will be the top-level element itself. But if your "teater" field is in a subelement, say "Metadata", you'll want to create a "metadata" element template with the above code, and call it from your story element template, like so: $burner->display_element('metadata'); See Bric::Templates for an introduction to Bricolage templating and the API.
