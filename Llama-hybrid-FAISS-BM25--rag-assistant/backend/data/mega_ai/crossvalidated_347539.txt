The random walk $(S_n; n \ge 0)$ satisfies the strong Markov property . In more detail, the random variable $\tau$ is a stopping time, i.e. adapted to the process, so the strong Markov property implies the trajectory $(S_{\tau+n}; n \ge 1)$ after $\tau$ is independent of $(S_k; 0\le k Suppose that $\mathbb{P}(\tau = \infty) = 0$, i.e. $\mathbb{P}(\tau Let $\tau_0 = \tau$ and recursively define $\tau_{n+1} = \inf\{\tau > \tau_n: S_\tau \le S_{\tau_n}\}$. Note that by construction $0 \ge S_{\tau_0} \ge S_{\tau_1} \ge \ldots$. Moreover, $\tau_0$ is a.s. finite by supposition. The SMP implies $(S_{\tau_0 + n}; n \ge 1)$ is independent of the past (given $S_{\tau_0}$, and the precise value $\le 0$ doesn't matter) and homogeneity of the random walk implies $\tau_1$ has the same distribution* as $\tau_0$ and in particular is finite a.s. Applying the argument repeatedly shows $\tau_n$ is finite a.s. So $\tau_n \to \infty$ and so $S_{\tau_n} \le 0$. Hence $S_n \not\to \infty$. Regarding relaxed assumptions- Do you have a specific scenario in mind for the non-i.i.d case? (You can prove something along the lines of my answer for time homogenous Markov chains with extra conditions when starting from $\le 0$ at step *)
