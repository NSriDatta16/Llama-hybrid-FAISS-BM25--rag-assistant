JavaScript: Creating objects based on a prototype without using new + Constructor

is this possible? My thinking: Prototypes are essentially attributes of the Constructor function (whether native Constructor such as Function, String or Object, or your own custom Constructor) and only the 'new' keyword is able to leverage the Constructor and its prototype for object creation Am I missing something?
