How does UIScrollView steal touches from its subviews?

I'd like to be able to create my own container subclasses of UIView which can react first to touches, before their subviews. This is tricky because normally a subview receives touch events (via touchesBegan: etc) before superviews. How does UIScrollView reverse this? To be clear, I am not asking how UIScrollView behaves . I understand what it does, and how you would normally use it. I'm asking about how I could cleanly implement my own version of this -- not because I want to, but because I'm trying to build reusable container views that take advantage of similar behavior.
