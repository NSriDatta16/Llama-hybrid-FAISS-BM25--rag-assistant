If you want to write a compiler for C#, the place to start is the Dragon Book , alongside a copy of the C# 4 spec . It's an awful lot of work though, and not for the faint of heart; you generally need years of experience to write a compiler for something as complicated as C#. I recommend starting with a smaller language, maybe a trivial language like brainfuck, or looking at existing toy compilers.
