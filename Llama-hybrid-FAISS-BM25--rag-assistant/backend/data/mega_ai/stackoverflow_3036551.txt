As Daniel mentions, RAM used by an application is not necessarily an indicator of a memory leak. With respect to the behavior you notice regarding vectors, a vector guarantees that the memory layout is contiguous & hence when you create a vector of size 99999999, all the 99999999 elements are laid out in sequence & would constitute a pretty sizable chunk of memory. Deleting this would definitely impact process size. A map behaves differently (as per Wikipedia, its often implemented as a self balancing binary tree) so I guess deleting it causes fragmentation in the process memory space & maybe due to that the process memory does not drop immediately. The best way to detect memory leaks would be to use a tool like valgrind which will clearly indicate whats wrong.
