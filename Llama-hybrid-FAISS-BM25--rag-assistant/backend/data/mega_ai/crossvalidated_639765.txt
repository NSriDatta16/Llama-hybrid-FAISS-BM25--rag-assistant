logistic regression vs poisson rate regression

I have some confusion about logistic regression, Poisson regression and Poisson rate regression and I hoping to get some answers that can clear the cobwebs in my mind regarding this confusion. My outcome is a binary "Yes-Smoke", "No-Smoke" variable. No-Smoke : 3154 (86%), Yes-Smoke : 493(14%) One row per subject, no repeat observation. In addition there are time variables . Specifically , Season:{Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall} & Year: { 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020} This is the distribution of Yes and No each Season, each year. Time Yes,Smoke(%) No,Smoke(%) 2017:Winter 92.7 7.3 2017:Spring 91.6 8.44 2017:Summer 92.5 7.49 2017:Fall 93.8 6.2 2018:Winter 93.5 6.5 2018:Spring 93.7 6.3 2018:Summer 92.6 7.4 2018:Fall 94.8 5.15 2019:Winter 92.4 5.61 2019:Spring 93.7 6.32 2019:Summer 95.5 4.5 2019:Fall 93.4 6.58 2020:Winter 94.4 5.6 2020:Spring 93.1 6.9 2020:Summer 93.4 6.6 2020:Fall 91.3 8.7 I am wondering if I should apply logistic regression for this scenario or rate Poisson regression since I also have number of yes and no for each season , each year? Any advise is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
