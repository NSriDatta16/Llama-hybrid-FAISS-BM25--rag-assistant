I had a very similar issue today and wasted about 2 hours on it. At the end I deleted the localized xib through the "-" in the localization menu. Then I had to delete the .XIB file in the project (be sure to have a save copy of it somewhere before deleting anything - you can't get it back!!). Then I dragged the .XIB file back into the project. And finally it worked AFter all that I could localize correctly and it worked. But let me tell you, I will NEVER EVER start to localize before the app is not 200% ready. There seems to be a serious bug in xCode4. (It even crashed on me couple of times - I guess because it kept a link to some xib that couldn't be found anywhere on the HDD. This error only went away after the described procedure. Even deleting the .XIB file from the project and deleting it from the HDD still didn't help. XCode happily started with this one .XIB (wherever it got it from). Good luck! (I wasted too much time on this today!)
