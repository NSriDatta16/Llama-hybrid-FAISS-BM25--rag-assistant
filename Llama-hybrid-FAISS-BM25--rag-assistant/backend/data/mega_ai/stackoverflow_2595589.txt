None of these answers (including this one) is vim-specific, and the selected answer is Windows-specific. Here's one for *nix running X. I map my left Win key to the Esc key. This won't work in virtual terminals, but it works in X. Either: (1) Append keysym Super_L = Escape to ~/.Xmodmap and execute xmodmap .Xmodmap . |______(1a) ~same as echo "keysym Super_L = Escape" >> ~/.Xmodmap && xmodmap .Xmodmap . (2) Execute xmodmap -e "keysym Super_L = Escape" . If you want it to work in virtual terminals, see [0].
