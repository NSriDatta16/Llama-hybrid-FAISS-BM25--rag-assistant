Instead of continuing to debate HTML 4.01 Strict vs XHTML Strict, I would suggest starting to use HTML 5 today. John Resig, the author of jquery, made a similar suggestion last year on his blog. The HTML 5 doctype, in it's beautiful simplicity will trigger standards mode in all browsers (including IE6). That's it. HTML 5 provides some exciting new features such as the tag which potentially can push javascript application development to the next level. HTML 5 also has proper support for media (and media is a fairly important aspect of the web these days!) in the form of and tags. If you like the syntax of XHTML, i.e. closing "empty" tags such as , that is fully supported in HTML 5. From Karl Dubost of the W3C's post Learn How To Write HTML 5 : auto-closing tag is allowed and conformant in HTML 5. XHTML2 has received relatively little attention compared to HTML 5. It's becoming increasingly clear that HTML 5 is the future of markup on the web. Microsoft's latest browser, IE8 still renders XHTML served as text/xml as text/html. Microsoft have a co-chair on the W3C HTML working group and there's an implied support from them for HTML 5. All of the browser vendors have publicly announced their support for HTML 5. At the end of the day, even if XHTML2 regains support from the industry, it won't be a significant issue having two competing standards as it has been in the past. Both languages support XML namespaces (in the case of HTML 5, serialization of HTML i.e. DOCTYPE switching).
