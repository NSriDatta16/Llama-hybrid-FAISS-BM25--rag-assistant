Probably you need something like defined() of php. It is not customary in Python to check for existence of unqualified names. Having a name either defined or not and depend on it is bad practice. Though you may access function's local variables as locals() and global vars as globals() ; both return a dict. So you may pass something like locals().get('somevar', None) or globals().get('somevar', None) to try and find somevar first in local context, then in global context. But I discourage you from doing that unless absolutely necessary.
