This answer can be found on Hamilton's "Time Series Analysis", page 215 ( http://www.amazon.com/Series-Analysis-James-Douglas-Hamilton/dp/0691042896 ) I am sure it is asymptotically valid if you include a constant term in your model: Since $X_{t+j}, j=1,2,...$ are not independent from $\epsilon_t$, the F test does not hold for small samples but still, its F statistic is distributed $\chi^2$ asymptotically (you can find the proof in the book, pp 215-216, but it is essentially the same as in regular OLS, again if you include a constant term). If your model must not include a constant term, then I don't know the answer.
