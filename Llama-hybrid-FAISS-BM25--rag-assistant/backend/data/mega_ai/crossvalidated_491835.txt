Are Deep Anomaly Detection Approaches able to tell me what kind of anomaly it is?

I recently started to look into anomaly detection. The deep learning approaches are trained on "normal" classes to build a classifier that can detect outliers (anomalies). Are these approaches able to classify these anomalies and if so how can they do it, if they have never seen these before?
