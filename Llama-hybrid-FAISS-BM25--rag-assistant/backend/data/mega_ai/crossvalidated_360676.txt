Your problem is not specific to prediction-interval s. If you were calculating point mean forecasts for the end of the month, but then have values on the 29th, you could still try to update your forecasts. The most natural thing would probably be to go to daily granularity in the first place. If you want month-end forecasts, then forecast enough days out. And update your model as you get new data. Alternatively (e.g., if you don't have a regular time series of daily data), you could consider fitting and predicting a second "correction" model, which takes the original monthly forecasts and the intra-monthly movements, possibly also a term for how far into the month we are.
