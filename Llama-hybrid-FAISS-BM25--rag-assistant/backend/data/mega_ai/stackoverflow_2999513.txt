so I'm trying to keep them as empty as possible to keep query time down First, Query speed is not directly proportional to Database size unless you're doing only full table scans. A Unique Index lookup is proportional to the depth of the index. From the time a index root block splits to the next time it splits could be millions of additional rows. In fact deleting rows to keep the database "as empty as possible" may not actually make the database smaller. Until you rebuild the index, you could have very sparse branch and leaf blocks making making index scans take longer and longer. I'm not sure how MSSQL or MYSQL fill partially empty pages, but you may not see any space savings at all from deletes. In Oracle, I'd suggest partitioning and drops over deletes for actually keep a database a certain size. But I said all that to encourage you to spread your wings into an using an In memory database for your server usage, instead of focusing on your archive usage. In this case you've said nothing that makes me think an RDBMS isn't the best solution for archiving.
