Large ASP.NET MVC Application Considerations

I've done a large study into using MVC and thanks to the people here a lot of the issues revolving around it have been cleared up for me. The problems I'm having now revolve around the sheer size of our application and how it would be organised within the project itself. For example, we have url's such as http://mylocalapp/folder/nestedfolder/subfolder/theapp . The reason we do this is because the application quite literally is that large. We need that kind of folder structure because otherwise the application would be unmanageable. Phil Haack covers the registering of routes for nested folders in one of his blog posts which is very useful indeed, but our application has sub-applications and sub-applications within that. It couldn't be simplified any further. What steps need to be taken to manage such a large application which spans a large amount of folders and has folders up to seven levels deep, as well as having about 15 databases? Is MVC really the answer for an application of this size? Is another option simply to apply lots of URL routing and map route areas for all the separate sub-folders?
