Exponential distribution of the time between recurrences

Patients in a hospital are treated for certain illness. The time in days that no recurrence takes place follows exponential distribution with mean of $\theta = 27$ days. The following table gives the recurrence times for 20 patients with an average of $\bar{t} = 27$ days. ____________ Time in days| (0,10] (10,20] (20,40] (40,70] >70 ____________ num patients| 5 7 4 2 2 a) Determine an expression for the probability of the data given in the table; b) Determine the expected frequencies for each part in the table c) Determine the probability that a patient will go through 15 days with no recurrence; I can only find a probability P(X>15) based on the value for $\theta = 27$ $$P=e^{-\frac{15}{27}}=0.57375342$$ but I am not sure what the table data means. Any hint is welcomed.
