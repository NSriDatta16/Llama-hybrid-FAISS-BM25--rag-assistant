Best short examples of the need for Excel VBA

Here's one for Joel... I am looking for ways to demonstrate to an Excel user (with no programming experience) how learning some Excel VBA can make their life working with Excel a little easier. First thoughts are to use an example that replicates manual tweaking of a spreadsheet, such as one click conditional formatting of all the data. For example: highlighting all the numbers red, orange or green according to user input thresholds coupled with some other derived data such as current business week. I am hoping that such a short VBA example should not be too difficult to grasp for someone who has never written a line of code before, and hopefully make a case for trying to learn a bit of Excel VBA. However, with this example the time taken to code it is not significantly quicker than applying the conditional formatting manually in Excel. So I would be interested to know if anyone in the community has any more elegant examples that demonstrate the advantages of using Excel VBA. Ideal examples would have the following characteristics: Significant time savings (large T, where T = time for manual procedure / time to code). Non-abstract, everyday spreadsheet examples. End results that can not be easily achieved manually. Achievable with short, basic VBA code. Bear in mind that the target audience is taking their first steps into programming.
