mathematical simulation of svm workings

i cant seem to work my head around the mathematical part of svm i understand the concept and the derivations but the the part that comes after lagrangian formulation is where im stuck..(googling didn't help at all) a manual calculation of w and b would be great (taking a few random points and separating them using support vectors)
