If you read down in the README a bit : Result of Prediction The function 'svmpredict' has three outputs. The first one, predictd_label, is a vector of predicted labels. The second output, accuracy, is a vector including accuracy (for classification), mean squared error, and squared correlation coefficient (for regression). If you're doing classification, you should only care about the first component. decision_values are confidence scores, by definition. They represent how far past the margin the test points lie. prob_estimates , when using -b 1 in the libsvm_options to turn them on, are monotonic transformations of decision values (which can be any real number, where 0 is the dividing line between the classes) to probabilities (between 0 and 1, with 0.5 the dividing line).
