In my experience, if there are elements of a string that have meaning, it's best to put them in their own field. The gymnastics we go through trying to tease out the meaning are complex and error-prone; also it is easier to do data validation when we deal with each field explicitly. It's easy to construct the composite string, easy to search on the constructed string (albeit sometimes difficult to index). Fine-grained storage has always worked best for me.
