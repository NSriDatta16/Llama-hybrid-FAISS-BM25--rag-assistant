I will just answer here because of the better text editor. So if you believe that the neural network will be capable of "learning" from the single numeric input of price that "round" values are preferred of "non-round" values, then normalisation of the variable should not be an issue as it will retain the relative relationship of values between each other. So, the neural network would be capable of learning of this relationship, because for the neural network the concept of "round" values is arbitrary and it would just learn to associated specific values with prefered values. However, I believe that this is a really hard task to learn for a neural network. You could simplify this task by normalizing the price and have an additional collum that indicated whether the value is considered round or not: (100,1),(99,0), (98,0), (97,0) ... (80,1) However, this way you only focus on round values, but there might be patterns that can be discovered by the network, that you are not aware of. I would maybe try to provide values in a tuple of three: (1,0,0), (0,9,9), (0,9,8), (0,9,7) ... (0,8,0) This way you can ensure that patterns are much easiere learned. For example round values always have a three at the third position.
