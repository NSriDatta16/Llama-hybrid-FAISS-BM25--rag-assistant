Logistic regression issue

I am estimating a logistic regression model to investigate how various factors influence second-year college retention. I include a variable indicating whether a student is in a minority racial-ethnic group and, as expected, find that this negatively impacts the probability of second-year retention. However, when I introduce first-year GPA into the model, the sign of the minority variable flips —- minority status positively influences probability of retention. I’m stumped. Any help appreciated.
