From my experience, by far the biggest tolls you end up paying with RoR are: Pretty big default stack (not counting plugins you might be using) Updating models tends to be a pain in the ass, at least in production servers. Updating Rails or Ruby themselves is a bit more complicated than it should, but this differs depending on your server setup. As ewalshe mentioned, deployment is sometimes a drag, and further down the road, should you require it, scaling gets a bit iffy, as it does with most development frameworks. That being said, I'm an avid user of RoR for some projects, and with the actual state of hardware, even though you do end up paying some tech debt to using it, it's almost negligible. And one can hope these issues will be reviewed eventually and solved.
