Grouping predictor factor levels based on response variable

I've read that it's bad to do this, but am looking for details as to why. Suppose we're trying to fit the linear model $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \epsilon_i$ where $Y$ is continuous and $X$s are categorical with many levels. We don't have any opinion on how the levels should be grouped. We then calculate the average response for each level of the predictors, then collapse levels with similar averages. How badly does this screw up parameter estimates and inferences on them, and why?
