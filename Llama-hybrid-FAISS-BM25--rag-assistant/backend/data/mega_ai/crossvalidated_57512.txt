You are looking the what's called the predictive distribution . To include this is very simple. Before creating the Model , add the additional stochastic variable: predictive = mc.Normal( "predictive", mean, precision ) model = Model( {"mean": mean, "obs": obs, "pred":predictive}) ... predictive_traces = mcmc.trace("predictive")[:] hist( predictive_traces ) This will generate artifical data from the fitted model. Thanks for bringing this oversight to my attention, I'll include it in the BMH project.
