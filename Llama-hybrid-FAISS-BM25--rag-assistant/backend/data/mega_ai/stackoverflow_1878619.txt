Depends. If you are a total newbie you might want to try entity framework because it contains all the ORM designer classes that allows you to create entity class by drag and drop. No, it won't. NHibernate is used by a lot of sites, and it has first and second level caching feature that would speed things up by caching the previous operation, so performance isn't really an issue. You can only improve your app after you identify the bottleneck. Don't premature optimize.
