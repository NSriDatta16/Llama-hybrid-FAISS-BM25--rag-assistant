Using Ruby's "ready?" IO method with gets, puts, etc

The standard Ruby library "io/wait" provides a method on IO objects ready? that returns non-nil if there is input available, nil or false otherwise. I know some methods like sysread and syswrite are not safe to use with higher level methods such as gets and read , and wanted to know if ready? was safe to mix with the higher level methods. The ready method seems rather useful and perhaps more elegant than relying on IO.select , but, surprisingly enough, I haven't seen it used much. There is nothing in the documentation to indicate it would be unsafe to use with read or gets , I just want to be sure I'm not mixing incompatible methods that could ultimately result in unexpected behavior when reading/writing sockets. Edit : I suppose I should mention I am using Ruby 1.8.7.
