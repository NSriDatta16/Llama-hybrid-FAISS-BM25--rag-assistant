This should work whether user enters First Name, Surname or both. SELECT * FROM customer cus WHERE ((cus.Name like @FirstName) OR (@FirstName IS NULL)) AND ((cus.Surname like @Surname) OR (@Surname IS NULL)) I used two variables because entering input values into an SQL string is strongly discouraged, as it exposes to SQL Injection (other than being slower).
