Sounds like a mess. I can suggest that for item #3, you look at the new R package brms , which uses Stan (Bayesian tool) under the hood. (If that doesn't seem quite right, also look at rstanarm , which is also using Stan under the hood, but takes a different approach.) These will not run nearly as fast as lmer since they're doing MCMC sampling, and are working through a second underlying tool. ( brms in particular needs a compiler and compiles your model before executing it.) But it can handle ordinal independent variables, and has several options for this. It sounds to me that 17 DVs with only 136 complete observations won't work and you might want to consider combining your DVs down to a single score if that's possible. (Other, more knowledgeable folks can chime in on this: whether it's a good idea or not and how to do it if it is a good idea. I have no experience in doing it.) But a Bayesian analysis should give you as much information as possible to decide how uncertain your results are.
