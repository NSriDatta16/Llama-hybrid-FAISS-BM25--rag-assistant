Are you sure ${project.config} point to the same place in both local and TeamCity environments? The agent are not always running with the sem environment variables as the local machine. So I would start out to check all properties and see where they point in the local machine as well as TeamCity. As for the /p:Configuration=${project.config}, you can only have one configuration running but you can specify more properties with ; between them: /p:Configuration=${project.config};OutDir=bin\x86\Release
