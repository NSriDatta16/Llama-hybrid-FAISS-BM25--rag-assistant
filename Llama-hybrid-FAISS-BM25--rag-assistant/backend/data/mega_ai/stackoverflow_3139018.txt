Using a generic type of a subclass within it's abstract superclass?

Within my code a have the following abstract superclass public abstract class AbstractClass {...} and some child classes like public class ChildClassA extends AbstractClass {...} public class ChildClassB extends AbstractClass {...} I'm searching for an elegant way how I can use the generic type of the child classes (GenericTypeA, GenericTypeB, ...) inside the abstract class in a generic way. To solve this problem I currently defined the method protected abstract Class getGenericTypeClass(); in my abstract class and implemented the method @Override protected Class getGenericTypeClass() { return GenericType.class; } in every child class. Is it possible to get the generic type of the child classes in my abstract class without implementing this helper method? BR, Markus
