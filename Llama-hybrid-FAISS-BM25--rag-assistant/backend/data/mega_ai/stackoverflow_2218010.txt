Scene management. kd-trees, frustrum culling, bsps, heirarchical bounding boxes, partial visibility sets. LOD. Switching out lower detail versions to substitute in for far away objects. Impostors. Like LOD but not even an object just a picture or 'billboard'. SIMD. Custom memory management. Aligned memory, less fragmentation. Custom data structures (ie no STL, relatively minimal templating). Assembly in places, mainly for SIMD.
