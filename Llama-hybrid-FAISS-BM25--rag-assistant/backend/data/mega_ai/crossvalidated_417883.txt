I don't think it's very useful to do a hypothesis test to compare average prediction errors - that seems like a confusing mix of two different statistical philosophies. A more suitable approach would be to decide based on your subject knowledge how much of an improvement in prediction error would be meaningful, and proceed from there. Given that this requires subject matter knowledge to evaluate, it's hard for us to tell you whether 0.0008 is a meaningful difference.
