Qt Creator Designer Issue

A friend just recommended that I try Qt Creator, so I downloaded it from http://qt.nokia.com/ . When I tried to make a hello world application using the GUI designer, I could not drag any widgets onto the window. I am using Ubuntu 10.04 and Qt Creator 2.0.0 on Qt 4.7.0 (64 bit). I am able to compile projects, but not add widgets to the UI.
