Like many predictive model, SVM will output probability scores and the apply threshold to probability to convert it into positive or negative labels. As, @Sycorax mentioned in comment, you can adjust the cut-off threshold to adjust the trade-off between false positive and false negative. Here is some example in R. library(kernlab) library(mlbench) graphics.off() set.seed(0) d=mlbench.2dnormals(500) plot(d) # using 2nd order polynominal expansion svp Note when we change cut_off , the confusion matrix (false postive, false negative etc.) changes > caret::confusionMatrix(d$classes,ifelse(p NIR] : cut_off=0.8 > caret::confusionMatrix(d$classes,ifelse(p NIR] :
