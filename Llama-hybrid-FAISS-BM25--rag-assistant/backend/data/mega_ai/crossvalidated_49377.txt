How to assign ranks given the distribution above mean?

Say I have the following data, % students below average in math: S1 % of students at proficient level in math: S2 % of students at above proficient level: S3 S1 + S2 + S3 = 100% If I have this distribution across multiple classes and multiple years, how can I do a comparitive assesment ? A naive score would be a weighted mean like S1 + 2S2 + 3S3 (so a bias towards strong performers). Anybody has pointers on better estimation ?
