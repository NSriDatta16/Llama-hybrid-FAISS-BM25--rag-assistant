Unbalanced multiclass data with XGBoost

I have 3 classes with this distribution: Class 0: 0.1169 Class 1: 0.7668 Class 2: 0.1163 And I am using xgboost for classification. I know that there is a parameter called scale_pos_weight . But how is it handled for 'multiclass' case, and how can I properly set it?
