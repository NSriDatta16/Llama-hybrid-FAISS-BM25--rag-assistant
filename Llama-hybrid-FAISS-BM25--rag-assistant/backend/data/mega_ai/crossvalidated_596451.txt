Visualizing matrix with high numerosity?

I have a matrix with many rows (>18000) and few columns (6), where five are numerical and one is a binary factor and i'd like to find an efficient and simple way to visualize the relationship between the factor and the other variables. I want to find out how observations with, for example, categorical value = 1 correlates with each numerical variable. I tried a pca and visualized the result as a biplot and it kinda works, but i would like to try other solution possibly. Do you guys have any idea ?
