The point of volatility forecasting is to forecast the full predictive density. For instance, you might assume a normal future density with mean zero, and forecast the one free parameter, which happens to be the variance. Or use some nonparametric approach. The method of choice for evaluating predictive densities is a proper scoring rule . We have a scoring-rules tag. Its tag wiki contains a few pointers to literature. As an example, I randomly picked the first relevant article in the current issue of the International Journal of Forecasting , which just happened to be "Forecasting volatility with time-varying leverage and volatility of volatility effects" by Catania & Proietti (2020, IJF ) . They use the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), which is one very commonly used proper scoring rule.
