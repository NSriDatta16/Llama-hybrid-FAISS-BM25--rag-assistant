How can I test for a systematic increase in Y as a function of X in data modeled by a sigmoid curve?

I have a psychophysical dataset in which the contrast level (a continuous variable) is expected to influence the proportion of correct responses (correct response: categorical [boolean]). Traditionally, these kinds of data are modeled by a psychometric function (in effect, a sigmoid curve constrained to chance performance). In my case, I'm using the following formula to fit my data: 1 / (1 + exp(-(x - theta) / sigma)) Additionally, this experiment was performed with a repeated-measures design, so there is a categorical subject column. I would like to demonstrate that the proportion of correct responses increases as a function of contrast, bearing in mind that the design is not fully-factorial, i.e.: the exact contrasts vary between subjects. Is there some form of mixed-effect logistic regression I could (should?) use for such data? I've done a linear mixed-effect model so far, but it seems hackish to apply a linear model when there's a strong a priori expectation that the data were produced by a sigmoidal function. This concerns me even more since such a linear regression intercepts at around .3, which suggests that chance performance is at 30%; in reality, it should be at 50%, and a sigmoidal function estimates this correctly. In other words, I'm concerned that linear mixed-effect models will muddy my interpretation and I'd much prefer some non-linear mixed-effect model. I apologize if anything is unclear and I am happy to provide further details. I'm not a statistician, so I ask that you please bear with me...
