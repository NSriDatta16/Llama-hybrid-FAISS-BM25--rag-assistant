I think this should be a community Wiki But to the point, my view is that J2ME is going to die a horrible death and leave us with normal Java. The current Netbook trend combined with the more powerful smartphone trend means that your average cellphone today is much stronger than the machines that ran J2SE when it first came out. Hence, we can do away with J2ME, which was designed for ancient Nokias, and enjoy the standard Java on a smart doorknob (or a smartphone). The only problem that Java faces is that the biggest player in smartphone applications - Apple - isn't going to allow a JVM anytime in the foreseeable future.
