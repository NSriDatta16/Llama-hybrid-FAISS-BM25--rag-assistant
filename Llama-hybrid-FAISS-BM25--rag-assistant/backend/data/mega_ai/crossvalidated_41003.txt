In a remarkable paper , Gleser and Hwang showed that, for some models, confidence intervals must have infinite expected length for any positive confidence level $\alpha$ to be attained. More precisely, there is a subset of observations with positive measure for which the length of the confidence interval is infinite. Examples include error-in-variable models and the Fieller-Creasy problem, where one estimates the ratio of two normal means. Conversely, a confidence interval may have zero length for a subset of observations with positive measure without jeopardising the (overall) coverage probability. For instance, in the normal $X\sim\mathcal{N}(\theta,1)$ case, if we pick an empty confidence interval with probability .01 and the interval $(x-2.054,x+2.054)$ with probability .99, we end up with an overall coverage probability of $$ \mathbb{P}_\theta(|X-\theta|
