You implement a form designer almost like a normal GUI. You have stuff you can drag (your widgets), you have stuff you can click (your buttons) and you have stuff you can select (your placed widgets) and that's really about it. Q: Now, how do you display a window in a GUI? A: You paint it, simple as that. Q: And how do you keep stuff inside that window? A: You check against the bounds of the "parent" object. You could almost say that a form designer is like a little game and you have a scene graph holding all your widgets, connected by parent-child-relations. Q: Then, how do you select stuff in a GUI? A: Check the current mouse position on-click against the bounds of all (near) widgets (a scene graph only helps here, like a quadtree). Q: How do you align widgets on a grid? A: For the grid alignment, let's have a simple example: Say your real resolution is 100px on the x-axis, but you want your grid to only have a resolution of 10px on x. Now say you move your widget by 28px in real resolution. To get the grid resolution, you simply divide by 10 , get 2.8 , round that, and finally move the widget 3 tiles on x. The rounding is the key here. only if the grid movement is >= ?.5 , you snap to the next tile. Otherwise you simple stay at the old one. Hope this can give you a general hint on how to start a form designer. Have fun. :) (PS: Don't know about any specific WinAPI/MFC functions/class to help you along, sorry.)
