Saving the position of a draggable div in rails

After making a div draggable, i would like, when the div is dropped, to pass to the controller the div's position so that it can be saved on to the database. My first idea would be to have an hidden form within the div, with 2 text fields (one for X and one for Y) which is kept updated via javascript and submitted on drop. However this sounds like a bit of a hack and is not an elegant solution. Has anybody encountered this before? Thank you.
