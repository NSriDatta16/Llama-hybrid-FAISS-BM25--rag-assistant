Clustering common words for objects

I am currently running experiments aiming to simulate information transfer between agents. Without going into too much irrelevant detail, following the conclusion of a simulation I am left with a csv file of agent ids and their 'terms' for resources A, B and C. Here is a sample of 6 lines: agent_id A B C 1 LJTHIA JNPHG FRMEAL 2 PDMLP JNPHG FRMEAL 3 IMKHR OEKL EVOUMLB 4 PDMLP PGMOS FRMEAL 5 PDMLP JNPHG EVOUMLB 6 RIMUBLU VTVHKZ ELS Based on this data, I want to create a cluster plot of agents with more 'similar' agents being clustered together. The current strategy I've taken (using R) is as follows: Set all terms as factors find a gower matrix run classical multidimensional scaling on the gower matrix (using cmdscale() ) with the intention of plotting the 3D data in 2D run kmeans() with the data and a predetermined k as input Plot the results The resulting plot can be seen below: Each cluster is supposed to represent different groups of agents that share common words or information thus aiming to show how clusters of information emerge when observing behavior of agents. Now my questions are: Does the current approach I've taken make sense? Would it be more accurate to run PCA, or even MCA, in order to map the similarities to a 2D space? Is there a more accurate way of finding similarities between agents based on common words? Thank you in advance!
