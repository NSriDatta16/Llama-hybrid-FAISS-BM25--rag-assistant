Is this an adequate example for simulation and modeling uncertainty in survival and hazard curve estimates?

I'm studying simulation and in particular uncertainty in survival curve estimates, by drawing from a distribution of parameters (for the Weibull distribution), using the variance-covariance matrix from the MASS package. In response to post How to generate simulation paths for Weibull distribution in R? , I've come up with the following example. My question is, is this an adequate example for simulating the Weibull distribution and in deriving survival and hazard curve estimates? I show the output plots below and the code at the bottom of this post. Code: library(survival) library(MASS) # Simulate survival data n $new_time new_time[i] $time), max(sfit$ time), length = 100) surv $surv))/diff(surv$ time) # Plot survival and hazard curves, and histogram of simulated survival times par(mfrow=c(1,3)) plot(surv, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Survival Probability", main = "Survival Function") plot(surv $time[-1], haz, type = "l",xlab = "Time", ylab = "Hazard Function", main = "Hazard Function") hist(data$ new_time, breaks = 20, xlab = "Survival Time", ylab = "Frequency", main = "Simulated Survival Times") # Calculate average hazard rate per time period haz_by_time
