A linear regression relates proportions $p$ linearly to predictors $x_1, x_2, \dots$: $$ p = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots $$ while a logistic regression relates log-odds linearly to $x_1, x_2, \dots$: $$ \log (p/(1-p)) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2 + \dots $$ Now, if you want to predict log-odds using linear regression (which is quite unnatural), you would clearly need to apply the logit function on predictions $\hat p$ from the linear regression, not the inverse logit as you propose. So my clear answer is "no, you should not use your formula".
