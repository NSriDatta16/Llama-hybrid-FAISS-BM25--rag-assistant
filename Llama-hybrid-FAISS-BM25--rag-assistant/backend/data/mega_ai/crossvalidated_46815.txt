Thompson sampling with multivariate posterior distribution

I'm implementing Thompson sampling for a multi armed bandit problem (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling ). The underlying Bayesian model is a Bayesian Linear Regression, which has a conjugate Normal-inverse gamma (NIG) prior for the regression coefficients and the standard error. This NIG distribution is multivariate over the regression coefficients, but I'm not sure how this fits into the Thompson sampling paradigm. Traditionally, you are supposed to sample from the posterior distribution and choose the sample that maximizes the expected reward (i.e. if you are running a beta-binomial model describing the probability of success, then you chose the highest sample from the beta distributions). But, with a multivariate sample, I'm not really sure how to choose the sample that maximizes the expected reward. Wondering if anyone who's familiar with Thompson sampling or multi-armed bandits could help. Thanks!
