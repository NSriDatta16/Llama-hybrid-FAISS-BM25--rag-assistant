The other reply is correct. In the example you place a 'project' is just another folder. However, let me expand it in the Codesion context as you mentioned Codesion.: You can have one Codesion Project, with one Repository.... so you can have: (CompanyProjectX is just a folder here) MyCodesionProjectRepo | |\-> CompanyProjectA | \trunk \branches \tags |\-> CompanyProjectB | \trunk \branches \tags Or you can also have 2 Codesion Projects (ea with it's own repo): MyCodesionProjectRepoA | \trunk \branches \tags MyCodesionProjectRepoB | \trunk \branches \tags As recommended by the other answer, it's probably better to create a repository (or Codesion Project) per your company/organization projects cheers!
