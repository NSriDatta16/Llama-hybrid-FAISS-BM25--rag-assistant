TL;DR It may make sense. It depends on what kind of autocorrelation you have. Trend is one possible type of autocorrelation, but there are also others. You may want to take a look at arima . I recommend the excellent free online book Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed.) by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman , here in particular the chapter on ARIMA models . Longer version Your autocorrelation may indeed come from a trend: Note the linearly but slowly dropping ACF plot that, and the PACF plot that is essentially insignificant. This combination is characteristic for a globally trended time series. (Think about why a global trend would yield this ACF/PACF pattern.) In such a case, it makes sense to just include time as a linear covariate. Here are the residuals: There is no remaining autocorrelation in the residuals. Everything is good. However , your time series may have a non-trend autocorrelation structure. For instance, an AR(1) series with a high AR term of 0.8: Note how if the series is at a certain level, it tends to stay at that level, but there is no overall trend visible. Here, the ACF drops much more quickly to insigficance. If we fit a trend to this series, we get residuals and ACF/PACF plots that look pretty much like the original series. Which is not surprising, since the fitted trend is essentially flat - because there is no trend in this series. However, suppose we fit a correctly specified AR(1) model, essentially regressing $y_t$ on $y_{t-1}$ . We get white noise, which is good: R code set.seed(1) nn
