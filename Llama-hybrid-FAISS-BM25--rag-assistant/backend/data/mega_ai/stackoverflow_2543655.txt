I'd go with UiBinder all the way - that way you'll get most from the benefits of UiBinder (like nice CSS handling/minification/obfuscation). And the rewrite will be a good chance to look at the older code and do some refactoring - like reorganizing the Widgets to be more lightweight (more pure HTML via UiBinder, less Widgets, but don't go overboard ;)), maybe introducing History support, i18n, etc. I had the same dilemma some time ago and took the full UiBinder approach and don't regret it ;) It makes it easier to work with the code too - since the UI code is consistent.
