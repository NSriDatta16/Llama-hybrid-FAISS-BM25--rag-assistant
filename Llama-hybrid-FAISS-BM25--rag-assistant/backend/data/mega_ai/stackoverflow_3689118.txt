Should I care that passing in a class representation of an XML settings file violates the law of demeter?

I'm using a tool to automatically generate a class representation of a hierarchically organized XML file. The XML file is a settings file my app need to be able to access (read-only). If I pass in the top-level node (e.g., AppSettings ) to a class that needs to access one or more settings, I can easily end up with code that looks something like this: var windowSize = AppSettings.Views.Windows.Dashboard.Size; This seems to be a serious violation of the Law of Demeter, but I'm wondering if I should care. I could take great pains to only pass in the exact settings I need for each class, but I'm having trouble seeing how those multiple dots are going to hurt me in this case. Is tightly coupling my code to my XML file format likely to create maintenance issues or other problems in the future, or is this an example where it makes sense to not religiously follow an OOP design principle?
