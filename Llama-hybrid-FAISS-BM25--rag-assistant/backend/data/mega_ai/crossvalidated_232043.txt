I'm not aware of any special performance measures for random forests, and I certainly see all manner of performance measures applied to them in the wild. I'm also not aware of any reason why random forests would need special treatment in this regard. Generally, it's a good idea to use the objective function implied by your model as your performance metric. Bit random forests don't really have a unified objective function, being an ensemble of greedy decision trees. The underlying trees usually use Gini impurity or entropy as the splitting criterion, but these are not the same thing as their accuracy-measuring counterparts, so any similarity is purely spiritual. So until someone smarter than me comes along with a different answer, my recommendation is to use what you're comfortable with and what makes sense for your problem.
