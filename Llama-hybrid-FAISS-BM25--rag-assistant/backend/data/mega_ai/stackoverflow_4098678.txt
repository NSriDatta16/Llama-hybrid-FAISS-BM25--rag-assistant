Average Inter-Keypress time when typing

I have tried to google for answers to this, but perhaps there isn't widely available research or perhaps I'm not using the right terms. Basically, I would like to have some idea as to the average time it takes between key presses when typing. The reason I want to know this is I'm working on a fuzzy search that would be used in a drop down. There are some things we can do to improve accuracy in our results but they would result in slower speed. However, if such a speed would still be below a reasonable threshold for inter-keypress times, it makes sense to implement the change. Any help would be appreciated.
