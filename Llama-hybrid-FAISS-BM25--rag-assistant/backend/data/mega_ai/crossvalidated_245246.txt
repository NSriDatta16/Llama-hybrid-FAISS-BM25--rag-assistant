This sounds like pseudostatistical gibberish to me. It may be that what he has in mind is the beta-binomial distribution , which is a way to account for greater variability in the response than 'ought' to occur with a binomial, but it's hard to say. The beta-binomial distribution would not be familiar to someone who has only taken a couple of applied statistics classes, but should not be exotic to a statistics professor. The rest of his argument sounds like a Dunning-Kruger effect to me. That is where someone knows just a little bit about a topic, but is unaware of the breadth and depth of the issues or the potential caveats and complications, and therefore thinks that the topic is easy and obvious. The idea that the best way to forecast the election is to build one simple logistic regression model with the state polls is strikingly ignorant.
