Compare in-pairs differences to between-pairs differences

I have some numerical data which comes in pairs. I need to test the hypothesis that values inside pairs are more similar to each other, than to other values in the sample. Is there a test for this?.. What I came up with is calculating differences in each pair and then taking variance of this sample. Then move second values in each pair, so that all pairs are disrupted and the values are paired to a wrong value. Then take the variance of differences. And do this until all such shifts without returning to the original pairs are performed. Then compare this "sample" of variances to the original "true" variance using t-test/wilcoxon test. Is this a statistically correct procedure? EDIT: Example data: 0.225610 0.512543 0.301496 0.414367 0.451774 0.406694 0.102956 0.220093 0.365923 0.463573 0.328177 0.318119 0.156525 0.281603 0.569386 0.259615 0.409145 0.380789 0.346699 0.184932 0.148997 0.256125 0.196723 0.241247 0.164317 0.255147 0.323110 0.268701 0.470532 0.426732 0.491121 0.674537 0.417971 0.358050 0.562317 0.481768 0.355106 0.558749 0.574543 0.158430 0.234307 0.482079 0.578360 0.092736 My hypothesis is that on average values in each pair are more similar to each other, than to values in other pairs. What I am doing now, is shifting all values in the second column by one, calculate differences and then take the variance of these differences. Then I repeat the procedure, but shift by 2, etc. Then compare this set of artificial variances to the variance of original data. (Order in pairs doesn't matter)
