Bayesian model predictions

I am using an exponential decay model for the prediction of chemical exposures. y[i] is measured exposure, and y_new[i] is a prediction for x_new. I expect that new predictions will have exponential decay. model { for( i in 1 : Ndata ) { y[i] ~ dnorm( beta0*exp(beta1*x[i]) , tau ) y_new[i] ~ dnorm( beta0*exp(beta1*x_new[i]) , tau ) } beta0 ~ dunif( 0 , 200000) beta1 ~ dunif(-1.0E+4,0) tau However, some predictions are negative numbers. How is that possible? Shouldn't all predictions for exponential decay be positive? How to explain negative values, if in reality, they are not possible. I appreciate any help.
