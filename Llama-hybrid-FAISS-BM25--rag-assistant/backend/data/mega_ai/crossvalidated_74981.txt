The major difference between time series data and cross-section data is that the former focuses on results gained over an extended period of time, often within a small area, whilst the latter focuses on the information received from surveys and opinions at a particular time, in various locations, depending on the information sought. Moreover, gdp in one time lag is likely to be dependent on the next time lag and so on. In a cross sectional point of view, you ignore this correlation. For your problem, I guess you will be trying to see how gdp is being affected by employment over time so that you can also estimate the future scenario.
