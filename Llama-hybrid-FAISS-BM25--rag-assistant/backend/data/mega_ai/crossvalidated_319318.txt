The use of an informative prior implies, of course, that you have information from which to be informed. For a similar problem, where I had binary outcome data, I happened to have twenty years of success/failure data leading up to the time period of my predictor variables. As it appeared to be relatively stable, I used the center of location of that two decades of data, but radically increased its variance. My failure rate, up to when predictor variables became available, was about 1 in 1000. Of course, I had hundreds of thousands of observations so I could make a very good estimate of the center with a very tight variance, but that could have overwhelmed the predictors if they were far away from the group mean. So, I placed a Beta(1,999) distribution as my informative prior density for the failure rate. You are doing something slightly different, but if you do have outside data on the incidence of the different values of the dependent variable, or if you want to use an empirical prior, then you could estimate the rate by adding significantly to the variance. You cannot use a beta distribution because of the use of logistic regression You will also need to rescale the probabilities into log-odds and reverse engineer the prior. So that, as in my example with a binary case, $$\log(.001)-\log(.999)=log(p)-log(1-p)=m\bar{x}+b=-2.9996$$ if you treat treated the various predictors as independent. Now there is a center of location. $b$ should probably be some large diffuse value such as $\mathcal{N}(0,1000^2)$ and $m$ needs adjusted for $\bar{x}$. You want the prior on $m$ to be informative as to within the ranges you would consider surprising, but diffuse enough that the prior does not control the outcome. Just a note, for my own project, I did not use logistic regression. There were enough violations of assumptions that I chose to use a math trick and solve it a different way than logistic regression. My own problem had a convenient natural structure that let me sneak around your headache. Avoid improper priors, they may not integrate to unity. As to the cut-off points, you have an ordering of variables, where $p_1$ percent are in category one, $p_2$ percent are in category 2 and so forth. Your cut-off should be centered around where those log probabilities actually sit at in aggregate. Same as above, but with more parameters. A cutoff $c_2$ sits at the boundary between category 2 and category 3 and sits at the point $p_1+p_2$.
