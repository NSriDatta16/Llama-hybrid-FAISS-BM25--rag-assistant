Is there a difference between a good development video card and general gaming video cards?

For reference, this would be for Visual Studio 2008 with a fair amount of WinForms working with the VS Designer. Given the same price bracket, would there be certain specs you look for in a development rig vs what one would get for a gaming machine? Edit: The reason I ask is on my laptop that I can run low-mid end games decently on, there's still a fair amount of time redrawing when switching between apps sometimes.(I keep about 20 tabs open average on a browser and have like 10-15 apps open at a time), and working with the VS designer on things like a TableLayoutPanel takes up to 10-15 seconds for changes and so forth. I'd like a really smooth experience.
