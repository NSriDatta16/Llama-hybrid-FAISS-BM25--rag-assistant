The information conveyed by the PR curve seems non-clear at first. The secret lies in reading it on both axis at the same time. It is widely used in Information Retrieval systems where it is important to return as much as relevant & precise information from some database given a query. Now, how each point is computed? There is always a parameter (it is not x axis, nor y axis!) whose value corresponds to a point on the curve (e.g. threshold). This threshold defines a cutoff point for a ranked list. For example, above the cutoff will be returned to user, below won't be shown. Based on what falls in the two groups (True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives and False Negatives), you compute Precision and Recall. For each parameter you compute Precision and Recall.
