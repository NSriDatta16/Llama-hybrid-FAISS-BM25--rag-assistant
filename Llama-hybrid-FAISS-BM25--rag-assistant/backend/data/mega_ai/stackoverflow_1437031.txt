I'm using win7 64 bit with TD.NET 2.22.246 and it works just fine. The only other Visual Studio runners exists are mstest (run only as 32 bit process) and TestMatrix (not free) To check if it's a 64 bit issue you can build the test project as x86 and run the tests with TD.NET. In that case TD.NET will run as 32 bit process - You can verify it using the Task Manager and looking at ProcessInvocation.exe If the tests run than its 64 bit issue. if it fails than maybe the problem is somewhere else. Are you using other tools in your tests? coverage, mocking etc, maybe the problem is in other place?
