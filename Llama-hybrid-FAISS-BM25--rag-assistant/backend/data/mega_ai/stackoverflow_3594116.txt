Do you preload the spritesheets using CCTextureCache's addImage? If not, you'll notice a lag whenever you switch to a spritesheet for the first time. Also, unless your spritesheets are so big that you can't fit all animations into a 1024x1024 texture you should simply put all of the sprites into one sheet, instead of using multiple like for example four 256x256 spritesheets. You hardly gain anything from doing that, at worst you lose the benefit of spritesheets because as soon as you render from two different spritesheets it'll be two draw calls instead of one. Texture atlases are not for organizing your animations but to keep as much as possible of all of your graphics into as few as possible textures.
