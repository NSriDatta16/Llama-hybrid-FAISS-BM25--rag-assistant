That guy's algorithm is interesting, but it needs to be pointed out that it does require O(log n) extra bits of space to traverse a binary tree with n nodes. Space requirements must be measured in bits, not bytes -- usually they collapse into the same thing when Big Oh notation is used, but cases like this point out why it's important to make the distinction. To see this, ask how a tree with more than 2^32-1 nodes can be traversed using a single integer of storage (on a 32-bit platform).
