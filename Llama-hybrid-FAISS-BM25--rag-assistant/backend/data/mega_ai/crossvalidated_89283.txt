What's the best way to visualize the effects of categories & their prevalence in logistic regression?

I need to present information about the main predictors of a candidate's votes using a public opinion survey data. I have run a logistic regression using all the variables that I care about, but I can't find a good way to present this information. My client doesn't care about the size of the effect only, but about the interaction between the size of the effect and the size of the population with such attribute. How can I deal with that in a graph? Any suggestions? Here is an example: The $\beta$ of variable SEX (Male=1) when the dependent variable is Vote/Not in a candidate is 2.3, which is a big number after having been exponentiated and treated as odds ratio or probability. However, the society in which this survey was run only had 30% men. Therefore, although man supported this candidate quite a lot, their numbers are insignificant for a candidate trying to win a majoritarian election.
