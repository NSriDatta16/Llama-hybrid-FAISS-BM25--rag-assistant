Howto Select rows that match the intersection of multiple rows in other tables in MYSQL?

It seems complicated (and probably it is). But i cant imagine how to solve this. There are tables: COMPANIES id | name 1 | Google 2 | Samsung 3 | Microsoft PARAGRAPHS id | name 1 | Header 2 | Body 3 | Footer TAGS id | tag 1 | Internet 2 | Softwate COMPANIES_VS_TAGS id | company_id | tag_id 1 | 1 | 1 2 | 2 | 2 3 | 3 | 1 4 | 3 | 2 PARAGRAPHS_VS_TAGS id | paragraph_id | tag_id 1 | 2 | 1 1 | 2 | 2 I need to select all companies, that belongs to [any_number] of tags that belongs to paragraph by logical AND . So, in the example above, the Body paragraph should output the only company "Microsoft". ADD: I can use only WHERE and SubQueries : this is the limitation of CMS i have to use.
