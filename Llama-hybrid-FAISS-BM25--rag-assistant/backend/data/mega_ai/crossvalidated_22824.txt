In my view, statistical inference is most important for a practitioner. Inference has two parts: 1) Estimation & 2) Hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing is important one. Since in estimation mostly a unique procedure, maximum likelihood estimation, followed and it is available most statistical package(so there is no confusion). Frequent practitioners questions are around significant testing of difference or causation analysis. Important hypothesis tests can be find in this link . Knowing about Linear models, GLM or in general statistical modelling is required for causation interpretation. I assume future of data analysis include Bayesian inference.
