You already know the anwsers to almost all you questions, Switch to InnoDB First check if you got InnoDB support. On your mysql server Execute the following query: SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_innodb'; if you get a value of 'YES' you can change every table you want to change with the following SQL Query: ALTER TABLE [tablename] ENGINE=InnoDB; (make a backup first) In future releases MySQL will switch to InnoDB as default storage engine. But because of legacy setup this haven't been changed
