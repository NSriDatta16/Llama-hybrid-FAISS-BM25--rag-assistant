It refers to the prediction you assign to each region when constructing the tree during training. In a classification task it could be the majority label of all examples in region A. In a regression task it could be the average of the true $y$ values of all examples in region A. Once you're done with training and applying the tree, all examples being allocated to A will be predicted as that predictive value, i.e. it determines $\hat{y}$ for all examples in region A. Here is a concrete example: if in a classification task during training region A contains 7 examples classified as "dog" and 3 example classified as "cat", then you would probably choose "dog" as predictive value of region A. Following that, when applying the model to test data or real data all examples being allocated to region A would be predicted as "dog".
