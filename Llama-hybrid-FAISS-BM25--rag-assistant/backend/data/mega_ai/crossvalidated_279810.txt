Significance Tests for mean of means

I have a metric which is calculated daily (e.g. Average Revenue per Day per User), so over 1 month this will yield 30 samples. I would like to test if the difference between experiment groups for this metric is statistically significant, but I'm not sure if I can since I would be testing the mean of 30 means. Do I have to treat those any differently with respect to statistical tests and can anyone include helpful links with supporting docs on the subject? (Edit) Example Experiment: Test if offering gift in game has impact on overall game revenue Cohorts: Control (no offer) Variant A (Offer free 10K coins once a day) Variant B (Offer option of free 5K coins or $2 purchase for 50K coins once a day) Target metric: Average Revenue per Day per User (ARPDAU). For example: Day 1 - $100 Rev / 20 Users = $5 ARPDAU Day 2 - $200 Rev / 50 Users = $4 ARPDAU Day 3 - $80 Rev / 80 Users = $1 ARPDAU ARPDAU Mean = $3.33
