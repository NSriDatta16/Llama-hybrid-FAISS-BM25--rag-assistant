Thanks Rubens Farias, My problem solved here.. Small Change in Code made it work.. Problem was I gave Justification property for Run Properties Instead Paragraph Properties. I Changed Code as Word.ParagraphProperties ParaProperties = new Word.ParagraphProperties() { ParagraphStyleId = new Word.ParagraphStyleId() { Val = Tbl.GetHashCode().ToString() } }; if (Tbl.HorizontalAlignment == HorizontalAlignment.Center) ParaProperties.Append(new Word.Justification() { Val = Word.JustificationValues.Center }); else if (Tbl.HorizontalAlignment == HorizontalAlignment.Right) ParaProperties.Append(new Word.Justification() { Val = Word.JustificationValues.Right }); else ParaProperties.Append(new Word.Justification() { Val = Word.JustificationValues.Left }); This Solved my Problem.. Once again Thanks for Rubens for your help, with which my mistake was Identified.
