My approach has been to use third party code for some core functionality. For example, I use Subsonic for my data access, Devexpress components for UI and Peter Blum Data Entry Suite for data entry and validation. Subsonic is open source, Devexpress Peter Blum's controls have source code available for an extra fee. It would be impossible for me to get the functionality of these control if I tried to write them myself. This approach allows me to focus on the custom functionality of my application without having to worry about how I will access the database or how I make an editable treelist that looks pretty. Sure I don't have a fully configured and working forum but I know that I'll be using a SQL database for my app and I won't have to try and get different data storage components to work together. I don't have a wiki but I know how to use the devexpress ui components and formatting and validating data entry is breeze with Peter Blum's controls. In other words, learn tools (and of course choose them carefully) that will speed development of all of your projects then you can focus on portions of your application that have to be customized. I'm not too concerned if it's open source or not as long as source code is available. If it's open source I donate to the project. If it's a commercial component I will pay a fair price. In any case, the tools help to make programming fun and the results have data integrity and are great looking. If I develop a wiki or forum I know that I can get them to work together seamlesslessly. Finally, all of the tools I have mentioned have been around for a long time and are written by outstanding developers with great reputations.
