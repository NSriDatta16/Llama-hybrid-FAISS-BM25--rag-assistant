This question was always in my mind when I started to learn deep learning. The answer is what I understood: In the training phase: actually, when we train our model it learns feature from images by updating filter weights i.e parameters through back-propagation. And this trained model learns to generalize feature of the input images. In testing phase: with the help of updated weights, now our model can understand (what image is this) the input image.
