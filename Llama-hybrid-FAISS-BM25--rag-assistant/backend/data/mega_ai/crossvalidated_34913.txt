A linear regression model could make sense here. R square is a reasonable measure of goodness of fit if the sample size is large relative to the number of parameters. If the number of parameters in the model is large R square can be deceptively high. Adjusted R square gives a better idea, Model fitting should not be based on individual p-values of the regression coefficients. Those p-value can depend on the other variables in the model. Stepwise selection procedures that penalize overfitting like AIC or BIC should be used. Narrowing down the choice of predictors based on knowledge of soccer is a very good idea. These are just a few basic principles. Modeling assumptions such as normal error terms and constant variance are important to check. There are also diagnostics that can be used to identify problems such as multicolinearity and individual or a small number of observations that have heavy influence on the model parameters. This can happen if there are outliers or point located in the x space that are called leverage points.
