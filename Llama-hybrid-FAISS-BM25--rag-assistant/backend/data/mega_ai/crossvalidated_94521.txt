How to interpret results if a reference category of a categorical variable in multivariable logistic regression is not significant?

I am trying to do a multivariable logistic regression and using a normal binomial logistic regression, using binomial variable X (coded 0 / 1 ) and Y (4 sub-categories). Unfortunately, the reference category was shown to be not significant. Should I then reject the null hypothesis for this variable? Cat., Sig., Exp(B) Y, 1, .161 Y(1), .032, .226 Y(2), .106, .370 Y(3), .061, .309
