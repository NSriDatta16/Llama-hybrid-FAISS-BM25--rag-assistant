A Google search turned up this: http://www.nuff-respec.com/technology/cross-browser-cookies-with-flash , with a flash file that is accessed through js. I haven't tried this. I think it's not possible to use Flash-cookies without flash. There's also html5 local storage: http://diveintohtml5.ep.io/storage.html
