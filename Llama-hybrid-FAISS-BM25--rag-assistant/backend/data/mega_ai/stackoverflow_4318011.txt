Manually rendering django template with date filter

I've got the template to render manually, but not the dates with a filter. Is there a way of doing this without formatting the dates before I put them in the context? Here is the code: t= This is to notify you that you are booked on the course {{title}} that starts on {{start_date|date:"F j, Y"}} at {{start|time}} and is being held at {{venue}}. c = {'startdate': datetime.datetime(2010, 12, 1, 9, 0), 'enddate': datetime.datetime(2010, 12, 1, 12, 0), 'has_cpd': False, 'title': 'Course 1', 'closes': None, 'creator': 1L, 'venue': 'Venue for Course 1', 'summary': 'Course 1 Summary', 'tags': '', 'attachment': , 'organiser': 3L, 'id': 1L, 'opens': datetime.datetime(2010, 11, 30, 20, 1, 50, 951490), 'venue_map': None} t.render(c) This gives the output: This is to notify you that you are booked on the course Course 1 that starts on at and is being held at Venue for Course 1. Why don't the dates show up?
