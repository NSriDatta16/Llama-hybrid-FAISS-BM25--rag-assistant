Markov Chains: Periodicity and Ergodicity

I found the dynamical system definition of ergodicity to be very intuitive: $T$, a measure preserving transformation wrt $(\Omega,\mu)$ is ergodic wrt $\mu$ if for all $A \subset \Omega$, $T^{-1}A = A$ means $\mu(A) = \{0,1\}$. When I approach Markov chains, my reading is that we have to consider the measure space for all possible sequences, under measure from Kolmogorov's Extension, $$(\Omega^{\mathbb{N}}, \mu^{\mathbb{N}})$$ And take transformation $T$ to be a shift of a single step, ie. $$T(x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots) = (x_2,x_3,\ldots)$$ But lots of definitions for ergodic markov chains (including the one on Wikipedia ) uses aperiodicity. Where does periodicity come in? Is aperiodicity a necessary and sufficient condition for the Markov Chain to be ergodic? Can't a Markov chain be periodic and ergodic? Eg. Consider the 2 state system $p_x(y) = 1, p_y(x)=1$
