This is not a direct answer to your question, but I don't understand how the set-up your teacher suggests, i.e. first applying PCA then looking for clusters, makes sense: If the dataset has a clustered structure, the dimensional reduction obtained through PCA is not guaranteed to respect this structure whatsoever. In your figures, PC1 and PC2 will only give you the variables (or linear combinations of variables) that capture the most variation in the data. Put differently: if you hypothesise from the onset that the dataset contains clusters, the most important features are clearly the ones that discriminate between clusters, which, in general do not coincide with the directions of great variations in the whole dataset. In such a scenario what makes more sense is to first cluster (without any dimensionality reduction) and then perform LDA or XCA , or something similar that preserves the class/cluster discriminatory information.
