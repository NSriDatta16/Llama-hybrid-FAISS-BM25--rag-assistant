WARNING: This is compatibility code for very old versions of Safari and Chrome. Modern browsers all support the FileReader API; here's one tutorial: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications This code is now only useful if for some reason you have a need to support Safari 5 and older, or Chrome 6 and older. One possibility is to use the method used in SwellJS : Use like so: The input element can be styled to have opacity: 0 and positioned (absolutely) over an element that accepts uploads. The entire form can be placed inside an iframe for "pseudo-Ajax" like behavior. And the upload element can be a layer hidden until something is dragged over it. Such an iframe would look like: Things can be dragged and dropped here! This should only be done when Safari or Chrome is detected (since other browsers don't support drag-and-drop onto elements), and can be used in combination with the HTML5 drop event for Firefox 3.6+. I can't tell if this is the method Gmail uses, but it certainly works about as well.
