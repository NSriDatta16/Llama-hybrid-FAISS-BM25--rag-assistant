Assuming that std::vector is the only container you're acquainted with at this point, and that you haven't gotten to std::pair yet, I suggest the following: you add a std::vector word_count in your std::cin while-loop, you check if the current word is present in word_input . If it is not, you push_back the word and push_back a 1 in word_count . If there already is an entry for the current word at some index i in word_input , you increment word_count at this index i . Thus every distinct word you input only appears once in word_input , with the number of times it was input being managed in word_count . for output, step through word_input and word_count in parallel and output the word count for every word. Done. But all this gets much simpler and more elegant with a std::map . Keep reading! :-)
