Maybe your ZeroMatrix uses the typical storage scheme for Sparse Matrices: store every non-zero value in a linked list. If that is the case, it is quite understandable why it performs worse than a typical array-based storage-scheme: because it needs to run thru the linked list once for every operation you perform. In that case you can maybe speed the process up by using a matrix-multiply-algorithm that accounts for having a sparse-matrix. If this is not the case please post minimal but complete code so we can play with it. here is one of the possibilities for multiplying sparse matrices efficiently: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/cacm/node9.html
