My suggestion would be to use a stored procedure. You can setup the stored procedure parameter input from the SQLDataSource attached to the Gridview. I would discourage use of direct SQL select statement in your datasource, as IMHO calling a stored procedure with parameter specification is more secure. Hope this helps, Sid
