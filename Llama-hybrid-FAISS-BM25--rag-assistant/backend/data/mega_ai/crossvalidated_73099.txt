Is there any way to model this grouping process?

I've been working on this problem for three days now, and it doesn't seem that it can be solved using pure thinking. Maybe there is some distribution that can model this but I couldn't find any solution till now. This is the process I'm trying to model: I have $K$ points randomly dispersed in an area of radius $R$ using 2D-poisson random variable. I start by putting the first point in a group. Then, the distance $d$ between the first and the second points is found. If this distance is larger than a certain threshold ($Dth$) then the second point will be put in the same group as the first point. Otherwise, the second point will be put in a group alone. The process continues until the last point $K$. A point will be put in a group if it has its distance from all the points in that group larger than $Dth$. I've derived $P(d>Dth)$ which is the probability that two points have a distance between them larger than $Dth$, so let's denote it by $p$, and $P(d What I want to find is either the average number of groups resulting given $K$ points (don't care about the radius $R$ because it is incorporated in the given probabilities) or the average number of points per group given $K$.
