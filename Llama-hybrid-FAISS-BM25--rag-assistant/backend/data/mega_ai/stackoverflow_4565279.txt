Can't get rid of compiler warnings for primitiveValue accessors in transient property getter impls

I've implemented a transient property as below on one of the models in my app. It is declared in the model design as a transient property with undefined type. @property (nonatomic, readonly) NSNumberFormatter *currencyFmt; The current (warning-free) impl of this accessor is: - (NSNumberFormatter *) currencyFmt { [self willAccessValueForKey:@"currencyFmt"]; NSNumberFormatter *fmt = [self primitiveValueForKey:@"currencyFmt"]; [self didAccessValueForKey:@"currencyFmt"]; if (fmt == nil) { fmt = [[[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init] autorelease]; [fmt setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle]; [fmt setLocale:[self localeObject]]; [self setPrimitiveValue:fmt forKey:@"currencyFmt"]; } return fmt; } The call to primitiveValueForKey: is the problem here, since the documentation specifically warns against using this version of the primitive lookup: You are strongly encouraged to use the dynamically-generated accessors rather than using this method directly (for example, primitiveName: instead of primitiveValueForKey:@"name"). The dynamic accessors are much more efficient, and allow for compile-time checking. The problem is that if I try to use primitiveCurrencyFmt instead of primitiveValueForKey:@"currencyFmt" , I get a compiler warning saying that the object may not respond to that selector. Everything works fine at runtime if I just ignore this warning, but warnings are horrible and I don't want to commit any code that has them in there. I tried declaring the property with @dynamic and @synthesize at the top of the file and nothing seems to help. What do I need to do to use the recommended dynamic accessors without generating these warnings? Any help much appreciated.
