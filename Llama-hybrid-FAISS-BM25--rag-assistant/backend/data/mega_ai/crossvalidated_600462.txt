Changing the prior probability (class ratio) only affects the intercept of a standard logistic regression model. Thus, it is a monotonic transformation of the log-odds. The logistic function is monotonic, so this also represents a monotonic function of the predicted probability values. Monotonic functions preserve order, and AUC only cares about order. Thus, the AUC does not change. That you achieve the exact same AUC is slightly surprising for slightly different data sets (due to the over/under-sampling), but that is the gist.
