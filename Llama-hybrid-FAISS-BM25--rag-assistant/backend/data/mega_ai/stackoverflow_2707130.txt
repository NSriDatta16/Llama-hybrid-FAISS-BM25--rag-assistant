You definitely need a solid math background: calculus, linear algebra, signal processing, probability and statistics. You also need to understand what specific problems are studied in computer vision: recognizing an image of a particular object, recognizing a general class of objects ("cars"), detecting whether an object is present in an image, locating an object in an image, tracking moving objects in video, reconstructing a 3D object or scene from an image or a set of images, etc. I was once told by a professor of a good way to get into a new field. Go to the library, find the main journal for that field, and start reading abstracts to papers, until you get the lingo. In the case of computer vision, good journals to look at are IEEE Transations of Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, aka PAMI, and International Journal of Computer Vision (aka IJCV). By the way, the two major conferences in computer vision are CVPR (IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) and ICCV (International Conference on Computer Vision). Topics that are related or heavily overlap with vision are image processing and machine learning. If there is a course in computer vision offered at your school, take it. Get some books on the subjects I've mentioned. If there is vision-related conference near where you live, sneak in and look at the posters. Oh, and Matlab is a great environment to play with image processing and vision algorithms.
