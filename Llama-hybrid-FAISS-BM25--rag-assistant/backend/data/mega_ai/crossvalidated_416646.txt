I'm not sure but I think contradictory definitions are in effect in the literature. Introduction to Statistical Learning basically formulates C as the total "budget" for errors (i.e. violations of margins). So higher C means more errors are allowed (which will lead to lower variance). However, in other implementations, for example this one cited by sklearn 's SVM docs -- https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/libsvm.pdf -- C is a multiplier of the sum of the errors in the cost function, so higher C means that errors are encouraged to be smaller (which will lead to higher variance).
