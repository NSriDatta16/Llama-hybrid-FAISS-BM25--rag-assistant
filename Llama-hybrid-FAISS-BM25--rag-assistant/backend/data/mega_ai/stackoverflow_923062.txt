I've found two primary limiters to Eclipse performance: Available RAM (2GB is a minimum on a Windows PC) Hard drive speed (I've had lots of issues with slow and/or highly fragmented drives.) Laptops have notoriously slow drives - and it's often compounded by the drive going into "power save" mode (thus spinning more slowly.) We also used to run Eclipse on top of ClearCase dynamic views....talk about a performance beast.... It may also be worth your time to trim down Eclipse (disabling unneeded plugins and the like.) Click "Help"->"Manage Configuration" to get to the interface where you can do this. The Eclipse distributions come with lots and lots of powerful tools - many of which most of us never use.
