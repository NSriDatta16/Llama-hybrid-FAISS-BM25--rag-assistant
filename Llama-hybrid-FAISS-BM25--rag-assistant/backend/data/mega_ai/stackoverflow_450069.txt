Detect which monitor shows the Window

I do have main application JFrame window which can include different components. I open a self implemented OnScreenKeyboard when the user select a editable textfield. The OSK is also a JFrame window. When the user drag the main window to another monitor, the OSK should also be shown on the same monitor. For this i have to detect the monitor the main JFrame is shown. I try to find a method in Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit() but was not able to find someting. Do you know how i can detect the monitor where a JFrame is shown? Java-Version 1.4 Windows XP Thanks
