How does a program look in memory?

How is a program (e.g. C or C++) arranged in computer memory? I kind of know a little about segments, variables etc, but basically I have no solid understanding of the entire structure. Since the in-memory structure may differ, let's assume a C++ console application on Windows. Some pointers to what I'm after specifically: Outline of a function, and how is it called? Each function has a stack frame, what does that contain and how is it arranged in memory? Function arguments and return values Global and local variables? const static variables? Thread local storage.. Links to tutorial-like material and such is welcome, but please no reference-style material assuming knowledge of assembler etc.
