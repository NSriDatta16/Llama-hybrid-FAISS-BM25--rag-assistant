My idea is, do both and see. It's direct to use AIC. Smaller the AIC, better the model. But one cannot depend on AIC and say such model is the best. So, if you have a pool of ARIMA models, take each and check on forecasting for the existing values and see which model predicts the closest to the existing time series data. Secondly check for the AIC as well and considering both, come to a good choice. There are no hard and fast rules. Just go for the model which predicts the best.
