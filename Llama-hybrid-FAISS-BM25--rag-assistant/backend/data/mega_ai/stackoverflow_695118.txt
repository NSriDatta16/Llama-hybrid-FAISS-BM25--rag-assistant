How should I estimate hardware requirements for SQL Server 2005 database?

We're being asked to spec out production database hardware for an ASP.NET web application that hasn't been built yet. The specs we need to determine are: Database CPU Database I/O Database RAM Here are the metrics I'm currently looking at: Estimated number of future hits to website - based on current IIS logs. Estimated worst-case peak loads to website. Estimated number of DB queries per page, on average. Number of servers in web farm that will be hitting database. Cache polling traffic from database (using SqlCacheDependency). Estimated data cache misses. Estimated number of daily database transactions. Maximum acceptable page render time. Any other metrics we should be taking into account? Also, once we have all those metrics in place, how do they translate into hardware requirements?
