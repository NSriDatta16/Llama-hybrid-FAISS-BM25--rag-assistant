Using Semantic MediaWiki for tabular data

Am I completely off-track to think about using Semantic MediaWiki to store (and organise, report on, etc.) 'tabular' data such as financial transactions or weather readings that would usually live in a spreadsheet or database? It seems that one would need a separate, tiny, page for each tuple; but then, that's by design and perhaps it's perfectly okay. I ask, simply because SMW seems like such a quick and easy way to get a collaborative data repository up and running.
