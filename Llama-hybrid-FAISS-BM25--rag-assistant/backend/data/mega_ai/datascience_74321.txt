As per the documentation , whenever the transformer expects a 1D array as input, the columns were specified as a string ("xxx"). For the transformers which expects 2D data, we need to specify the column as a list of strings (["xxx"]). so the code below will work. ## Important: i have passed the columns a string to CV and list of columns to OHE transformer=ct(transformers=[('review_counts',cv(),'verified_reviews'), ('variation_dummies', ohe(),['variation']) ],remainder='passthrough') Credit goes to Another man who helped me on this.
