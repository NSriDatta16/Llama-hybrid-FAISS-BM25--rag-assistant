Prediction with very less data

Here is a question I am struggling with Training data: start = "2013-01-01" end = "2013-01-01" temp = [24, 34.38, 34.36, 34.74, 35.26, 35.23, 35.29, 35.64, 36.02, 36.1, 36.98, 37.01, 36.75, 36.01, 35.66, 34.72, 33.9, 32.62, 31.51, 30.73, 29.5, 26.94, 25.47, 23.84, 22.55] Explanation: Above is the training data of temperature of a room for a single day. Predict for next 2 days. Visualization of above temperature series There is a same question (with some more info) at this link My Question: How to solve this question ? What model should be used for such a question ? My thoughts: It looks like time series model. But to use any time series model training data should have trend and seasonality which does not seems to be there (as seen in the above visualization). One can try linear/non-linear regression models by making on input feature(s) (eg. depicting hour of day starting with 0 to 23) but that would mean the model would predict same set of temperatures every day. Decision tree with input feature(s) (eg. depicting hour of day starting with 0 to 23) but decision tree is to big model for such small dataset it may over fit. Thanks in advance.
