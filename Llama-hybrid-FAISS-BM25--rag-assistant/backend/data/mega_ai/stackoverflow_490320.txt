When calculating the median of a group of numbers, you can use an algorithm very similar to quicksort. You partition around a number, and all the bigger ones go to one side, and all the smaller ones go the other side. Then you throw away one side and recursively calculate the median of the larger side. This takes O(n^2) in the worst case, but is pretty fast (O(n) with a low constant) in the average case. You can get guaranteed worst-case O(n) performance, with a constant of about 40. This is called the median of medians algorithm . In practice, you would never use this.
