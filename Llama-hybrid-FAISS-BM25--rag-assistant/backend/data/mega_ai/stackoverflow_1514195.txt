I decided that only the current cells background color need to change and began using the EditControl of the DataGridViewCell. In order to capture this, I had to grab the EditControl (Type DataGridViewTextBoxEditingContorl) on the DataGridView event "EditControlShowing" and associate the cells EditControl with a local form variable, then add a handler to the TextChagned event (since the Cells TextChanged doesn't occur until after editing is complete). (First procedure). After doing so, I'm able to change the color of the cell by changing the EditControls BackColor, which is changed immediately. (Second procedure) I have to release the EditControl on the DataGridViews CellEndEdit event in order to re-use my private variable. (Third procedure) I haven't tested attempting to change the row, due to a change in usage, but it seems to work just fine. I hope this helps anyone with a similar issue. If there are more efficient ways of doing this, please let me know! Private EditingControl As DataGridViewTextBoxEditingControl Private Sub dgvMain_EditingControlShowing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewEditingControlShowingEventArgs) Handles dgvMain.EditingControlShowing If TypeOf (e.Control) Is DataGridViewTextBoxEditingControl Then EditingControl = DirectCast(e.Control, DataGridViewTextBoxEditingControl) If DirectCast(e.Control, DataGridViewTextBoxEditingControl).EditingControlDataGridView.CurrentCell.OwningColumn Is PartNumber Then AddHandler EditingControl.TextChanged, AddressOf EditingControl_TextChanged End If End If End Sub Private Sub Error_Cell(ByVal [Error] As Boolean) If [Error] Then If EditingControl IsNot Nothing Then EditingControl.BackColor = Color.Red Else If EditingControl IsNot Nothing Then EditingControl.BackColor = Color.Empty End If Me.dgvMain.Refresh() End Sub Private Sub dgvMain_CellEndEdit(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellEventArgs) Handles dgvMain.CellEndEdit If EditingControl IsNot Nothing Then RemoveHandler EditingControl.TextChanged, AddressOf EditingControl_TextChanged End If EditingControl = Nothing End Sub Note: A lot of the steps that I have inside of the If/Then's have been removed to protect the innocent, otherwise, they would be inline when possible.
