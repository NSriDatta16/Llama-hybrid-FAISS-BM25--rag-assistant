Doubling binary digits

How to double a number of binary digits in an integer? For example, if bin(x)="1001" then bin(y) must be "11000011". Is there any smart and fast algorithm ? UPDATE: Here is an elegant solution: ''.join([''.join(i) for i in zip(X,X)]) where X is bin(int_x)[2:] However, I am interested in a more faster way and for the integers of any size. Maybe an arithmetical transformation should help.
