This looks like a proper task for Doc2Vec , which is an algorithm to build paragraph embeddings. For a nice implementation with usage examples you can try out gensim . Other options can be using word2vec and using vector averaging or sum to build sentence vectors (look at this ). For more approaches have a look at these two tutorials where you can see how to implement LSA, LDA, TFIDF: https://nlpforhackers.io/topic-modeling/ https://medium.com/mlreview/topic-modeling-with-scikit-learn-e80d33668730
