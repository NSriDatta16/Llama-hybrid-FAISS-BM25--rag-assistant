Your CI models should be organized to reflect your domain, so in the case of cities, countries, companies and such, each are different entities and deserve a seperate model. More files does not mean it is less maintainable. As for autosuggest, your model simply needs to deliver the data to a controller that will be called using Ajax. You can do the json_encoding of the data stream in the model or the controller, I prefer to use the controller. So eventually yoiu hopefully have a single autosuggest plugin in the front-end that simply calls different controller URLs. These controllers know which model to use to get the autosuggest data. This is a clean seperation of duties, and maintainable.
