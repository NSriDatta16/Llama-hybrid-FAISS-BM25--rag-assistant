NET: Best Practices/guidelines for dividing namespaces between files?

What should be the general guidelines/gotchas for dividing application code (App_Code) into separate files? I've found that over time, the original files do not match up well with how the namespace hierarchy evolves. How do I keep application code containers organized intuitively over time? What PURPOSE should the file divisions aim towards? Code portability? Separation of concerns? General functional context? Frequency of change? Should they strive for 1-1 relationship with classes? What are the implications of splitting the code into MANY smaller files vs consolidated into few files? I've often thought about this but never really reached any general conclusions that apply to all situations.
