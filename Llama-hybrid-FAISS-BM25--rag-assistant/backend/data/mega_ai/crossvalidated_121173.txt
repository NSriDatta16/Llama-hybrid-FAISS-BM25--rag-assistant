As I understand your question you have two issues. First, you are stratifying on a factor that has levels that may not exist in future datasets for which you want predictions. This is a sticky issue, even more so in stratified Cox models because you can't even easily average over strata effects as you can for fixed additive effects in a non-stratified Cox model. One possible approach is to get predicted survival curves for all strata and to do a time point by time point averaging of the multiple step functions. It is worth considering whether you expect the strata to engender enough non-proportional hazards to be worth handling them as strata instead of covariates. Your second issue is how to do the validation when a variable is not part of the covariate portion of the model. In the R rms package val.surv and calibrate functions this is done by getting calibration curves for survival probabilitiies at a specific time point. This takes strata into account and allows the stratification variable to contribution to predictive discrimination. If you want to not get any credit for predictive discrimination for having the strata then you can take the linear predictor $X_{test}\hat{\beta}_{train}$ and fit it as a single variable in the test sample, stratified by the new stratification factors, and judge how close to 1.0 is the coefficient of the linear predictor.
