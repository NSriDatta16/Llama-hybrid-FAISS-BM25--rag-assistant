With only the cycle consistency loss, generators would have no incentive to learn something different than the identity function. This way, if both generators would learn the identity function, then $x$ , $G1(x)$ , and $G2(G1(x))$ would be the same, meeting the incentives of the cycle consistency loss. The incentive to learn to generate images of each domain comes from the discriminators. In CycleGAN, each discriminator considers "real" images only the ones belonging to its domain. Therefore, for a Generator to generate acceptable images, they must belong to the domain accepted by the associated discriminator.
