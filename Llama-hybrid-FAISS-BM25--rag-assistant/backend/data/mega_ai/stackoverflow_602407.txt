Sorry, my answer is not computing related. A game tells a story, a great game tells a great story. So I would suggest to learn principles of storytelling. Not going as scholar as Aristotle's Poetics , I recommend more modern Story by Robert McKee . It focuses on movie making, but I am pretty sure that many of the concepts he develops can be applied to game making.
