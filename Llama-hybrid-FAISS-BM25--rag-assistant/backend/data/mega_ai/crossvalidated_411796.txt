Is the weighted average of growth rates equal to the growth rate of a weighted average?

More formally, is the following statement true? Let $\alpha$ be between 0 and 1. \begin{equation} \alpha\frac{(A_t - A_{t-1})}{A_{t-1}}\ + (1-\alpha)\frac{(B_t - B_{t-1})}{B_{t-1}}= \frac{(\alpha A_t + (1-\alpha)B_t)-(\alpha A_{t-1} + (1-\alpha)B_{t-1})}{(\alpha A_{t-1} + (1-\alpha)B_{t-1})} \end{equation} If it is not true, is it possible to determine how much they differ by?
