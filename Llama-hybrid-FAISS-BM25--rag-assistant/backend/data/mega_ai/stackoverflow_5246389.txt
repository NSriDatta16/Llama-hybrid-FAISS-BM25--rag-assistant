How could I compare C/C99 specifications to C++ specifications?

I need to verify that I can use unions a certain way. For C99, this answer is adequate: Union element alignment C99 - section 6.7.2.1 Structure and union specifiers (paragraph 14): A pointer to a union object, suitably converted, points to each of its members (or if a member is a bitfield, then to the unit in which it resides), and vice versa. Can someone please help me find the equivalent guarantee for C++? More generally, is there a good source for finding section/paragraph citations for C++ standards which are equivalent to a known feature in C? Thanks a lot.
