And let's end with a C++ reserved keyword story: When I just began learning C++ I had the worst teacher. One of his assignments was to write a "phone book". The design we were given was pretty simple, you have a phone book class which stores an array of classes called: friend. Back in the days I studied C++ we didn't had internet . So half of us had a compilation problem and the other half didn't. Our teacher just shrugged and said "No problem, half of you failed". It took us time to realize that the half that had the compilation problem were the half that the friend word was colored different in the IDE, the same color that the struct \ enum \ class keywords were colored. The other half called their class Friend (capital F).
