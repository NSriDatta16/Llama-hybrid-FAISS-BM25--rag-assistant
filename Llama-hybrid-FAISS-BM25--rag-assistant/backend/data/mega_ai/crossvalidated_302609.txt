Data Analysis for ranking data?

I want to compare three types of designs(A, B and C). After showing the images of three designs to each user, I have asked the user to rate/rank these 3 designs as Best, Worst and Average. Users response were: A-Worst, B-Average, C-Best and so on. For data analysis, when user rated a design as best, I gave a score of 3, for an average- score of 2, and for worst- score of 1. I asked each user 5 questions (criteria) to rank these designs. So data collected would look like as follows: How should I analyse this data (which test/procedure I should use)? Does usage of ANOVA valid here? Also, I would like to use Tukey's pair wise comparison along with ANOVA to find any significant difference among the means. I will be thankful for the responses.
