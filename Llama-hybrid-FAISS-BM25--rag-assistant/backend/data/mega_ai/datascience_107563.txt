When you look at word2vec model, it is different from other machine learning model and you cannot just call model on test data to get the output. You should do the following : Convert Test Data and assign same index to similar words as in train data Once Word 2 vec is trained on training data, use similar transformation on test data to convert sentences to vector Word2vec gives vector at word level, so if you have sentence you may want to take average of word2vec vectors for training your ML model Also, i don't think word2vec on whole data will lead to data leakage as you are not learning a classifier you are just doing feature engineering using word2vec. Once you pass data to training model like logistic regression, XGBoost etc you should worry about that.
