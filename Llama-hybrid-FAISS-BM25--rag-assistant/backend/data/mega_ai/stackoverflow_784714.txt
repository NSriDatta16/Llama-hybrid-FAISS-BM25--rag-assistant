What happens when dragging off screen?

I have an object that can be dragged around. Once the user's finger goes off screen and comes back, I loose the ability to drag the object. If the user then does another touch and drag, everything is fine. How can I get notified once the user's finger drags back onto the screen? Since touchesBegan doesn't fire, I don't get any notification. Here is my touchesMoved, which I call in the touchesBegan: - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; //stop object dragging at edge of screen if(location.x > 35){ myboject.center = location;} }
