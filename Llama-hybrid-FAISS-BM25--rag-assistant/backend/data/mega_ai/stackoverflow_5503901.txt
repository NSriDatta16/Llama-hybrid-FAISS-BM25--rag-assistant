How to correctly reference a function in an anonymous namespace

Consider this fragment of C++ code: namespace { void f() { } class A { void f() { ::f(); // VC++: error C2039: 'f' : is not a member of '`global namespace'' } }; } GCC compiles this just fine. Visual C++ 2008 fails to compile spitting out the C2039 error. Which one of these two compilers is correct here? Is there any way to reference that "global" f properly? Edit: Zack suggested to try and it works with both compilers. Looks a bit weird to me. namespace { void f() { } class A { void f(); }; } void A::f() { ::f(); }
