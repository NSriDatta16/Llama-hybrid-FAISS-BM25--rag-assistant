As your looking to take advantage of modern CPU architectures, it might be worth looking at the MonetDB project. The project has produced a lot of research around optimising databases for modern CPU architecture, using column stores and storing compressed pages in memory - only decompressing them in the CPU cache to get significant speeds for very large databases. This approach (column oriented storage + compression) and a more traditional query engine, perhaps based on the SQLite engine, should be a good basis for a project.
