You would probably have to use the size property of UIImage , triggered by UIImageView 's touchesBegan method. You can also use animations if you want the zoom effect to be smooth. Another option could be to place your UIImageView inside a UIScrollView , or use a UIWebView . Also, I suggest you take a look at the Three20 project. I think TTPhotoView supports zooming.
