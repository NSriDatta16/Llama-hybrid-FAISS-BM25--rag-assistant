ICEFaces 1.8 or 2.0?

I am currently developing an internal application for our company with the following requirements. Rich GUI but only basic HTML like components will be used. So component list is not a deciding factor. Fuzzy requirements which might change frequently during the implementation stage, and tight turn around times are the norm. Thus am looking for a Drag-&-Drop design The application will rarely be used (max once in a month) and the user base will not exceed 20. Time is a critical factor and thus I do not want to spend time on configuring and troubleshooting the framework. I will go for a easy to integrate solution. I did a brief research and decided on JSF with IceFaces. But am now confused about the version. If I go with 1.8, I get Drag-&-Drop designing (Netbeans 6.5) but I will be stuck with JSF 1.2 If I choose ICEFaces 2.0 I will have to manually design the UI which might take more time. Any suggestions on which version to choose?
