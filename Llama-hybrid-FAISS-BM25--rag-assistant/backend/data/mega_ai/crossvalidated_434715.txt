I will only try to address the specific question about getting a confidence interval for site 2 where the estimated proportion is 0. A nice method to construct a confidence interval with good coverage properties in low-sample cases (like for site 2) is that proposed by Agresti and Coull (1998) . Agresti and Caffo (2000) summarize that method here. You can effectively add two pseudo observations to the successes and failures. I think this has some intuition similar to what you stated -- you are sort of doing a weighted average of the result you get (0) and 1/2, with the weighting dictated by the sample size. Formally, following Agresti and Caffo (2000), the confidence interval would be given by: $$\tilde{p} \pm z_{0.025} \sqrt{\tilde{p}(1-\tilde{p})/\tilde{n}},$$ where $\tilde{n} = n + 4$ (and $n = 5$ for site 2), and $\tilde{p} = (X + 2) / (n + 4)$ , where $X$ is the number of successes (0 for site 2). Doing this you would get a confidence interval of $(0, 0.49)$ (I put a lower-limit at 0 for obvious reasons). See this link for more detailed discussion. Answering the more general question about what to do here -- producing a confidence interval for site 2 in the way I suggested is what I would do. There are probably some Bayesian approaches: suppose you observe site 1 and site 3, and these inform your prior expectation of the underlying proportion at site 2. But I think you have reason to expect your sites to have different underlying proportions (and actually this is a thing you are trying to assess), so I wouldn't actually go this route.
