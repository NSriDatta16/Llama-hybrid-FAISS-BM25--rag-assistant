How to use a multiple regression model with missing inputs?

I'd like to be able to use a multiple linear regression model even when I don't have all the independent variables. Ideally, I'd also be able to calculate some indicator of confidence too. Using the following example ( shamelessly borrowed ), we could imagine that I'd want to predict blood pressure without the "Age" factor. | Independent Variable | Regression Coefficient | T | P-value | |----------------------------|------------------------|-------|---------| | Intercept | 68.15 | 26.33 | 0.0001 | | BMI | 0.58 | 10.30 | 0.0001 | | Age | 0.65 | 20.22 | 0.0001 | | Male gender | 0.94 | 1.58 | 0.1133 | | Treatment for hypertension | 6.44 | 9.74 | 0.0001 | Omitting the age * 0.65 element of the regression equation would be the same as predicting for age 0, which has obvious problems. I suppose I could plug in the average age from the original dataset, but that would imply a greater precision than is true. I'm leaning towards a "brute force" approach, whereby I'd calculate a multiple regression for each combination of factors, then select the appropriate one depending on the available data. Whilst I think this would work, it seems inelegant and I'm sure there must be a better way. Is there a way to square this circle?
