Both models are quite different. As described in Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos, what you call the lagged model seems to be the autoregressive model (AR) . [...] an autoregressive model of order $p$ can be written as $$y_{t} = c + \phi_{1}y_{t-1} + \phi_{2}y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_{p}y_{t-p} + \varepsilon_{t}$$ where $\varepsilon_{t}$ is white noise. This is like a multiple regression but with lagged values of $y_t$ as predictors. We refer to this as an AR( $p$ ) model, an autoregressive model of order $p$ . It can be compared with the moving average (MA) model . Rather than using past values of the forecast variable in a regression, a moving average model uses past forecast errors in a regression-like model, $$y_{t} = c + \varepsilon_t + \theta_{1}\varepsilon_{t-1} + \theta_{2}\varepsilon_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_{q}\varepsilon_{t-q}$$ where $\varepsilon_t$ is white noise. We refer to this as an MA( $q$ ) model, a moving average model of order $q$ . Of course, we do not observe the values of $\varepsilon_t$ , so it is not really a regression in the usual sense. Though, as described later in the book, under some conditions, one model can be written as another. They are usually combined in the ARMA models . You would more commonly see the regression with lagged values because it is easy to interpret and estimate (does not need specialized time-series software as it can be done using regular linear regression).
