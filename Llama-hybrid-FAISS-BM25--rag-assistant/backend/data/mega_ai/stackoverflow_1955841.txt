Stay far, far away from the Java Web ADF. I would rather stick hot irons in my eyes than develop with the ADF. It doesn't work well with other JSF frameworks, any custom functionality results in you trying to develop javascript - but only by first embedding the javascript within XSL page fragments. It is cumbersome, confusing, but - at least it is slow. ESRI is not recommending the Java Web ADF for any new applications.
