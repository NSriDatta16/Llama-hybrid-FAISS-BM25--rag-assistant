Presumably, the model includes an interaction between A and B because those factors actually do interact. That means that the effect of A is different at different levels of B , and vice versa. Therefore, wanting to "evaluate the effect of A and A only" can't be done; B has to be included in the picture. First, as I often advise, statistics isn't about asterisks and P values, it's about understanding what is going on in the data. I suggest visualizing the effects first of all. For example, try lsmip(mod, B ~ A) which will produce an interaction plot showing how A changes for each B level. This plot may show widely varying effects. But it is even possible that the subjective effects of A are more or less the same across B , regardless of statistical significance of the interaction. If the latter is the case, it may make sense to do an overall comparison of A , averaged over B -- a result you already have (accompanied by the warning message shown). But if the effects are not more or less the same, you should test each of those A effects separately at levels of B , as follows lsmeans(mod, pairwise ~ A | B)
