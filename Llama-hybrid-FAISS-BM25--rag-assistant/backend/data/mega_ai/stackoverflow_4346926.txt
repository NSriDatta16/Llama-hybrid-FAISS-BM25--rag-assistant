How can I combine the WCF services config for both http and https in one web.config?

I spent a lot of time figuring out how to configure my WCF services so that they would work for https in the production environment. Basically, I needed to do this: Adding the bindingNamespace attribute to the endpoint is the final thing that made it work. But this config doesn't work in my local dev environment where I'm working under regular http. So my config there is: The differences here are that I've set the httpsGetEnabled attribute to false, and I removed the bindingConfiguration and bindingNamespace. The problem is: how do I create one config block that handles BOTH? I really hate having to make lots of special modifications to the config every time I do a release. Yes, I know I could have a post-build task that automatically changes the values, but I'd like to merge the configs if possible. I tried something like this: I figured that putting both endpoints would give it two options to look for when activating the service. However, this doesn't work. I get this error: Could not find a base address that matches scheme https for the endpoint with binding BasicHttpBinding. Registered base address schemes are [http]. From looking around SO and the rest of the internet, it appears that others have had problems slaying this dragon.
