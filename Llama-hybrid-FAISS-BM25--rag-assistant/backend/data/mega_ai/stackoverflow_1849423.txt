The way you should organise your code and tests is exactly the same you would for any OO language. Answers from the way I do it. It may not be right but works for me Depends on how your functionality is split. For my main python app I have 1 file with classes for the entry points and then packages of different bits of functionality I use PyDev for eclipse and organise it like I would for Java. > Workspace > | > |-Src > | |-Package1 > | |-Package2 > | |-main.py > |-Test > |-TestPackage1 > |-TestPackage2 Use DocString everywhere to keep track of everything After making sure that the relevant __init__.py files are in the folders. its just a simple case of from module import class
