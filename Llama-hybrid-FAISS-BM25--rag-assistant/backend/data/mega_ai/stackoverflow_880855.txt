increase the java heap size permanently?

Is there a way that I can set the default heap size for the jvm on my own computer? I want to set it to 1g, because I'm always running custom programs that always hit the overage point in the default jvm size. I just dont want to have to remember to type -XmX1g everytime I run my java app from the command line... There has to be an admin way to do this right?
