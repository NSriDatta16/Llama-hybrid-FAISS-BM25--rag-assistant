Embedding static CDATA with its tag in XSLT

I need to output from the XSL a static CDATA construct embedded in the XSL, not from the XML that I am transforming. For example... static text ]]> So on and so forth... I want this to output... static text ]]> So on and so forth... But what I get is... &lt;b&gt;static&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; text &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So on and so forth... I've tried several combinations of escaping the text and entities, but none seem to work.
