Large negative intercept value in python statsmodels regression for a time-series

I am quite new to regression analysis and am using python's statsmodels . My dataset is a time-series, which consists of values of a variable recorded for a long period, 1990 - 2020. I am interested to see whether the variation over time shows significantly increasing or decreasing trend or there is no trend. I am aware of other methods of trend analysis for time series. However, I choose OLS method in python statsmodels to find the regression of my variable on time. After running the OLS model for the time series, I found the following: Problems: Here I see the intercept value [ const ] ( red circled ) is very large negative and meaningless. It makes sense because I have data from the year 1990 onwards. Given the data set, going back to zero values of independent variable time , here, i. e. year = 0 may result in such a large negative value of the intercept. Condition number is too large also. Is there some way so that the intercept value would be meaningful?
