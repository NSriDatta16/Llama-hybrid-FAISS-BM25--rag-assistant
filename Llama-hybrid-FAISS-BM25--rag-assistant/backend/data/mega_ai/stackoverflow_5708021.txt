Grouping method to maintain nested elements XSLT 2.0 - separating the excess

I'm grouping bulleted items and embedding them as a second list of bulleted items inside some list elements. I can get the items to group, but my recursion template is selecting everything from my current position in the doc to the end. I need to set an ending point for my nested lists. My output looks like this: First Bullet: Sub-bullet 1: info for sub-bullet 1 Sub-bullet 2: info for sub-bullet 2 Sub-bullet 3: info for sub-bullet 3 Sub-bullet 4: info for sub-bullet 4 Sub-bullet 5: info for sub-bullet 5 Sub-bullet 6: info for sub-bullet 6 Second Bullet: Sub-bullet 5: info for sub-bullet 5 Sub-bullet 6: info for sub-bullet 6 But it SHOULD look like this (without Sub-bullets 5 and 6 under the first li): First Bullet: Sub-bullet 1: info for sub-bullet 1 Sub-bullet 2: info for sub-bullet 2 Sub-bullet 3: info for sub-bullet 3 Sub-bullet 4: info for sub-bullet 4 Second Bullet: Sub-bullet 5: info for sub-bullet 5 Sub-bullet 6: info for sub-bullet 6 I'm not sure how to properly group the sub-bullets in XSLT to get them in the correct position. Here's my source: First Bullet: Sub-bullet 1: info for sub-bullet 1 Sub-bullet 2: info for sub-bullet 2 Sub-bullet 3: info for sub-bullet 3 Sub-bullet 4: info for sub-bullet 4 Second Bullet: Sub-bullet 5: info for sub-bullet 5 Sub-bullet 6: info for sub-bullet 6 Here's my stylesheet: Any suggestions on how to accomplish this in 2.0? I've attempted to create some count variables, but haven't had any luck yet on establishing an endpoint outside of the current-group context. I know there must be an obvious (and more elegant) way to get this done.
