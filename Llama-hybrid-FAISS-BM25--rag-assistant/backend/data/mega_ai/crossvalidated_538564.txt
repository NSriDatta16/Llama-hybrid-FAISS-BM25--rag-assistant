What is a definition of data-efficient machine learning?

I found some papers referring to a particular machine learning algorithm as 'data efficient.' I understand the definition at an intuitive level (say, an algorithm with a good ratio of generated insights over inputs). But I suspect there is a more formal definition, which I would like to know.
