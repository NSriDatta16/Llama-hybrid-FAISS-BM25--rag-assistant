Views Bulk Operations & Draggable Views

I am in a situation where I need my end user to be able to organise a list of nodes using drag and drop. To do this I would normally be able to use Draggable Views . I also need the user to be able to bulk update the nodes returned. Normally I would use Views Bulk Operation . Is there anyway I can use both modules together? Would I need to code something myself or can you think of another way I can do what I want. Sortable Content by dragging In-line updating of content a view
