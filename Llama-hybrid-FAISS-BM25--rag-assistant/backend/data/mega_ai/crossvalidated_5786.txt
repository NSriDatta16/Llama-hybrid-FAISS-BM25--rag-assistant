Which kernel method gives the best probability outputs?

Recently I have used Platt's scaling of SVM-outputs to estimate probabilities of default-events. More direct alternatives seem to be "Kernel logistic Regression" (KLR) and the related "Import Vector Machine". Can anyone tell which kernel method giving probability-outputs is currently state of the art? Does an R-implementation of KLR exist? Thank you very much for your help!
