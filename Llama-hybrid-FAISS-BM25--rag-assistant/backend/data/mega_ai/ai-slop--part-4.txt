t there were no records of any performances by the band, that individual band members had no social media presence, and that their promotional images appeared to be fake. Deezer's AI detection tool flagged the band's music as being 100% AI-generated. An unaffiliated social media account in the name of the band denied that any AI was used in creating their music. However, within a week, the Velvet Sundown's artist biography on Spotify had been updated to say that the band was "a synthetic music project guided by human creative direction, and composed, voiced, and visualized with the support of artificial intelligence", intended as "artistic provocation". By this time, the band had over one million monthly listeners on Spotify. According to a former Spotify employee, the high listener count has two likely causes: firstly, Spotify now accepts payments to boost playlist placement, and secondly, playlists are increasingly selected by algorithms rather than humans. Earlier, Rolling Stone (which described the Velvet Sundown as "obviously fictional") had reported that a spokesperson for the band named Andrew Frelon had admitted that their music was an "art hoax" generated using the AI tool Suno. However, Frelon later stated that his statement was itself a hoax and that he had no connection to the band. AI has also been used to impersonate established musicians, and release music on major streaming services under their name without their knowledge, presumably to make money from streaming royalties. In particular, in August 2025, a number of Americana and folk-rock musicians including Jeff Tweedy, Father John Misty, and Blaze Foley (who died in 1989) were impersonated, as well as some established US Christian musicians and metalcore bands. The fake releases all had similar AI-generated cover art, and were credited to the same three record labels. Many listed "Zyan Maliq Mahardika" as a songwriter, indicating that the impersonation has a single source. Spotify removed the tracks, stating that they "violated our policy against impersonating another person or brand". In science Generative AI has been used to write articles which have been published in both low-quality paper mills and reputable journals. In 2024, a peer-reviewed article containing a generated image of a rat with absurdly large genitals accompanied by nonsensical text and diagrams was retracted by Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology after drawing attention from scientists on social media. In the workplace A Harvard Business Review study, done in conjunction with Stanford University and BetterUp, found that employees were using AI tools to create low-effort "workslop" that created more work for their colleagues. BetterUp defines workslop as "AI-generated content that looks good, but lacks substance". The study appears to be the first instance of "workslop" and also uses "workslopped" as a verb.
