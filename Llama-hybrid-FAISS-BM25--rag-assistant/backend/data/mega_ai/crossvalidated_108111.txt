Intervention Analysis Coding in R TSA Package

I am studying intervention analysis in time series with the Cryer and Chan book and am looking at trying to understand how to code the step response interventions. One question I had is how to differentiate between these two models: It appears the only difference is in (c) the value of $\delta$ is constrained to be 1. How can this constraint be added to the arimax function? I believe that (b) uses the coding transfer = list(c(1,0)) Is there a way to constrain $\delta$ =1?
