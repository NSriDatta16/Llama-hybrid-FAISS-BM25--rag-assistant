Eclipse doesn't highlight references anymore

I have an odd problem. In Eclipse Ganymede, I used to be able to highlight a variable, and it would highlight the use of that variables in that method. However through some action I have now disabled it. Is there a way I can enable it? I tried searching Google, but since I don't know what the feature is called, its kinda tough. Its a really useful feature, and its annoying that its not working.
