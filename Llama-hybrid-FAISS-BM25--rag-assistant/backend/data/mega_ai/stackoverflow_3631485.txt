The web storage API stores data as [key,value] pair where both key,value are Strings. So data in any format needs to adhere to this mechanism for local storage. So for example, if you have a JSON object like : { name:'John', gender:'male' } You can store it (through JavaScript) after passing it as a string like : localStorage.setItem("myObj","{name:'John',gender:'male'}"); For JSON objects, use JSON.stringify() to convert them to strings and use JSON.parse() to read them back.
