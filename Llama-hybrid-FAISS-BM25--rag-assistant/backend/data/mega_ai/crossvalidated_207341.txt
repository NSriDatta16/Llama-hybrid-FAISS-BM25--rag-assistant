I think machine learning needs to be a sub-branch under statistics, just like, in my view, chemistry needs to be a sub-branch under physics. I think physics-inspired view into chemistry is pretty solid (I guess). I don't think there is any chemical reaction whose equivalent is not known in physical terms. I think physics has done an amazing job by explaining everything we can see at a chemistry level. Now the physicists' challenge seems to be explaining the tiny mysteries at the quantum level, under extreme conditions that are not observable. Now back to machine learning. I think it too should be a sub-branch under statistics (just how chemistry is a sub-branch of physics). But it seems to me that, somehow, either the current state of machine learning, or statistics, is not mature enough to perfectly realize this. But in the long run, I think one must become a sub-branch of the other. I think it's ML that will to get under statistics. I personally think that "learning" and "analyzing samples" to estimate/infer functions or predictions are all essentially a question of statistics.
