For a true matrix implementation, you may consider trying something along the lines of: P2 = kron(centroids, ones(size(X,1),1)); Q2 = kron(ones(size(centroids,1),1), X); distances = reshape(sum((Q2-P2).^2,2), size(X,1), size(centroids,1)); Note This assumes the data is organized as [x1 y1 ...; x2 y2 ...;...]
