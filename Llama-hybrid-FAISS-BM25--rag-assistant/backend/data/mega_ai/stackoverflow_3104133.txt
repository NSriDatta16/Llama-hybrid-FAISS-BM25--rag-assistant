1 & 2) You can place it anywhere on your harddrive (so long as you don't move or delete it.. then you'll need to update the reference in XCode). Within XCode, you may want to create a "Group" for your images by right clicking in the left model tree and selecting it from the menu. Then just right click again and goto "Add" -> "Existing files or folders" and select the png file. If you accidentally add it in the wrong group, you can drag it around in XCode model tree. You can also drag and drop the file into a group in XCode from the Finder window. 3) You can just use "Default" copy settings and you don't need to copy it into the project. A reference is good enough and no need to recursively create groups. 4) What are you trying to do with the image? Do you need a CGImageRef from the png file or could you use an UIImageView or UIImage to load it from the file, or you can just lay it out in Interface Builder (IB). If you elaborate a little bit more about how you are using the image, maybe we can help you.
