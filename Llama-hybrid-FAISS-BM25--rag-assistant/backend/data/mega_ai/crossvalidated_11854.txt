You could use the MSE/AIC/BIC of the arima model and compare it to the MSE/AIC/BIC of the regression model. Just make sure that the number of fitted values are the same otherwise you might be making a mistake. For example if the ARIMA model has a lag structure of say sp+p ( a seasonal difference of order sp and an autoregressive structure of order p , you lose the first sp+p datapoints and only NOB-SP-P values are actually fit. If the regression model has no lags then you have NOB fitted points or less depending upon your specification of the lagged values for the inputs. So one has to realize that the MSE's may not be on the same historical actual values. One approach would be to compute the MSE of the regression model on the last NOB-SP-P values to put the models on an equal footing. You might want to GOOGLE "regression vs box-jenkins" and get some pointers on this and more. In closing one would normally never just fit a regression model with time series as their may be information in the lags of the causals and the lags of the dependent variable justifying the STEP-UP from regression to a Transfer Function Model a.k.a ARMAX Model . If you didn't STEP-UP then one one or more of the Gauusian Assumptions would be voided making your F/T tests meaningless and irrevelant. Furthermore there may be violations of the constancy of the error term requiring the incorporation of level shifts/local time trends and either pulse or seasonal pulse variable to render the error process having a "mean of 0.0 everywhere"
