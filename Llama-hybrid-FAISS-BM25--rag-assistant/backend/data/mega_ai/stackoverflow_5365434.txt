There are a lot of options, but none of them are probably what you would call "simple". Simplest: You'll have to shrink the database after removing the tables. You may also want to shrink the logs. Note that you don't want to be doing this on a regular basis (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlserverstorageengine/archive/2006/06/13/629059.aspx) and when you shrink the logs, you need to have taken backups. Other options include adding files to the database and moving data to only those files, or moving the tables to be kept to another new database with appropriate growth limits.
