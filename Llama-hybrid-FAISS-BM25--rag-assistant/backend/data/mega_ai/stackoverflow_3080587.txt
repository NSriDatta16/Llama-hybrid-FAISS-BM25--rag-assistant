Crossword puzzle construction is NP-Complete in general (i.e nxn board of 1s and 0s and a given set from which to pick answers). Look at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems which just mentions this. Garey and Johnson's classic book also has a mention of this, saying Exact cover by 3 sets can be reduced to it. So, you probably will have to use some backtracking/heuristic to fill the grid. Perhaps this project report of two students from Dartmouth college will be of some help: Crossword Puzzle Generator . It contains some heuristics which you might be able to use. Of course, you seem to imply there is a human involved, but it is not clear if you can leverage that person to fill the grid and whether your problem is basically some UI programming problem in helping the user out.
