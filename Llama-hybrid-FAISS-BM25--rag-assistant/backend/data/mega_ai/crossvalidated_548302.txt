Proper approach for image recognition of ~1000 symbols

We have a dataset of black symbols in grey squares (like attached below). The symbols are various letters (arabic, greek) as well as numbers in many distinct fonts; altogether ~1000 different images. We need to build an image recognition model (recognises each of the squares independently, so there are as many classes as there are images). This seems like an enormous task, I would like to know what would be the most suitable approach? Edit Let me summarise and clarify what we resolved in the discussion below the post: each image is an unique label; there are exactly as many unique labels as images I need to have a system which recognises these exact 1000 images. Noting more. I am new to image recognition therefore I am wondering what kind of model/algorithm should I apply to such exact problem. However, new examples may indeed come, for example improperly cropped squares, or re-sized images (smaller resolution). In an extreme case someone might even provide a very improperly cropped square which would include some background around it. The bg may be anything, no constraints. In such case - should I recognize the borders of the squares first and then proceed (how?) Edit2 After a discussion under this answer I conclude that the question is still open and I cannot accept a solution yet. It seems that proposed CNN would require ~6000 examples per image, which in my case of 1000 symbols is not realistic. That is why I would especially like to learn how should I proceed in this exact dataset (approach? model? algorithm?)
