Issue with complete separation in logistic regression (in R)

I am trying to fit a logistic regression model for business defaults. Apart from the dichotomous variable default, the data set includes some performance ratios. When estimating the model in R, the following warning appears: glm.fit However, when I'm using the brglm2 package to detect separation, no separation is detected: glm.det And when I'm using the logistf function to penalize complete separation, the variables stop being significant: glm.adj In case it helps here is the complete set of raw data. Why doesn't the detect_separation method detect any separation? Is it possible that the variables, even though yielding complete separation, are not at all significant with logistf? How should I proceed? Update : Added two boxplots (the first one includes all data, while in the second one two outliers are excluded to make the plot slightly clearer), in order to show the dispersion of the data depending on the Default variable.
