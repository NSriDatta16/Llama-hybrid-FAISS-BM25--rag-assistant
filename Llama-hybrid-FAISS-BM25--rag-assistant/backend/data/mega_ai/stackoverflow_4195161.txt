How can I select an nth child without knowing the parent element?

I can't figure out a way of selecting the nth element, last element, or first element in cases where I don't know the parent element. nth-child exists, but only for children, for example: One Two p:last-child selects the "Two" paragraph, and p:first-child selects the "One" paragraph. But what about when I have dynamic code and have no idea what the parent name is, or even what the parent really is (may be a div, span, anchor, ul, etc.)? For example: One Two How do I select the second paragraph here? (I'm unable to select youdontknowwhat! since I really don't know what element it is (it's just a hypothetical name). Why are there first-child , last-child , and nth-child selectors and NO :first , :last , :nth (like .select-me:first )?
