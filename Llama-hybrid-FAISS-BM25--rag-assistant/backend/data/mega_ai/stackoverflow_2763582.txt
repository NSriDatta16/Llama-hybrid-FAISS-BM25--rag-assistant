If you're looking for a .NET API, then I would recommend you try AForge.NET http://code.google.com/p/aforge/ If you just want to try various machine learning algorithms on a data set that you have at your disposal, then I would recommend that you play around with Weka ; it's (relatively) easy to use and it implements a lot of ML/AI algorithms. Run multiple runs with different settings for each algorithm and try as many algorithms as you can. Most of them will have some predictive power and if you combine the right ones, then you might really get something useful.
