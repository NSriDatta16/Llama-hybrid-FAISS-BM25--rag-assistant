Typically, profilers (such as JProfiler ) will allow you to see this - see for example the Allocation recording explained screencast. However, they achieve this by attaching an agent to the JVM that allows them to intercept the low-level operations - this information is not usually available to either users or Java programs. As such, you won't be able to see the heap via JMX apps such as JConsole or JVisualVM.
