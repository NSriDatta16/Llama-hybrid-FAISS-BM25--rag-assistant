Rapid Application Development always. As a freelance contract programmer my ability to satisfy clients is directly related to my productivity. On any new job I generally have a few days, at most, to show some kind of results. So I'm entirely oriented towards finding and using the best tools to help me produce good programs in the shortest amount of time. Within that constraint, I hope I pay attention to good programming practices. By the best practices in the world are no good to me, or to my client, if the project is abandoned or given to someone else while I'm still modelling or refactoring.
