As far as i know you cannot get at the listbox item container when using data binding. YOu could in Beta 1. You also cannot set a mouse event handler in the style, you must use a data template, just so you know. You will likely have to use the mouse move event from a parent element, probably the UserControl or main layout control that hosts the listbox. State changes and animations need to be in the style though so... you still cant get at the listbox item, just the element inside it in the data template. Oh and if doing drag and drop HitTest is now protected so that will make the Drop harder.
