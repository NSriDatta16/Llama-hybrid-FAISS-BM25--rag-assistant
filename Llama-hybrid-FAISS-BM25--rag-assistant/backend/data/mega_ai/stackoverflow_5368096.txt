I'm not sure if the answer below is directly tied to the Exception you are experiencing but i believe it will spare you a lot of trouble. Short answer You should not bind the objects returned by nhibernate to your UI. Project them to DTOs or ViewModel objects and bind those to the UI. Long answer NHibernate is an ORM designed to map your domain objects (the hole graph of interconnected objects that make up your business logic) to a relational database persistent storage. In order to be able to do this NHibernate uses lazy-loading to avoid loading all the graph of objects into memory. To perform lazy loading NHibernate uses generated proxies which are inherited from the from the class they proxy. Binding a proxy to the UI is not recommended because the proxy needs the ISession to still be active to be able to do lazy loading.
