The problem is that clearing the radio buttons make no information about them appear in the submitted form data, and Domino seems to interpret that as no change to the field rather than clear the field . I haven't found any solution to this I really like, but I can think of two options: Change the radio buttons to include a no choice option. The alternative is a bit clumpsy: Add an editable field to the form to use as a flag, hide it from the web browser with css. Have clearRadioButtonGroup also set the flag field to something. Have the onChange event of the radio buttons clear the flag field. In a WebQueryOpen agent, set the radio buttons field to empty if the flag field is non-empty. Another alternative could be to uses some clever javascript/css trick to hide the no choice option and have clearRadioButtonGroup simply set that choice.
