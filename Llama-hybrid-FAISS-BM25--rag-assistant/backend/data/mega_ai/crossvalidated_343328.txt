How to improve accuracy of my neural network?

I am working on a project in which I am using this dataset , I implement neural network by using keras for it but I am not getting testing accuracy more than 80%. Here is the details: Number of training examples = 1752 number of testing examples = 310 shape of image = (64,64) optimization algorithm = adam (learning-rate = 0.0001) number of epochs = 1500 minibatch-size = 32 This is the keras model code I used: model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(30, input_dim = 4096,kernel_initializer= "uniform", bias_initializer= "zeros",activation= "relu")) model.add(Dropout(0.3)) model.add(Dense(20,kernel_initializer= "uniform", bias_initializer= "zeros",activation= "relu")) model.add(Dropout(0.3)) model.add(Dense(15,kernel_initializer= "uniform", bias_initializer= "zeros",activation= "relu")) model.add(Dropout(0.3)) model.add(Dense(10,kernel_initializer= "uniform", bias_initializer= "zeros",activation= "softmax")) I tried different values for dropout probability(keep_prob), but nothing change much. Without dropout I am getting 98% training accuracy and 75% testing accuracy. So I tried dropout after this I am able to reduce the variance, but not getting enough accuracy. After so many hit and trials I got 80% testing accuracy max till not, but not getting higher than this. I also tried l2 regularization and l2 dropout combined also, but nothing changes much. By l2 training accuracy goes very down like 72%, but it does not increase my testing accuracy. How can I increase it?
