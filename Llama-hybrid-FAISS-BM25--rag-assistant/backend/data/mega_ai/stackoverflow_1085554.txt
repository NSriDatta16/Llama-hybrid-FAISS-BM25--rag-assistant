SQLite is there (but since you cannot write to files, you must use it in a read-only way, or on a :memory: database). App engine docs do a good job at documenting what's there. You can add any other pure-python library, typically as a zipfile of .py (NOT .pyc ) files to upload in the main directory of your app (you can directly import from inside the zipfile, of course). A few more pure-Python third-party libraries included with app engine are listed and documented here -- the paragraph on zipimport at this URL has a bit more details on the ways and limitations of using zipfiles to add more third-party pure-Python libs to your app.
