The most obvious thing to do is to save it to a database. Then storage and retrieval is very straightforward. If you can't do that for whatever reason, then I think your present solution is the way to go. Your parsing code looks pretty straightforward to me. I'd create a separate function to parse a line that returns the array of responses for one line, and then have the caller do whatever needs to be done with it, just for clean modularization.
