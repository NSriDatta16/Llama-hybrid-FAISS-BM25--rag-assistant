Machine learning Models with low variance?

I am trying to choose a classifier which is going to be trained on a huge dataset, however because of the nature of the problem, I do not expect the model to perform very accurately at all even with a large dataset to train on. In fact around 75% accuracy will be more than enough to call it a success. Of course I am thinking of using High Bias-Low Variance models like Naive bayes classifier or logistic regression. What I want to know is, in general which ml models perform comparatively better when it is difficult to achieve high accuracy because of the nature of the problem itself, even when having sufficient data to train on.
