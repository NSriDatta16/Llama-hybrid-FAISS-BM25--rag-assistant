Best way to use welcome file in web application

I have a Tomcat application where I have the choice to list the welcome (or index) page in the web.xml file as follows: /jsp/user/index.jsp And use scriptlets to call database methods to populate the page. Or I can use a servlet to call a welcome page or pages as follows: IndexServlet myApp.misc.Index_Servlet IndexServlet /IndexServlet IndexServlet Whichever way is chosen, the welcome page will be required to display quite a lot of data to render a small number of visualisations. But the welcome page won't be required to do user authentication. Can anyone tell me if one of these options better than the other or not? Thanks Mr Morgan.
