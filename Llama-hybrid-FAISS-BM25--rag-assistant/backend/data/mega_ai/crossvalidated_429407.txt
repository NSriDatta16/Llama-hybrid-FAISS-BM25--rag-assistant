In principle, once you have the linear regression object generated by lm() , you can test for significant differences between any desired linear combinations of predictor values that you wish by applying the formula for the variance of a sum to the covariance matrix for the linear regression, the matrix provided provided by vcov(lm()) . You should correct, of course, for the multiple comparisons. The emmeans package provides one convenient way to perform such tests. That said, you need to be very careful about comparing intercepts when interaction terms are involved, particularly when one of the predictors is continuous with values far from 0. In your example, the intercept represents the Sepal.Length for each Species when the Petal.Width is exactly 0 . Is that really a comparison you care about? In the iris dataset, the average Petal.Width values are 0.246, 1.326, and 2.026 for the Species setosa, versicolor, and virginica respectively. With such a range of Petal.Width values, what would be the point of examining the intercepts for Sepal.Length in the fictitious case when the Petal.Width is 0? I understand that you are using this dataset only as an example of a more general question, but the same cautions apply broadly to evaluations of intercepts when interactions are involved.
