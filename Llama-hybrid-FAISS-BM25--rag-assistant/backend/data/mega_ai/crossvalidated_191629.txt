Why filtering for trend estimation?

I'm starting to learn about techniques for trend removal of a time series with no seasonal component, i.e. $X_t = m_t + Y_t$. If I undertsnad correctly, there are all sorts of filter we can apply in order to estimate $m_t$. An example provided in my book is a finite moving average filter, another example is the Spencer 15-point moving average... I'm bit confused about why we are using this approach. Why not just apply regression techniques to estimate $m_t$ ? This filtering approach seems very ad-hoc.
