I can think of many ways to models such a time series, for example, do you suspect that there is a temporal dependency between successive A values? I will present what I believe is a simple way to start. For each $A_{ij}$ estimate the rate of the point process $P$. This could of course be done in many ways where a simple method is to put a window around $A_{ij}$ and count the number $N_{ij}$ of occurrences from $P$ in that window. The width of the window could be decided from what you know about $P$ and could later be optimized by using, for example, cross validation. Now when you have a $N_{ij}$ for each $A_{ij}$ you can put this into a regression model: $$A_{ij} \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot N_{ij}$$ This would just be a first step and there is much to play around with: Instead of using a rectangular window you could experiment with many other window functions . You can explore different regression models. If you believe there might be time dependencies in your data you could look into forecasting techniques such as vector autoregression . If prediction is your goal you could optimize your model(s) by evaluating different sets of parameters and models by cross validation .
