Thanks for all your help guys. I think if I had a bit more time on this issue I would have been able to use all your samples and make something work directly in SQL - but I don't really have that liberty. The project I'm working on is primarily written in MatLab, so what I've done is pulled the ID and TotalParticles data out of the DB, then in Matlab I ran checks on the TotalParticles Column. The output of this script are the ID values that I require for the collapsed database, which I'll feed in to a simple select statement and that in turn will make the view I require.
