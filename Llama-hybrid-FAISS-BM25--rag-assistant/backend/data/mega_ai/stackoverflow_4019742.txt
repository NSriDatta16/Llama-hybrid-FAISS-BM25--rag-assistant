Xcode: multiple projects, more than one main executable

Hi I'm new to Xcode. I'm trying to learn c++ and I was wondering if it is possible to have multi projects and choose which project should run. I used ms visual studios before and I like how under a solution I can create multiple projects and choose which one is the executable one. Xcode also has targets not exactly sure what they are maybe they play a role? I tried messing around but I constantly have issue because of duplicate mains. I'm going through a chapter and there are case studies. I'm trying to keep every chapter organized in one project well something like that. Any help thanks!
