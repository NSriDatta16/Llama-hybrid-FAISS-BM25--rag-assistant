The DBMS would have to be designed to work as you want. Regular DBMS have their own mechanisms for managing data, and while you might be able to communicate with them via shared memory, it is more likely that you won't. The DBMS might hold most of its working data in memory; it depends on the DBMS. Typically, the data will be backed by disk storage. What you can't do is take an arbitrary DBMS and decree to it that it shall communicate with your process via shared memory. If it is designed to do so, then you can; otherwise, you can't. Typically, though, you use an ODBC or similar driver to access the DBMS from your application, and those who implement the driver (and the DBMS) dictate how the interprocess communication will occur.
