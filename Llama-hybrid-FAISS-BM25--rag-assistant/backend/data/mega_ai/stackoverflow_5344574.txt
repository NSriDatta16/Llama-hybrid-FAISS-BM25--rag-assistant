the easiest place to put this is in your model. I would suggest using either before_save or even before_validation if you feel that fits better. Something like this would do the trick: before_save :upcase_content def upcase_content self.content = self.content.upcase end Additionally if you wanted to allow for exceptions of a case by case basis you could add an attr_accessor to your model. class MyModel :dont_upcase ... end then when you create a model set the accessor to true @model = Model.new(:brand_name => utorrent) @model.dont_upcase = true @model.save!
