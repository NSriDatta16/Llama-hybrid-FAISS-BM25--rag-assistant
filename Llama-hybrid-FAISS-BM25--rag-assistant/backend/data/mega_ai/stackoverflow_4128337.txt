As @Robert Harvey states, the examples have the right idea. The EF Context is specific to your persistence mechanism (SQL Server database, for example), and therefore belongs in the Data Access layer. The point of such layering is to make your persistence mechanism invisible to the layers above it, such that you could, for example, change database providers without altering your business / UI code.
