Spearman correlation I will assume that you want to treat your intervals as ordered categories (think as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and check if this order coincides with the order of the average answers. Then, yes, you should use Spearman correlation. However, note that Spearman correlation will only change values if, for instance, the average answer of group 1 surpases that of group 2. If the order does not change, the Spearman correlation won't change either. Thus, it will not be very sensitive. Spearman correlation is just the correlation of the rankings. Other ideas Forget groups Why don't you do the scatter plot of answer vs weight and visually check if you have something? A simple measure could be the correlation between weight and answer. Make groups scalar If you only have the groups, you can assume a single weight for each group and then compute the correlation again (mean or max). I would also recommend visualizing this. Use unordered groups If you assume the groups unordered, you could have the data to estimate the probabilities $P(answer | weight\; group)$ , in particular estimating mean and variance and assuming a Gaussian for each group. Maybe that is useful for further analysis, for instance computing the expected answer of a new patient.
