C++ boost ublas + units dimension constraints

I am seeking advice on design/general idea on how to force matrix dimension constraints on ublas matrix/vector possibly using boost units. For example, let matrix A have dimensions of time x force (for example) // does not have dimensions, time x force and force x time are not distinguished. matrix A; //something like? dimension > A; dimension > B = trans(A); // or maybe custom layouts, although ensuring dimension becomes harder between matrixes? matrix > A; have you done something like this or do you have some good idea about how to organize such constraints? I am looking more for syntax/semantics suggestion rather than implementation. I have gone through ublas archives, there are some discussion, but nothing concrete. Thank you
