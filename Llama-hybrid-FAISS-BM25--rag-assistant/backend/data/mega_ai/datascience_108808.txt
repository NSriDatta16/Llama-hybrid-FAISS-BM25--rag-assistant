Any embedding space is a latent space. I'm not expert in this specific topic, but in general the term "latent space" refers to a multi-dimensional space in which elements are represented but their representation is not directly interpretable and/or observable. Typically this is in contrast to a space where dimensions have an interpretable meaning, for example in the traditional bag of words representation a dimension corresponds to a particular word. The term "latent" applies to some variable which is not directly observable, for example the "latent variable" in a HMM is the state that the model tries to infer from the observations. It's sometimes called the "hidden variable". Naturally a latent space is relevant only if it is meaningful with respect to the represented objects and/or the target task. This is what these sentences mean.
