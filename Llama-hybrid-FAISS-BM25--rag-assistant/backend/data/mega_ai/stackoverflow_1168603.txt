You could make use of the built in Rails.cache mechanism to store the value but as mentioned in the first answer you'd have to key it off something like the user_id. This is a nice way to go since you can back it with different storage mechanisms. Rails.cache.write(:foo) # in later action Rails.cache.read(:foo) One other thing you could look at is the flash hash, which provides a keep method to make the flash value last more than one subsequent request. So in action 1 you could create the value: flash[:foo] = some_value flash.keep(:foo) In action 2 you can access it, and call keep again if you want it to stay alive for more subsequent actions. flash[:foo] #use it for something flash.keep(:foo) # keep it for another request It's a bit of a tricky thing to do cleanly within the context of http requests.
