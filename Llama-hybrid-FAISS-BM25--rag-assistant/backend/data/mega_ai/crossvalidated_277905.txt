Logistic regression is giving better results compared to SVM. How to explain this?

We are trying to come up with a prediction model for one our products in our team. We did some feature engineering to extract relevant features. Now we are trying to see which ML methodology would give us the best result. We started with Logistic Regression and SVM. We expected SVM to perform better than Logistic Regression. I am new to ML concepts. So need some help from expert forum. Firstly, is it always true that SVM would perform better than Logistic Regression? If not, can someone please help me understand this mathematically? i.e, How do I debug why SVM is under performing compared to logistic regression? Also is "Binomial Logistic Regression" different from "Linear Logistic Regression"?
