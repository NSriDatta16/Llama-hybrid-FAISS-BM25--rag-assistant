is a tree with nodes labelled by sentences in L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} or by symbol τ {\displaystyle \tau } , such that: The root is labelled by c {\displaystyle c} For each node N {\displaystyle N} , If N {\displaystyle N} is a leaf node, then N {\displaystyle N} is labelled by either an assumption or by τ {\displaystyle \tau } If N {\displaystyle N} is not a leaf node, then there is an inference rule l N ← s 1 , . . . , s m {\displaystyle l_{N}\leftarrow s_{1},...,s_{m}} , ( m ≥ 0 ) {\displaystyle (m\geq 0)} , where l N {\displaystyle l_{N}} is the label of N {\displaystyle N} and If m = 0 {\displaystyle m=0} , then the rule shall be l N ← τ {\displaystyle l_{N}\leftarrow \tau } (i.e. child of N {\displaystyle N} is τ {\displaystyle \tau } ) Otherwise, N {\displaystyle N} has m {\displaystyle m} children, labelled by s 1 , . . . , s m {\displaystyle s_{1},...,s_{m}} S {\displaystyle S} is the set of all assumptions labeling the leave nodes An argument with claim c {\displaystyle c} supported by a set of assumption S {\displaystyle S} can also be denoted as S ⊢ c {\displaystyle S\vdash c} See also Notes == References ==
