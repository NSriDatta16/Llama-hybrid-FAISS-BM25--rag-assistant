I think that SharpPCap is an overkill here. Try: listen on a port (say 8080) for each incoming connection, accept and open one to the server (original one, port 80) pass everything that comes in from the client straight to the server pass everything that comes from the server back to the client, monitoring the stream and injecting/modifying if needed
