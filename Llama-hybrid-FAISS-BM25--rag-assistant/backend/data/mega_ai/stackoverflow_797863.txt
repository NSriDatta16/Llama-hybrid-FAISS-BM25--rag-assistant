Break up the task into less-annoying chunks. Occupy your brain as much as possible: if the task only requires 20% of your intellect, you can probably listen to CNN radio (in some other language that you've studied, for instance) in the background. If it requires your full concentration, listen to whatever music you can without getting distracted. Avoid simple carbs (sugars especially). This is personal, but I find that they cause me to crash and need a nap. Which is good sometimes. Fight with your husband/wife/friends/etc. beforehand. This will make it very hard to focus and then boring tasks are a godsend. Many times, repetitive tasks are better coded than performed. I end up writing a huge amount of "code" in Excel/OpenOfficeSpreadsheetThinger (Excel writes Ruby, etc. perfectly :) and using global find and replace in Netbeans. This might take longer the first few times, but these are tools that you need to learn to use.
