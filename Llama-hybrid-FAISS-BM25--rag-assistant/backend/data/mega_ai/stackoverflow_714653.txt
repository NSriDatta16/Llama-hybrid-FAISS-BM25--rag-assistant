best way to turn a post title into an URL in c#

I was wondering which is the best way to turn a string (e.g. a post title) into a descriptive URL. the simplest way that comes to mind is by using a regex, such in: public static Regex regex = new Regex( "\\W+", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase | RegexOptions.CultureInvariant | RegexOptions.IgnorePatternWhitespace | RegexOptions.Compiled ); string result = regex.Replace(InputText,"_"); which turns "my first (yet not so bad) cupcake!! :) .//\." into my_first_yet_not_so_bad_cupcake_ then I can strip the last "_" and check it against my db and see if it's yet present. in that case I would add a trailing number to make it unique and recheck. I could use it in, say http://myblogsite.xom/posts/my_first_yet_not_so_bad_cupcake but, is this way safe? should i check other things (like the length of the string) is there any other, better method you prefer? thanks
