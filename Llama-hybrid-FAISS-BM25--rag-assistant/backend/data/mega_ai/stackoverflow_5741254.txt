Connection Data Sources and Delegates in Cluttered Interface Builder XIB

I am maintaining some code, part of it is a very cluttered xib file with two table views on top of each other (only 1 visible at any time when running) - I need to connect data sources and delegates from each of the tables, but because they're on top of each other, when I drag across, it always picks up the top one. Moving stuff around is not really an option, because it's very cluttered and cramped. Any ideas on working efficiently with cluttered and complicated xib layouts?
