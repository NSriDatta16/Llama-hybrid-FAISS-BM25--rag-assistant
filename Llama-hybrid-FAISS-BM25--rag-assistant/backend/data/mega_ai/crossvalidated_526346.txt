As described in your question, you should expect that the prediction intervals in production to have the desired coverage. During training you come up with a fitted model $f$ , which need not be equal to, or even close to, the true data generating function. Using the test set you get a sample $e_1,\dots ,e_{n_\text{test}}$ . By Glivenko-Cantelli as $n_\text{test}\rightarrow \infty$ the empirical CDF of $e_1,\dots ,e_{n_\text{test}}$ should converge to the true CDF of $e_i$ . Because of the above result, using the empirical CDF you can come up with an interval such that for a new independent set of observations in production, for each $e_i^*=y_i^*-f(x_i^*)$ , you will have $$P\left(e_i^*\in[e_{low},e_{high}]\right)\approx p \Rightarrow P\left(y_i\in[e_{low}+f(x_i),e_{high}+f(x_i)]\right)\approx p.$$
