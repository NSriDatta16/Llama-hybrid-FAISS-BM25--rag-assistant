1) Sessions aren't bound to accounts, they're bound to browser sessions. You can use the user agent information to see if that someone other user agent is trying to hijack the session. However it's not fail-proof. You can also use things like the user's IP address (or a given range of it) to catch hijack attempts. 2) By calling session_regenerate_id from time to time, you reduce the chance of someone hijacking the session. This is especially true if the session ID is passed in the URL. For example let's say someone accidentally pasted a link to a chat with the SID in the URL. If you regenerate the session ID periodically, the users who saw that link can't hijack the session with it, as the ID would've changed already.
