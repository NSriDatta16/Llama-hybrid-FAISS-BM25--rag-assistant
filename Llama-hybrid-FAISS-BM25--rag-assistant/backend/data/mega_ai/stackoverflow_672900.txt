From what you described, i am guessing you have no way of redefining the structure. If you did, i'd suggest you use Boost.Fusion to describe your structure with template-named fields. See associative tuples for more information on that. Both kinds of structures might actually be compatible (same organization in memory), but i'm pretty sure there is no way to get such a guarantee from the standard. If you don't, you can create a complement to the structure that would give you access to fields the same way that associative tuples do. But that can be a bit verbal. EDIT Now it's pretty clear that you can define the structures the way you want to. So i definitely suggest you use boost.fusion.
