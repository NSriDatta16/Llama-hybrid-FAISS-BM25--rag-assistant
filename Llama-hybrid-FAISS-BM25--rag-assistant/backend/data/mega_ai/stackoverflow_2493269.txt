Use whatever means for users to log in. Windwos authentication encouraged. make sure the user has no rights to change any data ;) The application then, on the existing connection, post-authorized using application roles. More info on that is on http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb669062.aspx Basically the application can get a separate sets of rights by using an application password (that sadly has to be coded into the application - use sensible means to protect it), replacing the limited rights the user has with more rights for itself. I would ask you to consider using an application server, but if you have a classical client/server architecture that is as good as it gets.
