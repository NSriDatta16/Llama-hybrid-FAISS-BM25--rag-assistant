Ugly and asking for trouble? I think you're on to something. Ideally, you could store previously-entered data in session state, which stores the data on the server. Alternatively, if the state needs to be stored in the browser page, you can use the method you mentioned, or you can do something a bit more like Microsoft's "view state" variable. Essentially, you serialize your data, perhaps encrypt and/or sign the result, and then base64 encode the whole lump and stick the result in hidden variable on the page. The advantage of doing it this way include (a) not polluting your namespace with old variable names, (b) not confusing form-filling addons and utilities, (c) tamper-resistant variable storage (esp. if encrypted or signed).
