For tabulated values, where you have outcomes $x_i$ with proportions $p_i$: x 0 1 2 3 4 5 p 0 0 0 0 0.6 0.4 px 0 0 0 0 2.4 2.0 then the sample mean is $\sum_i p_i x_i=0+0+0+0+2.4+2.0=4.4$ This is entirely algebraically equivalent to writing out the ten scores 4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5 and averaging those
