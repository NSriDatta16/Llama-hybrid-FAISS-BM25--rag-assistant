Not understanding reason for demeaning covariates in program evaluation regression

I am reading the Imbens et al. 2009 paper on program evaluation methods: http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3043416/imbens_recent.pdf?sequence=2 On page 24, discussing simple regression methods for estimating the average treatment effect, they write: "This estimator is also obtained from the coefficient on the treatment indicator $W_i$ in the regression $Y_i$ on $1, W_i, X_i, W_iÂ·(X_i-\bar{X})$." Can someone please explain to me why the covariates in the interaction term need to be demeaned here? I would have thought that if the non-interacted covariates enter the regression unadjusted, then they should be likewise unadjusted in the interaction term. But apparently my intuition is wrong. Thanks.
