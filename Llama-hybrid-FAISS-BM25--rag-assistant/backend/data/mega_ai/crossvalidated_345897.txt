Caret package - Logistic regression how to find Pseudo R square

Hi I am interested in utilizing caret for making inferences on a particular data set... Since this is caret-model, most common methods to find pseudo Rsquare fail. model Is it possible to find the Pseudo R square for the model created using syntax? Any help is appreciated. Thank you
