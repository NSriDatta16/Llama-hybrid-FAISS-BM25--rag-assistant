There is the Response.Buffer option that you can use to tell it to delay returning the response until the page has completed processing, so you could perhaps combine that with some kind of timeout in the script, but it would not be especially elegant especially as VBScript doesn't really offer you a way of asking threads to sleep so you can end up thrashing the CPU. Maybe better to use a server-side session and javascript on the client, so the client delays the request and the server will only send the response after the expected delay is over. That should provide some server-side safeguards and be useable for users who aren't trying to mess around with your system...
