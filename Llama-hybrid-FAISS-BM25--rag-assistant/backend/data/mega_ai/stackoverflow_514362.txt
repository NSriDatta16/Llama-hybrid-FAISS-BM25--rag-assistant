If you are like me, who has no formal computer science education, and is interested in building/want to know how a compiler works: I am recommend "Programming Language Processors in Java: Compilers and Interpreters", an amazing book for a self-taught computer programmer. From my point of view, understanding those basic language theory, automate machine, and set theory is not a big problem. The problem is how to turn those things into code. The above book tells you how to write a parser, analysis context, and generate code. If you can not understand this book, then I have to say, give up building a compiler. The book is best programming book I have ever read. There is an other book, also good, Compiler Design in C . There is a lot of code, and it tells you everything about how to build a compiler and lexer tools. Building a compiler is a fun programming practice and can teach you heaps of programming skills. Do not buy the Dragon book . It was a waste of money and time and is not for a practitioner.
