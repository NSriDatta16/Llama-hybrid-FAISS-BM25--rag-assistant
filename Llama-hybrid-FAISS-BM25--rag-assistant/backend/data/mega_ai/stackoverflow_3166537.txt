The simple answer is - yes. Java has libraries for defining Web Services and deploying them, and both Java and .NET have utilities for generating Web Service clients. That's not to say it will be easy though! If I was you, I would instead investigate creating a REST service using a JAX-RS implementation (my favourite is RestEASY). This will allow you to create a 'web service' without SOAP, i.e. http://server/invoices/1 might return apple banana robert 5.00 Which it then should be easy to interpret in any language. Either way it will be a steep learning curve though. The main difference between Java and .NET is that while a lot of functionality is built in to .NET, in Java it's spread across the ecosystem, which is good because it provides variety, however it can take a bit longer to locate functionality.
