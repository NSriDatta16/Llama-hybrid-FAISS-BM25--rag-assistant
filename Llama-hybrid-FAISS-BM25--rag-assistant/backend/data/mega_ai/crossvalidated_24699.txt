If you are only using 3 features, then doing PCA is not worth it unless you have high multicollinearity and these three variables would have some reasonable interpretation when grouped together into a composite index. The intuition is that when 2 variables used in clustering are collinear, they effectively represent the same information. But that information appears twice in the data and so it gets twice the weight of all the other variables. The second condition is probably more a matter of taste and/or the intended use of your model.
