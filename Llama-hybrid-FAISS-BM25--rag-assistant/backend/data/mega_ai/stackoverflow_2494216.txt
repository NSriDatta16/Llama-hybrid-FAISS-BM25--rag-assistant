The content-disposition header instructs the user agent how it should present the data, and it is usually used when serving up binary data (as opposed to plain text). When set to "attachment", the display of the content is contingent upon further action of the user. In other words, the user should receive a prompt and must decide what to do with the content (usually given an "Open" or "Save" option). You can not programmatically force a hyperlink to open up in a new tab. Even if you could, you should not. This behavior should be controlled by the user agent. As a user, when I want to open something in a new tab, I use the mouse-wheel-click because that is how my browser is configured.
