eCos is free (but you can get paid support). It supports Intel x86 architecture. It supports multi-processor systems. Depending on your timing requirements, I've had not too good experience with real-time Linux systems. Although response time may be good in average, I've seen cases where the worst case over a few days may be 10 or even 100 times as much. I guess this partly depends on the quality of the drivers, partly on the scheduler itself. But I guess it boils down to whether your system demands hard or soft real-time, what the timing constraints are, what kind of application you need to run. And how streamlined development system you require.
