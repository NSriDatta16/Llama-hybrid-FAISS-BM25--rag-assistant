The innovation of the synthetic control method (Abadie et al. 2010) is that it enables estimating the factor model that allows unobserved common factors (lambda) to vary across unit (mu) with fairly reasonable assumptions (equation 1 in the paper). Choosing a synthetic control in this manner is, of course, not feasible because μ1,...,μJ+1 are not observed. However, under fairly standard conditions (see Appendix B), the factor model in Equation (1) implies that a synthetic control can fit Z1 and a long set of preintervention outcomes, Y11,...,Y1T0, only as long as it fits Z1 and μ1, so Equation (4) holds approximately. (Abadie et al. 2010) So the existence of the set of weights that meet the balancing conditions (i.e., similar pre-trends and explanatory variables, equation 2 in the paper) means that these factor loadings (mu) have been estimated, or the unobserved time-varying confounders have been controlled. You can measure the fit, or the existence of such weights, by observing the pre-event RMSPE. Similarity of donor: it is to avoid the interpolation bias, which could exist because of the simple linear model specifications used for the estimation. Though, I couldn't find any papers pointing to how it might affect the validity of SC estimators. Time horizon: I think it can't be theoretically driven. You could simulate with your own data to find at which length the estimated effects start to drift off. Time-varying confounder: If there is an event that is believed to change not only the post-event outcome but also the factor loadings estimated from the pre-event characteristics (COVID?), I guess you can't use the synthetic control method or any estimation method for that matter. We would need some leverages for predicting counterfactuals, but the nature of that event would disqualify most external sources.
