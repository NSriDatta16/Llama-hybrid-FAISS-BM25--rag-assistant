Explanation needed for different ways of calculating precision (ISO-5725 and CLSI EP05-A2)

I'm trying to get along with calculating precision of analytical method. I'm a chemist not a mathematician. ICH M10 guideline requires that: Accuracy and precision should be determined by analysing the QCs within each run (within-run) and in different runs (between-run). Thus, it doesn't define how to do it. In the previous laboratory I've worked I was doing it according to ISO-5725-2. But I haven't analysed it in-depth. In my current laboratory they do it in the way that is in my opinion not suitable. I asked my boss to change this procedure but he requires me to explain in details every bit of this procedure (or simplified version from CLSI EP05-A2). There is one part I don't understand, thus I ask for explanation. NOTE: There are two differences between those two guidelines that might be important to good explanation: ISO-5725 is working on in-lab variance and between-lab variance where EP05 in-day variance and between-day ISO-5725 allows to remove outliers thus series can have different numbers of measurement where EP05 assumes equal groups. ad 1. I discussed it with some guys proficient in stats and the conclusion was that expanding from in-day to between-day is calculated the same as from in-lab to between-lab. Basic model: $S_R^2 = S_r^2 + S_I^2$ where: $S_R^2$ - variance of reproducibility $S_r^2$ - variance of repeatability (in-day or in-lab) $S_I^2$ - intermediate variance (between-day or between-lab) Given 3 series by 6 measurements, I assume that there are no differences in calculations if those series are separated by different reproducibility criterion (different day or different lab). If I'm wrong here, please explain me why? So, step by step, what I understand and what I don't. A) Both guidelines have some obvious calculation that don't need explanation, like in-group variations, in-group means and overall mean. B) AFAIU both guidelines calculate repeatability the same way with respect for the allowed difference in number of measurements. For EP05 it is: $$ S_r^2 = \frac {\sum_{d=1}^{D} \sum_{r=1}^{n} (x_{rd}-\overline{x_d})^2}{D(n-1)} $$ where: $D$ - total number of days $n$ - total number of replicates per day $x_{dr}$ - result for replicate r on day d $\overline{x_d}$ - average of all replicates on day d As I understand it is basic mean of each day variance. For ISO it is: $$ S_{r}^2 = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{p} (n_{i}-1)S_{i}^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{p} (n_{i}-1)} $$ where: $S_i^2$ - variance of measurement group i $n_i$ - total number of samples in group i $p$ - total number of groups As I understand it is weighted mean of each day variance. If all groups have the same number of samples, it is the same as in EP05. The part where I'm bit lost and need explanation. C) Intermediate precision and reproducibility from EP05. The first step is to calculate the variance of the daily means: $$ S_{d}^2 = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{D} (\overline{x_d}- \overline{\overline{x}})^2}{D - 1} $$ where: D - total number of days $\overline{x_d}$ - average of all replicates on day d $\overline{\overline{x}}$ average of all results That is clear for me. But after that there is something like this: $$ S_{R}^2 = \frac {n-1}{n} × S_{r}^2 + S_{d}^2 $$ where: $n$ - total number of replicates per each day It is clear for me why reproducibility variance is calculated as addition of repeatability variance and variance of means between days. But why there is $\frac {n-1}{n}$ in this formula? That is the part I don't understand in EP05 D) In ISO-5725 this part looks bit different. (And there is partiall explanation for $\frac {n-1}{n}$ from EP05) Last sum $S_R^2 = S_r^2 + S_I^2$ is as in the general model. But: $$ S_{I}^2 = \frac {S_{D}^2 - S_{r}^2} {\overline{\overline{n}}} $$ where: $$ \overline{\overline{n}} = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{p} n_i - \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{p} n_{i}^2 }{\sum_{i=1}^{p} n_i}} {p -1} $$ $\overline{\overline{n}}$ for all equal groups = n Side question: What kind of weighting $\overline{\overline{n}}$ is? Do it have a name? and: $$ S_{D}^2 = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{p} n_i ( \overline {x_{i}} - \overline{\overline{x}}) ^2 } {p -1} $$ $S_{D}^2$ is like variance of daily means but every squared deviation from overall mean is multiplied by respective number of measurements in this group. If I understand properly, this together with $\overline{\overline{n}}$ it is for weighting variances of groups that have different measurements numbers. If all groups are equal $S_{D}^2 = n × S_{d}^2$ So for eqal groups: $$ S_{I}^2 = \frac {n × S_{d}^2 - S_{r}^2} {n} = S_{d}^2 - \frac {S_{r}^2} {n} $$ and thus: $$ S_{R}^2 = S_r^2 + S_I^2 = S_r^2 + S_{d}^2 - \frac {S_{r}^2} {n} =\frac {n-1}{n} × S_{r}^2 + S_{d}^2 $$ So, forcing equal groups we get the same final formula as EP05. I t doesn't help me much. I can only rephrase my question as: Why repeatability is divided by n in $ S_{I}^2 = S_{d}^2 - \frac {S_{r}^2} {n} $ ? I'll appreciate any help or directions where I can find answer Radek
