How do I include a table in another table's cell in Microsoft Report viewer

I am working on a project which includes creating some reports and I am using Microsoft Report Viewer for this. Let's say I have Table 1 and I need to put another table let's say Table 2 into a cell of Table 1, when I drag Table 2 into Table 1's referred cell I get the below error The tablix ‘Tablix1’ has a detail member with inner members. Detail members can only contain static inner members. How can I achieve this? Is it something about parent groups or child groups?
