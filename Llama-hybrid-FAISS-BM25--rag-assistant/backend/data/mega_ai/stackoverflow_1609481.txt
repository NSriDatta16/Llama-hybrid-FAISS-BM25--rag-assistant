Not built-in, but there is Array::Compare . This is one of the operations that's left out of the Perl core for what I believe are didactic reasons -- that is, if you're trying to do it, there's probably something wrong. The most illustrative example of this, I think, is the absence of a core read_entire_file function; basically, providing that function in the core would lead people to think it's a good idea to do that, but instead, Perl is designed in a way that gently nudges you toward processing files line-at-a-time, which is generally far more efficient and otherwise a better idea, but novice programmers are rarely comfortable with it and they need some encouragement to get there. The same applies here: there is probably a much better way to make the determination you're trying to accomplish by comparing two arrays. Not necessarily , but probably. So Perl is nudging you to think about other ways of accomplishing your goal.
