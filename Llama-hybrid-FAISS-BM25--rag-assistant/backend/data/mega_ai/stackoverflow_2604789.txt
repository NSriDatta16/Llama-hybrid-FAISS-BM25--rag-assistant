quick question about memory management in AS3

the following method will be called many times. i'm concerned the continuous call for new rectangles will add potentially unnecessary memory consumption, or is the memory used to produce the previous rectangle released/overwritten to accommodate another rectangle since it is assigned to the same instance variable? private function onDrag(evt:MouseEvent):void { this.startDrag(false, dragBounds()); } private function dragBounds():Rectangle { var stagebounds = new Rectangle(0 - swatchRect.x, 0 - swatchRect.y, stage.stageWidth - swatchRect.width, stage.stageHeight - swatchRect.height); return stagebounds; }
