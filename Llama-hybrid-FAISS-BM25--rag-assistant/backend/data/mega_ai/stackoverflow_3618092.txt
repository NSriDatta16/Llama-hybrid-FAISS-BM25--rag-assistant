You need to add the forward declaration of Agent in Timing.h // Timing.h #ifndef _Timing_h #define _Timing_h class Agent; // fwd declaration. class Timing{ private: typedef struct Message{ Agent* _agent; // without fwd decln Agent type is unknown here. // rest all same. EDIT: As suggested by others, you should not be including Agent.h in Timing.h
