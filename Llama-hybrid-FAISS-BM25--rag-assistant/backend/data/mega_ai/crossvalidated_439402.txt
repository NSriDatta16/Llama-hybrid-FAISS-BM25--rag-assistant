Determining the Total Uncertainty in the Center of a Spectral Line Fit (Physics Experiment)

Currently I am doing a Physics Experiment that requires fitting spectral lines and the fit I chose was a Voigt Profile. The data that I am fitting has multiple peaks so the fit is the superposition of three separate peaks. Here is an example of what that looks like: I am using a python library I found called lmfit which minimizes the fit and also gives a descriptive report of the parameters and their uncertainties: # fitting method = leastsq # function evals = 183 # data points = 1200 # variables = 10 chi-square = 0.25969125 reduced chi-square = 2.1823e-04 Akaike info crit = -10106.0064 Bayesian info crit = -10055.1056 [[Variables]] D_amplitude: 0.44051227 +/- 0.01786331 (4.06%) (init = 0.537109) D_center: 6558.02131 +/- 0.00382755 (0.00%) (init = 6558) D_sigma: 0.26938178 +/- 0.00572091 (2.12%) (init = 0.3) D_gamma: 0.26938178 +/- 0.00572091 (2.12%) == 'D_sigma' D_fwhm: 0.97012209 +/- 0.01252836 (1.29%) == '1.0692*D_gamma+sqrt(0.8664*D_gamma**2+5.545083*D_sigma**2)' D_height: 0.34129628 +/- 0.01068745 (3.13%) == '(D_amplitude/(max(2.220446049250313e-16, D_sigma*sqrt(2*pi))))*wofz((1j*D_gamma)/(max(2.220446049250313e-16, D_sigma*sqrt(2)))).real' H_amplitude: 0.03513989 +/- 0.00315456 (8.98%) (init = 0.537109) H_center: 6559.91608 +/- 0.02088388 (0.00%) (init = 6559.9) H_sigma: 0.17161126 +/- 0.01681055 (9.80%) (init = 0.15) H_gamma: 0.17161126 +/- 0.01681055 (9.80%) == 'H_sigma' H_fwhm: 0.61802204 +/- 0.03681380 (5.96%) == '1.0692*H_gamma+sqrt(0.8664*H_gamma**2+5.545083*H_sigma**2)' H_height: 0.04273624 +/- 0.00270988 (6.34%) == '(H_amplitude/(max(2.220446049250313e-16, H_sigma*sqrt(2*pi))))*wofz((1j*H_gamma)/(max(2.220446049250313e-16, H_sigma*sqrt(2)))).real' v3_amplitude: 0.38711251 +/- 0.02853380 (7.37%) (init = 0.537109) v3_center: 6556.82464 +/- 0.07336412 (0.00%) (init = 6556.1) v3_sigma: 0.74169925 +/- 0.03532997 (4.76%) (init = 0.4) v3_gamma: 0.74169925 +/- 0.03532997 (4.76%) == 'v3_sigma' v3_fwhm: 2.67107458 +/- 0.07736990 (2.90%) == '1.0692*v3_gamma+sqrt(0.8664*v3_gamma**2+5.545083*v3_sigma**2)' v3_height: 0.10893091 +/- 0.00575726 (5.29%) I have taken 10 measurements of this exact same spectral line and have used the same fit 10 times. My goal is to record the center of the "H" and "D" peaks and their uncertainties. I am struggling to understand what exactly that reported uncertainty should be. For example, looking at the "H" peak (green) the uncertainty in the center is about +-0.02. This clearly isn't the uncertainty I should report, correct? To me, it seems way too small. Especially since the error in the other parameters are around 10%. My question is: How should I report this uncertainty? How can I incorporate the goodness of fit to find the "true" (not sure if this is good wording) uncertainty in one parameter? If anyone could help out with this or point me in the right direction, it would be much appreciated. Also, if I am thinking completely wrong about the entire problem, let me know! Thanks for any help!
