Folder Structure Zend Framework organizes their classes by functionality and names them as such. For example the class Zend_Controller_Action_Helper_AjaxContext is located at /library/Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/AjaxContext.php . This serves two purposes: Folder organization and logical separation of functionality. You'll always run into the problem of 'remembering what you build` but by applying SRP and placing functionality where it is logically 'most correct' you can cut down on confusion. IDE When dealing with a lot of classes an intelligent IDE is essential. Shortcuts that allow a developer to quickly lookup classes, filenames, and methods anywhere in the project make dealing with thousands of classes almost trivial. Using the same example as above one should be able to find the class in a variety of ways: Looking up the class name. In EclipsePDT it's as easy as ctrl+shift+T to lookup classes (types). (note: I honestly don't know if this is a feature of eclipse or an addition by the PDT plugins). Similarly, you can lookup by filename using ctrl+shift+R (resource). Or by method within the class ctrl+shift+m
