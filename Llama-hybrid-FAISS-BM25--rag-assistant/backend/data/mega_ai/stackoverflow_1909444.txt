How to prevent vertex from overlapping?

I use Jung to draw graphs. Below is a simple graph with tree layout that looks fine. All renderers and transformers are default. alt text http://czuk.eu/stackoverflow/ballon_layout_default_size.png Now, I have changed the default size of the nodes to 100px by setting a custom VertexShapeTransformer . The problem is that the nodes started to overlap. Here you can see how it looks: alt text http://czuk.eu/stackoverflow/ballon_layout_size_100px.png Is it possible to get rid of the vertex overlapping? Is it a matter of layout or some kind of shape transformation? Thank you in advance for any suggestions :-)
