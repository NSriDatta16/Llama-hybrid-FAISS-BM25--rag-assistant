Best models to determine the impact of demographic variables on chances of winning a competition?

I have a dataset where two teams generally compete against each other . For each team, I've gathered demographic characteristics such as the percentage of males, the number of males, average age, percentage of whites, and the number of whites, along with a binary variable (1 or 0) indicating whether a team won a competition. I'm interested in understanding how these variables might influence a team's chances of winning a competition . I've already implemented a probit model as the most straightforward approach. Do you have any other suggestions for models that could serve as robustness checks ? One idea I had was to incorporate distance measures, such as measuring the "maleness," age, and "whiteness" distances, applying z-scores, and then running a probit analysis again. Are there any other models you recommend?
