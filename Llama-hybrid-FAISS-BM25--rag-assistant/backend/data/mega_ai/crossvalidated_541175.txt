Interpret negative values of mean decrease accuracy (MDA) in Random Forest

The random forest model has four predictor variables so I used mtry = 2 (i.e., square root of number of predictor variables) and ntree = 500 (i.e., default value). I used randomForest package for modeling and the results obtained is given below. Note: I have also tried increasing ntree to 1000 and 5000 but still received similar results. 1 2 3 4 5 Q3 8.378854 -1.001002 8.4573160 1.001002 -0.4656459 Q7 -5.174891 2.222748 6.9639438 2.182959 -7.6100442 Q9 -6.145550 2.932870 3.7822210 -0.478020 -3.6996359 Q10 -5.583726 2.878947 0.1527115 6.523781 -4.8365354 MeanDecreaseAccuracy MeanDecreaseGini Q3 11.0123237 5.024804 Q7 -0.5622868 10.899521 Q9 -1.9446498 12.623284 Q10 -3.9631560 6.234065 Subsequently, I used randomForestExplainer package to find top variables based on both Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease Gini (MDG). The plot below illustrating the results suggests that Q9 and Q7 are both top variables. However, the MDA values for both are negative. So, as a final result which variable should I use, since a negative MDA value for variable suggests that the variable is not predictive enough i.e. not important? On removing the variables with negative values we are left with Q3 only which is not a top variable.
