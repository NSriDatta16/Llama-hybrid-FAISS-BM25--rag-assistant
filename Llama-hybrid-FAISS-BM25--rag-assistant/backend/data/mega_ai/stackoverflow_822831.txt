Performance of different storage structures will vary depending on the operations you require to carry out on said structure. General tests might be Sorting: Bubble, Merge Searching: Sequential, Sequential (with unsorted data), Binary Writing a function for testing these would involve filling up some arrays with an equal amount of random data and then performing the tests. Producing time based metrics of performance is generally pretty simple with these types of algorithms. Depending on language, you can time how long it takes to compute with the use of timers or simply storing/outputting the timestamps of each iteration point you choose.
