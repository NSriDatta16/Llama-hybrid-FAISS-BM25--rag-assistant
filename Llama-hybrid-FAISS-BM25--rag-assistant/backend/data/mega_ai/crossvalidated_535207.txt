As the Wikipedia entry on AIC notes, with $k$ the number of fitted parameters and $n$ the number of observations: The formula for the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is similar to the formula for AIC, but with a different penalty for the number of parameters. With AIC the penalty is $2k$ , whereas with BIC the penalty is $\ln(n) k$ . So if the AIC is the same between a coxph and a cph model on the same data, the difference must be in the definition of the number of observations, $n$ . Should that be the total number of cases, or the number of events? That's the substantive statistical issue behind this question. It turns out that the nobs() function, used by BIC() to retrieves the number of cases from an object, returns the total number of cases from a cph object, versus the number of events for coxph . A simple example from the survival vignette: > cfit1.coxph cfit1.coxph Call: coxph(formula = Surv(time, status) ~ age + sex + wt.loss, data = lung) coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p age 0.0200882 1.0202913 0.0096644 2.079 0.0377 sex -0.5210319 0.5939074 0.1743541 -2.988 0.0028 wt.loss 0.0007596 1.0007599 0.0061934 0.123 0.9024 Likelihood ratio test=14.67 on 3 df, p=0.002122 n= 214, number of events= 152 (14 observations deleted due to missingness) > nobs(cfit1.coxph) [1] 152 That's 214 cases, 152 events, and nobs() returns the number of events from the coxph object. In contrast: > cfit1.cph nobs(cfit1.cph) [1] 214 So with nobs() you get the total number of cases from a cph object. AICs are the same, BICs higher for cph as in this question: > AIC(cfit1.coxph) [1] 1352.112 > AIC(cfit1.cph) [1] 1352.112 > BIC(cfit1.coxph) [1] 1361.183 > BIC(cfit1.cph) [1] 1362.21 The difference in BIC values is (within rounding) what you would expect with 3 parameters fitted: > BIC(cfit1.coxph)-BIC(cfit1.cph) [1] -1.026287 > 3*log(nobs(cfit1.coxph))-3*log(nobs(cfit1.cph)) [1] -1.026286 As you should only be doing BIC comparisons on the same data set, either stick to one of coxph() or cph() , or recalculate BIC to use a single nobs() value of choice: do you want case number or event number?
