What is possible in Java not in C# and vice versa

In our real life Java and C# both has a significant effect. Personally I love Java because of its complexity also I have experience in C# too. I want to know, from desktop application to robotics, web application to machine learning what are the fields which are possible in Java but not currently available in C# and vice versa. Thank you.
