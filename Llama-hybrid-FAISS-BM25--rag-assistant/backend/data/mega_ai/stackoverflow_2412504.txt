Basically, the situation with this could be extrapolated for most of the best practices: You can do it otherwise, but most often that not, you shouldn't. It's not that you can't go only with drawable-hdpi , but the addition of drawable-ldpi and drawable-mdpi offers you the ability to customize and fine tune your assets, at the price of bulking up a little your application. Please, keep in mind that this bulking up won't be so dramatic - if you assume that: the resource size is proportional to the pixel count the differences between assets for different resolutions are proportional to the difference between resolutions the folder drawable-mdpi will be just 37% of drawable-hdpi and drawable-ldpi will be just 18% of drawable-hdpi Also suffixes for res folders are especially useful when used together - you can have full control over the application. In some cases, resources are pre-defined for a lot more than high-medium-low density screens, so I would say that you shouldn't worry that much for the additional bulk. As you've thought out, you can avoid the dynamic scaling of the resources (worse than scaling beforehand). It won't be that much of a problem, but most of the time, if you can avoid operations on the device by doing additional preparations in the development/production process, that's a good thing.
