Syncdb should really only be used for development. That's why it doesn't really matter if you wipe the tables and start again, perhaps exporting look up data into a json file that you can import each time you sync. When your site reaches production however, you have a little more work. Any changes you make to your models that need to be reflected in the database, need to be emitted as SQL and run manually on the database. There's a django-admin.py function to emit the suggested SQL, which you can use to build up a script to run on the database to migrate it. Like you mention, a migrations app like South can be beneficial here but it's not strictly needed. As far as your separation of sites goes, run them as separate sites/projects. You can have a separate settings file per project which allows you to run two different databases. This is in contrast to running the two sites as separate apps within the same project. If they're totally separate they probably shouldn't be in the same project unless you need to leverage common code.
