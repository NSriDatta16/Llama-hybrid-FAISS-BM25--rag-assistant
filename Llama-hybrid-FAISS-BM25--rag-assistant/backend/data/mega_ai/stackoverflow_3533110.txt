Since nobody did a for loop. long GetPhoneNumber(string PhoneNumberText) { // Returns 0 on error StringBuilder TempPhoneNumber = new StringBuilder(PhoneNumberText.Length); for (int i=0;i used like this: long phoneNumber = GetPhoneNumber("(123) 456-7890"); Update As pr commented many countries do have zero's in the begining of the number, if you need to support that, then you have to return a string not a long. To change my code to do that do the following: 1) Change function return type from long to string. 2) Make the function return null instead of 0 on error 3) On successfull parse make it return PhoneNumberText
