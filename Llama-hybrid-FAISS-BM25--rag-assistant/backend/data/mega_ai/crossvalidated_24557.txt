Isn't a test for cointegration the same as testing for heteroskedasticity in the residual error terms?

Testing for cointegration tests to see if the residuals from a regression between the two variables is a stationary process. So wouldn't a test on those residuals for heteroskedasticity be the same thing? To detect if the variance of the errors is stable and the error terms are not a random walk? Wouldn't a White test or Breusch-Pagan test for heteroskedasticity be the same as an Augmented Dickey-Fuller test? Both would detect if the errors are getting bigger or have a constant variance, right? An increasing variance would imply a random walk and unit root, correct?
