There is no canonical way of representing a graph in a feature space. One possible way to go is to use a graph embedding algorithm. Examples are isomap, t-SNE and mapping based on eigenvectors of graph laplacian. But such mappings may not produce nice features for machine learning. You can also have a look at graph kernels literature. They provide a direct method to find a similarity measure between graphs, and some can deal with node labels. Finding a canonical representation for a graph can solve the graph isomorphism problem, which is supposed to be a hard problem (not known to be P or NP).
