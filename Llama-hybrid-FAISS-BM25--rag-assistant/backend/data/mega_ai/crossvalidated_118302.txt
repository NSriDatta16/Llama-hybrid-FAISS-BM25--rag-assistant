Use cases for a unique metric

So I was thinking about this question: Maximum minus average? This question is on hold while work calls me. When I get a chance I am going to substantially update it. Background: At my previous job, I was able to find a metric that started triggering (onset of sensitivity) at 1.15 standard deviations from the mean, and reliably triggered above 1.54 standard deviations. The metric of Mean-to-max has onset at about 2.84 standard deviations, and the metric min-to-max has onset at about 2.69 standard deviations. This was applied to pre-reflow solder-ball coplanarity as a predictor of solder-joint reliability after reflow. The idea was that a pre-reflow outlier would not behave as it should and would cause itself (if too small) or its neighbors (if too large) to not reflow properly. The Question/s: What are some real-world use cases where "this thing isn't like its normally-distributed neighbors" detection is useful? (outside of solder-balls) Are there metrics that have sensitivity on 1200 samples of a normally distributed phenomena that can detect outlierhood at thresholds below 1.15 standard deviations from the mean? If so, what are they? How do they work? What is their onset of sensitivity? At what level of variation does the signal unilaterally emerge from noise? How do I determine whether something like this might be valuable to "the community of (statistics-oriented) scholars"?
