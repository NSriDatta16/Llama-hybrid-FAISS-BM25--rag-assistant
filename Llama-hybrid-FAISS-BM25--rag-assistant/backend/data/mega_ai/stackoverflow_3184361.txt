The Zend Framework is one such framework, which has almost the same structure as Magento and uses the correct MVC architecture (as many other versions of MVC architectures exist, which are implemented in many available PHP frameworks). However, the Magento framework has been greatly modified by Varien, to suit its requirements, thus providing support for controlling templates & modules using XML configuration files. Also I think that this is Magento framework's unique characteristic feature. So, all in all, I think Magento (with its barebones) must be used as you already are using & so does "silvo". Hope it helps.
