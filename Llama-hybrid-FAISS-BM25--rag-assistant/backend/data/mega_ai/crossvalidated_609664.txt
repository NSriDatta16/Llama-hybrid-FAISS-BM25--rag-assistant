how to find anomalies for a non-normal distribution with seasonality?

I have a time series broken down by day, and there are gaps in it that I have marked in red: the distribution there is not normal How do we approach modeling a system that will look for anomalies here if they appear? Because if you differentiate as I did above and try to set limits, for example, using Z score or IQr, it is obvious that anomalies will be growth that is typical and normal. I don't know how to approach this problem, what methods to use and where to go, please tell me.
