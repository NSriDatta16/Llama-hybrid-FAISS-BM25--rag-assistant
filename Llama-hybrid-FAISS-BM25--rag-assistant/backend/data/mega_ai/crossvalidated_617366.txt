Gradient vs differences to remove non-stationarity in time series?

When dealing with non-stationary time series (for instance, in auto-correlation analysis), differencing (computing absolute differences between consecutive samples/observations) is often regarded as the simplest method of de-trending the data. In theory, the first derivative (similar to what is obtained when computing the gradient using central differences ) should also remove any underlying trends in the time series. What would be the advantages/drawbacks of using one over the other?
