Why is still in HTML5, but isn’t? I’d assume is still around because it’s often used for side comments, disclaimers, etc in practice, and there isn’t an existing HTML element suited to the task. Ian Hickson tried to design HTML5 based on how HTML was used in practice: paving the cowpaths. Thus there are places where logic is sacrificed for practicability. (As it says on the WHATWG blog, “Please leave your sense of logic at the door, thanks!” . If people are already using for side comments, and aren’t using for anything meaningful (I say “if” as there’s plenty of room to debate and/or research that), then why not enshrine the common usage of the former in the spec, and remove the latter? Why are and still in HTML5 if they’re purely visual in effect? and have been redefined to have meaning in HTML5, although it’s a very light form of meaning: : “a span of text in an alternate voice or mood” : “a span of text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes” They’re now general purpose elements, to be used to distinguish runs of text for reasons not covered specifically by another tag.
