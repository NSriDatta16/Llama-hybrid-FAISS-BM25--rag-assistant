Firstly pca is a traditional method for image size reduction. Without any neural net , pca will work well for image compression. Neural nets are generally used for the more complicated problem of image recognition. I'm not sure how pca will interact with auto encoding, and I'm not convinced that there is a mathematical and general answer. I speculate as follows. PCA is essentially a linear operation, while neural nets are very non-linear. Once the non-linear operation of auto-encoding is applied, PCA will not be able to reconstruct the variables properly. In particular, it may have issues with the the third dimension since PCA is naturally a 2D tensor operator. This means it should have trouble with 3 colors.
