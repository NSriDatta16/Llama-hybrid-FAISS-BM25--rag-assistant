You probably have some kind of object in the array that it cannot write out into a plist (which is by default the storage mechanism for an array). Common examples would be any custom class, a UIImage, or NSNull (since you have JSON you are parsing). If you cannot make a plist by hand that has what you are trying to save out then the array cannot write it either.
