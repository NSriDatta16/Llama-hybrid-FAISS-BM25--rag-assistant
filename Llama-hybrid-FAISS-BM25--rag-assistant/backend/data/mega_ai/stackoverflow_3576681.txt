There's a lot of thread claiming - waiting to lock (a com.sun.deploy.security.CPCallbackHandler$ParentCallback) Is that held somewhere in the snipped output? It seems like you are intentionally mixing trusted and untrusted code ("mixed code"), which is a Bad Thing. From 6u19 a warning dialog is shown (really the attempt should be automatically blocked, but there appears to be plenty of code out there exploiting the bug). It's this warning dialog that appears to be causing the problem. To fix, don't mix trusted and untrusted code. It's a good idea to add "Trusted-Only: true" to the manifest of each jar.
