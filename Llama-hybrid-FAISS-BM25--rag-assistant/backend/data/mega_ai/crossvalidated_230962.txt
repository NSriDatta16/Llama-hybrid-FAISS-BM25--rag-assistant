My view of the contrast between Bayesian and frequentist inference is that the first issue is the choice of the event for which you want a probability. Frequentists assume what you are trying to prove (e.g., a null hypothesis) then compute the probability of observing something that you already observed, under that assumption. There is an exact analogy between such reverse-information flow-order probabilities and sensitivity and specificity in medical diagnosis, which have caused enormous misunderstandings and need to be bailed out by Bayes' rule to get forward probabilities ("post-test probabilities"). Bayesians compute the probability of an event, and absolute probabilities are impossible to compute without an anchor (the prior). The Bayesian probability of the veracity of a statement is much different from the frequentist probability of observing data under a certain unknowable assumption. The differences are more pronounced when the frequentist must adjust for other analyses that have been done or could have been done (multiplicity; sequential testing, etc.). So the discussion of the mathematical basis is very interesting and is a very appropriate discussion to have. But one has to make a fundamental choice of forwards vs. backwards probabilities. Hence what is conditioned upon, which isn't exactly math, is incredibly important. Bayesians believe that full conditioning on what you already know is key. Frequentists more often condition on what makes the mathematics simple.
