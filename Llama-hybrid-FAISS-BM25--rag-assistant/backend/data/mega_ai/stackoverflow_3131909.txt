how to design a single methon in DAL to retrieve various result from database?

we have designed our Data Access Layer and parts of it works as a charm without any problem but we have some doubts about designing a method to get a reference of sqlcommand from us and return a single row data from database also the retrieved data has an unknown data type here is what I've done : //I am using this class as retrieval datatype for now i have only 3 returning data types public class retDataTypes { public bool ansBool; public int ansInt; public string ansString; } public class doQuery { public retDataTypes returnAnswer(ref sqlcommand cmd , string typeHelper) { //opening the sqlconnection //pass the cmd then retDataTypes answer = new retDataTypes(); //in most of the cases we need only one row result so that I'm using executeScalar() switch (typeHelper) { case "string" : answer.ansString = cmd.executescalar(); break; case "int" : answer.ansInt = cmd.executescalar(); break; case "bool" : answer.ansBool = cmd.executescalar(); break; } return answer; } I need your opinion about this approach is it good ( I know its not efficient) and is there any better ways than this? please let me know. regards.
