First of all, the sample size of 30 is not valid here, 30 is the sample size required for approximating the t-distribution with a normal distribution. The variable you are sampling is binomial so you can't use the $n=30$ rule of thumb. It's not clear what you wanted to do after 30 samples. Were you going to use those 30 samples as a pilot study to then calculate a required sample size? You are right that using $0.5$ as an estimate will give an upper bound on the required samples. Since you have on information about the true proportion that you are trying to estimate, one thing you could do is to use a Bayesian approach. Use a non-informative prior for the true proportion and calculate an expected sample size required for your test, this will give an estimate smaller than when assuming the proportion is $0.5$.
