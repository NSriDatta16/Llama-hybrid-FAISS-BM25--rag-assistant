Maildrop: Filter mail by Date: header

I'm using getmail + maildrop + mutt + msmtp chain with messages stored in Maildir. Very big inbox bothers me, so i wanted to organize mail by date like that: Maildir |-2010.11->all messages with "Date: *, * Nov 2010 *" |-2010.12->same as above... |-2011.01 `-2011.02 I've googled much and read about mailfilter language, but still it is hard for me to write such filter. Maildrop's mailing list archives has almost nothing on this (as far as i scanned through it). There is some semi-solution on https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3092/organize-email-by-date-using-procmail-or-maildrop , but i don't like it, because i want to use "Date:" header and i want to sort by month like "YEAR.MONTH" in digits. Any help, thoughts, links, materials will be appreciated.
