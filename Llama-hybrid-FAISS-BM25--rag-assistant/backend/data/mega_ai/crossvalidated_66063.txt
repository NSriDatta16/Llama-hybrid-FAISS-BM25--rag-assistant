My answer would be that $\alpha_i$, usually interpreted as the unobserved heterogeneity, is a random variable in the sense that it varies over individuals. In that sense, you can say that it maybe correlated with other variables. However in the fixed effect model, $\alpha_i$ is not treated by the model as a random variable. It's just a set of parameters and in a frequentist framework, parameters are not considered as random variables. I'm not a specialist in bayesian statistics, but I can imagine that in a bayesian framework, you would not have this "puzzle" since parameters are themselves treated as random variables.
