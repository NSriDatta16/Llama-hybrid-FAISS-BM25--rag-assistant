2 basic but interesting questions about .NET

when I first saw C#, I thought this must be some joke. I was starting with programming in C. But in C# you could just drag and drop objects, and just write event code to them. It was so simple. Now, I still like C the most, because I am very attracted to the basic low level operations, and C is just next level of assembler, with few basic routines, so I like it very much. Even more because I write little apps for micro-controllers. But yesterday I wrote very simple control program for my micro-controller based LED cube in asm, and I needed some way to simply create animation sequences to the Cube. So, I remembered C#. I have practically NO C# skills, but still I created simple program to make animation sequences in about hour with GUI, just with help of google and help of the embedded function descriptions in C#. So, to get to the point, is there some other reason then top speed, to use any other language than C#? I mean, it is so effective. I know that Java is a bit of similar, but I expect C# to be more Windows effective since its directly from Microsoft. The second question is, what is the advantage of compiling into CIL, and than run by CLR, than directly compile it into machine code? I know that portability is one, but since C# is mainly for Windows, wouldnÂ´t it be more powerful to just compile it directly? Thanks.
