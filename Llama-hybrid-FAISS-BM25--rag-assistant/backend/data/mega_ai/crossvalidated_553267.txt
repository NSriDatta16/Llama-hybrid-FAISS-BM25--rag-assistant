Forecasting with log transformed data and then taking the exponential of my predictions

I am aware a similar question was asked here Interpreting forecast predictions of log transformed data . But I would like a deeper comment/answer. I have a time series and want to make forecast. I found that taking the log of my series (all positive values), helps with my increasing variance over time. If my first difference series is stationary, when I make a forecast with ARIMA(p,1,q), is it safe to take the exponential of my predictions, so to get my predictions back in levels? What problems are there with this procedure?
