I'm not sure why your data set looks like this (having different steps of future result as a single label) so provide some info about the context of your data. But you can use any Neural Network, Fuzzy Network and so on. you just need to consider your labels as continuous variables and then in final step round you network outputs. You probably don't need any recurrent or dynamic network, because your data already has lots of delays in it which is possibly able to represent dynamic behavior of your system behind data. You can also use Multi-Step ahead prediction instead. for example using your Instant1_feature predict or estimate [s21_var1 s21_var2]. then use a feature vector which looks like Instant2_feature but with your estimations of [s21_var1 s21_var2] replaced with real values of [s21_var1 s21_var2]. I hope this helps.
