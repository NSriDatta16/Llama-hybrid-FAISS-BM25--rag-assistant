When to use f1_macro vs f1_weighted?

My dataset is imbalanced. The labels are binary. I'm training 2 logistic regression models. For the first one, I didnt balance the model with class_weight and used f1_macro. Was it correct for me to use f1_macro? for the 2nd Logistic model I set class_weight='balanced' . Should I use f1_macro or f1_wighted here?
