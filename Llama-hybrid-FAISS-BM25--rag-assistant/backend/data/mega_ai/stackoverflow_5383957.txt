WPF Drag And Drop DataBinding

Hey guys, I'm starting to wrap WPF around my head and I came to a dead end. I have a ListBox that accepts files/folders by drag and drop. I have a Files Class witch contains files properties like "Name", "Thumbnail" [and so on] and a FilesCollection Class well it's self intuitive. The Collection takes a "FilesPath" and then it retrieves all the files from that path. Currently it has a static path associated with it but I want that path to change when I drag a folder to the ListBox. So what I want is: when I drag a folder to the ListBox, associate the path of it to the FilesCollection Class
