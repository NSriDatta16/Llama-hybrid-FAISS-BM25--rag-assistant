Symfony can do what you are looking for using a mix of concepts. Layout - This is the main structure used to decorate a page. Template - This is the main view attached to a URL by the controller. Fragments - Lightweight and uses data you pass to it. Component - Used if you need access to the model, the code is split between presentation and logic. Slot - used to replace a defined section of the layout. In your case the layout would have the main content included using the template logic which is the core of the view layer and the other items would be either fragments or components depending on how much of the model they would need to access. The Symfony documentation has a full explanation of this.
