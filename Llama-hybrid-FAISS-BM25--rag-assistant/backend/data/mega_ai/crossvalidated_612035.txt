is bayesian poisson regression remotely relevant in this scenario?

I am working with data collected in a community. We know the basic information about the community, let's say the racial composition is 60% black and 40% white, in a city of population = 500,000. I now have a list of incidents (fewer than 200 of them in total). Let's assume people involved in these incidents are either black or white. I want to be able to test if probability of a racial group involved in these incidents are unusually high/low, considering the racial composition that we know of this city. We don't have data for people who are NOT involved. My question is: what tests should I use? I recently attended a talk about bayesian analysis so I'm leaning that direction. Given the small number of incidents perhaps poisson regression will be more appropriate? Also, these incidents happened in different neighborhood, maybe 10-15 each neighborhood. It seems we need to rely on some mixed effect modeling. Is this right? Or I may be overthinking. Thank you very much.
