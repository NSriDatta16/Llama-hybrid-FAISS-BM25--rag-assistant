I couldn't say what's best , per se, but I can tell you what I prefer: jQuery. jQuery is an immensely useful library. Perhaps the most interesting and useful thing about it is that you select elements of your page to manipulate just like you do with CSS. Targeting any element with the id of "container" is as easy as $("#container"). Want all paragraphs with a shiny class? You'd use $("p.shiny"). The How jQuery Works tutorial and others, linked right here on the homepage are well written and will get you on your feet if you know some CSS and JavaScript basics. jQuery will not replace JavaScript - it's written in JavaScript, and you still need to know something about it. The slogan is no lie - jQuery will change the way that you write JavaScript.
