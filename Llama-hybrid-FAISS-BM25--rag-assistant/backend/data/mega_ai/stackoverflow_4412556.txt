How are you applying the images? You can just use fill_parent for the layout_width/height of an ImageView, and select fitCenter for the scaleType. It's perfectly correct for the Galaxy Tab to be reporting as medium dpi (although I thought the resolution of the Tab was 1024 x 600?), even though it is a high resolution . The dpi is a measurement of the size of the pixels (e.g. the number of pixels in an inch). So a 480 x 800 resolution in a 4" screen will have a higher dpi than a 480 x 800 resolution in a 7" display, simply because they are compressed into a smaller space. You can actually add an extra drawables folder called drawable-large-mdpi that could contain files for a large screened medium dpi device, such as the Tab (see here for more information on those qualifiers).
