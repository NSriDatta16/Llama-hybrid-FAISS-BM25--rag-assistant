This book chapter is a pretty good explanation of MCMC techniques for general state space models; you might want to start with this. For your particular model here, instead of looking at a review paper, you can have a look at this paper , which features a rather involved Metropolis-within-Blocked-Gibbs sampling procedure. It is all detailed in Appendix B. Many of the distributions are multivariate Gaussian, and for those that aren't, they either use a Metropolis-Hastings sampler, or a method discussed in this other paper . This is the other paper that I know of that implements this model, and they use a different Gibbs technique.
