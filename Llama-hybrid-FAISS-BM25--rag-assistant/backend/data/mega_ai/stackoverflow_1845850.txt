Opening IE Window from within Flex

All I need to open a new IE Window from within Flex code on click of a link. P.S I dont want to open a new Browser. I want to open a browser window only that can open a new URL. Something like clicking on a link in Flex and then open cnnibn.com in a Pop up window.
