Python Newbie: Returning Multiple Int/String Results in Python

I have a function that has several outputs, all of which "native", i.e. integers and strings. For example, let's say I have a function that analyzes a string, and finds both the number of words and the average length of a word. In C/C++ I would use @ to pass 2 parameters to the function. In Python I'm not sure what's the right solution, because integers and strings are not passed by reference but by value (at least this is what I understand from trial-and-error), so the following code won't work: def analyze(string, number_of_words, average_length): ... do some analysis ... number_of_words = ... average_length = ... If i do the above, the values outside the scope of the function don't change. What I currently do is use a dictionary like so: def analyze(string, result): ... do some analysis ... result['number_of_words'] = ... result['average_length'] = ... And I use the function like this: s = "hello goodbye" result = {} analyze(s, result) However, that does not feel right. What's the correct Pythonian way to achieve this? Please note I'm referring only to cases where the function returns 2-3 results, not tens of results. Also, I'm a complete newbie to Python, so I know I may be missing something trivial here... Thanks
