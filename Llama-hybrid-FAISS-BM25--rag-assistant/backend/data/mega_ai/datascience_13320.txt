I think the easiest way to do that is by using some machine, some bots. Recently I found one called Octoparse and the solution goes like this: Drop an “Loop Item” into the Workflow Designer in the bot. Then select a “loop mode” > Choose “text list” Enter the terms you want to search in the search bar. Next, click on the search box. Choose “Enter text value”. Drag “Enter text value” into the “Loop Item” box so that the program will loop to enter the keywords, and automatically search them in the search box. Then select “Use current loop text to fill the text box”. Then click "save". Next, capture the term entered. Click the search box and select “Extract value of this item”. The search item you just captured will be added to the extracted result. 8. Click search button > choose “Click an item”. The information I want is on the detail page. So I need to create a list of item to get into that page. Click on the title > Select Create a list a item > Add current item to the list > Continue to edit the list. Click on the send title > Add current item to the list again. Then click “loop”. You may check the link to see if that's what you want.
