No, combining these columns would not result in any improvement. Indeed it seems you would extend the overall length (with the adding of prefix and separators, hence potentially worsening performance. A few other tricks however, may help: reduce the size of the values stored in "xxxAccount" columns, by removing altogether, or replacing with short-hand codes, the most common parts of these values (the examples shown indicate some kind of URL whereby the beginning will likely be repeated. depending on the average length of the bio, and typical text found therein, it may also be useful to find ways of shrinking its [storage] size, with simple replacement of common words, or possibly with actual compression (ZIP and such), although doing so may result in having to store the column in a BLOB column which may then become separated from the table, depending on the server implementation/configuration. And, of course, independently form any improvements at the level of the database, the use model indicated seems to prompt for caching this kind of data agressively, to avoid the trick to SQL altogether.
