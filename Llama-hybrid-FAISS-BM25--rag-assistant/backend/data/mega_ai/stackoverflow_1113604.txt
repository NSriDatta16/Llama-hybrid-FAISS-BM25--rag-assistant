I've split my product list template to a separate file so I can use it in several places. In the parent template, I do something like: getChild('product_list_list')->setData('products', $_productCollection); echo $this->getChildHtml('product_list_list'); ?> In the child template I can do: products as $_product): ?> // display products So you should be able to do: $this->getChild('item_info')->setData('item', $item); and then within item_info, access it as $this->item Hope that works for you. Works for me on magento 1.3, but it seems fairly fundamental, so probably common to all versions.
