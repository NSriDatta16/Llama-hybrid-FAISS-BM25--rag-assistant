Well, the 5.1 reference manual doesn't have anything in the os table , but if you use Nixstaller , you get os.fileexists for precisely what you've explained. If you can afford to fiddle around a bit, or if you know what OS you'll be running on, you might get away with the standard os library's os.execute with some system call that will identify if the file exists. Even better than os.execute might be os.rename: os.rename(oldname, newname) Renames file named oldname to newname . If this function fails, it returns nil, plus a string describing the error. You could try setting oldname and newname the same -- you might not have write permissions, though, so it might fail because you can't write, even though you can read. In that event, you'd have to parse the returned error string and deduce whether you could write, or you'd have to just try executing your function that needs an existing file, and wrap it in a pcall .
