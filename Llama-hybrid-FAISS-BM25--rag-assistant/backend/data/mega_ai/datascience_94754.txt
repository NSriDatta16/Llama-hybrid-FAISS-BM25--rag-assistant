In what way is recurrent neural network state "hidden"?

Recurrent neural networks have hidden state denoted $h$ . Why is the state considered "hidden"? It's clear to me what purpose the state itself serves, but I can't figure out why it is "hidden". To me, the state seem perfectly "visible" - not "hidden".
