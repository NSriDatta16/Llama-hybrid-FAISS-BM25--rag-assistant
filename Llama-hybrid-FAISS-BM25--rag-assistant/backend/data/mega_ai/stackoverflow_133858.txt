I would tend to organize by project, but now always. If you have access control aspects of your code, then organize to minimize permissions-administration ; this could also result in a per-team organization of the repository. By the way: You seem to expect to work in one big repository - which I think is clever, because it means better history handling: As soon as you move stuff between repositories, you loose history. In other words, I disagree with Ben Scheirman's advice on this.
