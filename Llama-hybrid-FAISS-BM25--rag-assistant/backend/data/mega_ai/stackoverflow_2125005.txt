A log usually implies some kind of more permanent storage, which might mean that it should be written to a file. If so, then a structure is not necessarily required. It could be implemented as a function that accepts the required information and generates the other information (e.g., time/date). But if it is indeed more of a temporary type of storage, then it could be stored in a simple circular array. Keep an index of the current position in the array and write to that position. typedef struct { int faultNumber; char faultName[50]; // length should probably be a #define char faultDate[20]; // date in C could be stored in some kind of char array. // or it could be something representing results of something // like a time_t result. } LOG_ENTRY; LOG_ENTRY LOGS[10]; int iCurPos = 0; Then add an entry at the current position and increment iCurPos and loop it back to 0 when it hits the end.
