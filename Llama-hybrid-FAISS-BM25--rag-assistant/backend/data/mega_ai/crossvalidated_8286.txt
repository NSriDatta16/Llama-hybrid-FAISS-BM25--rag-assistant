Indicators of disease

I have this dataset with size (rows) and shape (columns) and in each cell #disease/#in cell . How would I answer the following questions? Is size an indicator of disease? Is shape an indicator of disease? Is there a size*shape effect? Size shapea shapeb shapec %a %b %c =8 mm 33 / 276 18 / 26 8 / 146 12.0% 69.2% 5.5% Total 50 / 7282 19 / 70 12 / 943 0.7% 27.1% 1.3% Thanks, Luther88 Edits @suncoolsu in detail these are nodule data. size is the size of the nodule (the cutoffs are what have been published and accepted as standards). shape is the shape of the nodule. the numerator is the number of malignant nodules and the denominator is the number of nodules of given size and shape combinations. @onestop i do not have the raw data to do logistic regression. just this table. any further suggestions?
