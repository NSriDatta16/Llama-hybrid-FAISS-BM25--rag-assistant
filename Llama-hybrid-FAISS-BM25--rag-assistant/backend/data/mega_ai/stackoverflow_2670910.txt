Where is the best place to store globals in Rails app?

I was wondering if there is the best practice on where to store global settings in a rails app. What I mean by that is i.e: I have a few globals defined that may change, but not likely and it seems inappropriate to store them in DB since they are used so much. For instance I have SYSTEM_EMAIL & SYSTEM_EMAIL_SIGNATURE & SYSTEM_STORAGE_ROOT. Right now I keep them in environment.rb, but I'm not sure if this is the right palce to store them. Thank you EDIT: Accepted answer still stands as appropriate, however I since moved on to using https://github.com/markbates/configatron , there are other options but I like configatron the most.
