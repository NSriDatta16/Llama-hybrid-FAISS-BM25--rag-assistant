Any way to create a PDF so the text can't be copied/extracted back out?

I'm trying to help create a neighborhood directory and I want to discourage someone from harvesting contact info (especially email addresses) from that. Is there any easy way to prevent someone from copying and pasting that text from the PDF? Update Goal here is to make the PDF no easier to harvest email addresses from than the current paper directory, and to make the PDF directory as useful as the paper directory. The online pdf directory will have advantages such as always being up to date and saving some printing costs (or passing those costs on to folks who want to print the document).
