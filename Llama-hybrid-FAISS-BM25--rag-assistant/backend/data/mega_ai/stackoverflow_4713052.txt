Building executable from perl scripts programs using PAR on Activestate Windows

I am used to build windows executable programs from perl scripts using Activestate PDK; now I would like to give a try to the PAR way to do the same thing - still using Activestate distribution: > This is perl 5, version 12, subversion 2 (v5.12.2) built for MSWin32-x64-multi-t hread The documentation states: > Combines scanning, zipping and loader-embedding: % pp -o out.exe src.pl # self-contained .exe % out.exe # runs anywhere on the same OS but I am unable to find any executable pp.exe, pp.com o whatever. Sure, PAR installed, version 1.002 Any idea about what I am possibly overlooking/ignoring/forgetting? Many thanks!
