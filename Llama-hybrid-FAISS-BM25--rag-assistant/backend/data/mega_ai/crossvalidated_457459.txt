How to prove a multivariate r.v. does not follow the nonparanormal distribution?

Background You may find the definition of the non-paranormal distribution at the 2nd paragraph in p.2296 of this paper . In short, $(X_1, \ldots, X_p)$ is non-paranormal if there exists a set of strictly increasing functions such that $(f_1(X_1), \ldots, f_p(X_p))$ is multivariate Gaussian. Question I'm trying to think of an example of a multivariate random variable that is not non-paranormal. For example, how do I check if the multivariate t-distribution (with some d.f.) follows the non-paranormal distribution or not? Any comments are very much welcome!
