The error message is: schema_reference.4: Failed to read schema document 'http://www.josso.org/schema/josso-jboss42-agent.xsd', because 1) could not find the document; 2) the document could not be read; 3) the root element of the document is not . You get this kind of message if you use a additional spring namespace where the xsd is not found when starting spring. You can do two things: 1) fix the url, or 2) create a own jar file, put the xsd in it and add a spring.schemas File to its META-INF directory. The spring.schemas File is a kind of property file: key is the xsd url (you have to escape the ':' !) and the value is the location of the xsd file within the jar For example: http\://www.josso.org/schema/josso-jboss42-agent.xsd=org/josso.sechma/josso-jboss42-agent.xsd
