You can create a new identity column on table MainTable (named for example correlationid) and correlate inserted and deleted tables using this column. This new column should be transparent for existing code. INSERT INTO LOG(OLDID, NEWID) SELECT deleted.id AS OLDID, inserted.id AS NEWID FROM inserted INNER JOIN deleted ON inserted.correlationid = deleted.correlationid Pay attention, you could insert duplicate records in the log table.
