It would help a lot if you could provide a reprex (reproducible example) of your data. Also, this is more of a statistics question than a programming question so you might also do well to ask on Cross Validated. However, in general, it sounds like you will need to use a mixed effects model. A simple case of that would be repeated measures ANOVA, however, there you are restricted to categorical fixed-effects predictors. A much better option is to fit proper mixed effects model with specialized mixed effects package, e.g. lme4 , nlme , brms . Personally, I'd recommend brms because it's Bayesian, flexible, easy to use, and awesome. It makes it very easy to fit, visualize, and check even pretty complicated models. Anyway, here's how you would fit a simple mixed effects model in brms , predicting wt from gene and time and their interaction, with random slopes across your test subjects ( id ). library(brms) mod You'd probably want to specify priors, etc..., but there's a lot of tutorials about how to do that if you google around a bit.
