Update: You can mark your service to retain the service object in memory for the life of the session. [ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.PerSession)] class MyWebService{ CrossDomainWebServiceClient client = new CrossDomainWebServiceClient(); This should keep your cross-domain client initialized between calls. Original answer: The Silverlight object stays alive between calls so you can maintain state in memory. If you want to store state between runs of the Silverlight application you can serialize state to isolated storage on the client computer and read it back in when the Silverlight application starts up.
