Getting aggregated share in R

I have a data set that I need to analyze in R. A simplified version of it would be like this SessionNo. Objects OtherColumns A 2 . A 3 B 4 C 1 D 2 D 1 D 2 D 3 E 5 here each sessionno. represents one session of a broswer but due to the relation with other columns in the data it is aggregated like shown. So, Session 1 is now fragmented into two rows etc. What I need to find is the avg. number of objects downloaded per session (or any other statistics for no. of rows in each session). So, how do I count the no of objects for each session in R. Here, 5 objects in session A, 4 in session B, 8 in session D etc. I guess one way would be to sum the whole Objects column and count the no. of unique session numbers in SessionNo. But I guess it would be more of a general solution if I could group the unique session number with the total number of objects aggregated in it? Any suggestions on how to accomplish that in R?
