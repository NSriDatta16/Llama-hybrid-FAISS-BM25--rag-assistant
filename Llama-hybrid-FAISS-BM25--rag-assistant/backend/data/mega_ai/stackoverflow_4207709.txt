Problems trying to get USB Debugging working on Windows 7 (Android)

I am using Windows 7 64bit and I am trying to get my computer to detect my HTC Desire, but it's not picking it up. I have everything available installed through the Android Updater and I have got my phone running through Ubuntu, so it is definitely a problem with Windows. Does anyone know what's wrong or how to get it working or both? I am using Windows 7 64 bit I have a HTC Desire running Stock 2.2 (Froyo) that works with USB Debugging on my Ubuntu machine Windows does detect that my phone is plugged in. It shows as a mass storage device. I have all the available things installed via the Android Updater.
