Is there a java alternative to the Bayesian Belief Network Framework "Infer.NET"?

Is the are java alternative to Bayesian Belief Network framework - Infer.NET? Preferable if it be scalable(online learning for large datasets), well-supported(last updated since 2010) and open source and easy to write network structure. So all features from Infer.NET.
