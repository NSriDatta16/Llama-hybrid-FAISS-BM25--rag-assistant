This can be changed by adding registry keys. See the relevant post from IE blog: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2009/03/10/more-ie8-extensibility-improvements.aspx Quoting parts of it: We’ve made a few improvements to our extensibility model in IE8 RC1 based on feedback we’ve received both internally and externally. WebBrowser (WebOC) Rendering Mode Changes About a year ago, I posted an entry talking about WebBrowser Control Rendering Modes in IE8. You may recall that applications using the WebBrowser Control (also known as the WebOC, or Trident hosts) can use a Feature Control Key to select the default rendering mode of webpages they load. Since our release of IE8 Beta 1, we’ve changed the name of the Feature Control Key that is used to toggle that behavior. The key was previously called FEATURE_NATIVE_DOCUMENT_MODE. IE8 now refers to it by the key FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION, and the values for both IE7 Standards Mode and IE8 Standards Mode have changed. For compatibility purposes, the WebBrowser control will run in IE7 Standards Mode by default if no Feature Control Key value is defined for an application. To run a WebBrowser control in IE8 Standards Mode, use the following new value into the registry: [(HKEY_CURRENT_USER or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE)\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION] "MyApplication.exe" = dword 8000 (Hex: 0x1F40) To run in IE7 Standards Mode, use the following registry value: [(HKEY_CURRENT_USER or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE)\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION] "MyApplication.exe" = dword 7000 (Hex: 0x1B58) For IE8 RTM, we’ve added a new “forced” IE8 Standards Mode value. When an application opts into this mode, the Web Browser control will use the IE8 User-Agent string and Browser Emulation mode strictly. It will also ignore fallback features such as the built-in Compatibility View list and the user-generated Compatibility View list when loading pages. To run in “forced” IE8 Standards Mode, use the following registry value: [(HKEY_CURRENT_USER or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE)\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION] "MyApplication.exe" = dword 8888 (Hex: 0x22B8) In all of these examples, “MyApplication.exe” refers to the name of your application.
