The cocos2d test projects are very bad examples to start a project from. Their intent is to test certain aspects of the code, and just those aspects you should look at and possibly copy. The way the cocos2d testcases are set up doesn't make for a good, clean project though. There are many shortcuts, like putting everything into one file and relying on the left/right buttons to be there to change testcases (I believe that's where the nextAction class comes into play). I recommend you install the cocos2d Xcode project templates and start with the cocos2d Application project: http://www.learn-cocos2d.com/knowledge-base/cocos2d-iphone-faq/learn-cocos2d-public-content/manual/cocos2d-general/15838-how-to-install-the-cocos2d-xcode-project-templates/ What I see from your code is that the layer doesn't have self.isTouchEnabled = YES and it also doesn't have the regular touch input event methods (ccTouchesBegan etc.) added to it. So it will never react to touch input in the first place, let alone call any method that calls replaceScene.
