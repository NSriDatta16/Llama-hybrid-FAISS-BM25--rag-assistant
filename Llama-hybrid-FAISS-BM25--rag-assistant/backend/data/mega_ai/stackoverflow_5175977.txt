The problem seems to be in the Range object that represents a part of the document. In my original code the Range object contains the first cell and starts at the first cell, where it will insert. Instead I want to insert at the end of the range. So I got the following code replacement to work. I moved the Collapse after the Add() call and gave it an argument of 0. Now there is only one Collapse call per Range object. location = worddoc.Range() location.Paragraphs.Add() location.Collapse(0) Now the code works, I can read from a database and populate new tables from each entry.
