I think you have got part of your answer in the question - a "good structure" is key. I am an engineer and have been working in roles that emphasise a similar application - where you are introduced to problems to provide assistance with analysing and improving the outcomes but are in an advisory rather than implementer role. The best approaches, that I have seen, are ones that are not too prescriptive or loose to ensure the right amount of evidence that the work was done with diligence - which is what I think you are after. Six Sigma (which is a bit of a dirty term in some places I have worked) and other methodoligies provide a framework for approaching, solving and embedding a solution. Because they are based on a framework, they can be audited. The key is to ensure that everyone is trained in the methodology AND have a good template that is auditable. For example, you probably want the solutions to be of a standard - this is not defined by the program used but rather whether you can audit the steps of analysis used at a later date and be satisfied that the task was completed to a standard. Providing milestones - e.g. check points where you can audit will be easier than trying to audit at the end of the project. Returning to Six Sigma, some approaches might be to audit at the Define stage, after Measure and Analyse, and finally at the conclustion (after Improve and Control). Six Sigma is certainly not the best in all situations but I can recommend it as a potential starting point.
