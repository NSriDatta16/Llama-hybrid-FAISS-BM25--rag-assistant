SVN user groups and permissions

I have setup an SVN server on my hosting account. Users can check in and out, but they have access to my entire repository. To give people access, I issue users a public key to my account and then I add a line into my "authorized_keys" file inside my ~/.ssh that looks like this: command="/home/user/packages/bin/svnserve -t -r /home/user/repository --tunnel-user=diogo",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa [KEY DATA IN HERE]== xxxx@xxxx.hostxxxxx.com Users can then checkout from my sever through a tunnel like so: svn+ssh://host.com/project/trunk My question is how can I restrict certain users to have access to certain projects?
