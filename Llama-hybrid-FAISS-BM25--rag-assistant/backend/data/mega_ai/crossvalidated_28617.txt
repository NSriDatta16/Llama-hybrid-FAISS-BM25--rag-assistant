Constructing a Bayesian network from the beginning

I am trying to construct a bayesian network which detects fraud. I have got a huge data set, with elements such as country, top spend merchant just to name a couple. The first part of my problem is to use a test set of data which is about 11,000 rows in excel and use this to firstly use Bayes formula to see the $P(\text{Fraud}|\text{each variable})$. After I have done this I have to perform this on the rest of the data and see if it is a good algorithm. This is the first part that I am confused with. How do I do this? I know $P(\text{Fraud}|X_1)=P(X_1|\text{Fraud})\frac{P(\text{Fraud})}{P(X_1)}$ and I dont understand why I have been told to do this on a test set of data.
