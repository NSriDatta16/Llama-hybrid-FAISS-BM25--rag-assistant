UPDATE The DEMO has been updated and code optimized, it works much better now. -- Dmitriy, thanks for your help. I used the jquery.forms plugin as you suggested but the code I used is a little different. The Solution As I said, I used the jquery.forms plugin to submit the form via Ajax. On submitting the form a DIV with a 'loader' or 'spinner' fades in (although the spinner image is not included in the demo), then it fades out and then the Thank You message fades in. The reason for the loader is so that the user sees something 'moving' while the form is being submitted, this way the user doesn't have to watch the screen doing nothing while the form is being processed. Nice usability touch. In the demo, the loader appears very fast right below the button, so pay attention to that spot if you want to see it in action. Gave you a vote though. Thanks again.
