Reorganize folders with a script

Through the last years I have different types of software to organize my photo and music collections. This has resulted in differences in directory structure, and I'd like this to be uniform. Problem a: Music collection I want my music collection to look like: /Artist/Album/files.* but now there are several instances of /A/Artist/Album/files.* I'm trying to write a script which: 1. Find all folders with 1 character, 2. Move contents of each one-character folder, to /Artist/ (Flatten structure, and handle spaces in filenames) find ./Artists/ -name "?" -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 | mv * ./Artists/ Gets me halfway, but it doesn't handle spaces in directory names, and I'm a bit unsure if it has other pitfalls. Problem b: Photo collection I have a very similar situation here, most of my collection looks like I want it. Desired: /Photos/2009/2009-08-07 description/filename.jpg Current situation: /Photos/2009/03/21/filename.jpg I need a script which: 1. Find all folders which match /yyyy/mm/dd/ 2. Move content to /yyyy-mm-dd/ 3. Delete old folders Background I believe a bash script would be well suited, but I am also up and ready for something in python. I'm using Ubuntu 9.04. Thank you in advance.
