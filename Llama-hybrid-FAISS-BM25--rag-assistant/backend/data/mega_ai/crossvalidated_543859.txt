A basic question about ATT and statistical notation

I'm trying to find an answer to what I think should be very basic. It's about the formal equation of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT): $$E[Y_{1i}|D_i = 1] - E[Y_{0i}|D_i = 1] $$ $Y_{1i}$ is the potential outcome if person $i$ is treated ( $D_i = 1$ ) and $Y_{0i}$ is the potential outcome if the person $i$ is not treated ( $D_i = 0$ ). I understand that we are dealing with potential outcomes, $D_i$ can only be 0 or 1 in this example. Now my question is specifically about one thing, in this seemingly simple formula. For me, the first part makes sense $E[Y_{1i}|D_i = 1]$ , however, this part does not: $E[Y_{0i}|D_i = 1] $ . In plain words, I read the second part as what is the expected outcome of the untreated group( $Y_{0i}$ ), give that the group is treated ( $D_i = 1]$ ) . Now that just doesn't make any sense - how Does anyone care to explain?
