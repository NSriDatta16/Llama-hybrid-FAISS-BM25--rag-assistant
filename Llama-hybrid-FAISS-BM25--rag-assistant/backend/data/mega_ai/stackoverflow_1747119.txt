Using multiple UIWebViews in a UIScrollView

I am using 5 UIWebViews in a UIScrollView to show the result of my game. Intention is to allow the user to scroll through the results screen. I had a problem where the UIWebViews won't load when scrolled to the next page. This means the first page will load successfully however when you scroll to Page 2, you will see a white blank page. Page is loaded as I can see the alert which was given in all the 5 pages, but it won't show. I tried a workaround as mentioned here inserting various views into UIScrollView http://pinchzoom.com/blog/items/view/1386/one-of-the-problems-with-the-uikit-at-the-moment-is-an-issue-embedding-a-uiwebview-within-a-table This fixed my problem, however when I submitted the app to iTunes, it got rejected with the following comment. "3.3.1 Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs." The non-public API that is included in your application is _documentView I would like to fix this issue and resubmit. Can someone help please ? Thanks Jugs
