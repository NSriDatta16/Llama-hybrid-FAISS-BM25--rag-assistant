If you need relational properties, look for non-Notes solutions . It is possible to get some relational behavior using document UNIDs and update agents, but it will be harder than with a proper relational backend. Your specific problem with referencing to a piece of text that might change can to some extent be resolved by using aliases in the choice fields. If a dialog list contains values on the form... Foo|id1 Bar|id2 ...the form will display Foo but the back-end document will store the value id1 - (and this is what you will be able to show in standard views - although xpages could solve that). Using the @DocumentUniqueID for alias can be a good idea under some circumstances.
