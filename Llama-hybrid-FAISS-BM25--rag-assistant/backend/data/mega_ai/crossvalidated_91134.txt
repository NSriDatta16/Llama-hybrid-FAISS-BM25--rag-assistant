Advice on how to analyse “customer-data” in R

consider the following example data: df1 My actual data consists of about 200000 rows and I would like to examine it in terms of, for instance, do customers from the US spent more money compared to customers from other countries. I would also like to see whether the amount of money spent depends on the industry sector and so on. I have some more explanatory variables apart from origin, industry sector and currency which I would like to look into. Also the number of records for the customers differ so that it might make sense to average the money spent for each customer. I am not sure about how to best analyse this data. I first thought of cluster analysis, in particular, hierarchical clustering but am not sure whether it can be applied to such data and, in particular, how to structure the data to be put into the function. The R function hclust takes a matrix as the input but how would I structure such a matrix in terms of my data? Could k-means clustering be a better alternative? Another approach would probably to analyse this data using boxplots and an one-way ANOVA approach to see whether "money spent" differs between different countries or industry sectors. However, this approach does not test whether the variables are dependend on each other. To look into this, I have been advised to apply a decision tree first and then do some statistical significance analysis. However, from what I have read so far I cannot see how decision trees can help me to detect variable dependencies. So, I am wondering whether there any other/better techniques/functions out there which are more suitable for such data? Maybe a time series analysis is more appropriate since we have also recorded the dates when customers spent money.
