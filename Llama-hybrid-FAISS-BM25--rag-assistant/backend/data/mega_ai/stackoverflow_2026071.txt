Neural Network Expert System

Does anyone know how to emulate an Expert Systems using Neural Networks? An example of this is the 20q.net website. I'm more curious to how the network would be designed; ie how many inputs, what the input represents, what outputs from the network, how these outputs point to an answer. Very interesting stuff.
