I didn't find these approaches to work for my situation, which was to alphabetize a list of Strings and then append a 'Create new...' item at the end of the list. The way I handled things is a little inelegant, but reliable. I sorted my ArrayCollection of Strings, called orgNameList , with an alpha sort, like so: var alphaSort:Sort = new Sort(); alphaSort.fields = [new SortField(null, true)]; orgNameList.sort = alphaSort; orgNameList.refresh(); Then I copied the elements of the sorted list into a new ArrayCollection , called customerDataList . The result being that the new ArrayCollection of elements are in alphabetical order, but are not under the influence of a Sort object. So, adding a new element will add it to the end of the ArrayCollection . Likewise, adding an item to a particular index in the ArrayCollection will also work as expected. for each(var org:String in orgNameList) { customerDataList.addItem(org); } Then I just tacked on the 'Create new...' item, like this: if(userIsAllowedToCreateNewCustomer) { customerDataList.addItem(CREATE_NEW); customerDataList.refresh(); }
