A silverlight out of browser app sounds perfect for your needs. Rather than trying to bundle IIS express and SQL CE, you might want to take a look at something like SterlingDB for local data storage. If you are calling web services, out-of-browser applications running with the "full trust" flag enabled don't have cross-domain restrictions. This way, your app would be pure silverlight, and your deployment & update scenarios would be very straightforward (single-click install via a website).
