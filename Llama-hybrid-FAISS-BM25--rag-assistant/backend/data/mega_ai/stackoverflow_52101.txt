For loops for (i = startValue; i For...in loops for (i in things) { // If things is an array, i will usually contain the array keys *not advised* // If things is an object, i will contain the member names // Either way, access values using: things[i] } It is bad practice to use for...in loops to itterate over arrays. It goes against the ECMA 262 standard and can cause problems when non-standard attributes or methods are added to the Array object, e.g. by Prototype . (Thanks to Chase Seibert for pointing this out in the comments) While loops while (myCondition) { // The loop will continue until myCondition is false }
