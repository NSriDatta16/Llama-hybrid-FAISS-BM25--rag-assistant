Typical machine learning methods assume that your data is independent and identically distributed, which isn't true for time series data. Therefore they are at a disadvantage compared to time series techniques, in terms of accuracy. For examples of this, see the previous questions Ordering of time series for machine learning and Random forest is overfitting .
