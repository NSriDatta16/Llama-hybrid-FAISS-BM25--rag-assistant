How to prepare my data for SVM classifier in matlab

I am new to SVM and Matlab. I would like to have an example how to prepare my data to be as input to the SVM classifer (using libsvm) let us assume that i have a group of words first i have extracted some attributes such as bigram and trigrams (Average Jaccard index) and I wanted to input these values to a classifier in order to classify them I know that i have first to train my classifier with initial data (labled) I have these data 60000 words from dictionary and 40000 other terms while I generate 100000 random strings now i want to classify if the new words are random or not I have calculated the Jaccard index for each one and also i have calculated some other features such as number of characters and number and some other features. now how I can convert these data to metrix ? I am a bit confused about the next step
