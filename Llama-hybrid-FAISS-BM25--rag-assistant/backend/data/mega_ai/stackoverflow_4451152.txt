In the app I work on, the following distinction is used: Settings file on web server: settings that are specific to the web server, not to the database it connects with (e.g. which theme to use, which mail server to use) Database table: settings that are specific to the database or to the current user, and that are not specific to the client machine the user is working on (e.g. what template to send mails with) Cookies / localstorage: settings that are specific to the client machine (e.g. layout of movable panels, because on different screens you want different layout) In all cases an API exists that abstracts away the details of reading or writing settings.
