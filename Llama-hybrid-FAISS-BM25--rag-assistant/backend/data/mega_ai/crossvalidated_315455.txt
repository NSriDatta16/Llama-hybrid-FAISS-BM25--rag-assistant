How to calculate the autocorrelation coefficient of multi-dimensional time series

The autocorrelation coefficient formula of one-dimensional time series is as belows: $r_k = {\sum\limits^{n-k}_{l=1}}(x_1-\bar x)(x_{l+k}-\bar x)/{\sum\limits^n_{l=1}}(x_l-\bar x)^2$ I want to know how to calculate the autocorrelation coefficient of multi-dimensional time series, such as(five dimensions): 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 6 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 6 2 3 4 5 7 1 2 3 4 7 4 5 6 7 8 5 6 7 8 9 4 5 6 7 9 3 4 5 6 8 Thanks in advance.
