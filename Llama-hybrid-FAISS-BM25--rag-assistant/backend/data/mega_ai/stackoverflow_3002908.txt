That is correct, simply pointing at a directory will not cause the .libs in that directory to get linked in (consider the case of the Visual Studio 'lib' folder: there's 60 files in my version of it: imagine if they all got linked in!) It's called "additional" because there's typically the standard C++ runtime that gets linked automatically. Various #pragma s can cause libraries to get linked automatically as well (this is libraries such as boost do it).
