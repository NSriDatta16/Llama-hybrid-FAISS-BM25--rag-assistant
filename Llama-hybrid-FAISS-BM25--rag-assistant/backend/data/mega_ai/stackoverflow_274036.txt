You can use either, but the proper statuscode to use for redirect-after-post is 303. The confusion has a historical explanation. Originally, 302 specified that the browser mustn't change the method of the redirected request. This makes it unfit for redirect-after-post, where you want the browser to issue a GET request. However, all browsers seems to misinterpret the specs and always issue a GET request. In order to clear up the ambiguity HTTP/1.1 specified two new codes: 303 and 307. 303 essentially specifies the de-facto interpretation of 302, while 307 specifies the original specification of 302. So in practice 302 and 303 are interchangeable, and in theory 302 and 307 are. If you really care about compatibility, 302 is a safer bet than 303, since HTTP/1.0 agents may not understand 303, but all modern browsers speak HTTP/1.1, so it isn't a real issue. I would recommend using 303, since that's the most correct thing to do. On a side-note; The Location field should be a full URL. In practice it doesn't matter - browsers are forgiving - but if you care about the specs, that's the proper thing to do.
