Use of Bayesian hierarchical model

What is the purpose of Bayesian hierarchical model? When should I use such models? I've found many questions here and references on the web but they are all too technical. My doubts are about the application of such models, and about their use as substitute of non-informative priors. From my professor's notes, Hierarchical models mediate two needs: the need to incorporate in the analysis "a priori" opinions about the coefficients of the model and the use of non-informative priors which, if not conjugated, involve big computational problems.
