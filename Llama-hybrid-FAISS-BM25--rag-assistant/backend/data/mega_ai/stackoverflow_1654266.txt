I think by 'language' you actually mean 'character encoding' . Please go ahead and read The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!) . It will save you (and others ;) a lot of trouble in the future. The basic thing is that you have to know the encoding of your characters at every stage of your processing and storage , because otherwise, you can not really ensure proper, readable output. That your setup is working right now is more or less a lucky incident, but as soon as you use your database from a different app (or change the way your current app deals with strings), things can break down pretty fast. You want to ensure that all characters in your database are stored with the same encoding (preferably one of the UNICODE versions), so that you can convert them reliably to any other encoding you might need in your apps.
