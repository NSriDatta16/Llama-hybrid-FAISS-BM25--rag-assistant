IIS7 Hijacks My Coldfusion Error Page

In my exception handling file, I set a statuscode to 404 and then render n HTML page, for the error page (think fail-whale). Error There was an error yo! This is obviously over simplified, but just to make sure everything was demonstrated. What I have found is that from a ASP.NET request, they can set a variable "Response.TrySkipIisCustomErrors=true" to keep IIS from showing its own error page. How can someone in Coldfusion do it / how can I just tell IIS to stop its thinks it knows better than me shenanigans.
