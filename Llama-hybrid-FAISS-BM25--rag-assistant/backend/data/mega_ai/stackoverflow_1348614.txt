Given the average computer speed these days, if it's real-time as the user is playing the game, it probably won't matter (EDIT: for very small game boards only). Certainly, it would depend on the complexity of the game logic, but also how fast the code is going to run on the target machine (i.e., is this a JavaScript web page game, or a Windows app written in C++). If this is for something like simulating gameplay strategies, then use an algorithm that's more efficient. A more efficient strategy could involve keeping track of incremental changes to the game board, instead of re-scanning the whole board every time.
