jQuery : crossfading image on hover

I'm trying to implement a 'fade into' script which would affect two images : $(document).ready(function(){ $('img').mouseover( function() { $(this).fadeOut(200, function() { $(this).attr({'src':'http://example/images/image.png'}); if (this.complete) $(this).fadeIn(500); }); }); }); This bit of jQuery gives me the following : 1 - first the image fades out and disappears 2 - then, from a blank space, it emerges the new one. So I'd like to improve the script in order to get a real 'fade into' effect. There's two great resources I have been exploring by now : Cycle Plugin - very cool (I will try to get that cycle effect on hover) JQuery for Designers cool , but I had a bunch of issues with IE (a strange black pixelated border on the fadeIn). Thanks very much if someone can point out an eventual extra solution. Jan EDIT : CSS trick/solution here http://paragraphe.org/stackoverflowdemos/crossfade-images/
