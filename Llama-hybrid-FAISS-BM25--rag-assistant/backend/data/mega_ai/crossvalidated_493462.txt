Interesting question: Here is one possibility I could think of: Say you have two groups: $A$ and $B$ . Both groups have males and females, females outnumbering males significantly in group $A$ and opposite in group $B$ . You give a medicine to only group $A$ and measure effectiveness by some measure $y$ . Now assume a scenario in which the medicine is actually effective (and raises score) but the average score is generally low for females. Since females greatly outnumber males in group $A$ , on average the score should be lower. However, since this group is also getting medicine, the average increases such that both groups have close averages. Hence the t-test could not reject the null of same means. On the other hand, you run the following regression: $$y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 D_B + \beta_2 D_F$$ Here, $D_B=1$ if score is from individual in group $B$ . Similarly, $D_F=1$ for females. Interpretation of $\beta_0$ is the average score of all males from group $A$ . Interpretation of $\beta_1$ is how much does the average score changes for group $B$ , keeping gender fixed . In our set-up we would rightly expect it to be significant. Interpretation of $\beta_2$ is how much does the average score changes for for females as compared to males in either group (since no interaction term - the effect of medicine is considered same in both groups). This will also be significant of course, but the coefficient will be opposite in sign. So this could be one possible set-up that can lead to the results you are getting (since you are getting negative coefficient for age).
