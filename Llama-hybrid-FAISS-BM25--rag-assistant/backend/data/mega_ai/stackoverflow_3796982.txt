If I have lots of small icons, I'm embedding them. Imagine that number of requests in runtime, any of which may timeout. Pain of embedding, where? A single Embed tag in source or CSS for an asset. "Constant" assets must be embedded, "variable" ones - loaded. Edit: OK, I got it. Pain of embedding lots of assets. Here is one idea come to my mind... Even if you loading something dynamically, you need some list with all filenames? You may take list of files and generate class full of public static const members with [Embed] attributes, that's fairly trivial. Then you use that class in project and voila, all is in the place. Maybe this helps.
