The first idea I had to do this could be something as follows: Food content type with: name (title), description (body) and price Restaurant content type with multiple food node-reference fields Vocabulary associated to food with terms like Beverages, Cocktails, Pasta, .. (and I'm pretty sure there is a module that let you define taxonomy terms weights) This way, you can store your data. For the displaying part, you could use: (better approach) a custom node-restaurant.tpl.php that creates the formatted page showing food categorized by taxonomy term (I'm quite sure you have direct access to referenced nodes through the template variables.. I'm going to test that and let you know) (could be done through admin panel) A view in a block placed in the "content" region showing the referenced nodes, formatted as a table grouped by taxonomy term on the "Food category" vocabulary. You can get the current node nid (used for filtering) by using arguments. I recommend the first choice since it is more standards-compliant, quicker in execution and could avoid some possible problems that could come from the views+block way.
