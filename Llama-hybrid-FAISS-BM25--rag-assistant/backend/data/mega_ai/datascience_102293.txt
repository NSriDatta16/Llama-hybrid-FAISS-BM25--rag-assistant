Can a CNN have a different number of convolutional layers and kernel and what does it mean?

So if I have $3$ RGB channels, $6$ convolutional layers and $4$ kernels, does this mean that each kernel does a convolution on each channel and so the input for the next convolution will be $3 \times 4=12$ channels? Or those outputs are just stacked on each other (summed) and the input to the next neural network is still 3 channels? Edit: I am pretty sure that the input for the next convolution would still be $3$ , but why is that? What is the operation performed?
