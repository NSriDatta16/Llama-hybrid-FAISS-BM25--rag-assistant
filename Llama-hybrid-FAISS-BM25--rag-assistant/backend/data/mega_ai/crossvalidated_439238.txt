What does a decision tree hypothesis look like?

I am learning Tom M. Mitchell. Machine Learning (free) . in Candidate-Elimination algorithm, a single hypothesis looks like $ $ there are three hypotheses in FIGURE 2.1 in that book, in which $h_1$ and $h_2$ are 2 different hypotheses. similarly, what does a single hypothesis learned by decision tree regarding discrete dataset look like? is the following one a single hypothesis?
