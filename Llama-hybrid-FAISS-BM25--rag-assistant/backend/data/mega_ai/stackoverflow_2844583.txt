Anybody's guess. A frequently used tactic when trying to cram a lot of software into a mass-market device (where saving 10c on storage can matter) is to use some kind of bytecode interpreter, where the bytecodes are designed to save space, even if they execute fairly slowly. FORTH used to be popular for this purpose, but there are an awful lot of one-off bytecodes in the world. One that has survived for adventure gaming is the Infocom Z-Machine .
