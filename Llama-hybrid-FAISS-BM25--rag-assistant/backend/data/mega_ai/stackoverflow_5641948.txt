There are two things your going to need to study. http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_intro.asp This is a tutorial on using the XHR object from php. You should go through that. Also, if you aren't familiar with the XHR object, I would read this as well: http://www.w3schools.com/XML/xml_http.asp You're going to have to create a servlet capable of responding to these requests. There are various tutorials on how to create a servlet. Here is a link to a youtube video I fall back on when I forget how to do servlets: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOkN5IPoJVs In the video, he just uses straight up javascript; so you're php code is going to be doing what the javascript did in the video (item 1 on my list). The video uses an older version of eclipse (I think ganymede), but it is pretty close to the same process in the newest version of eclipse. Just to be blunt, this isn't something you're going to be able to figure out and make work properly. You've probably got at least a day to a weeks worth of learning here depending on your experience and aptitude; and this will only get you something basic. The servlet you make won't be secure, it won't have user authentication...my point is don't take anything for granted.
