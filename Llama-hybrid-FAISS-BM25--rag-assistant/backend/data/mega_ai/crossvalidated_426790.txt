In order to close this: The latter piece of code worked fine as far as I can tell, but I guess the Differential Evolution algorithm is overkill for a rather simple optimization problem as this here. Moreover, in our experiments (bankruptcy prediction, data: Polish Companies Bankruptcy from UCI) the tuned SMOTE parameters combined with the XGBoost algorithms didn't lead to conclusively better results. More testing would be necessary to get an idea about this, but the impact of tuning SMOTE in that case seems rather limited if I did everything correctly.
