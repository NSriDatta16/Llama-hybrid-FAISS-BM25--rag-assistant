Not working is a problem description that's more adapted to people that don't know/care about how computer works and not software developers. Software developers usually describe precisely the problem they are having. They post the exact error message/exception stack trace they are having. This being said you are asking for alternative solutions, here's mine: don't use any MS Ajax.* helpers , use jquery directly and unobtrusively, like this $(function () { $('#confirmation').hide(); $('form').submit(function() { $('#confirmation').show('slow'); $(this).hide('slow'); return false; }); }); @using (Html.BeginForm()) { Message @Html.Label("Email", "Email"): @Html.TextBox("Email") @Html.Label("Subject", "Subject"): @Html.TextBox("Subject") @Html.Label("Message", "Message"): @Html.TextArea("Message") } Thanks!!! Notice how the confirmation paragraph has been externalized from the form.
