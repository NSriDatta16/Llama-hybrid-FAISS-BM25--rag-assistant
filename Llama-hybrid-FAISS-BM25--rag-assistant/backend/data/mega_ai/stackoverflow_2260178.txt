Decompiling the Flash source would let you see the ActionScript part of the Flash file, which I've found to often contain info like links. A free decompiler is Flare . It's command line only, and works fine. It won't decode some of the info in newer Flash formats (>CS3 I think). It dumps all the AS into one file. Sothink SWF Decompiler is a more sophisticated commercial program. It will work fine with any Flash file I've tried and the results are quite thorough and well organized. it's GUI based and I don't know if it is easily automated. With Flare, since it's a command line tool, one could easily write a script to obtain the SWF, decompile it, grep for 'http://', and log the results.
