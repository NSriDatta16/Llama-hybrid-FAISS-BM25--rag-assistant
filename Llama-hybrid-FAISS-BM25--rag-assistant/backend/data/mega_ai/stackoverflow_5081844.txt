Magento: Call template phtml file via Ajax

I'm attempting to call a phtml file from Ajax on the homepage of my Magento site. I basically created a copy of app/design/frontend/base/default/template/catalog/product/list.phtml and customized it to view a particular category. If I add a block pointing to this file in the CMS section, I can view it just fine. However, I want to call this file via Ajax. I followed the instructions to create a module here , and then I attempted to follow the logic of Ajax in Magento by following this post . However, in the last step it lists: Where do I insert this? Also, for the template="module/template.phtml" , what folder is that referring to?
