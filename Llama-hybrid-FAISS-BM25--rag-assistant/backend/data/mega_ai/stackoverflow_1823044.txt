touchtouchEnded is not getting called after touchesBegan and touchMoved

I am having a strange effect with touches. Sometimes when I swipe the screen slowly the touchBegan and touchMoved get called but not the touchEnded, which kinda screws up my view movements. How is it possible that touchEnded doesn't get called? And my finger leaves the screen without running off the sides or anything like that !! Any tips or suggestions to explain this behaviour? I really need the touchEnded to clean up my view. Thank you for any advice. Al
