Draggable , droppable and sortable

I am new to JQuery.... Recently i was working on a project and i faced the following problem: I have two ul (say: gallery(LHS) and trash(RHS)) . In gallery i have 8 li's and they are draggable and sortable. I can drag and drop the li's to trash. I can even sort them in trash. the problem i am facing is with the placement of this li's Actually, initially the trash is empty but has a background image with 8 rectangular boxes and each rectangular box has a serial number in it.(mind it.. the 8 rectangular boxes are merely a single image). So whenever I drop the first li into the trash, the first rectangular box hides behind the li. when I drop the second one, the second box hides and so on..... Now i want that when i drag the first li from gallery onto the 8th rect. box of the trash it stays there instead of moving upwards as it is a single container. Someone suggested me to use 8 different containers. But the problem is can i make this 8 container sortable. I need a draggable,droppable on a particular container and sortable li's within that 8 container.
