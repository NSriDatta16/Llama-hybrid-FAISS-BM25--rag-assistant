Edit: nvm misinterpreted the question. I'll leave this answer here anyway. Maybe try finding the convex hull of the points first then fit the convex hull on the plain http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/java/3d/giftwrap.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull_algorithms If you don't want efficiency there are some very simple implementations like the gift wrapping version which is O(n^2) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm The divide and conquer version is O(nlogn)
