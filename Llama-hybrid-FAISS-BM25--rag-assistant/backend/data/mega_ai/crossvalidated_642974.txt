I recommend this book, which is free on-line: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/ Without more context, I can't be sure of this answer, but it is likely that: You had 6,000 data points which were observations of some physical process ( $X$ ) There were 4,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples drawn from the appropriate distributions to form the posterior sample given the data. The 4,000 MCMC samples are about the model parameters, while the 6,000 data points are about the process outputs. Generally, the posterior probability distribution over the parameters given the data ( $f(\theta|X)$ ) is proportional to the prior distribution over the parameters ( $f(\theta)$ ) times the likelihood of the data given the parameters ( $f(X|\theta)$ ). $$f(\theta|X)\ \propto\ f(\theta)f(X|\theta)$$
