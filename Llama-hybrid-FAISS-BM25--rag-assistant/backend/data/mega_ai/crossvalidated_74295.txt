Differences Between Logistic Regression in Statistics and in Machine Learning

I just found out that machine learning also has logistic regression as one of its methods. Can someone please tell me the differences between logistic regression in statistics and machine learning? I've seen lecture slides on logistic regression from a machine learning course, but I can't see the difference with the coverage of logistic regression in a statistics course. Does logistic regression in machine learning have no need to check for multicollinearity? The reason I asked this is because I've tried to run a dataset through R's glm function with binomial logit, and then I ran the same dataset through Apache Mahout's trainlogistic . But the resulting coefficients are different. This is the command I use in R: w1.glm This is the result of summary(w1.glm) : glm(formula = anw ~ cs, family = "binomial", data = w1) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.5400 0.1073 0.1924 1.0047 1.0047 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.42077 0.02588 16.26 And this is the command I use in Mahout: /usr/local/mahout/bin/mahout trainlogistic --input w1.csv --output ./model --target anw --categories 2 --predictors cs --types numeric --features 20 --passes 100 --rate 50 Running on hadoop, using /usr/local/hadoop/bin/hadoop and HADOOP_CONF_DIR= MAHOUT-JOB: /usr/local/mahout/mahout-examples-0.8-job.jar 20 anw ~ -19.553*cs + -7.512*Intercept Term cs -19.55265 Intercept Term -7.51155 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 -19.552646543 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 -7.511546797 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 13/11/01 02:04:47 INFO driver.MahoutDriver: Program took 22118 ms (Minutes: 0.3686333333333333) Edited: Added the reason I asked the question in the title. Added the commands used to execute glm in R and trainlogistic in Mahout.
