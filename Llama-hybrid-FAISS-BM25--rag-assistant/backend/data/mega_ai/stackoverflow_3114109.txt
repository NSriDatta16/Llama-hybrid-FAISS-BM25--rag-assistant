Populating the table, whether using innerHTML or DOM methods, is going to be worse performance-wise. Retrieving the data (particularly if via iteration) also becomes less verbose, easier to maintain and, again, better performance-wise. Using an HTML table is also a more fragile option, as if something goes wrong, other markup on the page could become invalid or, worse, it might end up displayed to the user. There's also the simple fact it just seems hacky, workaroundy and dirty. It's an HTML table that is to present tabular data, it's not an SQL table for data storage. JavaScript objects are pretty much made for what you're describing. Using an object makes even more sense and is a nice and clean option if the data you're getting from the server is already in a suitable form (i.e. JSON). Then it's ready for you and all you have to do is parse it .
