So for example, let’s say I do a survey on healthy eating. My questions are: 1) Do you like cherry tomatoes? 2) Do you like yellow tomatoes? Whenever the respondent answers these questions, he sneezes and slightly shifts his pen on the paper. If I add the answers to the 2 questions, I average out this error. As I add more questions, I get more covariance terms in the denominator for the formula for Chronbach alpha, and –provided the covariances are positive- alpha gets bigger as I add questions. This is counteracted slightly by the K/(K-1) factor in the formula for alpha, which gets smaller as K increases. (K being the number of questions). That would also be the case even if there were no error terms (no sneezing) Now for factor analysis: I am looking for a hidden factor (‘healthy eating’), and now we see the answer to question 1 as made up of 3 things: healthy eating, his liking for cherry tomatoes, and the sneeze. Adding more questions will average out the sneeze as before, but gets me no closer to my hidden factor, because I keep adding variables, such as his liking for yellow things, etc. Is it necessarily a bad thing if I cannot find a small number of latent factors in a survey?
