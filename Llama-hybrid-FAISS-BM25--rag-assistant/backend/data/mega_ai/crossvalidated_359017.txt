Fine-tuning in Random Forest regression analysis for forecasting

I am trying to run a regression estimation on random forest algorithm. As I am very inexperienced in using RF algorithms, I couldn't figure out some questions unless I make a quick survey on literature. Unless I do know that it's common to take n(parameters)/3 for mtry, I also tried to tuneRF() function of RandomForest package in R. Unfortunately function returned value of 22, while the number of predictors I am using is 38. Although the model I estimated with these parameters gave me lower MAE, I am not sure if a mtry value as high as 22 would cause overfitting. In addition to this problem I am not sure that growing 500 trees for estimation with 4380 observation, do you have some suggestions?
