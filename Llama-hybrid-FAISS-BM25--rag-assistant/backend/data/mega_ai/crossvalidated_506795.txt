As @oleh says, the chi2 test is basically a general GOF, which will be triggered by overdispersion, but could be triggered also by other problems. You can test specifically for overdispersion in binomial GLMs with the DHARMa R package (disclaimer: I'm the developer), which compares the dispersion in the data with the dispersion of simulated data from the fitted model. model_binom However, note that the raw 0/1 response in a logistic regression cannot have overdispersion, so this test (as any other dispersion test) will never be positive. Overdispersion tests on a 0/1 response only make sense if you group the residuals. See the comments specific to binomial responses in the DHARMa vignette here .
