Mysql Query not working

I have three tables that are structured like this: http://i41.tinypic.com/2bt9aq.png What I am trying to do is retrieve the joke id, title, and average rating of all jokes in a certain category and order them alphabetically. I have this query: $result = mysql_query(" SELECT jokedata.id AS joke_id, jokedata.joketitle AS joke_title, SUM(ratings.rating) / COUNT(ratings.rating) AS average FROM jokedata INNER JOIN ratings ON ratings.content_type = 'joke' AND ratings.relative_id = jokedata.id WHERE jokecategory = '$cur_category' GROUP BY jokedata.id ORDER BY jokedata.joketitle LIMIT $offset, $jokes_per_page "); However it is not selecting any jokes. What is wrong with that query? Thankyou.
