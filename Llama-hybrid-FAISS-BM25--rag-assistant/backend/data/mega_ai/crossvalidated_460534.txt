Conjugate priors are not necessarily tractable ( Robert, 1994 ): take for instance a Beta distribution $$f(x|\alpha,\beta) = B(\alpha,\beta)^{-1} x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1}\mathbb I_{(0,1)}(x)$$ as the sampling distribution. A conjugate prior on $(\alpha,\beta)$ is $$\pi(\alpha,\beta|\mu,\sigma) \propto B(\alpha,\beta)^{-\sigma}\mu_1^\alpha\mu_2^\beta$$ but given the complexity of the special function $B(\alpha,\beta)$ it is not something directly simulated. Manageable posteriors can be found outside exponential families, as for instance with uniform priors associated with sampling distributions from exponential families, e.g. a Normal distribution. (Uniform priors and exponential families often provide a manageable posterior.) Another (counter-)example is the posterior associated with a mixture of $k$ distributions from exponential families and component-wise conjugate priors, for a small number of observations (the details are available in an old technical report of mine, cf. Diebolt & Robert, 1990, but this is simple combinatorics). But given that the complexity of the likelihood grows with the sample size outside exponential families, since there is no sufficient statistic of fixed dimension, it is unlikely there are many examples of that kind. (The mathematical result that prevents manageable posteriors to exist outside the exponential families is called the Pitman-Koopman-Darmois theorem .)
