Random Survival Forests - How Do They Work?

Survival Analysis methods such as Random Survival Forests be used for modelling survival, for example: Student Dropout in Education, Disease Recurrence in Health Care, Project Success in Project Management, Customer Lifetime Value, Reliability, etc After reading through a number of papers (e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.1645.pdf ), I am unable to summarise concisely in what way a Random Survival Forest differs from a Random Forest. Is anyone able to please explain how a Random Survival Forest differs from a Random Forest (splitting criteria, etc.)?
