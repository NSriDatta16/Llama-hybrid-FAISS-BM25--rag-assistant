Cron Job with R and SQL Server

This is probably going to be an underspecified question, as I'm not looking for a specific fix: I want to run a machine learning algorithm on some data in a SQL Server database. I'd like to use R to do the calculations -- which would involve using R to connect to the database, process the data, and write a table of results back to the database. Is this possible? My guess is yes. Shouldn't be a problem using a client... however, would it be possible to set this up on a linux box as a cron job?
