Amazon S3 standalone stub server

I seem to recall reading about an Amazon S3-compatible test server that you could run on your own server for unit tests or whatever. However, I've just exhausted my patience looking for this with both Google and AWS. Does such a thing exist? If not, I think I'll write one. Note: I'm asking about Amazon S3 (the storage system) rather than Amazon EC2 (cloud computing).
