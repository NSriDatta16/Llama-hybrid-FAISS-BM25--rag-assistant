Online Credit Card Storage?

I am about to inherit and work on a small business retail website that is very poorly designed. Among other things, the greatest concern is with the current credit card processing. Currently, the owner retrieves credit card information (name, number, CVV2 and expiration date) from an online order form and saves all of that information in plain text within a MySQL database. A notification then gets sent to his email that someone has ordered. Thereafter, he has an administrative back-end page that he views the orders and credit card information which he uses to process offline with his own merchant. After retrieving the information from the back-end page, the credit card number and CVV2 is immediately deleted (PHP script automatically called). The information is also deleted if that page is not accessed within 7 days. So, there is a potential for all of the information to be in the database in plain text for seven days before transaction processing. This does not seem like a good design and may be illegal. If it is illegal, I am going to have to break this to him, because he does not realize that yet. My question: Besides being insecure, is this illegal or a violation of terms of use (PCI DSS)? And, if so, how can I prove it to him so that he will allow me to change his ways (obviously, I don't want to put my hands into something that is illegal. Also, sometimes the wording of terms of use can seem subjective)? Finally, what are the best options for fixing this issue (3rd party online merchant, becoming PCI DSS compliant, or something else)?
