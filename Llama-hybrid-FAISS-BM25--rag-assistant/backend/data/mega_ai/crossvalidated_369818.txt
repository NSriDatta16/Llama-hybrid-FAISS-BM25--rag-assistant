One approach is to calculate the confidence interval of the mean value after each sample. The relative size of this interval compared to the mean value could be used to identify when to stop measuring. The calculation begins by calculating the standard deviation of the sample, $s$ , and then the standard error of the mean, $s_{\bar x}=s/\sqrt{n}$ , where $n$ is the number of samples. The confidence interval is defined as $$\bar x \pm t s_{\bar x}$$ where $t$ is obtained from a t-distribution table, based on the confidence level and degrees of freedom. Using the t-value in this situation is more appropriate because of the small sample size. Note that if you specify a 95% confidence level, you would use a 1-sided t-table with $\alpha=0.5$ . It seems reasonable to set a minimum number of samples to obtain, then stop measuring after the confidence interval is repeatedly less than a prescribed percentage of the mean. For example, stopping after the confidence interval is less than 5% of the mean, $2ts_{\bar x} , 3 samples in a row. Several online references (see below) discuss identifying the required sample size based on an estimated standard deviation of the sample. The approach here instead calculates the sample standard deviation as you go. The cuttoff criteria is somewhat arbitrary but the method for calculating the confidence interval is statistically sound.
