Allocate 0 points for sprint Y and 10 points when the story is eventually completed. Either the story is done or it is not done. There is no middle ground. You want to avoid the 50% done or your teams may implement many stories half way and none completely. It is perfectly okay not to finish a story during a sprint and completing it in the next sprint. But, you should not present this story to the product owner during the sprint review. If you have enough stories for a given sprint, it won't matter if the story is completed this sprint or the next. Things will average. It is also important to explain to the team and to the stakeholders that the velocity helps estimate when the release will take place and is not a measure of the team performance. The team should be judged on the final result they produce, not when those results are produced. Combined with a well prioritized backlog, you will create good quality software that means your customers needs.
