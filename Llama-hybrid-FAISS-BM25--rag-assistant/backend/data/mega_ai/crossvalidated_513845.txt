Subscript notation in expectations (variational autoencoder)

This is the objective function of a variational autoencoder. I am not sure how to interpret the second term. It appears to be an expectation value over log p(x^(i)|z), but I'm not sure what role the subscript q(z|x^(i)) plays here. Thanks in advance.
