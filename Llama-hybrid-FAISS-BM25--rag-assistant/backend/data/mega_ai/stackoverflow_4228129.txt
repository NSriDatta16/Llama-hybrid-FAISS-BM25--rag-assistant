Pass an option to a method only if a condition is true. Elegant?

I have a partial that inserts in my forms the appropriate input according to the model's attribute type. I pass an array of attribute names and my partial puts a form.text_field where the attribute is a string, a form.select when the attribute is an integer (I also have a way to find the collection of text values associated to a attribute) and so on with datetime, ect. The problem is that partial need to be as generic as possible, so I want to check if I have a params[:search][:attr_name] to set the default value, and if a don't have it, I use the default call, that sets the value of the model in the form. Of course, i can do somethig like this (I use HAML) works: - if search_param(field) = form.text_field field, :value => search_param(field) - else = form.text_field field but it's really ugly. There is any way to pass an option to a method only if a condition is true. Something like this. = form.text_field field, (:value => search_param(field) ) if search_param(field) I tried also to do: = form.text_field field, :value => search_param(field) || field.to_sym but it shows "field" inside the input Ideas?
