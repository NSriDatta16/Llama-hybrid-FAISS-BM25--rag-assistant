Display macOS window full screen on secondary monitor using Cocoa

I'm working on a Cocoa Mac app where I need to display a window/view on a secondary monitor, full-screen. I know how to create a window that could be dragged onto the secondary monitor, but I was wanting to programmatically create the window and make it full screen on the external monitor.
