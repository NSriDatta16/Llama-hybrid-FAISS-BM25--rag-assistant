MySQL performance DELETE or UPDATE?

I have a MyISAM table with more than 10^7 rows. When adding data to it, I have to update ~10 rows at the end. Is it faster to delete them and then insert the new ones, or is it faster to update those rows? Data that should be updated is not part of the index. What about index/data fragmentation
