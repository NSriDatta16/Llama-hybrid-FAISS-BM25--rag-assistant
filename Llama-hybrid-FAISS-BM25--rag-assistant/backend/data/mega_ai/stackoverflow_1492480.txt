The problem with regions is they can make files filled with thousands of lines of spaghetti code look like they are compact, clean and well organized at first glance, which they are not. If a single file is getting unmanageable, think about how you've structured your classes and is there things you can refactor out into their own classes or methods? I got very region happy when I started .net and now I don't think I've written one in years. They lost all value in my eyes the first time I opened a file with 5 regions, thought, "Hmm...simple enough" only to expand one and get a few thousand lines of code that made no sense whatsoever.
