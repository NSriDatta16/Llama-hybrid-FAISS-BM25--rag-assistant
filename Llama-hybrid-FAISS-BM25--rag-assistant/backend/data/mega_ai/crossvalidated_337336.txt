The confusion comes from this sentence: And yet, the consensus seems to be that a 95% confidence interval can NOT be interpreted as there being a 95% probability that the interval contains the true mean. It is a partial misunderstanding of the real consensus. The confusion comes from not being specific about what probability we talk about. Not as a philosophical question but as "what exact probability we are speaking of in the context". As @ratsalad says it's all about conditioning. Call $\theta$ your parameter, $X$ your data, $I$ an interval that is a function of $X$: $I$ is a confidence interval means $P(\theta\in I\mid\theta)>0.95$ for all possible $\theta$ including the true one. Probability averages over all possible $X$ at fixed $\theta$. This is what you explain in your interpretation. $I$ being a (Bayesian) credible interval says $P(\theta\in I\mid X)>0.95$. Probability averages over all possible $\theta$ at fixed $X$. Both are probability of the same event but conditioned differently. The reason why one discourages saying "the probability that $\theta$ is in $I$ is 0.95" for confidence intervals is because this sentence implicitly means the second point: when we say "the probability that..." the conditioning is implicitly to what has been observed before : "I have seen some $X$, now what is the probability that $\theta$ is..." is formally "what is $P(\theta...\mid X)$". This implicit is reinforced by the (again implicit) suggestion you experience when reading "probability that $\theta$ is in $I$" that $\theta$ is the variable and $I$ the fixed object, while in frequentist analysis it is the opposite. Finally this is made even worse when you replace $I$ by your calculated interval. If you write: "The probability that $\theta$ is in $[4;5]$ is 0.95" then this is simply false. In frequentist analysis "$\theta$ is in $[4;5]$" is either true or false but is not a random event thus it does not have a probability (other than 0 or 1). Thus the sentence could only be meaningfully interpreted as the Bayesian one.
