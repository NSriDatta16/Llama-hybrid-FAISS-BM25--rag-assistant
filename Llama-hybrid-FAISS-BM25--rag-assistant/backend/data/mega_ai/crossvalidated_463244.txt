What might be a method for assessing number of cases required to achieve a 'stable' mean average value?

Apologies for what might be a basic question! I'm currently assessing whether to retain or remove cases where there is missing data (e.g. 167 data points monitored out of a potential 304) and I'm interested in exploring whether there might be a method to assess number of data points at which the mean average stabilises? In case data information might help, these are mean average daily air temperature calculations. Thanks!
