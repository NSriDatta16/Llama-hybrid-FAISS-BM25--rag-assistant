SQL datasource for gridview

I want to use a gridview with sorting and paging to display data from an SQL server, the query uses 3 joins and the full text search containstable. The from part of the query uses all 3 tables in the join. What is the best way to do this? I can think of a stored procedure, SQL directly in the SQLDataSource and creating a view in the database. I want good performance and would like to leverage the automatic sorting and paging features of the gridview as much as possible. Edit: About size, I suspect very few records, total about 1000 and a query would typical result in no more than 100 records and most times much less.
