Will ANOVA work for spatial data?

I have 16 variables separated into columns with 12 observations each. Each row represents a point along a sampling transect, so for example, A2, B2, C2, and so on are all different measurements but from the same point in space. I'm trying to find out if (and how) these different variables correlate, but it seems like a lot of tests I'm seeing are for replicate observations that produce an average, not data in space. I know ANOVA calculates variance which retains some of the information regarding spatial variation, but you would lose information like, for example, measurements 1 and 4 increase at point 7, but measurement 2 does not. This might be a little long-winded, but I don't know statistics well so I'm explaining it as well as I can. Thanks!
