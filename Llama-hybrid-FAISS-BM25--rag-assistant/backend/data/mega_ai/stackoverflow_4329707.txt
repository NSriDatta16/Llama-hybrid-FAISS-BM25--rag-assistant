There are a set of tests that explicitly exercise the public interfaces. I would treat those as black-box tests. There are a second set of tests that could be seen as looking at the corner cases of the implementation. This is white box testing and surely has a place in a Unit test. You can't know the interesting paths without some white-box implementation knowledge. I would pay particular attention to the String case, because the interface allows for strings that may not convert cleanly to doubles, that push the boundaries of precision etc. Would I cut a few corners in the integer case? I know I pushed the paths in the double case, probably shouldn't but might well under time pressure.
