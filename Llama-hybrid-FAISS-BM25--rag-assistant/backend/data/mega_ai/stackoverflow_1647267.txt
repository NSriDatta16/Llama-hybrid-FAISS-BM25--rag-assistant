.Net 4.0 Memory-Mapped Files verses RDMS Storage

I'm interested in people's thoughts comparing storing data in a traditional SQL based Database or utilising a Memory-Mapped File such as the one in the new .Net 4.0 runtime. The data in question would be arrays of simple structures. Obvious pros and cons: SQL Database Pros Adhoc query support SQL Management Tools Schema changes (adding more columns and setting default values) Memory-Mapped Pros Lighter overhead? (this is an assumption on my part) Shareable between process threads Any others? Is it worth it for performance gains?
