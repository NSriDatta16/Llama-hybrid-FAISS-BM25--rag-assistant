Is the requirement that I win at this game equivalent to the least squares criterion?

There is going to be a lottery with a certain number of participants. The organizer is going to take a normal distribution with some parameters for the mean and variance. He will then generate some number of samples (say 5) and give them to the first participant, repeat for the second one and so on. The participants have to guess the variance. Whoever comes the closest (absolute difference between the estimated and actual values) will win. What should I do to maximize my chances of winning? We know there are two estimators for the variance of the normal distribution, $s^2$ which is unbiased and $\hat{\sigma}^2$ which is biased, but does better on the mean squared error criterion (see here ). Is it better for this contest to use $\hat{\sigma}^2$ due to this? Follow-ups: If we replaced a normal distribution with another and the variance by some other arbitrary parameter, is it always the case that the estimator with the smallest mean squared error should be used? Is it ever possible for two estimators to have the same mean squared error and for some other criterion to become the deciding factor in that case? I realize I've asked a couple of questions here. The first one pertaining to the game where participants estimate the variance of the normal distribution is the most important.
