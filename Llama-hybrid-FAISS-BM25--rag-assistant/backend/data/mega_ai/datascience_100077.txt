Seems like the recommended option would be to store the trained embeddings in Azure Blob Storage and add it as a Dataset to the Azure ML workspace see here . Other option can be to have the embeddings file out of the snapshot see here To prevent unnecessary files from being included in the snapshot, make an ignore file (.gitignore or .amlignore) in the directory. Add the files and directories to exclude to this file. For more information on the syntax to use inside this file, see syntax and patterns for .gitignore. The .amlignore file uses the same syntax. If both files exist, the .amlignore file is used and the .gitignore file is unused.
