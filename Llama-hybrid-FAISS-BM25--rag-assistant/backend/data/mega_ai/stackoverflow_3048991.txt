Why Is Bottom Half of Custom UIActionSheet with UIDatePicker Disabled?

Everything seems to be working great with my UIActionSheet that contains a UIDatePicker except that the bottom half of the DatePicker is disabled. Visually there is a shadow that makes the bottom half of the picker darker than the top half. Everything in the bottom half is disabled and I can't for the life of me figure out how to enable it. I also noticed in my other "normal" UIActionSheets that just contain buttons, the bottom half of the cancel buttons are disabled. This is the code for my custom UIActionSheet: self.datePickerView = [[UIDatePicker alloc] init]; self.datePickerView.datePickerMode = UIDatePickerModeDate; self.actionSheet = [[UIActionSheet alloc] initWithTitle:@"Choose a Follow-up Date" delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:nil destructiveButtonTitle:nil otherButtonTitles:@"Done", nil]; [self.actionSheet showInView:self.view]; [self.actionSheet addSubview:self.datePickerView]; [self.actionSheet sendSubviewToBack:self.datePickerView]; [self.actionSheet setBounds:CGRectMake(0,0,320, 500)]; CGRect pickerRect = self.datePickerView.bounds; pickerRect.origin.y = -95; self.datePickerView.bounds = pickerRect; I've tried several things including sendSubviewToBack, BringSubviewToFront, etc but I have not had any luck. I appreciate your help! Here is a screenshot. I added the red boxes for clarification. alt text http://gorgando.com/UIActionSheet%20Problem.png
