Introduction to Algorithms is a very good book. You can read the book and follow the video lecture series available at AcademicEarth.org . But if you want to learn it with a specific language (C, C++ or Java), you can pick any of the data structures and algorithms books by Mark-Allen Weiss, Robert Lafore or Robert Sedgewick.
