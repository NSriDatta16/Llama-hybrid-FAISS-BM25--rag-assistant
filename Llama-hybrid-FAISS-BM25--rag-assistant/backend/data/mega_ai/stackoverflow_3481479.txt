Found some really neat information on retrieving the client's IP address here. Essentially, you should probably also pay attention to the Request.ServerVariables("HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR") as well. This helps to identify the actual IP address if the end user is going through a proxy whereas the REMOTE_ADDR attribute would be the address of the proxy...unless it is an anonymous proxy in which case, you would still just get the proxy address.
