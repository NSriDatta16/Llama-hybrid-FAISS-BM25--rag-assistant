@Carlos Jaime wrote me an e-mail and sure I will answer. @Mitch Wheat I don't know if you've seen Notes recently but since Notes 8 was released this is no longer your grand fathers Notes!! Notes is now based on Eclipse and a very modern and capable client. Probably one of the strongest enterprise clients, if not the strongest, on the market today. Many with views like yours either haven't seen (or used) a Notes client for a looooooong time or they are part of an organization that simply don't upgrade due to reasons that are beyond me.
