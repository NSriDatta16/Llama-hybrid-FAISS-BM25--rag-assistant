10-fold cross-validation (high variation)

I am using 10-fold validation method to validate my model. I am using CART model and my sample size $\approx$ 50. Features $\approx$ 9. The 10-fold validated accuracy (averages) is about 76%. However, I noticed that there is a a huge variation in the accuracy % for each of the folds ranging from 30% - 100%. Is this normal? Also, when I randomly permute the order of my observations and train my CART model (and repeat this process), there is a variation in my accuracy % (ranging from 68% - 84%). Right now I am doing about 25 trials and using the average from these 25 trials to gauge my model performance. Is this the right approach?
