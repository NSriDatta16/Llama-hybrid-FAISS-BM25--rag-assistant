How can I create a SQL query to also include acronyms?

Suppose I have a search for government registered charities, how can I craft my SQL query so that it also searches for acronyms of the query submitted? For example, if I search for 'Toronto SPCA' I would like it to return the results for 'Toronto Society for the Protect and Care of Animals' Is there a way I can write my TSQL so that it does this for me in a Freetext search? or do I need to parse out the acronym myself before generating the TSQL query?
