Why isn't storing cookies in a file good? Since WWW::Mechanize is built on top of LWP::UserAgent , you handle cookies just like you do in LWP::UserAgent . You can make the cookie jar a file or an in-memory hash. If you don't want to save the cookies in a file, use an empty hash reference when you construct the mech object: use WWW::Mechanize; my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new( cookie_jar => {} ); If you want to use a new file, make a new HTTP::Cookies object: use WWW::Mechanize; my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new( cookie_jar => HTTP::Cookies->new( file => "$ENV{HOME}/.cookies.txt" ) ); If you want to load a browser specific cookies file, use the right module for it: use WWW::Mechanize; my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new( cookie_jar => HTTP::Cookies::Netscape->new( file => $filename ) ); If you want no cookies at all, use undef explicitly: use WWW::Mechanize; my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new( cookie_jar => undef ); All of this is in the docs.
