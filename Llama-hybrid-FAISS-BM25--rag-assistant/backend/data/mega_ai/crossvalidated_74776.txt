What aspects of the "Iris" data set make it so successful as an example/teaching/test data set

The "Iris" dataset is probably familiar to most people here - it's one of the canonical test data sets and a go-to example dataset for everything from data visualization to machine learning. For example, everyone in this question ended up using it for a discussion of scatterplots separated by treatment. What makes the Iris data set so useful? Just that it was there first? If someone was trying to create a useful example/testing data set, what lessons could they take away from it?
