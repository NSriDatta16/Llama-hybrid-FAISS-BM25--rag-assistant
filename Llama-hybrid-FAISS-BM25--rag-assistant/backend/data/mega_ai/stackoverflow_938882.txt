.NET Windows Store Data

Well if i want to store data for a application machine wide i just use Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData) And if i want to store data per user i use Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData) But what if i want to save data per application instance? i could use the folder that the application is stored in but the "program files" folders are not made for this type of data storage if i understand it right... Edit: To clarify what i meant if i install the application 2 times in differnet folders... not instances running sorry.
