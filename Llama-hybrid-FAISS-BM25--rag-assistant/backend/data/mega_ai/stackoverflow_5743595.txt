The page itself has no state and won't remember anything the user did when you reload it. If you are using a server-side language as well you can save the value somewhere on the server (a database or simple flat file), but if you just have javascript and can't save the value to the server you can take a look at saving the value to a cookie and then restoring that value when the page reloads. If you're feeling really adventurous, HTML5 also gives you the ability to save content to something called local storage , although this is only supported by more advanced browsers.
