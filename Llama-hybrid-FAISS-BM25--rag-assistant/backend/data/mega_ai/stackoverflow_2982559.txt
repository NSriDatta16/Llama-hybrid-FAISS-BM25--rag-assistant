Extract number from string in MSBuild

I would like to extract the number from a string in MSBuild. How can I do that using the built in tasks or the MSBuild.Community.Tasks? (RegexMatch might do, but how?) Example: I have the string agent0076 and I would like to get out the number, without the leading zeros: 76
