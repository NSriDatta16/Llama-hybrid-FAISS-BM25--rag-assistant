For a logistic regression fitted by maximum likelihood, as long as you have both (1) and (2) in the model, then no matter what "default" value that you give new runners for (2), the estimate for (1) will adjust accordingly. For example, let $X_1$ be the indicator variable for "is a new runner", and $X_2$ be the variable "previous laptime in seconds". Then the linear predictor is: $\eta = \alpha + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots$ If the default for $X_2$ is zero, then the linear predictor for a new runner is: $\eta = \alpha + \beta_1 + \ldots$ whereas for an existing runner, it will be: $\eta = \alpha + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots$ Now suppose that you change the default for $X_2$ from 0 to -99. Then the linear predictor for a new runner is now: $\eta = \alpha + \beta'_1 - 99 \beta_2 + \ldots$ but for an existing runner, it will remain the same. So all you've done is reparameterise the model, such that $\beta'_1 - 99 \beta_2 = \beta_1$, and since maximum likelihood is paremeterisation invariant, the estimates will adjust accordingly. Of course, if you're not using maximum likelihood (i.e. you're using some sort of penalisation or prior on the parameters), then you're going to get different values unless you adjust the penalisation/prior accordingly. And if the model is non-linear (e.g. SVM, NN & Decision trees), then this argument doesn't work at all.
