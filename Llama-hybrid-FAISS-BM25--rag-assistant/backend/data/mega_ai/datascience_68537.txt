Checking if english sentences have impact catpured in them using NLP

I am looking for high level approach to identify if a given sentence has impact captured in it . For example in below two examples, sentence 2 has impact captured. Example 1 Sentence 1: I learnt speaking spanish this year. Sentence 2: I learnt speaking spanish this year which helped expand my business to Mexico. Example 2 Sentence 1 : I taught machine learning to my students this year. Sentence 2 : I taught machine learning to my students earlier this year which resulted in increasing base salary of students by 20,000 Dollars. My initial thought is below approach. think of all the english words like helped, resulted etc., Apply these words as filters on a public domain data set to get sentences Curate the sentences to see if they fall in the "Sentence 2" category. Apply classification/modelling to categorize into sentences with impact and without impact Question : Is the above approach good or there are better approaches? What is the best publicly available dateset to tackle this problem. Any inputs are greatly appreciated. Thanks alot in advance!
