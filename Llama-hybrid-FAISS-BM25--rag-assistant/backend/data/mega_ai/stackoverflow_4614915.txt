Sounds like the printer is caching the image. Try appending a random number to the image name each time perhaps? Edit: Another possibility is that in the line: Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage("barcode.jpg"); The toolkit is caching the image rather than reloading it. Edit 2: From the javadoc for getImage: Returns an image which gets pixel data from the specified file, whose format can be either GIF, JPEG or PNG. The underlying toolkit attempts to resolve multiple requests with the same filename to the same returned Image. Since the mechanism required to facilitate this sharing of Image objects may continue to hold onto images that are no longer of use for an indefinite period of time, developers are encouraged to implement their own caching of images by using the createImage variant wherever available. To me that sounds like its caching the image - have you tried using createImage() instead?
