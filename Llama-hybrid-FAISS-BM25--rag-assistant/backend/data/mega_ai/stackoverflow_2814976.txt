I am not sure if i understand exactly what you try to achive, but i guess you are heading in wrong direction. What would prevent you from just having roles independend from the client and store to which client an admin belongs to: admin1 -> GOOG admin2 -> MSFT With this information just use [Authorize(Roles="Admin")] and show the user only data that belongs to his organisation: [Authorize(Roles="Admin")] public class AdminController : Controller { var data = GetDataForDomain(); //retreive data based on organisation of the user }
