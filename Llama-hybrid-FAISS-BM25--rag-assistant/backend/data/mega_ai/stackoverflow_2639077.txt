Follow the logic of your program, looking at what happens to the indices variable. Since you assigned some malloc storage to it, there needs to be a corresponding free . So, figure out: where that variable gets freed when that's supposed to happen are there any conditions when it doesn't happen? (for example, exiting a function early due to an error)
