Is a logistic regression biased when the outcome variable is split 5% - 95%?

I am building a propensity model using logistic regression for a utility client. My concern is that out of the total sample my 'bad' accounts are just 5%, and the rest are all good. I am predicting 'bad'. Will the result be biassed? What is optimal 'bad to good proportion' to build a good model?
