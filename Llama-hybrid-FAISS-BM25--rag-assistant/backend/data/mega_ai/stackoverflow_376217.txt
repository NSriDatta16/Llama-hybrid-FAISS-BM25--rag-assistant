If you limit your requirements to languages that are based on latin scripts with some extensions, then you'll have a much larger choice as if you were to require "wide unicode support". Most professional, high-quality fonts should support those easily. A good indication of this is that Microsoft uses the same basic fonts in their western language software products. On the other side of the software world there are the DejaVu fonts which provide great coverage for those scripts and are widely used on many Linux distributions. The real pain with fonts starts when you want to display arabic scripts and far easern characters (and to a lesser extend greek and cyrillic characters). And as a side note: a good browser should choose a different font if the selected font isn't capable of rendering a given glyph. Be sure to provide a generic font-family in your CSS (possibly in addition to a more specific font choice) to help the browser with this fall-back.
