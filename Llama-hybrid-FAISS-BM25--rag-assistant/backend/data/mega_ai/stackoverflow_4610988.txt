Ok, finally figured this one out. Exchange takes a lot of liberty when it re-renders the HTML and assumes that you want to put a relative web link versus network path. That's why all the "\" were converted to "/". The way around this is to add "file:///" prior to the href address: \\abc\123 will work!
