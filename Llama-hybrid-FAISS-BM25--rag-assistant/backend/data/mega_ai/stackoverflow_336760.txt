Enable ListView multiselect by dragging

How do I enable multi-select in a WPF ListView by dragging? Setting the SelectionMode property to Extended does allow multi-select using Shift and Ctrl, but not by clicking and dragging. Setting the SelectionMode property to Multiple gives a sticky selection which isn't what I want.
