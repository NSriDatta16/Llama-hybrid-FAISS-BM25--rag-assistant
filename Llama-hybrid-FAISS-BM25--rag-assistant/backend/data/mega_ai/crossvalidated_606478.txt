The data to which you fit the VAE has noise. If you fit a model that allows no noise (randomness) then this randomness will no where to go but into the coefficients (weights). A perfect model will allow for the noise to find its resting place in the randomness (noise) component of the model, and let the weights to set on the correct values.
