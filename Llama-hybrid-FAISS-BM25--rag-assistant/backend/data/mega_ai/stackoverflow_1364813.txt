Version-control the test cases

Should the test plan be kept in the version control with the code ? That is, the test plan and the code are put under the same version control system and have the same revision numerating. I am not talking about unit test code, but a test plan document populating with manual test cases. There are some web-based test case management systems, but I doubt how the test cases are version-controlled and synchronized with the code ? UPDATE: Acutally I am looking for a web-based test management system for my oragnization, because it allows easy access to the non-developers team members (i.e. no need to use VC to check out the test plan from the repository). However, I'd prefer to version-control these test plans, synchronized with major milestone/releases of the software. I've not found any test management system satisfying this need. Or I am looking in the wrong direction ?
