If you are working with large amounts of data, and caching isn't cutting it, look into Sphinx. We've had great results with using SphinxSearch not only for better text searching, but also as a data retrieval replacement for MySQL when dealing larger tables. If you use SphinxSE (MySQL plugin), it surpassed our performance gains we had from caching several times over, and application-implementation is a sinch.
