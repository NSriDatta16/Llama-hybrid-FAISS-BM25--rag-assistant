It's a tiny bit less efficient, but you still should generally not make your object state public. Although public members are considered bad in most OO languages, there's actually a pragmatic reason why in Objective-C: The framework uses your "getter" and "setter" methods to make certain things automatic, such as memory management and KVO notifications. With ivars accessed from multiple places, every piece of client code needs to fully understand all the responsibilities that the accessor methods were taking on and perform those duties in the exact same way itself. So it's no "absolutely don't access your own ivars," but just make sure you fully understand what it entails in a given situation.
