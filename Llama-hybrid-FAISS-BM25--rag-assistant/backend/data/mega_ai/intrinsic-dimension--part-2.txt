is type of function is constant along one or several dimensions its Fourier transform must appear like an impulse (the Fourier transform of a constant) along the same dimension in the frequency domain. A simple example Let f be a two-variable function which is i1D. This means that there exists a normalized vector n ∈ R 2 {\textstyle \mathbf {n} \in \mathbb {R} ^{2}} and a one-variable function g such that f ( x ) = g ( n T x ) {\textstyle f(\mathbf {x} )=g(\mathbf {n} ^{\operatorname {T} }\mathbf {x} )} for all x ∈ R 2 {\textstyle \mathbf {x} \in \mathbb {R} ^{2}} . If F is the Fourier transform of f (both are two-variable functions) it must be the case that F ( u ) = G ( n T u ) ⋅ δ ( m T u ) {\textstyle F\left(\mathbf {u} \right)=G\left(\mathbf {n} ^{\mathrm {T} }\mathbf {u} \right)\cdot \delta \left(\mathbf {m} ^{\mathrm {T} }\mathbf {u} \right)} . Here G is the Fourier transform of g (both are one-variable functions), δ is the Dirac impulse function and m is a normalized vector in R 2 {\textstyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} perpendicular to n. This means that F vanishes everywhere except on a line which passes through the origin of the frequency domain and is parallel to m. Along this line F varies according to G. The general case Let f be an N-variable function which has intrinsic dimension M, that is, there exists an M-variable function g and M × N matrix A such that f ( x ) = g ( A x ) ∀ x {\textstyle f(\mathbf {x} )=g(\mathbf {Ax} )\quad \forall \mathbf {x} } . Its Fourier transform F can then be described as follows: F vanishes everywhere except for a subspace of dimension M The subspace M is spanned by the rows of the matrix A In the subspace, F varies according to G the Fourier transform of g Generalizations The type of intrinsic dimension described above assumes that a linear transformation is applied to the coordinates of the N-variable function f to produce the M variables which are necessary to represent every value of f. This means that f is constant along lines, planes, or hyperplanes, depending on N and M. In a general case, f has intrinsic dimension M if there exist M functions a1, a2, ..., aM and an M-variable function g such that f ( x ) = g ( a 1 ( x ) , a 2 ( x ) , … , a M ( x ) ) {\textstyle f(\mathbf {x} )=g\left(a_{1}(\mathbf {x} ),a_{2}(\mathbf {x} ),\dots ,a_{M}(\mathbf {x} )\right)} for all x M is the smallest number of functions which allows the above transformation A simple example is transforming a 2-variable function f to polar coordinates: f ( y 1 + y 2 2 , y 1 − y 2 2 ) = g ( y 1 ) {\displaystyle f\left({\frac {y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}},{\frac {y_{1}-y_{2}}{2}}\right)=g\left(y_{1}\right)} f ( x 1 , x 2 ) = g ( x 1 2 + x 2 2 ) {\displaystyle f(x_{1},x_{2})=g\left({\sqrt {x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}}}\right)} , f is i1D and is constant along any circle centered at the origin f ( x 1 , x 2 ) = g ( arctan ⁡ ( x 2 x 1 ) ) {\displaystyle f(x_{1},x_{2})=g\left(\arctan \left({\frac {x_{2}}{x_{1}}}\right)\right)} , f is i1D and is constant along all rays from the origin For the general case, a simple description of either the point sets for which f is constant or its Fourier transform is usually not possible. Local Intrinsic Dimensionality Local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) refers to the observation that often data is distributed on a lower-dimensional manifold when only considering a nearby subset of the data. For example the function f ( x , y ) = x + max { 0 , | y | − 1 } {\displaystyle f(x,y)=x+\max\{0,|y|-1\}} can be considered one-dimensional when y is close to 0 (with one variable x), two-dimensional when y is close to 1, and again one-dimensional when y is positive and much larger than 1 (with variable x+y). Local intrinsic dimensionality is often used with respect to data. It then usually is estimated based on the k nearest neighbors of a data point, often based on a concept related to the doubling dimension in mathematics. Since the volume of a d-sphere grows exponentially in d, the rate at which new neighbors are f
