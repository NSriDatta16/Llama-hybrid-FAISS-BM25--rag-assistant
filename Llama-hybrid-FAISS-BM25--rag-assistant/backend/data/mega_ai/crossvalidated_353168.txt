Do equal percentage changes mean perfect correlation?

Consider two datasets, say time series $\{X(t),Y(t)|t\geq0\}$, and that the two experience an equal percentage change from one period to the next for all time. That is, if there is an $\alpha \%$ change in $X(t)$ it is accompanied by an $\alpha \%$ change in $Y(t)$ from time $t$ to $t+1$. Are $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ perfectly linearly correlated? If so, is there any way to show it explicitly using knowledge of the percentage changes being equal?
