Thoughts? You haven't said how it is better... (or how it is better to a flat BLOB/database/file solution). Also, regular .NET (binary) serialization isn't well-suited to long-term storage (in a database), since it is implementation-specific (and tied to the assemblies). For serialization, you might want to look at platform-independent solutions such as Google's protocol buffers (which has implementations for C++, java , C#, and others - including one of my own ).
