While there is something to this Bayesian line of reasoning (deconstructed very thoroughly by Erik!), and indeed this line of thought would explain why many medical findings cannot be reproduced, this particular argument applies that thinking like a sledgehammer. The author presupposes two things without providing evidence: that exposure to smoke was chosen at random, and that almost nothing in the world causes heart disease. Under these lax standards of reasoning, the author could reject ANY conclusion that something causes heart disease. All you would need to do is assert: That the hypothesis was chosen at random, and That heart disease has very close to zero causes. Both of these assertions are debatable (and, based on my general knowledge, very likely false). But, with these assumptions in place, even observing that 100% of people exposed to secondhand smoke dropped dead of a heart attack within a year, you could assert that the connection is merely a coincidental correlation with the hidden, singular, "true" cause.
