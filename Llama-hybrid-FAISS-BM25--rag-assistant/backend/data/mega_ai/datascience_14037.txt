There is not such thing as "the best way to impute data". The best method will always depend on your specific application and model. Just remember the No Free Lunch Theorem. There are many ways in which you can impute values. You can ignore the rows containing missing values, you can impute values based on the other rows (mean, using classification, etc.), or you can even replace the missing values by a constant. Which method to use will depend on how much effort you want to put into the imputation algorithm and the final results. As usual, I'd start by using a simple method (the average, as you suggested), and increase the complexity of the imputation only if the results are not satisfactory enough.
