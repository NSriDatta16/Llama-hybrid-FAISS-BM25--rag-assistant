Randomization techniques might be more powerful than ANOVA in some circumstances, but not necessarily. See " Comparative Power Of The Anova, Randomization Anova, And Kruskal-Wallis Test " . Randomization techniques are usually more powerful than non-parametric rank transformation tests like Kruskal Wallis. See Adams and Anthony " Using randomization techniques to analyse behavioural data" . I think their main strength though is that they don't invoke assumptions related to normality; non-parametric methods in general (bootstrap, jacknife, randomization) can handle data from any distribution. It has been argued that for many study designs randomization tests offer conceptual advantages over hypothesis testings because available items or subjects are generally randomized to treatments rather than truly randomly selected from a population then randomly assigned to treatment; see Ludbrook & Hugh Dudley " Why Permutation Tests are Superior to t and F Tests in Biomedical Research ". There are lower limits to sample size and I;ve seen writers lament that people will take advice that non-parametric methods "work well with small sample sizes" and use them with samples sizes You should probably also assess to what extent you are violating ANOVA assumptions; perhaps a generalized linear model with a binomial (logistic regression), poisson or negative binomial distribution would be more appropriate if your response variable is, for example, a count.
