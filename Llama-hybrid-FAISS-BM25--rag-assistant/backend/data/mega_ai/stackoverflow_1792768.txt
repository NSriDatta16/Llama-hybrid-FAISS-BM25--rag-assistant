NULL is stored more efficently (NULL bit map) then empty string (2 bytes for varchar length, or "n" for char) Storage engine blog: Why is the NULL bitmap in a record an optimization? I've seen some articles that say different, but for char/varchar I've found NULL to be be useful and tend to treat empty string the same as NULL. I've also found the NULL is quicker in queries than empty string too. YMMV of course and I'll evaluate each case on it's own merits.
