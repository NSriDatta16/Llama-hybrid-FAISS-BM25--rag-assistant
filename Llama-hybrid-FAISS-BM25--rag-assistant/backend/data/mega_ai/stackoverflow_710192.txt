Creating a table in JavaScript/JQuery is not the most elegant code either. So I would miss the Repeater control. Also, there are workarounds for the ClientId issue. I have a lot of code in my page that looks like this: var myTextBoxId = ' '; If there are a bunch of controls I need the client ID for I will put them in an object var myControlIds = { MyTextBoxID: ' ' }; Another work around is to put specific css classes on your controls or custom attribute name/values. So your textbox could be: And my final trick is to use the "Ends With" attribute finder. So your JQuery, instead of $("#MyTextBox") // doesn't work because of client id mangalling instead do: $("[id $=MyTextBox]") This searches the 'id' attribute of all controls to find one with a value that ends with "MyTextBox"
