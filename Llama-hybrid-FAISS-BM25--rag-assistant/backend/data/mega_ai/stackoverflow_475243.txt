It's not as clear cut as it used to be. It used to be build a parse tree, bind it, and execute it (often binding at the last second). BASIC was mostly done this way. You could claim that things that run bytecode (java/.net) without doing a JIT are interpriters - but not in the traditional sense since you still have to 'compile' to bytecode. The old school difference was: If it generates CPU code it's a compiler. If you run it directly in your editing environment and can interact with it while editing, it's an interpriter. That was far less formal than the actual Dragon book - but I hope it's informative.
