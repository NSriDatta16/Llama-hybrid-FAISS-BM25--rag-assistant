Off the top of my head, I'd get a collector object / class that pulled sequentially from each stream with the collector sleeping as appropriate (probably via a moving average comparison). This will balance your streams to allow the full bandwidth limit to be achieved if one is slower than the other... you'll poll to pull, find it empty, and pull the next stream before sleeping. Since your collector is limited by aggregate data pulled / time you'll get the right client side bandwidth.
