I always follow the 80-character limit, in any language, for a few reasons: Consistency, consistency, consistency. Possibility of multiple views in multiple windows or columns. Seamless switching between old and new editors. Encourages keeping nesting shallow, arguments few, and expressions succinct. The last is the most important, and integrates comfortably with verbose naming conventions. If it doesn't fit on one line or neatly break into two, then regardless of your naming, the code probably needs to be adjusted anyway. Though I refer to it as the 80-character limit, in practice it's a good idea to keep to 79 or even 78 columns, for those console editors that insist on a scrollbar and a border. On a related note, I use tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment. This way, formatting is not disturbed if the tab size is changed. With regard to the 80-column rule, though, I minimally ensure that the code does not hit the margin when using 4-column tabs, since tab sizes higher than that are less common.
