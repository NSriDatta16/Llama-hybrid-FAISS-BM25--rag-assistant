So you're a developer who's new to the iPhone and need to come up with an estimate and how much to charge? Software development is an inherently unpredictable process, however there are many techniques to address the unpredictability. For any specific project, it's impossible to predict with much certainty the outcome, but you can aggregate many iPhone projects and calculate some averages. What I've heard is for a prototype or wireframe, it's $10,000 to $15,000 USD and about a month of full-time work. For a simple app to completion, around $30,000. And for more complex apps, it is around $50,000 to $80,000. I've heard that hourly rates range from $50 to $200, and that's in NYC. Rates are highly variable because the quality of programmers is highly variable. Even the most conservative estimates put good programmers at five times the productivity of poor programmers. You're probably going to be spending many hours off the clock learning iPhone development, and the on-clock hours are going to be long because you're going to be making a lot of mistakes. My advice is to learn iPhone dev with your own project, because you can learn at your own pace without a client and do things right. Set yourself a deadline, etc. But if you decide to go with your project, the above ballpark figures are a start.
