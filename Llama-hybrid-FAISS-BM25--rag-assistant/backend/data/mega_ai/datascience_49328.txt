Neural network with different input shapes

I'm currently designing the architecture of a neural network for the colorization of grayscale images. Later on it should be able to colorize images with different sizes and different aspect ratios. I read that this would not be possible with a common CNN. I also read that the only options are downscaling the images to one specific size or to use a big fixed size (like 3000x3000px) and to fill the remaining space black. Both of these options don't seem to be that elegant. The first one is the opposite of what I want and the second would make the neural network slower. Then I read about Fully Convolutional Networks and that this problem would not exist there. This would be great if it really works. I would like to know why this special network can deal with different input shapes. And maybe you could show me some tensorflow code of such a network. By the way, I thought about an Autoencoder combined with a GAN for the architecture. I know that this question is very general, but I would really appreciate your help.
