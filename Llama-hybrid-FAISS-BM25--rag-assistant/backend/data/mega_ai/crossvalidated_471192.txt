About the power spectral density of poly-cyclostationary process

For a cyclostationary process (CS), I know that the time-averaged power spectral density (PSD) is derived by the Fourier transform of the zeroth-order cyclic autocorrelation function. How about poly-cyclostationary processes (PCS)? Assuming that a PCS composes N independent CS and each CS has an incommensurate period Tn , does anyone know how to derive the PSD of the PCS?
