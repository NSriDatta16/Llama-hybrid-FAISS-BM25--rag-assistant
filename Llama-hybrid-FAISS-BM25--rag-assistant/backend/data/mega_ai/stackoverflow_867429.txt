There are only 30 of them it's 2 hours work man just fix them. I completely disagree with anyone who says a deadline supercedes fixing these warnings. You will waste more time churning later on problems in the post code completion stages than if you fixed your problems now. Ignore your manager he probably is a moron who wants to look good to his boss. Initial quality and a correct design is more important than his arbitrary deadlines (within reason). The fact that you have warnings in the first place means that someone was sloppy with the code. Double check the areas where there are warnings exist for correctness. If you are using code analysis or are writing C/C++ then warnings are sometimes really not valid. In that case pragma them out (C/C++) or System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage. This can be done automatically from VS2008. I have not seen any .net warnings that were not valid outside of code analysis.
