It's a rolling standard deviation that you want - i.e. one that computes the standard deviation on a rolling basis as you move further up the time steps in the series. The problem with time series is that the mean is constantly changing, i.e. the mean for the first 10 observations will be different from the mean for the last 10. In this regard, if you were to compute standard deviation on a rolling basis, then this should suit your needs better. That said, even if the time series isn't "tight enough", this doesn't necessarily mean that you cannot forecast with this. It may be the case that ARIMA doesn't give great forecasts, but volatility-based models such as GARCH or LSTM will.
