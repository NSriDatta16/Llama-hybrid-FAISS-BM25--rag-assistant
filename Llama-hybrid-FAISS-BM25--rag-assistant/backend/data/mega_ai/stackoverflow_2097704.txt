The problem is that story points define effort. Days are duration. The two have an almost random relationship. duration = f ( effort ) . That function is based on the skill of the person actually doing the work. A person knows how long they will take to do the work. That's duration. In days. They don't know this abstract 'effort' thing. They don't know how long a hypothetical person of average skills will require to do it. The best you can do is both -- story points (effort) and days (duration). You can't replace one with the other. If you try to use only effort, then you'll eventually need to get to days for planning purposes. You'll have to apply a person to the story points and compute a duration from the effort.
