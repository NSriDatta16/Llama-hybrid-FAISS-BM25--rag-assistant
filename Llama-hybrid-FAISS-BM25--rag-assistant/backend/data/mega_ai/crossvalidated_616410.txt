Use of polynomial regression when I can identify more curves

Hello I am modeling a regression for my school project and one of the question I got from my professor was, how would I model this with polynomial regression. I have quite good random forest and knn regression models, however it is desired that I improve my polynomial regression model. My question is, is polynomial regression any good for identifying multiple curves? Should I try to raise my polynomial regression degree, so its more "wobbly", or should I try to make 2 different models, as it is fairly easy to identify into which curve does the data point go? I included a picture of the graph:
