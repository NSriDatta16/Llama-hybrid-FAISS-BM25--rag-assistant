The concept of i18n and l10n is broader than merely translating strings to and fro some languages. Example: Consider the input of date and time by users. If you haven't internationalization in mind when you design a) the interface for the user and b) the storage, retrieval and display mechanism you will get a really bad time, when you want to enable other input schemes. Agreed, in most cases i18n is not necessary in the first place. But, and that is my point, if you don't spend a thought on some areas, that must be touched for i18n, you will find yourself ending up rewriting large portions of the original code. And then, adding i18n is a lot more expensive than having spent some thought beforehand.
