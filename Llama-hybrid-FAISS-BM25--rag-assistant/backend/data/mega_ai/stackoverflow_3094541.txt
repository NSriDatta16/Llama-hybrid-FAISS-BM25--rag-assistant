So it sounds like you don't want to use a neural network. I have found that neural networks are more difficult and take longer to train in these types of sparse feature spaces. You want to predict (I believe) books that a person might like given their ratings and the ratings of people who made similar purchases. You should look at collaborative filtering . I am not saying that you can't solve the problem with neural networks but I am not sure that you want would really want to.
