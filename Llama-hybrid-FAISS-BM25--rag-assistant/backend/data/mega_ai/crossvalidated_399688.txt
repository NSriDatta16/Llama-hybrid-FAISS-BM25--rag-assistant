Combining custom YOLO network for face detection with another CNN

I am looking for a way to build and train an end-to-end CNN that contains two steps: 1) a CNN for finding a face and hands in the image and 2) CNN that works on the crops of the face and hands. To accomplish the first step I was thinking of: 1) finetuning a YOLO network for detection of faces & hands, but YOLO has tons of parameters for detecting many classes of objects; 2) building a custom YOLO-style network and training both CNNs at once. Any other ideas? Any suggestions or links are highly welcome!
