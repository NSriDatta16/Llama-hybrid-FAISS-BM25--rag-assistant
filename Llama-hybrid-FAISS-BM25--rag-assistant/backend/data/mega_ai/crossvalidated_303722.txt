Methods to work around the problem of missing data in machine learning

Virtually any database we want to make predictions using machine learning algorithms will find missing values ​​for some of the characteristics. There are several approaches to address this problem, to exclude lines that have missing values ​​until they fill with the mean values ​​of the characteristics. I would like to use for a somewhat more robust approach, which would basically run a regression (or another method) where the dependent variable (Y) would be each of the columns that have missing values ​​but only with the rows of the table that contain all the data , and predict the missing values ​​with this method, complete the table by the table and move to the next 'column' with missing values ​​and repeat the method until everything is filled. But that gives me some doubts. Why any column start? I believe that the one with the smallest missing values ​​until the one with the most Is there any threshold of missing values ​​that is not worth trying to complete it? (for example, if this characteristic only has 10% of the values ​​filled would not it be more interesting to exclude it) Is there any kind of implementation in traditional packages or other methods that are robust to missings?
