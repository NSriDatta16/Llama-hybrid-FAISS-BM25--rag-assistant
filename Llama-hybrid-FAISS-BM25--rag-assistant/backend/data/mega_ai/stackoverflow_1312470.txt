The Ada Crypto Library supports big unsigned numbers ( Big_Numbers ). You can download the lib from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libadacrypt-dev/ . I recommend checking out the svn. The Big_Numbers multiplication function of the current release has a minor bug. You can compile the lib with the current GNAT compiler from the AdaCore Libre site . The lib will not compile under gcc-4.3 or gcc-4.4 because of a bug in gcc . Finally, I will give you a small exmple how to multiply two 512-bit Big_Numbers from the LibAdaCrypt. package Test.Big_Numbers is with Crypto.Types.Big_Numbers; pragma Elaborate_All(Crypto.Types.Big_Numbers); package Big is new Crypto.Types.Big_Numbers(512); use Big; use Big.Utils; end Test.Big_Numbers; package body Test.Big_Numbers is x : Big_Unsigned := To_Big_Unsigned("16#57C19F8F7866F8633AC1D25B92FC83B4#"); Y : Big_Unsigned := To_Big_Unsigned("16#FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF60#"); x := X * Y; Put_Line(X); end Test.Big_Numbers; Best regards Christian
