In Fallout 3 in particular, the map is divided in a grid fashion. You can only see your current square and the ones immediately next. The type of data store is not really important - can be a SQLite database, can be a tree serialized to disk, or can be something else entirely. ...you would you have a gigantic array of every object in the game, and constantly update a smaller list that holds the visible objects to render? Generally yes, but the "gigantic array" doesn't need to be in memory. And there are more lists - objects in current and adjacent grid square (you can be attacked from behind - not in visible list), the visible list, the timer list... Would would happen if you eventually touched every object in the game? Would your save game get bigger and bigger? Could - if there is a default state table for everything, the save can contain only the differences. The save will then grow as you progress. Everything is persisted when you leave/return to a location. Nope. Items you drop outside of your house will eventually disappear. Bodies too, probably. Random monsters are respawned every once in a while. This is both convenient to game designers and consistent with the real world.
