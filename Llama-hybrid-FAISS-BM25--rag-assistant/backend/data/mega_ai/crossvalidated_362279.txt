Magnitude of non-ergodicity effect on the individual's risk of bankruptcy

Dr. Ole Peters presents the concept of (non-)ergodicity with the following gambling example : You're given $\$100$ to play a game where you toss a coin once a minute. If it comes up heads, you win $50\%$ of your wager, while you lose $40\%$ if tails. Averaging over $1$ million sequences (or players) results in the plot on the left below, which shows this is a favorable game: This is the ensemble perspective, or the idea of parallel worlds, which do not apply to the individual, who can go broke ( absorbing states ), and drop out of the game. Considering longer time sequences, the average over time ($1$ year) will also get rid of the noise, and result in the plot to the right above. I am having problems reproducing these plots in R. The idea is there, but the drop is much more rapid in the time perspective plot: Is there a much more rapid bankruptcy tendency for the individual player than led to believe by the plots on the talk? Or is it simply differences in the frequency and length of sampling in the original code from the lecture, which is not shared, as for example, less sampling points along the time line? # ENSEMBLE PATTERN: sam = 60 # Sixty samples (1 per minute) mat = matrix(0, sam, 10^6) # The experiment is repeated 1 million times for (i in 1:10^6){ mat[1,i] = 100 # Each time the money wagered is $100 for(j in 2:(sam-1)){ # H's wins 50% tails loses 40% mat[j,i]
