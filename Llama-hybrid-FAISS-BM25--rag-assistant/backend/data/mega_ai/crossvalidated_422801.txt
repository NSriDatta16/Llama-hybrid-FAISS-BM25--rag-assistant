How to compare different data preprocessing when using CNN from sratch

Let's says you use a CNN for image classification. You have binary images: pixel values = 0 or 1. Some tools can be used to get those images with continuous values (i'll not explain how since that not the purpose of the post). You don't know which encoding format is best. Now you build a CNN from scratch, so you'll optimise you'r CNN on one image format (you decided to build it using binary images). So you'r model will very likely be better on binary image since it's has been build on this format The only way to know if using continuous value can be better than binary value is to create a new CNN from scratch, using different hyperparameter or architecture?
