If you want Async operation with variables, I would construct a table to hold the variables you wanted to pass in, and an Agent job launched SSIS with them. Then you could use sp_start_job to launch that job asynchronously. The package could read the variables it needed from the table, or the job could read them to construct an appropriate launch command. The package could even update the table to indicate results back to BizTalk.
