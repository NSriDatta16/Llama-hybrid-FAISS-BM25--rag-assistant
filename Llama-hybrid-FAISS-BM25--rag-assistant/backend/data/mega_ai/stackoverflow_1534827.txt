Except for the App.config, that has to be in the application folder, you can put them anywhere. I would recommend however that you establish a logical organized folder structure under your application folder for all the required application files, and a " config " folder for all config files is certainly a good start at that. Just remember that if a config file is not in the application folder, you have to put a redirection line in the app.config to tell the configuration subsystem where to find it...
