What are your Common Magento Configuration Mistakes?

If there's something that everybody hates about Magento it's endlessly configuring your modules before being able to write some code. I'm trying to collect a list of common Magento configuration errors for a future project that's I'm close to launching. I'm looking for specific examples of things like using the wrong naming convention on classnames, forgetting the wrapper when setting up grouped class names. Little things like that that drive you batty for hours until you realize your error. The more details the better!
