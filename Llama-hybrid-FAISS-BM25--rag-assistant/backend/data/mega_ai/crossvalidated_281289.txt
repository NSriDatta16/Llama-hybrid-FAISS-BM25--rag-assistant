How to detect distribution changes within population?

I have a time series data of populations, e.g. for each time point, I have the blood pressure of 1 million of rats. How can I monitor that the distribution of this population drift over time? For instance, if it is normal distribution, then the mean and variance might drift over time. But I do not know the distribution of my data, is there any nonparametric method to detect distribution drift over time? Another example will be the world-wide income distribution, and I have 100 years of data. How to measure the distribution changing year over year? Thanks.
