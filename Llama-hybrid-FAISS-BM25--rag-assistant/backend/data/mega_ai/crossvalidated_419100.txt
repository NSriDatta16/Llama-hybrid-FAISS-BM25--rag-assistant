I think you should use the following as CL: CL = mean(Error Rate) ± ×std(Error Rate)/10 10 comes from sqrt(100). Error Rate is the average Error Rate from each CV round, so it is averaged over every 5-fold CV. So Error Rate has 100 elements. Alternatively you can use bootstrapping of Error Rate. Let's say you create 60 bootstrapped samples from Error Rate, for each of the 60 bootstrapped samples, you'd calculate the mean. So you get 60 Error_Bootstrap values. Now use CL = mean(Error_Bootstrap) ± ×std(Error_Bootstrap) Notice how we don't need to divide by sqrt(size) in bootstrapped calculation. Hope this helps.
