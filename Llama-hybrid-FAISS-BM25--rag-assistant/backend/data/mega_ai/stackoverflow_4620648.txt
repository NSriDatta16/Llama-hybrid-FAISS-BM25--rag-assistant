Yes, cross-platform coders will still be able to read the XML, but it is not the best option. Scott Hanselman says : Returning DataSets from WebServices is the Spawn of Satan and Represents All That Is Truly Evil in the World Here is the XML produced for simple DataSet containing 1 table, with 2 columns and two records: hello world hello greg Your cross-platform coders will need to parse the XML, which can become very cumbersome, especially if the data is complex. DataSets are really about representing the Database - in a well designed, layered application, they should only be used in the Data Access Layer. They should then be morphed into strongly-typed domain/model objects, which know nothing about databases. A much better option is to use custom objects. There is an example for how to do this on Ryan Farleys blog . The main advantages of using custom objects are: 1. They are fully interoperable. 2. They are strongly typed. 3. The consumer is not responsible for parsing/deserializing XML. 4. Separation of concerns between data storage and consumer. Side-note: I should point out that web-services are becoming out-dated. If you're creating a new web service you really should use WCF. It takes some learning but it's a much richer and more flexible platform.
