Opening multiple files in C++

I have this code to open multiple files one at a time that is given at the command line, and then if it cannot open one of the files, it closes all the files and exits. /* Opens an array of files and returns a pointer to the first * element (the first file). */ ifstream *OpenFiles(char * const fileNames[], size_t count) { /* If no command line arguments, error and exit */ if (count == 0) { cerr = 0; loopCount--) { fileObj[loopCount].close(); cout I am doing this for homework and my teacher has another checker we have to submit to and gives me these types of warnings: Assign8_1.cpp(44): error 445: (Warning -- Reuse of for loop variable 'loopCount' at 'line 40' could cause chaos) return fileObj; Assign8_1.cpp(51): error 850: (Info -- for loop index variable 'loopCount' whose type category is 'integral' is modified in body of the for loop that began at 'line 40') return fileObj; Assign8_1.cpp(51): error 449: (Warning -- Pointer variable 'fileObj' previously deallocated [Reference: file Assign8_1.cpp: lines 30, 48]) Assign8_1.cpp(30): error 831: (Info -- Reference cited in prior message) Assign8_1.cpp(48): error 831: (Info -- Reference cited in prior message) } Assign8_1.cpp(63): error 818: (Info -- Pointer parameter 'files' (line 55) could be declared as pointing to const) } Starting with the first warning, I was wondering why I shouldn't use my loopCount variable twice the way I do in my code. That was the way I thought it would work, keeping track of which file I am looking at, opening, and closing it appropriately. Does anyone know what error 449 means? Thanks.
