OK, so values at time t-1 predict values at time t. That makes sense. First you should decide whether you think these values are independent or not. Do the x predict the y or z at all? And, do you think just the previous 1 value is predictive, or the previous n? Either way you could model this as a simple regression problem. What technique is best really depends on what you expect the relationship to be, and what these variables are; I am not sure that's given here. For example if they're sensor values read fairly rapidly, and the sensor changes slowly, you'd expect some simple model like a moving average to do well. For other types of values this would not be predictive at all. This looks like the Markov chain model, so you may look into that, but somehow I think it's over-general for what I think the problem is.
