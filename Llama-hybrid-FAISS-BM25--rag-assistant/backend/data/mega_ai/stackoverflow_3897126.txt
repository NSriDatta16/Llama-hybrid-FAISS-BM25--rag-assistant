Elegant isn't typically the word that jumps to mind when you have to hack the way the native Windows control works, but that's what required here. Do consider if you really want your control to behave differently from the listviews in any other program. Add a new class to your project and paste the code shown below. Compile. Drop the new control from the top of the toolbox onto your form. using System; using System.Windows.Forms; class MyListView : ListView { protected override void WndProc(ref Message m) { // Filter WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK if (m.Msg != 0x203) base.WndProc(ref m); } }
