Transforming a time series so it is stationary

I am not sure if I am undertaking the following steps correctly. I am trying to make this time series stationary: as you can see, it is decreasing: In the beginning I tried taking log, but it is still decreasing: Then I take differences, but still it doesn't look stationary to me: Did I do anything wrong? What can I do to make it stationary? I need it to be stationary to use ACF and PACF.
