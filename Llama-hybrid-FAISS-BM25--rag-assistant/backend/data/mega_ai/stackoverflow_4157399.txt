How do I copy a hash in Ruby?

I'll admit that I'm a bit of a ruby newbie (writing rake scripts, now). In most languages, copy constructors are easy to find. Half an hour of searching didn't find it in ruby. I want to create a copy of the hash so that I can modify it without affecting the original instance. Some expected methods that don't work as intended: h0 = { "John"=>"Adams","Thomas"=>"Jefferson","Johny"=>"Appleseed"} h1=Hash.new(h0) h2=h1.to_hash In the meantime, I've resorted to this inelegant workaround def copyhash(inputhash) h = Hash.new inputhash.each do |pair| h.store(pair[0], pair[1]) end return h end
