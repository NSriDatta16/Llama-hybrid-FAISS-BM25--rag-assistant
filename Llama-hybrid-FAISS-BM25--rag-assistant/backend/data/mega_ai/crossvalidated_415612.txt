How do I sample N items from a list ensuring the samples are as similar as possible to each other?

Is there anyway to sample 6 numbers without replacement this list of 12 numbers (490, 700, 850, 1220, 505, 650, 930, 810, 800, 960, 1130, 1480) ensuring that the average is as close as possible to the remaining 6 numbers? In this case is the average the best method of making sure that the two samples are as similar as possible? (Maybe something like a Density curve)?
