I've implemented my own memory manager which uses buddy memory allocation and block sizes of powers of two. I'm satisfied it is correct and has doesnt leak, coalesses free blocks and can do a 'stop the world' defragmentation. That's a great first step. Once you have a working custom memory allocator you can of course do better! The problem is, as expected there is quite a bit of internal(power of 2 blocks) and external fragmentation. I'm not an expert in this field and although I find it facinating (I'm still a student), I wonder if there is any other implementations that have done the same or similar thing? Surely I cant be the only one? The power of two is a generic approach. However, note that this may not be the best simply because your allocation pattern may not follow the same geometric progression. In such a case it is best to test as much as you can and see what block sizes are getting allocated the most and optimize accordingly. I would also like to suggest this a wonderful article by Andrei Alexandrescu and Emery Berger on the topic of memory allocation: Policy-Based Memory Allocation and the latter's work in particular: The Hoard Memory Allocator . If possible go through the references mentioned at the end of that article. They may just as well provide additional insights.
