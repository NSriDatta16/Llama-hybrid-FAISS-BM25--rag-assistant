conjugate prior for my model parameter

This question is related to the another thread that I posted: Help with Variational Bayes on a weighted linear regression model To reiterate, I have the model as follows: $$ y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(T(x_i; \beta), \frac{\sigma^2}{w_i} {\textbf{I}}) \\ \beta \sim \mathcal{N} (\beta_{0}, \Sigma_{0}) \\ w_i \sim \mathcal{G} (a, b) \\ $$ The full joint model can be written as: $$ p(\beta, w, y |x) = \prod_{i=1}^{N} \bigg[p(y_i|x_i, w_i, H) \ p(w_i)\bigg] \ p(\beta) $$ I suspect that using the Gamma distribution as a prior distribution for the weights $w_i$ is not opportunistic in the conjugate setting as I am unable to find the variational updates which allow the posterior distribution over $w_i$ being written in an analytical form as I am trying in that post. So, my question is what distribution should I use for the prior on $w_i$ so that the posterior distribution after applying mean field and variational bayes inference comes out in some analytical form. [EDIT]: The post @Xi'an pointed out deals with the so called g-prior but that example again does not try and estimate the weights of the regression problem in a Bayesian setting as far as I can tell.
