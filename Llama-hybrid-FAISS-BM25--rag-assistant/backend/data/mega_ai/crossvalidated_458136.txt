First, RMSE is not equal to relative error so RMSE of 0.09 does not mean you made 9% error on average. (which is the mean relative error) Then, as you mentioned, RMSE is scale-dependent. When dealing with multi-output regression, RMSE is computed for each output and then averaged. It is clear that you have to normalize outputs if you want global RMSE to be equally representative of each target's RMSE. You could also use relative RMSE : \begin{equation} RMSE\% = \frac{RMSE}{\bar{y}} \end{equation} Wich represents RMSE relative to mean target value and enables you to compare and average errors on different targets. However, I don't recommend averaging RMSE of the outputs unless it is done for models comparison purposes and averaging weights have been properly adjusted.
