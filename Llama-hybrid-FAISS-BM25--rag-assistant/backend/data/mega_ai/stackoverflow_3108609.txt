I looked at some old JMeter results from when I wrote and ran a suite of performance tests against a web service. I'll attach some of them below, it's not apples-to-apples of course but at least another data point. Times are in milliseconds. Location Req and Map Req had inherent delays of 15000 and 3000 milliseconds, respectively. Invite included a quick call to a mobile carrier's ldap server. Others were pretty standard, mainly database read/writes. sampler_label count average min max Data Blurp 2750 185 30 2528 UserAuth 2750 255 41 2025 Get User Acc 820 148 29 2627 Update User Acc 4 243 41 2312 List Invitations 9630 345 47 3966 Invite 2750 591 102 4095 ListBuddies 5500 344 52 3901 Block Buddy 403 419 79 1835 Accept invite 2065 517 94 3043 Remove Buddy 296 411 83 1942 Location Req 2749 16963 15369 20517 Map Req 2747 3397 3116 5926 This software ran on a dedicated, decent virtual machine, tuned the same way production VMs were. The max results were slow, my goal was to find the number of concurrent users we could support so I was pushing it. I think your numbers are absolutely ok. With regards to all the other stuff that makes websites seem slow, if you haven't, take a look at YSlow . It integrates nicely with Firebug and provides great information about how to make pages load faster.
