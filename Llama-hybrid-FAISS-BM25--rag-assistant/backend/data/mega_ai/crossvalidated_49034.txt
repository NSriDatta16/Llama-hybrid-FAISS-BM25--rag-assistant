Multiple imputation refers to a set of stochastic imputation routines aimed at preserving the multivariate features of the data. While single imputation can produce consistent estimates of the parameters of interest, standard errors are difficult to pin down correctly. Rubin (1978) suggested to take several independent realizations of imputation mechanism, and provided the ways to combine the estimates to obtain the point estimates and standard errors valid under "proper imputation" assumptions.
