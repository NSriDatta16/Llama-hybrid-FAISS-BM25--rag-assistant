Outliers and Methods I will echo Christian's sentiments here (I've discussed this here and here ). You need to determine if this is an erroneous value or simply a value that is higher/lower than the rest of the distribution. My previous answers discuss that in more detail, so I won't repeat that again, but will summarize that simple removal of a "real" value isn't usually a great option. Chapter 10 of Cohen et al., 2003 provides a very in-depth discussion on outlier detection and treatment, where some suggestions (such as Christian's) are listed as possible solutions (starting around Page 415). I wanted to add that another alternative in addition to Christian's suggestion is running a quantile regression using the conditional median rather than the conditional mean. The median is less affected by outliers and may paint a more accurate picture of the relationship if the regression seems to not be capturing what you determine to be the real data generating process. For some useful articles on the subject of quantile regression, see the references below. References Cohen, J., Cohen, P., West, S. G., & Aiken, L. S. (2003).
