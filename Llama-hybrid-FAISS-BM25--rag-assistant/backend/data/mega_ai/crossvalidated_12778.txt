ROC, sensitivity, specificity, and cutoffs have gotten in the way, unfortunately. Assuming there is nothing between "good" and "bad" and that the success of the experiment was not based on an underlying continuum that should have instead formed the dependent variable, a probability model such as logistic regression would seem to be called for. You may need to do resampling to get an unbiased appraisal of the model's likely future performance. Note that even though a receiver operating characteristic curve is seldom appropriate, its area (also called c-index or concordance probability from the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test) is a good summary measure of pure predictive discrimination. On the other hand, percent classified correctly is an improper scoring rule that, if optimized, will result in a bogus model. Predicted probabilities are your friend, and they are also self-contained error rates at the point where someone forces you to make a binary decision, if they do.
