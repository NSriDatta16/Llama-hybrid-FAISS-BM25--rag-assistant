.NET Module for Email to Database

I'm looking for a robust module that will monitor an email account (ideally POP) and load each new email into a database (or cloud-based storage solution) as it arrives. This can either be an open source module, a commercial module or even SaaS. Ideally, would be easy to use from .NET. Simply put, trying to avoid re-inventing the wheel. Do you know of any such modules or services? Did you have a positive experience with them?
