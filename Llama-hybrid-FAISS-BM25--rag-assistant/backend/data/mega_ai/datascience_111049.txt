How can deep learning be applied to association rule mining?

Association rule mining is considered to be an old technique of AI. Rules are mined on statistical support. How can deep learning be applied to this? What are approaches for structured data (in a graph format like XML)? XML documents are structured by tags. My goal is to extract a rule that says that tag x is often combined with tag y and z. Then, I later want to apply these rules and if a tag y and z is found, the tag x is inserted or recommended to be inserted.
