Windows Live oAuth wrap for contacts?

I would like to know if the oAuth wrap authentication facility by windows live is just for messenger connect or what? Can it be used for Live Contacts API? I am trying to fetch addressbook from live contacts. How can i do that? Microsoft's msdn documentation on various APIs sucks to the core!! They doesnt even have any specific working PHP example for this. Can somebody redirect me to the well organized documentation/tutorial on this?
