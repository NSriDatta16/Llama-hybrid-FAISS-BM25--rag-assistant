I wrote a light webserver in Python a few years back, also as a learning project. The simplest piece of advice I can give, especially as a learning project, is build a core that works, then iterative design on top of that. Don't aim for the moon right off the hop, start very small, then add featuers, refine and continue. I would recommend using a tool that encourages expermentation, like Python, where you can literally type and test code at the same time.
