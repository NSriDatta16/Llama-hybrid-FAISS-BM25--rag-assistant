I would say the simplest answer is that a time-series is any dataset where event time is a feature . It doesn't need to be correlated with anything in any way, but you also can't assume it's not . Event time here is defined as a unique numeric index $T$ corresponding to a partial ordering of the set of events such that for any pair of events $A$ and $B$ , if $T_A = T_B$ then $A$ and $B$ were concurrent up to the 'resolution' of the index. This means only reporting a Unix timestamp up to the hour value is fine, but reporting the year and the UTC hour on a wall clock as an integer alone is not - 1 PM can refer to the same hour in any number of days. Event time as an index has a bunch of properties that makes it distinct from any random numerical feature, even an orderable one. Even with no causality in the common sense of the word the values of $Y_2$ become more and more correlated with the values of $Y_1$ as $T_2 - T_1$ goes to zero. With causality on top, the data-generating process is effectively a Markov chain of some (arbitrarily high or low) dimensionality.
