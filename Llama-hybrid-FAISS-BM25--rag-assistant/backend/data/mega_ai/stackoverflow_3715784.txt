Zend Framework and clients User Agent

I've created an application with the Zend Framework. Now I was asked to make an iphone webapp for it. So my solution is to get the useragent and render a different view for it. My searches on google lead to Zend_UserAgent but my library says it doesn't contain it. ;) Is there any Zend way to find the useragent to render a different view or should I do it another way? Thanks in advance!
