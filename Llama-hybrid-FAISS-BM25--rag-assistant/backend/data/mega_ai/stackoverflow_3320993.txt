I agree that Solution Explorer will "by design" omit all those objects, but only if you do not include them as Solution items, which I believe you should include in your solutions, so that a newbie can open the solution, do a Get Latest, and know they have all the dependencies needed for that solution, and not have to learn how to do it via a command line tool, or use Source Control Explorer if they don't want to. Including all the non-code dependencies as solution items (we organize the solution folders using the same folder structure as their source control folders) reduces "voodoo" knowledge required to open and compile the solution for new developers on a project. It would be good if you could link entire folder trees to a solution folder in the VS solution.
