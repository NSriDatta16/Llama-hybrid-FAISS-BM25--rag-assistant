Do not confuse the storage format (JPEG) with the format you operate on using the Graphics object. The storage format is compressed, the Graphics object works with decompressed data. The LoadImageFromURL method decompresses the information stored in the JPEG, you perform your resize operation on the decompressed data, and when you save it to a JPEG file, it gets compressed again. Since JPEG compression is not lossless, the picture quality will be reduced every time you perform this process: Decompress, mutate, recompress . If I missunderstood your question: The compression factor you use for saving the image inot set in your code, so it will be at some default value. If you want to reduce quality loss by saving with a small compression factor, you need to explicitly set it.
