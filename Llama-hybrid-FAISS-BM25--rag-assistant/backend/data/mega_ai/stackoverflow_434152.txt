If none of the inputs are live, then you won't get anything out of the output. It's been a long time since I spent some time on this, but back in the day, we'd add noise to the equation. This can be in the form of inputs that are always on or by adding a small random amount to each input before shoving it at the neural network. Interestingly, the use of noise in neural networks has been shown to have a biological analog. If you're trying to hear something, and you add in a bit of white noise, it makes it easier to hear. same goes for seeing. As for your initial question - How to find out the value of o1 depends on ... The formula used throughout the neural network. The values of n1 to n4. The inputs. http://www.cheshireeng.com/Neuralyst/nnbg.htm Has some basic info on the maths.
