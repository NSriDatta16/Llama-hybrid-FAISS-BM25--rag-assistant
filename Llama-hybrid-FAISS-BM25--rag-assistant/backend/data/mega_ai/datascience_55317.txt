When I should use PCA?

I have a data set with 60000 rows and 32 columns. I want to use SVM (with some more constraints that make it more complicated)and I think 32 columns are too large. So I decided to use PCA. But when I load PCA, the first 20 component describe 85% of data which 20 variables still is too large I think, but it is better than 32. I am wondering is that ok if I use PCA? when n>>m? if not what is a better option?
