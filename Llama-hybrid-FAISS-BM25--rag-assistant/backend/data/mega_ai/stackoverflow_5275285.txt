You are using the wrong endpoints. Dynamics CRM 2011 introduces a complete new WCF based web service. It's endpoint is http://ServerName/OrganizationName/XRMServices/2011/Organization.svc See the endpoint overview So you should either add a Service Reference (See Use the WSDL Endpoint ) or use early/late bound access (See Write Code for Microsoft Dynamics CRM (Web Services) The endpoints you mention in your post are for legacy purposes. See the article Use the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0 (2007) Endpoint
