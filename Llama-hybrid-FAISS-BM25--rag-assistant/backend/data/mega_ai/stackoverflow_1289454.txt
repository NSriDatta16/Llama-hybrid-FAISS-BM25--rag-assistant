Same as you - I fought this for the longest time. Then I started considering why I created folders. I found myself starting to create folders to represent namespaces and packages instead of arbitrary buckets. For instance, in an MVVM project, it might be helpful to put views and view models in a separate namespace. MVC will have a separate namespace for Models, Controllers, and Views. It is also beneficial to group classes by their feature. Suddenly, the project feels more organized. It is easier for other developers to find where features are implemented. If you standardize on your namespace practices, all of your projects will have the same predictable structure which will be a big win for maintenance.
