iPhone - How may I know if scrollToRowAtIndexPath will scroll something

I have some things to do at scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation time with a DoThis function. But sometimes, scrollToRowAtIndexPath with animate=YES does not scroll anything. So how can I know if the scrolling will be done to be able to force an alternative function DoThisWithNoScrollOccured call after the scrollToRowAtIndexPath call ?
