OP: This makes me wonder whether there is any good reason not to always use bootstrapping. Given the difficulty of assessing whether a distribution is normal... Traditional parametric methods rely on the CLT. The data don't have to be Normal, but the sampling distribution should be (asymptotically) Normal. Alas, bootstrap methods typically also have similar assumptions. The data don't have to be Normal, but the sampling distribution of $\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta-\theta)$ has to be well-defined and well-behaved in order for us to guarantee that the bootstrap works (asymptotically). See Larry Wasserman's notes : The bootstrap does not always work. It can fail for a variety of reasons such as when the dimension is high or when [the estimator] is poorly behaved. So we can't guarantee that the bootstrap will save us from needing a CLT. On the other hand, if a CLT is appropriate, some bootstrap methods can be "second-order accurate." In other words, if your sampling distribution of interest has an asymptotic approximation and you'd rely on the CLT anyway , some kinds of bootstrapping might get you there slightly "faster" (better approximation at lower $n$ ) and/or with CI coverage closer to nominal. See Section 3 of Davidson, Hinkley, Young (2003), "Recent Developments in Bootstrap Methodology" . OP: A similar question that bugs me is why not always use the median as the measure of central tendency. The median is one of those estimators that aren't always well-behaved -- whether you're using bootstrap or other methods. I once was working with a fairly large survey dataset, where one of the questions was about income. We tried to do exactly what you suggest: focus on the median rather than the mean, and use a bootstrap approach to get the CI (though I don't think it was BCa). It turned out that many respondents had rounded their income to exactly \$50,000. So many, in fact, that in EVERY bootstrap sample the median was also \$50,000! Our bootstrap SE was 0 and our bootstrap CI was (\$50k, \$50k). We ended up using one of the much older nonparametric CIs for a median, based simply on order statistics of the sample, which (thankfully) gave a reasonable result.
