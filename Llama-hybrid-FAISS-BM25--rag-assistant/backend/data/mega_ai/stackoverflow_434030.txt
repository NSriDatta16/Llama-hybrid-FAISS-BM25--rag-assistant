You're using the naive "textbook" way of storing trees, i.e. store a reference to the immediate parent. This design is called Adjacency List . There are other solutions: Path Enumeration , where you store in each node of the tree a string encoding all its direct ancestors. Nested Sets , a clever approach by Joe Celko where you use two numeric values per node to bound all its descendants. Closure Table (or Adjacency Relation), where you use a separate table to list every ancestor-descendant pair. See my response to " What is the most efficient/elegant way to parse a flat table into a tree? " for references and examples of the Closure Table design.
