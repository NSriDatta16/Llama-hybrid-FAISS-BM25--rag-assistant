Well, I don't have a solution to the match/case problem. You do need an extractor which whitens the input xml due to how Scala pattern matching works -- you cannot apply trim to an xml literal which is a pattern, as that exists just at compile time, patterns being translated into a series of function calls at runtime. However, to get the value of the c tag, you could always use the XPath like syntax of taking xml apart. For example, to get the value of c in your XML you could use: // a collection of all the values of all the c subelements (deep search) val c1 = (xml \\ "c").map(_.text.toInt) // same as above, but shallow val c2 = (xml \ "c").map(_.text.toInt) Also see the XML chapter from Programming in Scala (part of which is on Google books ) Hope it helps, -- Flaviu Cipcigan
