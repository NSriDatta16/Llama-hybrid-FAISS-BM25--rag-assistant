Video/Audio online material for getting into Bayesian analysis and logistic-regressions

Well, I'm an engineer by day. Although most of my work revolves around modeling, we generally do pretty basic stuff. An "Advanced" model would be a monte carlo simulation validated using R2 tests. Currently, in my field, there is a lot of research using Logistic and bayesian analysis. My question is, which courses would you recommend someone to take from MIT's open course site or any other sites, for someone who learns best by video/audio first, and reading second? What i'd like to learn are the following: Be able to understand the models and when to employ them able to take in field data (which is generated once and cannot be regenerated) and design and perform experiments Able to understand the results, look at them, and figure out if something is off, "show stopper" or "outliers", or if everything is fine and dandy Be able to validate and calibrate the model, to actual "As-built" results Be able to forecast the results using appropriate sensitivity analysis be able to forecast / "plug" missing data be able to write journal papers related to my field my field in a nutshell is: transportation demand modeling for passenger vehicles, using either the generic four step model, or socio economic activity/tour based models such as PECAS or urbansim
