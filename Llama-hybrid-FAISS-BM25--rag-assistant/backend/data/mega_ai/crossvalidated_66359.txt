What can I say about my logistic regression output?

I'm analyzing customer satisfaction for a certain program. My response variable is ordinal- where 0 means dissatisfied and 1 means satisfied. I have 10 predictor variables. I used Binary logistic Regression on my data, and the results showed that 6 of my 10 variables are statistically significant. My question is, what can I safely say about my output? Can I say that there is significant evidence to suggest the variables have an affect on the response?
