I believe there's no point in Unit test generation, as far as TDD goes. You only make unit tests so that you're sure that you (as a developer) are on track w/ regards to design and specs. Once you start generating tests automatically, it loses that purpose. Sure it would probably mean 100% code coverage, but that coverage would be senseless and empty. Automated unit tests also mean that your strategy is test-after, which is opposite of TDD's test-before tenet. Again, TDD is not about tests. That being said I believe MSTest does have an automatic unit-test generation tool -- I was able to use one with VS2005.
