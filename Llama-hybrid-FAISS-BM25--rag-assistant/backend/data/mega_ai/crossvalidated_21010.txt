Here's a basic applied example from Biostatistics Let's assume that I am studying possible relationships between the presence of ovarian cancer and a set of genes. My dependent variable is a binary (coded as a zero or a 1) My independent variables codes data from a proteomic database. As is common in many genetics studies, my data is much wider than it is tall. I have 216 different observations but 4000 or so possible predictors. Linear regression is right out (the system is horrible over determined). feature selection techniques really aren't feasible. With 4,000+ different independent variables all possible subset techniques are completely out of the question and even sequential feature selection is dubious. The best option is probably to use logistic regression with an elastic net. I want to do feature selection (identify which independent variables are important) so ridge regression really isn't appropriate. It's entirely possible that there are more than 216 independent variables that have significant influence, so I probably shouldn't use a lasso (Lasso can't identify more predictors than you have observations)... Enter the elastic net...
