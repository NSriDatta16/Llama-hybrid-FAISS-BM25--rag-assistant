Should I dynamically recreate a PDF, rather than store it in either the database or the filesystem?

I need customers to be able to download PDFs of letters that have been sent to them. I have read the threads about database versus filesystem storage of documents or images, and it does sound like the consensus is that, for anything more than just a few images, filesystem is the way to go. What I want to know: would a reasonable alternative be to just store the letter details in the database, and recreate the PDF 'on the fly' when it is requested? Is that approach superior or inferior to fetching the PDF from the filesystem?
