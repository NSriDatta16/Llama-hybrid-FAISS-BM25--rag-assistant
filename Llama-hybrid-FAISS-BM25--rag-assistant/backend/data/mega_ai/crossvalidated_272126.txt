It was brought to my attention that Lange et al 1989 derived the expected Fisher's Information for the multivariate t-distribution in Appendix B. Therefore, I got the answer I wanted, you can regard this question as answered! In particular, using the result of Lange et al, I derived the following Fisher's Information Matrix for the univariate t-distribution (with fixed degrees of freedom parameter $v$): \begin{align*} \boldsymbol{I}=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{v+1}{(v+3)\sigma^2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{v}{2(v+3)\sigma^4} \end{bmatrix} \end{align*}
