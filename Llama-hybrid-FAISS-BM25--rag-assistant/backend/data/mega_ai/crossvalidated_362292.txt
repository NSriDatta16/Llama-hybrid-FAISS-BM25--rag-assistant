Frankly, I don't think there is any justifiable way to compute the standard errors. The bootstrap appears to be a commonly used method, but Abadie and Imbens (2008 Econometrica) paper demonstrated the problems the bootstrap runs into. For a method as complicated as PS matching, I am not entirely sure 100 is a sufficiently large sample size to give you the asymptotically normal distribution. – StasK If balance is good, and covariate matching is used as well as propensity score matching, the sample is plenty large enough for non-parametric estimators such as the Wilcoxon's sign-rank test. With the non-parametric estimator, the confidence interval coverage will be correct. An additional advantage of this approach is that sensitivity to the random assignment assumption can be tested with Rosenbaum bounds. See Paul Rosenbaum's Observational Studies or Design of Observational Studies, the latter being an easier introduction. – Jason Morgan
