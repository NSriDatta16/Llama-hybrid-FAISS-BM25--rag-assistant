Here is my view of things: Sockets: Upside is that this can perform really good. Downside is that it is somewhat fragile and complicated to implement both on the client and on the server. I would avoid this unless there is no other way (e.g. you need very high performance). WCF / WCF Duplex: WCF is very easy to implement if you just take ten minutes to think about what you want to send back and forth. Performance is good and deployment is easy. This would be my first choice for an online game. WCF Duplex is somewhat more complex. There are some good tutorials as to how to get this to work, but I find there are some pitfalls that may not make this worth the effort. If you don't need high polling intervals I would stick with normal WCF. As far as I know WCF Duplex does polling as well so it's not really duplex. .NET RIA Service: I'm not sure about this one, but I figure the overhead is not what you need when having large volumes of traffic. Also from forum questions I learn that this one is not so easy to customize, whereas WCF is more flexible. Conclusion: Unless there is some compelling reason not to, I would stick to WCF.
