Because your tests are not independent, you need to apply Bonferroni correction (if you didn't already). Not having "significant" effects with such a small sample sounds right to me. You just get many false positives in such cases. Don't interpret a too large p value as a "bad executed experiment". These values are a safeguard for you to indicate observations that may well be random. Recent observations in medicine (e.g., why most published research findings are false ) indicate that even a "significant" p-value must only serve as encouragement to rerun the experiment on a larger scale, unfortunately. Don't hack your p-values to become "significant"! So in the end, maybe the correct conclusion is that you observed higher brain activity, but you cannot rule out it was by chance because of the few patients. There is probably a 10% chance to observe such an effect by chance, and you don't just get this down to 5%.
