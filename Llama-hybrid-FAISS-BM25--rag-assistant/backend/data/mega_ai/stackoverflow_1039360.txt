If you are using Matisse, you can do this one of two ways. Expand your jpanel jar file, navigate to the class, and drag-and-drop it onto your JFrame in the Matisse editor. On the palette, click on "Add Bean" and type in the fully-qualified name of the JPanel. Then click on the JFrame to place it. You need to have the jpanel's jar file added to the project.
