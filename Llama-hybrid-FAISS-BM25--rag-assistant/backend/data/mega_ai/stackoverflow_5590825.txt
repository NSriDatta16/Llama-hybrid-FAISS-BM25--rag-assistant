Ncover integration with CC.Net

I'm using NCover 3.0 .Want to integrate the results into CC.Net .Everything works fine, but the report shown in CC.Net after is not that detailed. I would like to be able to display the uncovered classes, methods and probably the source too. This is what I have done on the NAnt build script I suspect the report format is limited to Symbol module. How can I get a full coverage report as we get in HTML .
