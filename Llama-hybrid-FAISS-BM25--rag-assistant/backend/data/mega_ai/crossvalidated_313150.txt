a) Correct. Variable importance is not exactly an statistical concept. b) Moreover, you gotta be careful about the techniques used in medical journals as they worry more about the epidemiological question than the (validity of) statistical methods. What you need to do here is to conduct a formal variable selection and, if you are Bayesian, calculate the posterior probability of each model to see how much each variable affects this probability. There is no unique way to assess the importance of a variable, though, since "importance" is not uniquely defined.
