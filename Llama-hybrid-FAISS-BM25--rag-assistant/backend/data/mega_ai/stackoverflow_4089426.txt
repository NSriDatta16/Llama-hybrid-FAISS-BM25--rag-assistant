Having problem with very basic SilverLight LineSeries graph

I been stack for the last few days trying to figure out the SilverLight 4 LineSeries graph, for some strange reason the graph being displayed but the line not being displayed. I am pretty sure that my mistake is something very basic but I been straggling to pinpoint the problem by myself. Bellow is the code that I having problem with. 1,10 2,20 3,30 4,40 I would also apreciate if anyone can point me to some code example with scrollable graph on Silverlight. Thank you in advance.
