In the coupon collector's problem with group drawings, why does the probability decrease with increasing samples?

My son is collecting Panini stickers from one of their football albums, where there are 472 stickers in total, and you can buy them in packs of 5 (no duplicates within those 5). You can also buy any 50 as a one-off from Panini, which you obviously want to do right at the end, for the final 50. I believe this is the coupon collector's problem with multiple coupons being drawn at once. A paper analyses this problem and proves a probability distribution for it. The paper is: " The collectorâ€™s problem with group drawings ", Wolfgang Stadje, Advances in Applied Probability, Vol 22, No 4, Dec 1990. (Not open access, unfortunately.) From the paper, $S$ is the set of all stickers, $A$ is the set of interest (where $A\subset S$), $l = |A|$, $s = |S|$, and we draw, with replacement, subsets $\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots$ from $S$, each containing $m$ different stickers. Each $\omega \subset S$ has an equal probability of being chosen. Then $X_k(A)$ is the number of distinct elements of $A$ contained in the sets $\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_k$ and we have the following probability distribution: $$ P(X_k(A) = n) = {l \choose n}\sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j {n \choose j} \left[{s + n - l - j \choose m} \bigg/ {s \choose m}\right]^k \quad\quad n = 0, 1, \ldots, l $$ In my case, $s=472$, $l=n=422$ and $m=5$. I'm looking at how the distribution changes as more packs of stickers are bought. However, the probability doesn't monotonically increase as $k$ does. It's clearer to see (and work out) with smaller values, so for $s=l=3$, $n=2$, $m=1$ the probabilities are 0, 2/3, 2/3, 14/27, 10/27 for $k=1,\ldots,5$. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing or interpreting wrongly here, or why the probability is decreasing with more packs, when intuitively it should tend towards 1. For reference, there's another post I found that also deals with this equation, but in that they are considering $s=l=n$ which is not the case here.
