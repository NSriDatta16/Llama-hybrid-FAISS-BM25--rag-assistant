Language Switching in Magento

Thanks in advance, I am new to Magento and I need help switching languages for users. When a customer visits my website it should use their IP to determine their country and switch the language appropriately. For example, if I am visiting from France my site should display in French. If any others try from any country the website should be in that country's local language.. -Jeet
