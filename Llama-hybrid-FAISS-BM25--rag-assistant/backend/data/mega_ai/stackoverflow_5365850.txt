Dynamic Table Bucketing

I've scoured the net, but I can't find a solution that quite solves my current problem. I want the user to be able to group table rows based on the values of columns. They should be collapsible, too. Example data: Size Number Place Name ---- ------ ----- ---- S 10 NY First S 15 NY Another S 20 DE Second M 10 NY Third L 4 DE Fourth The user should then be able to see a list of the columns (Size, Number, Place) and drag them onto the vertical axis. This will then automatically group the rows by similar column values. The user should also be able to specify a hierarchy, such as Place -> Size -> Name. Here would be an example of that: Number --------------------------- (-) NY 35 [sum] (-) S 25 First 10 Another 15 (-) M 10 Third 10 (-) DE 24 (-) S 20 Second 20 (-) L 4 Fourth 4 Collapsing, say, NY would obviously show: Number --------------------------- (+) NY 35 (-) DE 24 (-) S 20 Second 20 (-) L 4 Fourth 4 The trick here is that the user should be able to simply rearrange the order, and it will rebucket it. So if they then wanted to see Size -> Place -> Name...: Number --------------------------- (-) S 35 (-) NY 25 First 10 Another 15 (-) DE 20 Second 20 (-) M 10 (-) NY 10 Third 10 (-) L 4 (-) DE 4 Fourth 4 Hopefully that makes sense. Does anyone have an idea of a good way to do this? I don't care about the architecture of the database - assume I can get it into whatever form is necessary (i.e. calling it with PHP from MySQL, grabbing it out of a CSV with Perl, anything). The front-end is what I'm concerned about mostly.
