Understanding difference between Maximum Likelihood and Levenberg Marquardt result

In some of my regression results I noticed a deviation between Maximum Likelihood (via Monte Carlo Markov Chain, initialised by parameter result of Nelder-Mead, median value pictured) result and Levenberg Marquardt result. Since the deviation is outside the Ïƒ region, I would like to understand the reason why. The subsequent question would be, how to decide which approach is best suited for approximating the "real" parameter value. For now, I used the Maximum Likelihood approach mainly for detecting correlations and exploring parameter space. The official website suggests that the Maximum Likelihood method could lead to better parameter values than Levenberg Marquardt. Could you provide a method to evaluate this? LM Estimate i_0_an 9.88E-08; 5.80E-08; 3.39E-08; 1.85E-08; 7.96E-09 ML Estimate i_0_an (notice: this is not exactly the same value as pictured in the diagram, since this is the middle value and in the diagram the median value) 7.62E-08; 4.34E-08; 2.52E-08; 1.46E-08; 7.31E-09
