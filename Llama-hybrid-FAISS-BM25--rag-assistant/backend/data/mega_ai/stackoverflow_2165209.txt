There are 2 'easy' directions, at the OS or Process level. Add the /3GB switch to your boot.ini, and modify your app to use /LARGEADDRESSAWARE . You immediately gain an additional 1G of virtual address space, but not without a tradeoff . Good chance it's the right choice for you. Often the problem is not lack of memory, but rather its fragmentation - seems relevant to your context too (huge consecutive arrays). A while back I had put online some techniques that helped me combat fragmentation for native code - should be at least partially applicable to managed.
