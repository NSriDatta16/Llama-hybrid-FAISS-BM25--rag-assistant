Choosing a Model for Inference

I'm trying to understand what factors contribute to the a certain outcome which is a ordered factor variable. In order to just understand which factor is statistically more significant than the others, I would like to build a model and given that my output variable is an ordered factorial variable - I thought I should go for Ordinal Logistic Regression. Given the tradeoff between interpretability and flexibility of models, in my case since I'm only making inferences and not predictions, should I rather go for a easier model to handle like Generalized Linear Models? It kind of boils down to me choosing the polr package in R versus the glm one.
