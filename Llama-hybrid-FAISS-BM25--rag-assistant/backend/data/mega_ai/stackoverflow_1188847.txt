The selector you use for your timer does not have the correct signature. From the Apple docs : The selector must have the following signature: - (void)timerFireMethod:(NSTimer*)theTimer You should use your own method for the timer and call setNeedsDisplay from there. As Robert said, you should turn down the frequency a bit, but I don't think either of these issues will solve your problem.
