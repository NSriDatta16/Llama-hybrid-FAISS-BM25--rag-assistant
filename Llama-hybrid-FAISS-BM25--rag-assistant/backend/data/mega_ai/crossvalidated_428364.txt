Interpreting odds ratios in ordinal logistic regression

I am trying to predict exam performance (below, average, above) based on whether participants attended a revision class. I am analysing my data in R using a proportional odds logistic regression. I am using the polr function from the MASS package. Here is an example of my code: data $exam_performance exam_performance, c("Below", "Average", "Above")) data $attended attended, c("0", "1")) model This returns an odds ratio of 18.64. Given my factor orderings, does this tell me that 'the odds of achieving average or above average performance is 18.64 times more if the participant attended than if they did not'? Also, I notice that MASS does not provide p-values. I've googled this and it seems that LRT is the best way to obtain these. Would this be how I would do it? intercept_only This results in a Pr(Chi) value of 0. Should this be reported as p The table of the factors is: Attended 0 1 Exam performance Below 1482 300 Expected 1094 2822 Above 57 1422
