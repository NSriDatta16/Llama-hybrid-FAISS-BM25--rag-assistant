Yes, this is possible. Use the Sql Express sample sync provider ( http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/sync/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=1200 ). It is not supported by Microsoft and it uses Sync Framework 2.0 techniques instead of the newer 2.1 techniques for collaborative sync. Enable change tracking on the server, create the anchor and guid table on the client. Create sync adapters per table in the sync agent and you're off. You have to keep in mind that the sql express client provider uses the server provider under the covers, so you need to reverse it's thinking in some places (download becomes upload).
