It depends on which storage engine you are using. MyISAM tables do not support clustered indices, so primary keys on MyISAM tables are not clustered. The primary key on an InnoDB table, however, is clustered. You should consult the MySQL Manual for further details about the pros and cons of each storage engine. You need to have a primary key; if you don't create one yourself, MySQL will create a hidden one for you. You could always just create an AUTO_INCREMENT field for the primary key (this is preferable to having MySQL have hidden fields in your table, I think).
