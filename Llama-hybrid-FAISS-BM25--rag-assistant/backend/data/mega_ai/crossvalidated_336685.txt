De Finetti's representation theorem is generally taken to be a justification for the assumption of IID observations conditional on underlying parameters. The latter is a model specification that jumps straight to assumptions about unobservables, whereas the former is a purely operational assumption applying to observables. It is therefore common to assume infinite exchangeability as a means to get to the IID model. Within Bayesian regression this is the standard way you would frame your analysis. You would begin by assuming that the sequence of observables is exchangeable, which gives you the IID form, and then you would go further and assume that the long-run behaviour of the observables conforms to some specified regression model (which assumptions you would then test later).
