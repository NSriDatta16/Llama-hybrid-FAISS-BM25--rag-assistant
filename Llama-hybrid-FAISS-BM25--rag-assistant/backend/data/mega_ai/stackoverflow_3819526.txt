As of MySQL v5.0.3, MySQLs DECIMAL datatype stores an exact decimal number, i.e. not an inaccurate floating point representation. To correctly manipulate precision numbers in PHP use the arbitrary precision math functions . Internally this library manipulates text strings. Currency is intended to be stored as a decimal number, you can get units of money smaller than cents. You should only round any values when displaying the figures, not during manipulation or storage.
