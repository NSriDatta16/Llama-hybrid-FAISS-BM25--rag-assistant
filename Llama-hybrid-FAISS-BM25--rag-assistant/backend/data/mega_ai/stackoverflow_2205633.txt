As far as I know Unity tries (by default) to call the constructor with largest number of parameters and tries to resolve each of the parameters from the mappings. You shold add the mapping for IPreferenceStorageProvider or remove the constructor that requires this parameter. If you don't want the IPreferenceStorageProvider parameter to by injected by unity maybe it shouldn't be declared as a constructor parameter at all. You can hard code instantiation of this object in default constructor.
