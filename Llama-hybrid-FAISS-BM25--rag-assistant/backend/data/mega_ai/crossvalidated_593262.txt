Build causal network from stepwise regression analysis , do I need stationarity?

I am new to time series analysis and struggle a little bit with "causality". Assume I have the time series Y,X1,X2 and Z. I want to test if X1 and X2 impact Y and if X1 and X2 are impacted by Z. I know that there could be no direct causal link between Z and Y . I try to accomplish this by stepwise regressions. First, I test if X1 and X2 affect Y and I allow lags (up to p=3) in the model, and trim the model based on GAIC (here using a k of 3, but could be 2 or log(N)) leading to: Y~Ylag1+X2+X1lag1 There is no autocorrelation left in the residuals. Now I build models for X2 and X1lag, allowing only variables with equal or higher lag and including Z. For X2 I do not find anything, while X1lag1 is : X1lag1 ~ X1lag2+X1lag3+Zlag2 There is no autocorrelation left in the residuals. So, there seems to be a relationship of X1 and Z, however I have the following questions: the p value of Zlag2 is 0.03, do I need to adjust for multiple testing for all p values in the three models leading to my 'causal' network'? then my p value for Zlag2 is > 0.05 Z is the only variable that not passes the ADF test, thus is not stationary. Is this a problem in such an approach? Is doing stepwise regression at all suitable to identify such "causal" networks? I know that some links are not allowed but contemporaneous links could exist, so I would prefer this over e.g., a VAR. the code can be found below, if data is needed I can share it confidentially over PM. Thanks a lot. #calculate lags library(dplyr) dat %mutate(Ylag1=lag(Y),Ylag2=lag(Y,2),Ylag3=lag(Y,3), X1lag1=lag(X1),X1lag2=lag(X1,2),X1lag3=lag(X1,3), X2lag1=lag(X2),X2lag2=lag(X2,2),X2lag3=lag(X2,3), Zlag1=lag(Z),Zlag2=lag(Z,2),Zlag3=lag(Z,3)) library(gamlss) dat = predictor) ## X2 bnullX2 $model model $model padjust $`Pr(>|t|)`,method="BH") tableC$ signi $Y) adf.test(dat$ X1) adf.test(dat $X2) adf.test(dat$ Z) ```
