Interlinking GUI in some other language and Python

I have done coding for mathematical simulation of Theory of Computation concepts in Python such as grammar checking and other stuff. My Problem is that I have to build a decent looking GUI for it . I have looked at PyQt4 and the lack of documentation is really a big deterrent. I have looked at other graphical libraries in Python and they are not helping me so is there a way that I can write the GUI stuff in some other language and integrate python in it. The problem is that I want mathematical stuff like circles, epsilon on runtime which have drag and drop events available on them. So simply creating an image is not an option. I am sorry for being a little non specific here but the problem is that I am looking for things that can help here. I have asked a question before too for GUI and unfortunately I could'nt find the right answers for it. Is there a way I can get around this problem. Thanks a lot....
