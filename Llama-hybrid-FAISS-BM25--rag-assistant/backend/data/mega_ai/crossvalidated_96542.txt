I would take a gander at the 7 Chernozhukov and Hansen IVQR papers. The 2005 paper is often cited. They also provide links to data and code in MATLAB, OX and Stata. Another frequently cited paper in this literature is Abadie, Angrist, and Imbens (2002) . Frolich and Melly (2010) and Kwak (2010) are also worth checking out, especially if you use Stata. Both provide code.
