Using boost::accumulators, how can I reset a rolling window size, does it keep extra history?

I am looking at the boost::accumulator framework, specifically a couple of the rolling_window calculations. #include #include #include accumulator_set > acc(tag::rolling_window::window_size = 3); As you see here, I have set the window_size to be three, such that it is maintaining the mean average of the last three samples only. Can I amend that size at run-time, perhaps based on a user setting? If so, and I increase the window_size does the accumulator have extra internal state if it had already seen more than my new window_size, or would I have to wait for the extra values?
