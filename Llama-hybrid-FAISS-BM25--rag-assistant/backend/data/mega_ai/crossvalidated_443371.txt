Clustering categorial data

I have a dataset with 100 nominal categorical variables with two levels each, for example: Do you smoke? Yes/No Do you like to dance? Yes/No etc. How can I cluster this dataset to group/create "profiles"? I know a few type of clustering algorithms, like PCA, K-neighbors etc. But I think that I can't use these types of algorithms with non-quantitative variables. Is that true? Thanks you.
