Django ImageField upload to nfs. (No locks available)

I want to upload with a Django ImageField to a nfs storage but I get this error: [Errno 37] No locks available This is in /etc/fstab/: 173.203.221.112:/home/user/project/media/uploads/ /home/user/project/media/uploads nfs rw,bg,hard,lock,intr,tcp,vers=3,wsize=8192,rsize=8192 0 0 I also tried to patch django to use flock() instead of lockf() but still not working. http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9400 Any idea whats wrong?
