What is statistical diversity and how is it measured? (dataset with properties of materials)

I'm curious how one would define and measure statistical diversity for a research project of mine. My motivation is to understand the statistical space of materials. Each material has a set of properties associated with it. Out of the set of all materials, I would like to develop a subset that accurately represents the whole. My understanding is that I will need to maximize diversity in order to develop an unbiased set. For example, this set might be used as a training set for machine learning, etc ... I would love it if anyone could recommend resources to progress further, and advice on whether I am even approaching this project from the proper direction.
