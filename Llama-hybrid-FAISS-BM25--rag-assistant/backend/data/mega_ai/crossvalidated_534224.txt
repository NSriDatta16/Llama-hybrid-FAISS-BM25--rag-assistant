I read this as "How do we update a productionized model based on more production data"? If so, if data retention and volume is not a problem, retraining from scratch with all the data combined is a serious option. The main quesiton then is whether older data eventually becomes irrelevant (as is often observed in production models, but could depend a lot on the specific field) and should be discarded (or at least downweighted). Another potential concern occurs, if the new data is influenced by model predictions of the old model. E.g. think of ranking internet search results based on what users click on, where whether users click on a link is not just determined by how relevant it is, but also by how high up you displayed it, which would be influenced by an model you are already using. That's an area of ongoing research, but may not be a concern in your particular problem. Of course, there is no reason, why you could not re-start training a decision/regression tree ensemble by adding more trees (and popular packages have that option), which could be a sensible option, if e.g. the original data is no longer available or similar issues. One then has to determine though how to weight the original versus the new data, which one cannot explicitly do when only training some more on new data. One can also build a second model that takes the first model as an input, but this feels somewhat inelegant. Perhaps if the new data has just way more volume (and at leas the same quality as the original data), it may be worth considering just using the new data to train a totally new model. It's more complicated when e.g. for the new data one is less sure of the correct labels (e.g. old data = small amount of high-quality labelled data, new data = hug volume of less reliably labelled data). Then, one could consider options like using label smoothing on the new data, but not (or to a lesser degree) on the older data (or in some other way reflecting that the labels of the older data might be more reliable than for the newer data).
