Perhaps your XML processor is ignoring the !ENTITY declarations because they are contained within an otherwise empty DTD. Do you have a DTD you could use to validate this document? Lacking a DTD or schema, you can't really say the document is valid. Try running it through an online XML validation service like the one at URL: http://www.validome.org/xml/validate/ Here's an amended version of your document with a DTD I whipped up. See if this helps. ]> &MyStorageLocation;
