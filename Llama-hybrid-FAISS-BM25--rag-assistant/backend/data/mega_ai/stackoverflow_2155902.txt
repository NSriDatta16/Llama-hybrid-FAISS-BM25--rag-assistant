Try adjusting your block declaration as follows: {{block type="forthcomingproducts/list" template="forthcomingproducts/list.phtml"}} In your config file you defined an alias for your blocks ( forthcomingproducts ) and now you should follow it. Magento will dereference forthcomingproducts to be MyCompany_ForthcomingProducts_Block as you requested, then append the capitalized class name ( list ), creating the classname MyCompany_ForthcomingProducts_Block_List . When you use a alis that Magento doesn't know about ( MyCompany_ForthcomingProducts in your example), it is assumed to be part of the Mage namespace. Hope that helps, Joe
