Calling PHP scripts from Javascript without leaving current page

I'm having some trouble calling PHP scripts from Javascript without leaving the current HTML page (if it is at all possible). I understand it is possible using AJAX, although is it possible using Javascript alone? Context:- I want my page to perform a short animation using Javascript (using onclick ), then immediately call a PHP script to insert data into a MySQL database - all without leaving the page so it does not inhibit the animation. The animation part I can do and the inserting the data into the database, etc. but how can I call a PHP script at the end of that Javascript animation function? Any pointers, code fragments, etc. would be greatly appreciated! ^_^ Apologies if this question has been asked previous.
