IF your 2 worksheets are in the same closed workbook, I think you could eventually use an SQL query against them using adodb. dim cnn As ADODB.Connection dim rst As ADODB.Recordset strProv = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=" & _ SourceFile & ";Extended Properties=Excel 8.0;" cnn.Open strProv Set rst = New ADODB.Recordset strSql = "select * from [Sheet1$]" rst.Open strSql, cnn rngDestRange.CopyFromRecordset rst I have been using that technique, but for one table at a time. So I am not 100% sure the join is supported, but you could give it a try.
