How would you do Bayesian ANOVA and regression in R?

I have a fairly simple dataset consisting of one independent variable, one dependent variable, and a categorical variable. I have plenty of experience running frequentist tests like aov() and lm() , but I cannot figure out how to perform their bayesian equivalents in R. I would like to run a bayesian linear regression on the first two variables and a bayesian analysis of variance using the categorical variable as the groupings, but I cannot find any simple examples on how to do this with R. Can someone provide a basic example for both? Additionally, what exactly are the output statistics created by bayesian analysis and what do they express? I am not very well-versed in stats, but the consensus seems to be that using basic tests with p-values is now thought to be somewhat misguided, and I am trying to keep up. Regards.
