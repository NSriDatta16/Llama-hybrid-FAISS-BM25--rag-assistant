iphone BPM tempo button

i want to create a button that allows the user to tap on it and thereby set a beats per minute. i will also have touches moved up and down on it to adjust faster and slower. (i have already worked out this bit). what are some appropriate ways to get the times that the user has clicked on the button to get an average time between presses and thereby work out a tempo.
