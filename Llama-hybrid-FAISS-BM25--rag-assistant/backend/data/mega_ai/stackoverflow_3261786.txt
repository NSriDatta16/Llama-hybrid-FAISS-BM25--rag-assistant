page cache in rails

My home page is largely the same for all users, which makes it a candidate for page caching. however, there are a couple of things that are user specific. For example, there is a nav item that is only shown for logged in users and there is a link like logout, my profile etc, generated for specific users. Do I have to use fragment caching instead? or should I use page caching and embed fragment caching for these specific items? or what other ways can this be accomplished. Also, the nav bar is generated in a plugin (simple-nav), how do I control what is generated inside the plugin with regards to caching? Thanks
