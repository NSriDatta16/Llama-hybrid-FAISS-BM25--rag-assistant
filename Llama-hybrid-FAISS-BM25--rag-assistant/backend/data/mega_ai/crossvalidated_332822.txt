How to analyze two-sided scale (too high-OK-too low)?

just not to invent the wheel: what is the standard approach to compare two variables coded by two-sided scale where the best value at the center and two types of the worst outcomes on the ends (too high-just OK-too low)? Two-step procedure comes to my mind: recode to one side to learn which variable is "better" and then split each variable by two to learn the direction of superiority. Anything more elegant?
