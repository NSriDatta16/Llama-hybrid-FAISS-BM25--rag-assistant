There's an old joke about a programmer who smoked. A friend said, "You're a really smart guy, can't you read the warning on the pack that says cigarettes will kill you?" Came the reply: "I'm a programmer. We only pay attention to errors, not warnings." Sometimes JSLint tells you things that are critical, sometimes it just nags. You can get lost trying to make it happy, but you might just be lost without it. Like any other tool, its input should be taken with a grain of salt. I prefer to think of it like the spell-checker or grammar-checker in MS Word. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong, and sometimes I just don't care what it tells me.
