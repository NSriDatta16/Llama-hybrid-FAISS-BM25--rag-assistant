If you use just single points for estimation, you get large variance due to measurement errors. If you use MA (moving average) in the form $\hat X_t = \Sigma^t_{t-\tau}{\gamma_iX_i}$, you get bias due to velocity of the object, unless you suppuse that you have Brownian Motion. If you don't mind a lag, you can use some kind of MA like $\hat X_t=\frac{1}{3}X_{t-1} + \frac{1}{3}X_{t} + \frac{1}{3}X_{t+1}$; you can include more terms or use different coefficients (corresponding to different kernel). If you need $\hat X_t$ at the moment $t$, you have to estimate velocity from previous observations with something simple like OLS, and correct the $\hat X_t = \Sigma^t_{t-\tau}{\gamma_iX_i}$ formula for this velocity to get something like $\hat X_t = \Sigma^t_{t-\tau}{\gamma_i[X_i+ (t-i)\hat V_t]}$. The velocity estimate we used for the correction is just ad hoc. When you compute velocities for your original purposes, use $\hat X_t$.
