If all your values are from the same sample size then you can compute their average to obtain the overall rate, 0.501. You can make a better estimate, particularly if the sample sizes vary by multiplying each value by the sample size to get the annual number, total these as the numerator (say s) and total the sample sizes as the denominator (say n) and compute the rate, p = s/n. The variance and standard error use the standard formulae. That is se = sqrt(p(1-p)/n). If your sample sizes are all 100, then you will get an overall rate of 0.501 and a se of 0.017. Doubtless your sample sizes are not all equal or equal to 100.
