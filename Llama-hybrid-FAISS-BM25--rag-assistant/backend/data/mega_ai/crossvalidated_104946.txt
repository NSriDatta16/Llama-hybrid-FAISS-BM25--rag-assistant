The temporary change, TC, is a general type of outlier. The equation given in the documentation of the package and that you wrote is the equation that describes the dynamics of this type of outlier. You can generate it by means of the function filter as shown below. It is illuminating to display it for several values of delta. For $\delta=0$ the TC collapses in an additive outlier; on the other extreme, $\delta=1$ , the TC is like a level shift. tc In your example, you can use the function outliers.effects to represent the effects of the detected outliers on the observed series: # unit impulse m1 $outliers, n = length(chicken), weights = FALSE)) tsp(m1) outliers, n = length(chicken), weights = TRUE)) tsp(m2) The innovational outlier, IO, is more peculiar. Contrary to the other types of outliers considered in tsoutliers , the effect of the IO depends on the selected model and on the parameter estimates. This fact can be troublesome in series with many outliers. In the first iterations of the algorithm (where the effect of some of the outliers may not have been detected and adjusted) the quality of the estimates of the ARIMA model may not be good enough as to accurately define the IO. Moreover, as the algorithm makes progress a new ARIMA model may be selected. Thus, it is possible to detect an IO at a preliminary stage with an ARIMA model but eventually its dynamic is defined by another ARIMA model chosen in the last stage. In this document (1) it is shown that, in some circumstances, the influence of an IO may increase as the date of its occurrence becomes more distant into the past, which is something hard to interpret or assume. The IO has an interesting potential since it may capture seasonal outliers. The other types of outliers considered in tsoutliers cannot capture seasonal patterns. Nevertheless, in some cases it may be better to search for a possible seasonal level shifts, SLS, instead of IO (as shown in the document mentioned before). The IO has an appealing interpretation. It is sometimes understood as an additive outlier that affects the disturbance term and then propagates in the series according to the dynamic of the ARIMA model. In this sense, the IO is like an additive outlier, both of them affect a single observation but the IO is an impulse in the disturbance term while the AO is an impulse added directly to the values generated by the ARIMA model or the data generating process. Whether outliers affect the innovations or are outside the disturbance term may be a matter of discussion. In the previous reference you may find some examples of real data where IO are detected.
