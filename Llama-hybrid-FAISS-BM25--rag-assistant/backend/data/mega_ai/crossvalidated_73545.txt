Basic binomial question

The following appeared on an assignment of mine (already turned in). I contend that not enough information is given to provide an answer.... it seems pretty cut and clear to me. However, instructor insisted it's solvable in minitab. Can you help me figure out what I'm not understanding? How do you solve this without a model of distribution of weekly demand, or at least an average value to use as constant approximation. I must be missing something simple. The problem: Consider a service company. 10% of the weekly demand is for a service category named "X" [Assume service categories are mutually exclusive]. The company must revise their resource plan iff there are too few customer orders(less than one/week) or too many customer orders (more than five/week) of service category "X". For the next 12 weeks, what is the probability that the company will not need to revise the resource plan? Thanks
