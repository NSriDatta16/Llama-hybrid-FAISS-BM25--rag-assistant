Cannot drag selection in Jcrop, what could break it?

I'm at a loss. I'm using JQuery 1.4.2 and JCrop 0.98. Everything else works fine, but I cannot move a selection once created. When I mouse over the selection and click, nothing happens. I have the JQuery library, the JCrop library and the JCrop css file all included. It's a pretty clean page without much else on it. I don't know if I'm accidentally overriding something in my own javascript and css in such a way that it breaks JCrop, there's quite a bit of both. But Firebugs isn't turning anything up. The tutorials work fine with my browse and on my server, though they do use a different version of jquery. However, when I replace the version they originally used with the version I use they continue to work just fine. So it has to be something to do with my javascript or css. I'm at a completely loss here, I'm looking at everything I can think of for where an issue might be, but I don't even know where to look. Has anyone else ever run into this issue before? What was the problem and how did you solve it? Where should I look for an error or bad override?
