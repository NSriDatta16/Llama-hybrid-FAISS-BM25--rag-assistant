It's not quite clear (at least to me) what you mean by using "none of the command-line tools". To run a program in a subprocess, one usually uses the subprocess module. However, if both the calling and the callee are python scripts, there is another alternative, which is to use the multiprocessing module. For example, you can organize foo.py like this: def main(): ... if __name__=='__main__': main() Then in the calling script, test.py: import multiprocessing as mp import foo proc=mp.Process(target=foo.main) proc.start() # Do stuff while foo.main is running # Wait until foo.main has ended proc.join() # Continue doing more stuff
