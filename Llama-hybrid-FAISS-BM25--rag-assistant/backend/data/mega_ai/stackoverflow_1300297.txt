I recently tried one very simple-minded technique. I noticed that when presented with a collection of radio buttons, the spam bots seems to always either choose the first option or accept whatever was pre-checked. So on one web site I run I have a form that users fill out with maybe half a dozen questions. One of the questions is a "type of entry" with radio buttons for the choices. So I added a new first choice, "I am a spammer", with a parenthetical comment explaining why the choice is there, and made it the default. If the form is submitted with that option checked, I return an error message instead of the usual confirmation message. Since doing that, the amount of spam I get has dropped to almost nothing. I don't know if what's left is spam bots that take a different strategy -- randomly choose among available radio buttons perhaps -- or if it's human spammers rather than robots. Mostly I did this as an experiment to see if it would work -- and frankly because it was fun to trick the spam bots into simply confessing and turning themselves in! Mostly I bring it up for discussion: maybe it will contribute to a better idea. If a spammer decided that my little site was worth devoting their special attention, they could easily beat this with a slightly smarter spam bot. But that could be said of many anti-spam schemes.
