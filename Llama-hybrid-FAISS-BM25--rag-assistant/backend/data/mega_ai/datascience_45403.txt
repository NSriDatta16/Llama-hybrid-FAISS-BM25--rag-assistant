Least squares could technically be use for categorical output, but definitely should not be. Least squares (in general, linear regression) is used for continuous output and makes several assumptions about the data that fail when using categorical output. One of the main issues is that your predicted values will probably be out of the 0-1 range, but if you are looking at a binary categorical problem, they should be within that range. Instead, you should use something like logistic regression which uses the sigmoid to bring the score within 0 and 1. Here's a visualization of this. You can use LS when one-hot-encoding categorical data as long as you have a continuous output.
