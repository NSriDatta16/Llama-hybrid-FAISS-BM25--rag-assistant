Making an element unselectable using jQuery

What's the best way to make an element unselectable using jQuery? I know you can use onselectstart="return false;" ondragstart="return false;" in the HTML, but I'm not sure how cross browser compatible that is. I also see someone's made a jQuery plugin: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Unselectable .. would a plugin like that be necessary? Is there a simple, compatible way to make an element unselectable? The reason for wanting to do this is purely aesthetic. With webpages that have dragging or click events, it's not very nice when things get selected.
