Q Learning Function Approximation

When I have the following function $$Q(s,a;w) = w_1f_1(s,a)+\cdots +w_nf_n(s,a)$$ in reinforcement learning. $f(s,a)$ is the feature vector. How is $f(s,a)$ defined? When I have state $s_0$ and two actions, can I choose {left, right}? How would the feature vectors look?
