How would you handle a very large vector in Ruby?

I'm planning to write a program in Ruby to analyse some data which has come back from an online questionnaire. There are hundreds of thousands of responses, and each respondent answers about 200 questions. Each question is multiple-choice, so there are a fixed number of possible responses to each. The intention is to use a piece of demographic data given by each respondent to train a system which can then guess that same piece of demographic data (age, for example) from a respondent who answers the same questionnaire, but doesn't specify the demographic data. So I plan to use a vector (in the mathematical sense, not in the data structure sense) to represent the answers for a given respondent. This means each vector will be large (over 200 elements), and the total data set will be huge. I plan to store the data in a MySQL database. So. 2 questions: How should I store this in the database? One row per response to a single question, or one row per respondent? Or something else? I'm planning to use something like the k-nearest neighbour algorithm, or a simple machine learning algorithm like a naive bayesian classifier to learn to classify new responses. Should I manipulate the data purely through SQL or should I load it into memory and store it in some kind of vast array?
