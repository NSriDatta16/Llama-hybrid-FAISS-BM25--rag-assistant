I feel we need to understand the nature of those missing values and then try to come up with a solution. In a VAR setup all variables are theoretically related in some way. How are all your loans related? Do they pertain to the same customer? If so, you might do better by summarising that information computing a new variable related with the puntuality or efficiency that the customer pays its loans. Say, for instance, taking the average (across all customers' loans) ratio of effective payment to the due payment by each month. Then you could average across all loans for each month and this new variable should not contain NAs.
