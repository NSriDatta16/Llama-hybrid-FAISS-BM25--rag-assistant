If I have means and medians, is there a way to average them?

Please consider these data points as an example of many more, they represent single studies with multiple samples which have been done during the last decades. 7.7 +/-3.3) mg/L, n=10 3.6 +/-0.2 mg/L, n=22 The publication states that 7.7 resp. 3.6 represents mean OR median, without specifying which has been used where, and there is no way to find out. Is there a way to get something like an average out of those data points, or is too much crucial information missing? EDIT: This question should be deleted. I realized I misread the data in question: values with a standard deviation are means, values without are median. Thank you for your help, and sorry for bothering you.
