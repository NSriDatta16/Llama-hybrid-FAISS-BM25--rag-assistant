How to select a model depends on what you want to do with the model: a model that's good for one purpose may be bad for another purpose. RMSE is often used to assess model fit (training error) or, using cross-validation or a separate test set, to assess predictive accuracy (test error). RMSE is no less useful for these tasks with a neural network than with any other kind of data-generating or predictive model, because it only compares model-generated values to observed values, with no concern for the interior structure of the model or how the model uses the predictors.
