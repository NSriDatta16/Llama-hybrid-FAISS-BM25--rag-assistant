Main script: my ($x, $y) = (888, 999); system('start', 'List Perl files', 'perl', 'other_script.pl', $x, $y); The other script: print "Args received = @ARGV\n"; ; BTW, there's probably a better way to achieve your larger goals -- for example, organizing the needed functionality into modules. Passing information from one script to another via command-line arguments and @ARGV can be a hassle and a limiting factor.
