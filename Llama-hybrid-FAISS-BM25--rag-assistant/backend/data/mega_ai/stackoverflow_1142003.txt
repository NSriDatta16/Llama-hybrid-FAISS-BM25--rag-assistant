Set "Homepage" in Asp.Net MVC

In asp.net MVC the "homepage" (ie the route that displays when hitting www.foo.com) is set to Home/Index . Where is this value stored? How can I change the "homepage"? Is there anything more elegant than using RedirectToRoute() in the Index action of the home controller? I tried grepping for Home/Index in my project and couldn't find a reference, nor could I see anything in IIS (6). I looked at the default.aspx page in the root, but that didn't seem to do anything relevent. Thanks
