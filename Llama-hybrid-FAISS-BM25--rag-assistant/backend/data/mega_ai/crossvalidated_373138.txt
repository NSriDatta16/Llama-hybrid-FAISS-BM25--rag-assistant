Usage of tsclean() in time series data

Consider the scenario, where I have many time series data. I have to make predictions for all.I made a ts object out the data. The data may contain outliers. I am not sure of it. But I always pass the ts object to tsclean() function of forecast package before building ARIMA model out of it. Is this a right approach? If not, Please provide any other alternative.
