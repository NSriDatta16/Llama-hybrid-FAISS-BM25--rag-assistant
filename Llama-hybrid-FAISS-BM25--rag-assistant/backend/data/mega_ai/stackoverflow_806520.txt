See Repository Maintenance in the svnbook, especially the Cleanup section. Your Subversion repository will generally require very little attention once it is configured to your liking. However, there are times when some manual assistance from an administrator might be in order. The svnadmin utility provides some helpful functionality to assist you in performing such tasks as modifying commit log messages, removing dead transactions, recovering “wedged” repositories, and migrating repository contents to a different repository.
