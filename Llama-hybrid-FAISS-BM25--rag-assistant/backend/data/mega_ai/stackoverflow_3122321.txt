I would ask you to point out a UI precedent where this is standard / expected behavior. When you drag an itemA onto itemB; and itemB is highlighted somehow, it usually means you're dragging into ItemB. But, in this case you are not dragging item from List1 into the item from List2. [I assume at least]. You'd have to override the list code drag and drop features to make this happen.
