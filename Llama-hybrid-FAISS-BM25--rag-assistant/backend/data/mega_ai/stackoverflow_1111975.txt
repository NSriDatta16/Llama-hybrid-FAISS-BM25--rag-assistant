I've written a PHP plugin in C++ with the help of SWIG . It's doable, but it may take a while to get used to the SWIG-compilation cycle. You can start with the SWIG docs for PHP . Update As @therefromhere has mentioned, I greatly recommend that you get the book Extending and Embedding PHP . There is almost no documentation to be found online (at least there wasn't in late 2008, early 2009 when I did my PHP plugin). I had to rely on the book for everything. Although sometimes Google Code Search is helpful for finding sample code.
