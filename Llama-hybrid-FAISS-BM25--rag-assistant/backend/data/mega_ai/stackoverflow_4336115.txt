The best rule of thumb for minimum resource usage is to use the fewest constructs as possible while remaining thread safe. Accordingly: Connection Factories are thread safe: One per JMS server (or one per JMS server per destination type for topics and queues) Connections are thread safe: Depending on the application architecture, you may be able to use one connection, but I would not bend over backwards to do this. Sessions and all constructs below the session are NOT thread safe: You will need one session per concurrent thread (or per transaction if you think about it that way). Based on that, hopefully you can strike a balance between an elegant architecture and low resource utilization.
