Problem Getting/Reading Webservice Response in Axis 1.4

I am using Axis 1.4 to to create a webservice client because the service uses RPC encoding. I've autogenerated the client code using wsdl2java based on a provided wsdl file. I can't get the wsdl from the service itself using ?wsdl appended to the service URL because it does't accept GET requests. When I try to access the service via the client, it first logs this exception: DEBUG org.apache.axis.ConfigurationException - Exception: org.apache.axis.ConfigurationException: No service named GetSettings is available I've read in other posts that this isn't something to worry about. However, if I could get rid of it it would be nice. My client class looks like this (try/catches removed): private String endpoint = "http:// /ToolsServlet/"; private ToolsServiceLocator locator; private ToolsPort service; public ToolsClient() { locator = new ToolsServiceLocator(); URL url = new URL(endpoint); service = locator.getToolsService(url); } public SwitchSettingsType getProvisionedSettings(String value) { SettingsType settings = service.getSettings(value); return settings; } My real problem lies in that I get exceptions trying to parse the response. For example: INFO: 13:59:17,361 [http-thread-pool-8080-(2)] ERROR org.apache.axis.client.Call - Exception: java.lang.NumberFormatException: Invalid boolean at org.apache.axis.encoding.ser.SimpleDeserializer.onEndElement(SimpleDeserializer.java:180) at org.apache.axis.encoding.DeserializerImpl.endElement(DeserializerImpl.java:502) ...

I tested direct post against the webservice using Firefox and the Poster addon. I used the SOAP message/request generated by my client and I do get back a valid response. Am I reading the logs correctly in that Axis thinks that there is an empty response? If so, does anybody have any suggestions as to why Axis is not getting a response or not reading it correctly? I can't see anything else in the logs that provides any clue. Start Update One It appears that I am getting back a response even though it's not logged in that one place, but further log statements show attempts to parse the response via DeserializationContext. Axis is throwing a NumberFormatException because it's expecting '0', 'f' or 'F' for false and '1', 't' or 'T' for true. It doesn't like 'true' or 'false' which is really warped since the wsdl defines the elements as xsd:boolean and the allowed values are 'true' and 'false' . Other than updating the source code to process 'true' and 'false' correctly, are there any suggestions to making Axis work? TIA End Update One Start Update Two Fresh eyes the next day help. The Axis code handles true and false because it's getting the first char of the string. The issue is that I'm receiving bad data. End Update Two
