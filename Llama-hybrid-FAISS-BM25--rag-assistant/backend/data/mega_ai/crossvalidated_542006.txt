How could I get the factor scores in factor analysis for a new observartion in R?

I would like to get factor scores for a new observation from a factor analysis 2-factor problem, I've tried to use factor.scores(object_of_fact_analysis,new_observation) to get factor scores but this command only allow object_of_fact_analysis as fa (the output of factor analysis using this command) and I used that as principal object from psych lib (I estimated the parameters of factor analysis by PCA). To be more clear see my code bellow: > object_of_fact_analysis=principal(data, nfactors=2, rotate="varimax", covar=FALSE, scores=TRUE, method="regression", cor="cor") > new_observation=c(110, 98, 105, 15, 18, 12, 35) > factor.scores(new_observation, f=object_of_fact_analysis) and I got: Error in if (dim(x)[1] == dim(f)[1]) { : argument is of length zero Can anyone please help me, I wouldn't like to use fa because it doesn't use PCA to estimate the factor model.
