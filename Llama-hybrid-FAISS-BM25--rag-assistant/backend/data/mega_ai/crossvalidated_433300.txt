By Gordon Smyth, Two reasons. First drop1 is doing likelihood ratio tests while summary is doing Wald tests. These are known to give different results for logistic regression when the fitted probabilities are close to 0 or 1, see for example link to the example The likelihood ratio tests are more reliable. – Gordon Smyth 2 days ago Second, drop1 is testing for differences between all the var2 levels at once, whereas summary is testing all the levels individually. The fact that the overall test is significant does not guarantee that any individual level will be significant. That's partly we do the overall test. – Gordon Smyth 2 days ago Thank you very much for the help Gordon Smyth.
