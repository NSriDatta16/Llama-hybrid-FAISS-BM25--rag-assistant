How do I emulate a storage card in Windows Mobile 6?

I have seen in many programs such as FreeOTFE that they can emulate a storage card in WinMo. It will be shown in Windows Mobile just as a storage card is inserted and i can interact with it just like a SD Card. How do i implement that? Any tips/tricks/guides/samples? I am using WinMo 6 Professional with Dot Net Framework :) I know i have to use C++ with some Native APIs :) But i need to know which ones :( Thanx a lot in advance :)
