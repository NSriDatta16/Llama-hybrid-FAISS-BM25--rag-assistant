Need Design help with POJO's used for JPA services and REST Client's

I have a set of JPA POJO's that contain annotations required for mapping to my domain. I also want to expose some REST services that will interact with those domain objects. My current task is to create an android application to access these REST services. I am not able to use the domain object due to the JPA annotations they contain. The Dalvik compiler complains. So I am looking for a strategy to be able to leverage these domain objects in a way that an Android project can also use those objects and not have to duplicate those POJO's.
