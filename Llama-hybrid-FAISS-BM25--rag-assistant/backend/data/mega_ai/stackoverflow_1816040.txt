SimpleDB vs Tokyo Cabinet

Has anybody compared SimpleDB and Tokyo Cabinet for performance and scalability? I'm coding my project against SimpleDB at the moment and considering benchmarking TC, be nice if somebody had already done it and could tell me whether it's worth testing my specific storage and searching operations. If not I'll run some direct comparisons and blog the results. Project is using Ubuntu 9.1 & Ruby 1.8.7 on an Amazon EC2 small instance (for now).
