Using PCA to select best variables, and then performing Linear Regression?

I am currently working on variable selection and came accross many methods which i tested. I tried one which i thought of, but never read about it. I would be curious if you know anything about it: What is commonly used is PCR: You use the projections of the individuals on the new dimensions which were calculated from a PCA. This does not select any variable, but mostly take in account the variables which contribute the most to each axis. However, since i wanted to select variables, i tried to take the variable contributing the most to each axis of a PCA and then building a linear model out of it. I tried it, and the results are really good for my data: It outperformed Lasso, RF, BestSubset... I think it is because i'm trying to model field data which describe the same reality as the descriptive variables i'm using (teledetection). I wanted to know if this method already exist anywhere, in order to read about it (as i highly doubt i've invented anything) and assess it's flaws.
