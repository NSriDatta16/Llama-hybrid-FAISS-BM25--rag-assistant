Unfortunately we did not publish this. Here's a summary. We assembled 5 large medical databases with a binary mortality outcome. For each we developed a then state-of-the-art neural network model and a logistic model. The neural net did not add very much to any of the logistic models. Delving deeper into this I allowed for each of the 5 datasets the presence of all two-way interactions among the model's variables. None of the interactions in any of the 5 were important. Since then I have continued to routinely quantify on lots of datasets, using methods similar to this , what proportion of the total predictive information is due to two-way interactions. I typically find that additive effects explain more than 0.95 of the explainable log-likelihood.
