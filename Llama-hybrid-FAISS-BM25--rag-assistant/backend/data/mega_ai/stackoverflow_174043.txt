This sounds like a good match for Java Management Extensions (JMX) JMX allows you to expose certain operations (eg: start/stop forwarding messages) JMX allows you to monitor certain performance indicators (eg: moving average of messages processed) Spring has good support for exposing beans as JMX MBeans. See here for more information. Then you could use an open-source web-based JMX console, such as jManage Hope this helps.
