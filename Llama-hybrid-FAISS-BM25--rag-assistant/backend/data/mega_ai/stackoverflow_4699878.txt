SOLVED! In eclipse it was my fault. I don't know why, but after some stops and starts from eclipse and the adb server it worked. In IntelliJ Idea I found the error, because I launched the IDE accidentally from the command line and saw an error in the console: 31:42 E/adb: Failed to get the adb version: Cannot run program "/home/frafu/devtools/android-sdk-linux_86/tools/adb": java.io.IOException: error=2, No such file or directory That seems to be a Idea failure or i missconfigured something. The adb executable is not located in /tools but in /platform-tools. So I made an symlink in tools/adb -> ../platform-tools/adb and now also IntelliJ Idea runs! Thank you for your attention. :-) frafu
