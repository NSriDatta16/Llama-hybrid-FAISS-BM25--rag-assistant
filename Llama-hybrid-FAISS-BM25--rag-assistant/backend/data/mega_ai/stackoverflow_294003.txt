RAM: enough to run your CI tool ( phpUnderControl ?) and whatever supporting software you want for your build and tests. Storage: decide how many old builds you want to keep on the machine. In my experience it isn't useful to keep very many, esp. if you have small team w/out a lot of formal process for rolling back to older builds. CPU: non-issue. Any machine you can buy will work. So between the two I tend to favor RAM over Storage space.
