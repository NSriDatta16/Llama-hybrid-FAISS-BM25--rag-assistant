Generally "efficiently" would probably be a measure of how much memory and GPU cycles (average, min, max) of your program is using. Then the efficiency measure would be avg(mem)/total memory for the time period and so on with AVG(GPU cycles)/Max GPU cycles. Then I'd compare these metrics to metrics from some GPU benchmark suites (which you can assume to be pretty efficient at using most of the GPU). Or you could measure against some random GPU intensive programs of your choice. That'd be how I'd do it but I've never thought to try so good luck! As for bottlenecks and "optimal" performance. These are probably NP-Complete problems that no one can help you with. Get out the old profiler and debuggers and start working your way through your code.
