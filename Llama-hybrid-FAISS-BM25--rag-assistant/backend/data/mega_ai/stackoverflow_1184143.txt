I had this exact problem and it turns out it was due to ColdFusion putting none printable characters into the JSON packets (these characters did actually exist in our data) but they can't go into JSON. Two questions on this site fixed this problem for me, although I went for the PHP solution rather than the ColdFusion solution as I felt it was the more elegant of the two. PHP solution Fix the string before you pass it to json_decode() $string = preg_replace('/[\x00-\x1F\x80-\xFF]/', '', $string); ColdFusion solution Use the cleanXmlString() function in that SO question after using serializeJSON()
