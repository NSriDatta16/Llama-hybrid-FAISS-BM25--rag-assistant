Covariance estimation of overlapping time series

I have two series $x_t,z_t$, and compute the differences like $\Delta_h x_t=x_t-x_{t-h}$. What is a good estimator of the covariance of changes? $$Cov[\Delta_h x_t,\Delta_h z_t]$$ The intervals are overlapping, so the series $\Delta_h x_t$ are autocorrelated, i.e. $Cov[\Delta_h x_t,\Delta_h x_{t+1}]>0$ for $h>1$. Hence, I'm not sure the usual covariance estimator is the best in this situation. We can assume that $\Delta_1 x_t$ are stationary, and not autocorrelated, if that's necessary. The series themselves are not necessarily stationary, they could be random walk, for instance. Otherwise, I'd rather prefer not to have strong assumptions on the series $x_t,z_t$.
