There's little hope of your program ever finding that folder. When you deploy your app, there is no project folder. The best way to organize it is to add the .xml files to your project with Project + Add Existing. Select them in Solution Explorer and in the Properties window set Build action = None and Copy to Output Directory = Copy if Newer. Build. That puts the files in the same directory as your .exe. Find them back at runtime with System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName(System.Reflection.Assembly.GetEntryAssembly().Location)
