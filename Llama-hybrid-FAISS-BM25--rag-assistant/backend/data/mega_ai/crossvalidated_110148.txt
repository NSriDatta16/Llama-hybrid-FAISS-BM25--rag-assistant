R multinomial logistic regression interpretation

I have run a multinomial logistic regression test for the interaction between species of deer, days a camera trap was in the field and type of reaction. The model with the best AIC value was: Coefficients: (Intercept) speciesmuntjac speciesroe speciessika days r -0.7471023 0.6263753 -0.005967869 -0.74253017 -0.05189515 sr 0.6909319 0.5552278 -0.355611180 -0.01622306 -0.03178001 Residual Deviance: 971.6464 AIC: 991.6464 But I also got the following (Intercept) speciesmuntjac speciesroe speciessika days r 0.0071741793 0.17599897 0.9865350 0.2095687 0.08669276 sr 0.0001402185 0.08536257 0.1331651 0.9574258 0.08829020 I'm just wondering if anyone knows why this is considered the best model when neither days nor deer react (r) or strongly react (sr) higher than chance?
