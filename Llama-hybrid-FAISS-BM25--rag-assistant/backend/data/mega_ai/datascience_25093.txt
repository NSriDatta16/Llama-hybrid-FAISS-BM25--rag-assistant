What is the efficient way to generate a similarity score when comparing two face images?

I am working on a face recognition application using deep learning. To plot the ROC curves and do performance evaluation, I extracted the features from the last layer of the deep neural network and I have tried Euclidian and Manhattan distances between high dimensional feature representation, but this won't give me accurate measure in terms of comparison as faces have intra-personal and interpersonal differences and other challenges such as pose, lighting condition, and expression. I came across techniques such as joint bayesian , sparse projection , KL-divergence based regularizer/prior(EM algorithm) etc. Are there any other approaches that I'm missing here? What would be the efficient approach to generate similarity scores?
