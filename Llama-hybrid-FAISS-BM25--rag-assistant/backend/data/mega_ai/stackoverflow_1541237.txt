I develop Sharepoint applications since 2002 and ran successfully dozens projects based on it, ranging from . Starting with WSS 3.0/MOSS 2007 most Sharepoint specific technologies (aka webparts) was incorporated into .net; so, application development changed a lot: you don't need to eat SPWeb on breakfast, but being a regular ASP.NET developer and having a pragmatic approach to learn about content management it's enough. Bottom line: Sharepoint development isn't rocket science; don't be afraid, get a VS2005/8, a VPC and happy coding!
