It is right that there is a Reinforcement Learning problem here. The negative reinforcement would be when the person skips the song, and positive when he/she doesn't. The action in this case would be choosing the song, and you wanted the state to be a playlist. I don't think this is a good idea. First, you'd have a varied number of songs (thus actions) per playlist (state) which doesn't make much sense. I would generalise it a bit: state: for example the person's mood or music preference of the person. action: choose a type of music / artist for example. reward: negative when skipped, otherwise 0 or positive. This way the method is more generic, and the meta data (music type, artist, ..) can easily be extracted from a MP3 file for example. I have not used any R package with MDPs, but this link seems interesting: Reinforcement Learning in R: Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Value Iteration
