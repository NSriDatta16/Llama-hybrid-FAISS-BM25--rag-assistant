Multiple Entry Points in GWT

I'm getting into Google Web Toolkit, and am a little confused about the Entry Points in GWT. Google's docs say: If you have multiple EntryPoints (the interface that defines onModuleLoad()) within a module, they will all be called in sequence as soon as that module (and the outer document) is ready. If you are loading multiple GWT modules within the same page, each module's EntryPoint will be called as soon as both that module and the outer document is ready. Two modules' EntryPoints are not guaranteed to fire at the same time, or in the same order in which their selection scripts were specified in the host page. So does each page in your website need an Entry Point defined for it? Do you only really NEED an entry point when you have javascript generated based on your Java classes? Are you able to combine multiple auto-generated-js definitions into a single *.gwt.xml file? EDIT: Link to quoted source: http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/1.6/DevGuideOrganizingProjects.html Thanks!
