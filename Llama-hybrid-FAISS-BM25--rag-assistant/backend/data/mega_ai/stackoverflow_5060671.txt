If there is exactly one block of interest per file, you could do from itertools import dropwhile, takewhile startline = "The text I want is set off by something distinctive" endline = "The end is also identifiable by something distinctive" masterlist = [] for file in filelist: next(dropwhile(lambda line: line != startline, file)) masterlist.append(list(takewhile(lambda line: line != endline, file))) If there is an unknown number of blocks per file, this gets a bit less elegant though: for file in filelist: templist = [] while True: try: next(dropwhile(lambda line: line != startline, file)) masterlist += takewhile(lambda line: line != endline, file) except StopIteration: break masterlist.append(templist) Note that this code assumes that filelist is a list of open file objects.
