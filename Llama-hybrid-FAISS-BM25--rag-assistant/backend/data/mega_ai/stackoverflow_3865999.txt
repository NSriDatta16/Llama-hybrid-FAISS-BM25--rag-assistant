Views and buttons unresponsive to touches after rotation

I am coding against iOS 3.0 and I am trying to add rotation (landscape) support to my app. Everything about the rotation was easy enough. However, after rotation to landscape mode from portrait, the right-third of the screen (480-320) is unresponsive to all events (touches, drag, etc.). I've verified that the key window is receiving the events but those events are not being passed to the buttons and UIViews on the right (in landscape) side of the screen. I am using NSNotificationCenter to receive orientation changed events (and not using autorotate flag). I did see: link text but that wasn't very helpful to my case. Stuck. Need help. Thanks.
