In the usual setting, $\mathcal{X}$ is simply not considered a random variable, but is instead considered deterministic! Therefore, $p(\theta|\mathcal{X})=p(\theta)$ . This assumption is of course often violated in practice. There are loads of discussion of this issue on the web, see, e.g. wiki1 , wiki2 and this answer . In particular, I can recommend Buja's tutorial-style article on this subject (2014) . To quote: the predictors are treated as known constants even when they arise as random observations just like the response. Statisticians have long enjoyed the fruits that can be harvested from this model and they have taught it as fundamental at all levels of statistical education. Curiously little known to many statisticians is the fact that a different modeling framework is adopted and a different statistical education is taking place in the parallel universe of econometrics. For over three decades, starting with Halbert White’s (1980a, 1980b, 1982) seminal articles, econometricians have used multiple linear regression without making the many assumptions of classical linear models theory. While statisticians use assumption-laden exact finite sample inference, econometricians use assumption-lean asymptotic inference based on the so-called “sandwich estimator” of standard error.
