Using FuzzyFinder in vim (+MiniBuffer), open file in current buffer

I'm using FuzzyFinder in vim together with MiniBufExplorer (with this setting in my .vimrc: g:miniBufExplorerMoreThanOne = 1). I'm using FuzzyFinder in coverage-file mode (where it works pretty much like command-t, from what I understand). The problem is, whenever I use FuzzyFinder to open a new file, instead of opening it in the current window I have open, it creates a new, tiny vertically-split window. Is there any way to change this behavior? EDIT: This only happens with the new, modified version of minibuffer (linked to from the vim script page). Not sure what I can do about it.
