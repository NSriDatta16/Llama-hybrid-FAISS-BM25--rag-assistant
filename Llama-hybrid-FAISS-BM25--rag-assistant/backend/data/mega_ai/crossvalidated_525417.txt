I assume you want to cluster respondents. I'd probably define a suitable distance between respondents (you could use the simple matching distance within each question and then average over questions if all questions have the same inportance) and do something distance-based such as Average Linkage or Partitioning Around Medoids. A Multidimensional Scaling could be useful for visualisation. k-means can only be run if you dummy-code your answers, and even then it'd not normally be recommended as it is meant for continuous data. There are many methods of cluster analysis (and in fact distance definition) and the choice of method depends on the clustering aim, precise meaning of the data, background information and the like, so I can't really say what is best for you.
