Developers normally need to do things that the average person wouldn't, and so should normally have administrator accounts. Making them hop through awkward hoops wastes their time and demoralizes them. There may be exceptions in high-security situations, but if you can't trust somebody with an admin account you sure can't trust their code. They should also have an available account of the same permission as their users (more than one account if the pool of users has different permission statuses). Otherwise, they may just develop something cool, deploy it, and then find it won't work for the users. There are also too many ways to screw up computers with admin accounts (yes, I've done it). The IT department needs a policy that they will re-image a developer's computer if they can't fix it quickly. At one place I contracted at, I had to sign a copy of that policy to get my admin account. This is a pretty Windows-specific answer. In Linux and other Unix-y systems, developers can more often get by with user accounts only, often don't need another account for test (if they've got an account they can sudo with, they do know when they're using the sudo, but they may need one with the same group permissions), and can do incredible amounts of damage to the OS very easily, so the same IT policy is necessary.
