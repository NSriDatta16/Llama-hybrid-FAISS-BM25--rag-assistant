If you need the value from a JSF managed bean programmatically, you can use something like this: FacesContext context = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance(); ELContext elContext = context.getELContext(); ValueExpression ve = context.getApplication().getExpressionFactory().createValueExpression(elContext, expresssion, Foo.class); Foo foo = (Foo) ve.getValue(elContext); Where expression is something like #{myBean.someValue}. Now this foo can be stored in any other bean that can be stored in any scope, or foo could be directly stored in some scope. Of course the code fragment shown above needs to be executed when still in a JSF context. If the JSP page is executed within a JSF context, you could also place the fragment on the JSP page as a scriptlet. This would be a very bad practice, but for some quick hack it might be a workaround.
