Edited due to the changed question on the comment below: Ah I see. You could easily use the same URL for all devices and just separate by checking the request environment for HTTP_USER_AGENT . But if this distinction is not enough (I think it is enough for more than 80% of all cases) you could do the following: in config/routes.rb : map.with_options :prefix => '/m', :format => 'mobile' do |mobile| mobile.resources :apples mobile.resource :user mobile.connect #... end # generates # /m/apples # /m/apples/new # ... # /m/user # ... I have not tested this, but maybe you will have to add a MIME type mapping for :format => 'mobile'.
