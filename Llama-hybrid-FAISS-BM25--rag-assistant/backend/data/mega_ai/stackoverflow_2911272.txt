I've found that when I try to be brief with comments (i.e. incomplete sentences, fragments), I often leave out key assumptions or words that would actually clarify meaning. I'm having a hard time of coming up with a concrete example at the moment, sorry. In general, though, forcing yourself to write complete, proper sentences also forces you to think more about what you're really trying to say with the comment. I've often caught myself rethinking what I really want to include in a comment by writing it out in full. There's no good reason to sacrifice clarity at the altar of brevity. Someone will need to understand the code in the future. The comments are for them, so make them easy to grok.
