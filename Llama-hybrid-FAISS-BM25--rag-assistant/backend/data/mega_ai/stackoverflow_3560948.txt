If you do not have the memory you will need external storage backing your datastructure, which is hard to do correctly (maps of weak references to your data, which all need to be rolled out to disk, etc), and you probably still will end up with bad performance when scaling. If you really have lots and lots of data, I would suggest embedding a SQL database. Then you can generate two tables containing your data and ask the database to find out any differences, and drop the tables afterwards. I've previously played with Derby, which I found nice, but others exist.
