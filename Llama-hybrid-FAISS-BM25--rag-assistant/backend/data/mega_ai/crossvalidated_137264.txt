Imputing missing gaps in irregular time series

I am currently working with time series data that was sampled at irregular time intervals. There are some gaps of missing data, i.e. a bunch of subsequent observations are missing every now and then. Particularly, these observations are missing completely (all features and the timestamp). I'm wondering what imputation method makes most sense here. My experience in this field is limited and the most promising ideas that I stumbled upon are: State-Space Models with Kalman Filters ARIMA models (problem: I read that ARIMA models implicitly assume regularly spaced time series. Maybe a transformation from irregular to regular series might make sense). I'm thankful for any opinions, papers (maybe a good review paper), et cetera.
