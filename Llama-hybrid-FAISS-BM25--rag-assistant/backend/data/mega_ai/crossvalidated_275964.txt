I think a better question would be: SHOULD you deal with different video frame sizes. First of all, the video linked has the same frame size throughout the video. It has just been padded with a black border. This shouldn't be a problem for your CNN . If you have trained a CNN well enough to detect faces for example, it doesn't matter that there is a black padded border around the 'active' part of video. It won't change the ability of face recognition.
