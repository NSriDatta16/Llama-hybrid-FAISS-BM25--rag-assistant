Perceptron definition doubts

I'm preparing a presentation about neural networks and I have doubts about the perceptron definition. Some sources I found in the internet tell that it's a basic artificial neuron, thus it's the basic part of a neural's network structure (and so have I written), but some say that it's the most basic neural network and not a part of it (e.g. the polish Wikipedia perceptron article, but not the english one) . I see the second ones point, because this might happen, but my problem is: can anyone accuse me of making a mistake and that I can't say a perceptron is the basic part of a neural network?
