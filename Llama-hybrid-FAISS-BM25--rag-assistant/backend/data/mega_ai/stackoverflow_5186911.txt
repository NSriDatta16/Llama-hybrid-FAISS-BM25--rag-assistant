A robust solution to a fundamental matrix using something like a 5 point or 8 point algorithm is certain a good start. That said, fundamental matrix solution can be susceptible to outliers and you'll likely want some additional overarching system to do the actual 3D solving. You can use a Kalman Filter type approach (fast, can be done in real time on embedded systems) or bundle adjustment (very accurate but can be slower). Some good SFM software out there that you can use or draw inspiration from: VSLAM (developed by Konolige who is a professor at Stanford and also works at Willow Garage, the OpenCV folks). Probably the fastest bundle adjustment solution I've seen. RSLAM (developed by the Oxford Mobile Robotics Group, showing some excellent results)
