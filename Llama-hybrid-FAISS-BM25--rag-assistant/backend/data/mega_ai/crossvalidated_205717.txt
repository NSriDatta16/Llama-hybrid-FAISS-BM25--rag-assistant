The fact that the algorithm took a while to "kick-in" is not particularly surprising. In general, the target function to be optimized behind neural networks are highly multi-modal. As such, unless you have some sort of clever set of initial values for your problem, there is no reason to believe that you will be starting on a steep descent. As such, your optimization algorithm will be almost randomly wandering until it finds a fairly steep valley to begin descending down onto. Once this has been found, you should expect most gradient-based algorithms to immediately begin narrowing into the particular mode that it is closest to.
