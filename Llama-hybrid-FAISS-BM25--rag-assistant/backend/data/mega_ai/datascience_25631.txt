Prediction with multiple features (attributes)

I recently used a prediction algorithm to try to predict how much an user is willing to interact with an item using ALS (Matrix Factorisation) but I had to "condense" multiple attributes into one, deciding some arbitrary weights for the values to be able to calculate the rating to use. It works (sort of) but I think it is definitely wrong because weighting the attributes manually is static and do not adapt to the data themselves dynamically. I was thinking to switch to a Distributed Random Forest algorithm but even if it would use all the attributes (randomly) they would not be used all together and this makes it not fit for my purposes. During my researches I found out that the Recurrent neural networks may be fit for what I am trying to achieve but before focusing on them, because I am not really an expert in the field, I would like to have suggestions :) Potentially I could take advantage of the time-series feature of the RNNs but for now I prefer to focus on supporting the set of attributes I have. Currently the "rating" for the ALS is calculated weighting some attributes like: how many times the user viewed the item page how many times the user viewed the category page how many times the user viewed the sub category page how many times the user bought something from the category how many times the user bought something from the sub category how much time ago the user bought the item how much time ago the user bought something from the same category how much time ago the user bought something from the same sub category (and similar) Is it worth trying with an RNN? If yes, should I try to go with tensorflow or caffe? Thank you!
