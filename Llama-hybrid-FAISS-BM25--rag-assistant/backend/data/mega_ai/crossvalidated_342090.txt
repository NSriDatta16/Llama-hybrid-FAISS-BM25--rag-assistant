xgboostExplainer intercept: and xgboost parameters

Can somebody shed some light on the xgboostExplainer intercept. I know it reflects the imbalancedness of the data but I have a doubt. I have one xgboost model with the following parameters params For this model I am able to obtain a negative intercept log-odds score of -1.41 which corresponds to a probability (y-axis on the waterfall plot) of approx 0.20 which is perfect since I have approximately 80% of the data as class 0 and 20% of the data as class 1 . However I run into problems when I assign a scale_pos_weight parameter to the model in order to penalise negative cases (0 cases) and assign a higher weight to positive cases (1 cases). params Now the intercept of the waterfall plot becomes zero and I do not understand exactly why...
