Java - Huge Data Retrieval

I have a requiement where in one of the report, I need to fetch around 10 million records from the database and transfer them to Excel. The application is client-server model where server side logic is written in EJB & client is written in Swing. Now my question is when I try to fill the Object of Java from Resultset , IF the size of resultset is more ( > 100000) then It throws Out of Memory Error on Java side. Can someone let me know how this scenerion should be handle in Java? I need to transfer all the records from the server to the client, and then I need to build the Excel report based on the data retrieved from server side.
