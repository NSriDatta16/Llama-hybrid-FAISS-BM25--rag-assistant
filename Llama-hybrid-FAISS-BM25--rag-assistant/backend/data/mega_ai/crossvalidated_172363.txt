A logistic regression model assumes that the data are binomial. If at least one of your variates are continuous (and you don't have replication) you'll want to generate Bernoulli observations (binomial $(n_i,p_i)$ with $n_i=1$). So given some overall sample size $n$, you set up the values taken by your predictor variables for each of those observations. You also need the $n_i$ for each case ( $= 1$ for many cases, but in some logistic regression situations $n_i>1$) You compute $p_i$ from your population parameter values and the values of the predictor variables for each observation: a. $\eta_i = x_i\beta$ (where $x_i$ is the row-vector of predictors from row $i$ of $X$) b. $p_i=1/(1+\exp(-\eta_i))$ For each observation in the sample generate from a binomial$(n_i,p_i)$ (if $n_i=1$ this will just be a 0 or 1 of course. This is your response, $y_i$. Those will give you a single simulated sample. You need to repeat step 3. as many times as you need samples for whatever you're doing.
