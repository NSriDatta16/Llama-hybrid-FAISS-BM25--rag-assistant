You need to make sure your files exist on the local server and that the paths are correct. Right click the page from your browser, "view page source", and click on the javascript links to see if they open or server returns 404 not found. If you can't access the javascript files from the browser, first check if they are even present in the local folder structure, but my guess is that your url's are wrong. Pay attention to absolute/relative paths. Try including your javascript files with a relative url (without a / in the beginning)
