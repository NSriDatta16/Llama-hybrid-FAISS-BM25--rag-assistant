Thank you vooD for taking some time for helping me! However, I've been lucky because I emailed the creator of css_views GEM and surprisingly, I did get a pretty fast answer. Very nice of him! I'll share it with you since it answers my question (saying it won't provide a solution to my problem). In the application layout you would use this: production_stylesheet_path( 'application', '2011033101', :css ) The first param is what you want the name of the file to be, the second is a string for cache busting and the last is the file type. The above will generate: /stylesheets/application-2011033101.css 'application' is which css_configuration to use. So the one above uses this one from my stylesheets controller: css_configuration "application", :components=>['global', 'application', 'recipes', 'print'],:transformers=>[Transformer.new] The components refer to the name of files in the /views/stylesheets folder, and the order to compile them in. In development it'll serve up the files dynamically, but in production it will write out one file into /public/stylesheets/application-2011033101.css This means that you can have variables in the css.erb files BUT you cannot change them on a per request basis. If you update anything in the CSS erb files you have to bump the number, otherwise the changes may not appear, especially if you have far-future dates set for the headers on the CSS. The Gem has been overtaken somewhat by stuff coming in Rails 3.1 - they are integrating SASS - but if you want a lighter weight solution, this is it! I hope that all makes sense - let me know if you have any further questions! Cheers, Richard
