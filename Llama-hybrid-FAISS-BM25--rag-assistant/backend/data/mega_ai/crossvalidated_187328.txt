Price Elasticity at customer level

Has anyone worked on Price Elasticity model at customer level? In Insurance Industry, insurance policies from a insurer that have been given a renewal offer in the period of 2 years are taken. Target Variable: (Binary) whether a customer renew an existing insurance contract or policy? I have read somewhere they generally use the treatment - the rate change: percentage change in premium from the current to the new rate, categorized into ordered values. My question - How price elasticity would be calculated give it's a logistic regression model (binary)? How can model help in finding the customers which are more sensitive toward policy premium changes? Any help would be highly appreciated!
