I know one software company in my city is using AI, that was developed as a Masters in Engineering project, to detect fraudulent bank/financial transactions. It's pretty interesting stuff. They look for strange recurring payments, or compare account numbers based on known terrorist organizations ...etc. I'm not sure how many people are doing similar work, but i'm sure with the lock-down on financial institutions these days these types of applications will become more prevalent (it's working for them).
