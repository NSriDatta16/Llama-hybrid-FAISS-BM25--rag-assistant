;; * Inserted "tabs" to be expanded into two spaces. Emacs stubbornly ;; sticks to eight, no matter what I do. ;; * Tabs (i.e. real \t characters) to be represented on screen by two ;; spaces.

Currently, I press TAB anywhere and Emacs ;; destroys all whitespace at the start of the line; this is the ;; most infuriating thing so far.

Well ... visit a file ;; in that mode, and then type C-h v major-mode RET. You'll see the ;; mode's name in the *Help* buffer (probably on the second line). ;; Then type (e.g.) C-h f python-mode; you'll see blather about the ;; mode, and (hopefully) somewhere in there you'll see (again e.g.) ;; "This mode runs the hook `python-mode-hook', as the final step ;; during initialization."
