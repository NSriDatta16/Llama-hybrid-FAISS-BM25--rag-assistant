How to deal with survey question with multiple response?

I have a dataset asking people whether they have been to a certain places (e.g. A, B, C, D), and they can make more than one choice, then a specimen is taken from their nose to see if they are infected with some disease. I need to find out the relative risk of getting infected for one going to a certain place, I can only think of logistic regression right now, is there any other suggestions? Thanks.
