You'll definitely feel at home with Firebug. I is the easiest and the most powerful of tools that I know of for debugging pages live. I constantly make use of it prior to committing a change to a CSS stylesheet (i.e. margins/paddings, colors and the like). The fact that it also includes a Javascript Debugger and a console is a plus. From what I gather, many that do not use Firefox use Firebug Lite. It's JavaScript powered and a bit slow, though. IE8 Dev. Tools is useful, but the experience isn't very much alike Firebug, but the concept remains. I recommend also familiarizing yourself with Safari Web Inspector and Opera Dragonfly. They are debugging tools with similar aspects to Firebug.
