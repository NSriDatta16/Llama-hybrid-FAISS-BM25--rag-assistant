First, some background from Wikipedia , to quote: a log-normal (or lognormal) distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. Thus, if the random variable X is log-normally distributed, then Y = ln(X) has a normal distribution.[1][2] Equivalently, if Y has a normal distribution, then the exponential function of Y, X = exp(Y), has a log-normal distribution. And further: Since the log-transformed variable ${Y=\ln X }$ has a normal distribution, and quantiles are preserved under monotonic transformations,... Actual my experience with Box-Cox is that for generated normal random deviates to which one raises to a power, the Box-Cox correctly identified a log-transformation. However, while the starting normal random deviates nicely produced a confidence interval centered close to the true normal population mean, applying the transform Exp() produces a value that corresponds now to a value reflective of median of the lognormal population. The latter is in accord with the fact that the median for a lognormal equates to the ${Exp(\mu)}$ where ${\mu}$ relates to the mean of the underlying normal. So, transformation entail perhaps more of an interpretation issue as to what the center of the interval actually pertains to with respect to your original data set, albeit, the percentage coverage band is likely accurate. Here is a prior answer that you may find more informative .
