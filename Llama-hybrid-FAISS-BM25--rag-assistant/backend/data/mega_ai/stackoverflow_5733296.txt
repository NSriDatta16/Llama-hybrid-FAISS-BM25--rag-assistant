CSS Media Query for print, mobile, and desktop

I have had a look around but need a more concise answer to this question. I'm trying to workout the best way to construct the CSS in my current project for multiple media devices. I want to be able to have a stylesheet for: CSS resets (everything to use) The normal desktop 'screen'. (only desktop computers) Printing 'print' (only printing) The iPhone/handheld (only handheld) IE6 stylesheet (only IE6) So my question is: Am I right to think the right way to control this would be.. set the media="all" for the resets.css set the media="screen" for the desktop.css use conditional comments 'here' for legacy browsers. set the media="print" for printing.css use css3 media queries such as : @media only screen and (min-device-width: 320px) and (max-device-width: 480px){ } has anyone got a little more experience setting up multiple device css that could share their methods? how do you organize this yourself?
