If you want to use Deep Learning, you must know what is it good at in the current state of art, and what problem is still challenging. Essentially, the classes of problems are (no my list is definitely not exhaustive): a. image recognition and classification b. natural language processing: translation and c. audio: speech recognition And what problem it is still a challenge: a. logic processing / understanding and proving b. source code processing: automated programming, bug fixing, bugs finding etc. c. problem diagnosis (eg, engine, or mechanical problem diagnosis). My knowledge is limited, eg, the last item above may well be very much advanced right now, as it has a long history starting from the use of experts system for problem diagnosis (and had many success stories). So like (c) above, you have to frame your problems in the form that fits one of the above well-known domain or problem classes, before even identifying the algorithm. Broadly, algorithm can be broadly classified as follows: https://www.quora.com/Machine-learning-is-a-broad-discipline-Where-can-I-find-a-mind-map-knowledge-tree-of-all-the-areas-and-methods-and-their-relations
