It sounds like you'd be interested in the Bradley–Terry model , which models the probability of a player winning a match against another player. It is generally estimated in a fashion that takes into account each player's win–loss records against all other players. A detailed example of its use to model performance in a chess tournament, in a Bayesian context, can be found in Gelman, A., Carlin, J. B., Stern, H. S., & Rubin, D. B. (2004), Bayesian data analysis (2nd ed.), Boca Raton, FL: Chapman & Hall/CRC, ISBN 1-58488-388-X, pages 431–433. Gelman et al. cite Glickman, M. E. (1993), Paired comparison models with time-varying parameters (Ph.D. thesis), Department of Statistics, Harvard University, http://www.glicko.net/research/thesis.pdf . This said, beware that MCMC is slow and computationally intensive, almost certainly prohibitively so for real-time use on a web server. Even MLE, which can be thought of as an approximation to a full Bayesian analysis, may be too slow. Perhaps you can find an approximation that is computationally much simpler but gets most of what you want. In any case, you may be able to find a way to reuse partial results so that only a few computations need to be done per candidate matchup.
