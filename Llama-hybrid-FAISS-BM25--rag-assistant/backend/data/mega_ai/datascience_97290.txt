If you take a Bayesian approach, you do not need to equalize the time points. The model would have greater confidence in predictions for the time points where there is more data. Looking at the data, you have very few observations (less than 10 for several years). This limits the type of techniques you can use. It might not be appropriate to use machine learning or deep learning.
