Is reinforcement learning the right approach for finding unknown functional relationship in this example?

We have a machine learning problem as depicted in the following figure . It has the following structure: Data consists out of float values $a_i$ , $n_i$ , $X_i$, $Y_i$ and an outcome $O_i$ (0 or 1). $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are decisive for $F_i$ and there is a functional relationship between $X_i$ and $Y_i$ and $F_i$ but we don't know the type of it and it might be very complex. What we know is how $F_i$ needs to be postprocessed to find $G_i$ , i.e. we calculate $H_i=f(F_i,n_i)$ and compare $H_i$ against $a_i$ which gives $G_i=1$ if $H_i>a_i$ and 0 otherwise. What we want is the best agreement between all $G_i$ and $O_i$ . So to sum it up: We are interested in a neural network (or similar) that allows us to predict $F_j$ for a new dataset $X_j$ and $Y_j$ , but we can only train using the booleans $G_i$ and we do not know or have any access to any training value $F_i$ . We thought about reinforcement learning, but I only heard of applications in action taking depending on a state (e.g. pacman). Can you tell me if reinforcement learning might work on this or can you direct me to any other field in machine learning that might help here?
