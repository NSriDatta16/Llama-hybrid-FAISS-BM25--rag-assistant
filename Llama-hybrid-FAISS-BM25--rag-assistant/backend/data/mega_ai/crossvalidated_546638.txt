Model Y~X using longitudinal data when X is measured less often than Y

I have the following data/setting: N persons assessed over time: different number of assessments; assessments at different time points Variable Y: measured ~50 times (3 times per day) Variable X: measured at 5 time points It is possible to model Y ~ X? I was thinking in using mixed models and account for the two levels (assessments nested in individuals) but I don't know how to do it without losing information (as would happen if I use just 5 measures of Y). In practice, I'm looking for two time series (for each individual) and I want to know if X affects the dynamic of Y over time.
