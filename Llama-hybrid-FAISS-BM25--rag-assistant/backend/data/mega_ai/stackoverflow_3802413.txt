How to store duplicate data from xml file in C#

I'm having an xml file like i need to store the data in any temporary storage ( namely a Dictionary ) for some sort of manipulations . but i cannot use dictionary here because dictionary does not support same keys. can any one suggest me a better way to store this data?
