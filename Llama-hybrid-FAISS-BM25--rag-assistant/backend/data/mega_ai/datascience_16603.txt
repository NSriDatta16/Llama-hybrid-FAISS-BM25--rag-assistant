What tools are available for programming language parsing for ML?

I want to preform a machine learning task (e.g. supervised classification, clustering) on a corpus of programming language source code (lets say Python), and I'm looking for tools for parsing and constructing structures out of a document of Python (for example) code, similar in concept to NLP tokenization and higher level language processing, adjusted for programming languages. While I'm able to find a lot of general NLP related material, it seems to me a better starting point would be previous research specifically focusing on programming languages. I'm looking for tools, resources, academia articles and keywords to search for, basically any help is appreciated!
