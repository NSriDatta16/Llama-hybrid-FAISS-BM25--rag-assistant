The third option is to just use a global variable. Declare: int counter = 0; between the imports and the implementation in any .m file (but only one); declare: extern int counter; in the header of any file where you want to use this counter. And use: counter++; from anywhere (any function, method, object or class), and access the counter across the entire application. Note that the use of global variables does not scale well to large apps or reusable components, so their use is usually discouraged. Use instance variables, or maybe class or method static locals, instead, if at all possible.
