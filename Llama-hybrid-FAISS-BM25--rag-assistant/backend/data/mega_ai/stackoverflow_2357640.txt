Are your looking for a one time transfer? Or are you looking to keep two iPhones in sync with each other for a period of time (a game?). I haven't looked too much into this subject, however if your creating a game I suggest you take a look at the chapter "Sync Services and Core Data" in the book "Core Data: Apple's API for Persisting Data on Mac OS X". http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mzcd/core-data GameKit appears to simply establish a connection via Bluetooth. If you want to use IP in the future, look into using AsyncSockets. http://code.google.com/p/cocoaasyncsocket/
