How to control the order of functions being called in jQuery $(document).ready

I need to be able to control the order of items being processed in the $(document).ready event. These are multiple controls, loaded from multiple files, all asking to be called in the ready event. They all start an async call to the server (AJAX). Only after they are all done, I need to do some extra work. What would be the elegant solution for this?
