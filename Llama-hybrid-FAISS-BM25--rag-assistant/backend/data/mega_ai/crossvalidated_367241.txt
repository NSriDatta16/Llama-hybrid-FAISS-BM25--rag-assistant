Is there any Good comprehensive reference for tensor calculus?

I am currently reading this RNN blog, where it talks about Backprop through time. I am struggling to derive it and don't understand how to go about such derivations in general. Stuff like this ends up being a pain point in most literature related to ML/DL/AI. Is there any resource that explains derivatives of different objects of higher dimensions in detail with proper examples.
