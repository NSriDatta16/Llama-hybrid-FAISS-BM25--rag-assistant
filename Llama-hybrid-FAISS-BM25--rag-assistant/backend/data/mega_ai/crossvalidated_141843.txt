Do I need to be a mathematician to be more than an expert in machine learning?

Machine learning has its roots principally in mathematics so if I wanted to be not only an expert but an innovator in this area would I have to be a computer scientist or would I need to be a mathematician? I ask this, because I have found that most of the Turing Award winners are mathematicians. Therefore seems logical to think that the great advances in computer science including machine learning are produced by mathematicians not by computer scientists. Can anyone clarify this for me?
