Giving a Silverlight port per se for our WPF App, the following are the two 'pain' points we encountered. Splitting up and grouping XAML's/modules for improved performance and on demand XAP downloading using MEF. Challenge of achieving Binary Compatibility using the same code base for WPF/Silverlight. A few of our Functionality required OOB and user acceptance. We optimized a bit of Functionality relying on IsolatedStorage. Hope this helps. [ Now that Silverlight 4.0 has a stable build, we had a few Visual Studio hiccups over the last few releases which resolved itself overtime. (We stuck to Silverlight 3.0 and somewhere in mid march jumped to SL 4.0 beta and final release)]. N.B. : I have tried to keep things way abstract to not reveal the identity of the client.
