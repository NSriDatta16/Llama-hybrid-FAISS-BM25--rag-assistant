The question isn't really answerable because "RDBMS" and "column-oriented" refer to very different aspects of a DBMS and are not mutually exclusive. A RDBMS is any DBMS that implements the relational model. A column-oriented DBMS is any DBMS that uses a columnar storage for data. That could be an RDBMS or it could be something else.
