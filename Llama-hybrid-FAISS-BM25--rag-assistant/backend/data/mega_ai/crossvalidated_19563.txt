You can be confident of your models if you cross-validate them! You can do by "rolling" through your dataset one observation at a time, forecasting 1 step ahead. At the end of the process compare your 1-step forecasts to the actual values to get some idea of how your model performs out-of-sample. You can find this process explained in more detail at the end of this post . You can find R code for cross-validating time series here , here and here .
