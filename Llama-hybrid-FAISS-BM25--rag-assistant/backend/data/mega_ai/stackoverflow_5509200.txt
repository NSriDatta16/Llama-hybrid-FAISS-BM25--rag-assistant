For the first cell (next to 0 ), type in =SUM(IF((A:A A2-60),C:C,0)) and press CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER to confirm(, and there will be {} around the formula after you have done so). Then drag down. Here you see, the answers provided by Excellll and me are both correct. For 61.6 , 1.8 - 61.6 are summed, while for 63.25 , 4 - 63.25 are summed. To make sure, the { and } are around the formula, which appear after CTRL + ALT + ENTER. That is, press CTRL and hold, press ALT and hold, press ENTER and release 3 simultaneously.
