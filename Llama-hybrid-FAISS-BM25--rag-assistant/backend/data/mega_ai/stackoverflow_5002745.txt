UITableView is designed only as a way to view your data, taken from the data source. The total number of cells is an information that belongs in the data source and you should access it from there. UITableView holds enough cells to fit the screen which you can access using - (NSArray *)visibleCells One dirty solution would be to maintain a separate array of every UITableViewCell you create. It works, and if you have a low number of cells it's not that bad. However, this is not a very elegant solution and personally I wouldn't choose this unless there is absolutely no other way. It's better that you do not modify the actual cells in the table without a corresponding change in the data source.
