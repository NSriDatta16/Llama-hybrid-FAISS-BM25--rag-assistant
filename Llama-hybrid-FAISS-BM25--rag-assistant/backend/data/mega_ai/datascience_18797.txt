How do convolutional layers get connected to each other?

I'm trying to analyze the architecture of a CNN and I was expecting it to be shaped: Input Image: 28 x 28 1st conv.: 28 x 28 x nb_filters 2nd conv.: 28 x 28 x nb_filters x nb_filters But apparently it goes: Input Image: 28 x 28 1st conv.: 28 x 28 x nb_filters 2nd conv.: 28 x 28 x nb_filters I thought that every filter in the second layer would be applied to every activation map in the first layer resulting in: Activation maps after second layer = nb_filters_1st_layer x nb_filters_2nd_layer If it's not working that way, how do I know what filters are applied to what activation maps?
