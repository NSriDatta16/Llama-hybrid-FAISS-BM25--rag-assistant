Remote login to facebook account

For my project purpose, i need to login to my facebook account remotely and retrieve some information from there. For the login purpose, i am using cURL library of PHP. On execution of the code, facebook page asks me to enable the cookies on my browser which i have already enabled. Is there any problem with the code? Can anybody help me out in logging into my account remotely? I am a newbie and would really appreciate if any help comes. Here is the code $value) { $post_items[] = $key . '=' . $value; } //create the final string to be posted using implode() $post_string = implode ('&', $post_items); //create cURL connection $ch = curl_init('https://login.facebook.com/login.php?'); //set options curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 30); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)"); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1); //set data to be posted curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $post_string); //perform our request $result = curl_exec($ch); print_r($result); //close the connection curl_close($ch); ?>
