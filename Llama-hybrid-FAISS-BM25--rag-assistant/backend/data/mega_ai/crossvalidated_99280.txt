Logistic regression with time series predictor data

I like to know if we can model binary outcome with time series predictors. For example lets say Y is binary. $X_1, X_2, X_3,...,X_n$ is the same predictor variable but is a historical snapshot over time period $1,...,n$. I am interested in predicting $Y$ but include the auto correlation among $X_1,...,X_n$ and seasonality if any among $X_1,...,X_n$.
