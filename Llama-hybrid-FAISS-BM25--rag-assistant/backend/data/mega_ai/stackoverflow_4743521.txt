How to learn OpenGL by example, say, building a rotating globe?

I have two years of experience on iPhone programming but totally new to OpenGL. What should I pick up in order to build a rotating globe on iPhone? What I want to archive: a 3G globe shown on an iPhone basically a 3D ball with a texture map on it when a user drag on the screen, the globe rotates Thanks
