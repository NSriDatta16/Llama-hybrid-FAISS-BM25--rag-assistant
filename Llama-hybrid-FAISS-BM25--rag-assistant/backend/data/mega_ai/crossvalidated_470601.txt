For medical data, a few datasets can be found at: Physician notes with annotated PHI 1) i2b2 2006 Deidentification and Smoking Challenge's data set : NLP Data Set #1B: 889 de-identified discharge summaries with de-identification challenge annotations, training and test sets and ground truth.

All detected instances of PHI in these nursing notes have been replaced by realistic surrogate data in the gold standard corpus. Although the deid software, as noted above, may be redistributed under the terms of the GPL, the gold standard corpus, because of the very small possibility that it may contain one or more instances of undetected PHI, is currently available only under terms that do not permit it to be redistributed.
