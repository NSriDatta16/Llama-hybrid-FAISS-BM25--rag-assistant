Is it possible to classify images by vectorizing them (and achieve a good performance)?

Many applications of image classification involves convolutional neural network, where the image is treated directly as a 2D (or 3D, if multiple images) matrix. I wonder if images can be classified (and with reasonably good performance) with a MLP or softmax regression or even SVMs by vectorizing them, meaning to stack each row or column of this 2D matrix into a single row or column vector and feeding that into the network directly (no convolution) The answer is probably negative...but I wonder if anyone know whether this is possible.
