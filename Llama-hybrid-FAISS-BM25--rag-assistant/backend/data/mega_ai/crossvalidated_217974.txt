Is there a way to flip the hypotheses of the significance of variables in a logit regression model?

I am using the GLM Summary in R to determine the significance of the variables in the logistic regression model. I am trying to figure out if there is a way to flip the null and alternative hypotheses such that the null is that a certain variable is not insignificant in the logistic regression model and the alternative is that a certain variable is insignificant in the logistic regression model. This way, if I reject the null, I can accept the alternative with some level of significance. Is there a way to do this? Or is there some other test or model I can use?
