Adding rows programatically to a DataGridView that is data bound?

I have a problem and I can't seem to be able to solve it. I thought someone here will be able to help out. I have a form that has a DataGridView of customers. Now, I want to add several customers to this DataGridView without actually adding them to the database. This is because the client must be able to create a list of clients and when thats done add them all at once. I have tried this: string[] array = {"Microsoft", "Redmond", "Something"} dataGridView.Rows.Add (array); Now this can't be done because I get an exception saying something in the lines of you cant add rows programatically to a DataGridView that is data bound . Now I have also read that this can be solved by using a table adapter to insert the rows instead of directly adding them via. a DGV. But this is also not possible because I use custom headers in the DGV because existing data is fetched via JOIN's so if I add them via a TableAdapter I get an exception that the it doesn't match the databases table schema. Now I am really lost... Anyone know of a (halfway) elegant solution to this problem? Thank you
