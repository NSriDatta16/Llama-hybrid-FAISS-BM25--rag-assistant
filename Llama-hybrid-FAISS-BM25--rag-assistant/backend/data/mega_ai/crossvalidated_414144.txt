When to use Normalized Root-Mean-Squared Error vs Spearman Correlation?

I am doing some Machine Learning experiments with Azure and the graphs that it gives me are measured in Spearman Correlation vs Iteration Number (part of the machine learning) However I was just in a talk that stated that Normalized Root mean SQUARED error is recommended instead of Spearman. Can anyone explain the difference between these two metrics and why RMSE is "recommended"?
