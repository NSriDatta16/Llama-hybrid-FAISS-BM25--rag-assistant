Interpretation of logistic regression model output in R

I have created a model in logistic regression to find if there is an association between the number of months of drug use prior to rehab, and the success of that rehab. My code is: head(peermentor) summary(peermentor) sapply(peermentor$duration_use, sd) xtabs(~duration_use + rehab_success, data = peermentor) peermentor$rehab_success And the output is: Call: glm(formula = duration_use ~ rehab_success, data = peermentor) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -18.966 -12.966 -4.981 5.034 101.034 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 18.9665 0.8773 21.618 In interpreting this, is the coefficient of -2.9854 telling us that the greater the number of months of use, there is a -2.9854 change in the log odds of passing the rehab therapy (coded as yes/no)? Does that mean there is a decrease due to the negative sign? Additionally, surely the p value of 0.0117 suggest this is statistically significant? Please also advise on if there is a better statistical model that can be used to find any correlation here Edited code: Call: glm(formula = rehab_success ~ duration_use, family = binomial(), data = peermentor) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.341 -1.263 1.026 1.070 1.453 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.377679 0.097586 3.870 0.000109 *** duration_use -0.009959 0.003986 -2.498 0.012473 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 1188.8 on 863 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 1182.4 on 862 degrees of freedom AIC: 1186.4 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4
