Internet browser keep loading old swf files?

i have an swf file, uploaded in server. But whenever I make changes to the files, uploaded and replace the old one, I go to browser, clear cache and everything, refresh the page, but it still load the old swf file. (Do you know what I mean?) But after 10 - 20 hours, I visited the page again, it loaded the new one. Is there anyway to load the new swf without having to wait for 10 - 20 hours? (my last option is renaming the swf, which works immediately. But for some reason, renaming is my very last option, I would like to know if there are anything I can do before I rename the file.) Here are the list of what I tried to do to load new swf: Clear browser cache Clear dns cache (ipconfig /flushdns) Include header in html meta pragma no-cache (forgot the formula, cuz i copied from internet) Rename the swf (which works immediately)
