What are the preliminary analysis before running a logistic regression?

I have a dichotomous variable which represents if a student is accepted or not in a University. In order to do this I have about 60 variables (information of the students: gender, age, etc; their results in multiple classes, etc) and 1000 observations. I would like to know which tests/analysis I need to conduct in order to pre-select my independent variables (instead of blindly put all variables in the model). Which conditions should I verify for each type of variable (continuous, polynomial, etc)? Thanks
