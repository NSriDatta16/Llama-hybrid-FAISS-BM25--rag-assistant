Rolling Time Period for Exponential Forecast (Holt Method)?

I am curious in which cases (if any) you would force an exponential smoothing function to only incorporate data from the past year? Per Holt method, one would continue to use the full time series as opposed to a 1-year lookback. Is the idea behind this that the "trend" component would update the forecast for any structural shifts? If my data has a totally different monthly trend this past year as opposed to prior years, wouldn't I want to restrict Holt Winters method to only observe months from the past year?
