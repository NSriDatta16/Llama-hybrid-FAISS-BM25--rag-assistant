I had the same problem with a sparce matrix in NLP and what we did was select the columns that where more useful to clasify our rows (that gave more information for discerning the result), if you want I can explain it to you in more detail but it is really simple you can figure it out. But your problem does not seem to be a classification one, I actually am a little confused about what you said about above the diagonal and below it. But I was thinking that you can use the Apriori data mining algorithm to discover the more important alliances between any number of items.
