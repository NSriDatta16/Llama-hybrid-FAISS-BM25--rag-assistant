Can an R^2, or coefficient of determination be used on non-linear data?

I have used the $R^2$ metric to determine how well my neural network performs a non-linear regression. And it seems to work. The plots look almost identical, and I get an $R^2$ value of 0.93... it seems to work perfectly, however I have been told that $R^2$ should only work for linear data. Is this true or false?
