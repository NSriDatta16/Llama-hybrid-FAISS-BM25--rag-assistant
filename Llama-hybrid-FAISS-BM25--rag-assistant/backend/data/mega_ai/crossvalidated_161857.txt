How to assess the relationship between a continuous explanatory and categorical response variable?

I have a categorical variable as my response variable (severity of disease: absent, mild, mild/moderate, moderate, moderate/severe, severe), and I have a continuous variable (test scores, which are normally distributed). I'm interesting in seeing how the test score is associated with the severity of the disease. I thought of a few approaches: 1) multinomial logistic regression 2) correlation analysis (but I have no idea which technique to use).
