Convert mp3 to wav on Android

There seem to be a lot of questions regarding the inverse wav to mp3 conversion, but none to go the other way. My situation is that I can use steganography to embed data in wav files. I can convert these to ogg and back (the steganography is format independent, and can survive format conversion). What I want to do now is build in AudioBoo integration. Uploading to AudioBoo is not a problem, retrieving the files in mp3 format is not a problem, but converting those mp3 files back to wav to perform the steg. extraction is. Does anyone know where I should start?
