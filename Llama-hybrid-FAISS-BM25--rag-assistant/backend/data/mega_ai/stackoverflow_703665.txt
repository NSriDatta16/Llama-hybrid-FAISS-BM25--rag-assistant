There are tools out there, Jumble for one, that perform analysis through branch coverage, by mutating your code to see if your test fails for all different permutations. Directly from their website: Jumble is a class level mutation testing tool that works in conjunction with JUnit. The purpose of mutation testing is to provide a measure of the effectiveness of test cases. A single mutation is performed on the code to be tested, the corresponding test cases are then executed. If the modified code fails the tests, then this increases confidence in the tests. Conversely, if the modified code passes the tests this indicates a testing deficiency.
