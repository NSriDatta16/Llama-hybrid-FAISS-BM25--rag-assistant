ASP.Net converts 401 to 302 error codes

I have a custom handler and in some cases, I want to indicate to the user agent that they are not authorized (Http Error Code 401) if (!IsAuthorized(context)) { context.Response.StatusCode = 401; context.Response.End(); return; } When I access my handler, I am actually getting a 302 and a redirect to the forms authentication page. Is there a way to stop this from happening?
