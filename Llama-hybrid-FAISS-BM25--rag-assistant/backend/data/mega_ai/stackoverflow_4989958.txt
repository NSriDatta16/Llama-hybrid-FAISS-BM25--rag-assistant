Javascript event file retrieval

I'm currently having a problem with events in Javascript. I'll first try to explain what I'm trying to achieve. I want to draw a canvas based on the contents of a file retrieved in the element. I was trying to do an OOP based design for this. I want to create a widget that can do this. So first, I have created my widget class: Dicom5.Rendering.Viewer = function(){ var viewer = document.createElement('div','dicom5-rendering-viewer'); var fileOpener = new Dicom5.Rendering.FileOpener(); var canvas = new Dicom5.Rendering.Canvas(); viewer.appendChild(fileOpener.render()); viewer.appendChild(canvas.render()); this.render = function(){ return viewer; } }; I also have the following two classes FileOpener and Canvas Dicom5.Rendering.Canvas = function(){ var canvas; canvas = document.createElement('canvas'); this.render = function(){ return canvas; } }; and the fileOpener Dicom5.Rendering.FileOpener = function(){ var fileOpener = document.createElement('input'); fileOpener.setAttribute('id','dicom5-rendering-fileopener'); fileOpener.setAttribute('type','file'); fileOpener.onchange = function(){ **HERE !! I want to change my canvas object** } this.render = function(){ return fileOpener; } }; So as you can see I have one object, that has a Canvas object and a FileOpener object. I want to change the instantiated Canvas object with the instantiated FileOpener object. What would be the best way to do this?
