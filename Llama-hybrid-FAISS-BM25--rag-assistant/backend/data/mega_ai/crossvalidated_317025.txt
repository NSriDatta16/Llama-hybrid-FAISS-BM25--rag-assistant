If you meta-analyze a mean differences with weights of $n$ instead of by $1/\text{SE}^2$ (inverse variance) - assuming groups of equal size are being compared - this gets you an appropriate average effect estimate under the assumption that variability is the same across studies. I.e. the weights would be proportional to the ones you do would use, if the standard errors were all exactly $2\hat{\sigma}/\sqrt{n}$ for a standard deviation $\sigma$ that is assumed to be identical across trials. You will no longer get a meaningful overall standard error or confidence interval for your overall estimate though, because you are throwing away the information $\hat{\sigma}$ on the sampling variability. Also note that if groups are not of equal size $n$ is not the correct weight, because the the standard error for the difference of two normal distributions is $\sqrt{\sigma^2_1/n_1 + \sigma^2_2/n_2}$ and this only simplifies to $2\sigma/\sqrt{n}$, if $n_1=n_2=n/2$ (plus $\sigma=\sigma_1=\sigma_2$). You could of course impute the missing standard errors under the assumption that $\sigma$ is the same across the studies. Then studies without a reported standard error have the same underlying variability as the average of the studies, for which you know it and that's easy to do. Another thought is that using untransformed US dollars or US dollars per unit might or might not be problematic. Sometimes it can be desirable to use e.g. a log-transformation to meta-analyze and then to back-transform afterwards.
