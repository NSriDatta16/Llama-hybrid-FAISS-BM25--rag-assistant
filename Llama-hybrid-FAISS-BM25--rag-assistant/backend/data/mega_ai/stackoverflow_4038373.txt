How do I control the TimeZone of events returned by the .NET Google Calendar API?

I have the following code for use in my asp.net website: CalendarService service = new CalendarService("mycalendar"); EventQuery query = new EventQuery(); query.Uri = new Uri(group.GroupEventsURL); query.SingleEvents = true; query.SortOrder = CalendarSortOrder.ascending; query.ExtraParameters = "orderby=starttime"; query.NumberToRetrieve = 50; query.TimeZone = "America/Chicago"; EventFeed feed = service.Query(query); Which produces the following URL: http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/TRIMMEDgroup.calendar.google.com/private-TRIMMED/full?max-results=50&orderby=starttime&ctz=America%2FChicago&sortorder=ascending&singleevents=true According to the documentation (emphasis mine), I expect the Times in each EventEntry to be in the Central time zone: ctz: The current timezone. If not specified, times are returned in the calendar time zone. Times in the resulting feed will be represented in this timezone . Replace all spaces with underscores (e.g. "ctz=America/Los_Angeles"). But my server is hosted in Arizona, so (for now) all of the dates on the calendar are two hours earlier than they should be. Am I doing something wrong? How do I get the dates in the feed to be in the Central time zone even though the server is in Arizona? I do not plan on moving my hosting any time soon, but since Arizona does not participate in Daylight Savings Time, I cannot simply add two hours to every date.
