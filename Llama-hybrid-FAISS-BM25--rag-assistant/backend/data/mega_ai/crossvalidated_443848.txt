Estimating $\mu$ using the sample mean is only a reasonable option if $\beta \equiv 0$ , i.e., a symmetrical distribution. Otherwise the sample average, $\bar{x}$ , is severely biased for $\mu$ , the location parameter -- not to be confused with the expected value of a stable distribution, $E(X)$ , which is $\neq \mu$ if $\beta \neq 0$ and $\alpha (for $\alpha = 2$ , distribution is always a Normal distribution independent of $\beta$ ). For what follows I assume $\beta = 0$ . For skewed distributions your best bet is probably a likelihood based optimization / posterior calculation. For $\alpha a natural candidate to estimate the location in a more robust manner than the sample mean, is to use the sample median. Another alternative is to use heavy-tail Lambert W x Normal distribution estimates and use $\hat{\mu}$ from the Lambert W x Normal fit as an estimate of the location of your data (from the stable distribution). See an example of this here , which compares estimators for the location of a Cauchy ( $\alpha = 1$ ) -- including sample mean, sample median, and the Lambert W x Normal options. To address your specific question about $\alpha I replicated the simulation from that post, and simulated samples from a stable distribution with $\alpha = 0.75$ and $\mu = 0$ . Results show that in this case Lambert W x Normal estimators even outperform the sample median. library(alphastable) library(LambertW) LocationEstimators These functions can now be used to run the simulation study with $n = 100$ replications and a sample size of 1000 each. # Simulate and look at bias, std dev, and MSE nsim As expected, sample mean is useless; median and Lambert W estimators all provide (effectively) unbiased estimates of $\mu = 0$ , with Lambert W MLE A violin plot of these 3 estimators makes this clear as well: library(ggplot2) library(reshape2) theme_set(theme_bw(18)) est.m
