argument error c#

I'm doing an example from the book: The Complete Reference C# 3.0 by Herbert Schildt. It's about writing in Console.WriteLine with arguments. Here is the example: I tried this but I was getting an error: Project1.exe has encountered a problem and needs to be close. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Please tell Microsoft about this problem. Send Error Report or Don't Send. And if I click, I get another error in the command prompt. "Unhandled Exception: System.Format.Exception input string was not in a correct format. at System.Text.StringBuilder.AppendFormatError() at System.Text.StringBuilder.AppendFormat(IFormatProvider provider,String Format, Object[]args) at System.IO.TextWriter.WriteLine(String format, Object arg0) at System.IO.TextWriter.SyncTextWriter.WriteLine(String format, Object arg0) At Example2.Main() in D:\myPath I'm not sure if the book has some error or is it my code? I would appreciate your help. Thanks One of the easiest ways to specify a format is to describe a template that WriteLine( ) will use. To do this, show an example of the format that you want, using #s to mark the digit positions. You can also specify the decimal point and commas. For example, here is a better way to display 10 divided by 3: Console.WriteLine("Here is 10/3: {0:#.##}", 10.0/3.0); The output from this statement is shown here: Here is 10/3: 3.33 Btw this is my code looks like: static void Main() { Console.WriteLine("Here is 10/3: {0:#.##)", 10); }
