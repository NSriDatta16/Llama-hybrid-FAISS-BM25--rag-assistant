lightbox dynamic image retrieval

I am constructing a lighbox gallery, currently experimenting with FancyBox (http://fancybox.net) and ColorBox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox). By default you have to include a link to the large version of the image so that the Lightbox can display it. However, I am wanting to have the image link URLs pointing to a script rather than directly to the image file. So for example, instead of: I want to do: The above URL points to a function: public function actionPhotos($view) { $photo=Photo::model()->find('name=:name', array(':name'=>$view)); if(!empty($photo)) { $user=$photo->user; $this->renderPartial('_photo', array('user'=>$user, 'photo'=>$photo, true)); } } At some point in the future the function will also update the view count of the image. Now this approach is working to an extent - most images load up but some do not load up (the lightbox gets displayed in a malformed state). I think the reason for this is because it is not processing the function quick enough. For example when I click the "next" button it needs to go to the URL, process the function and retreive/output the response. Does anybody know how I can get this working properly?
