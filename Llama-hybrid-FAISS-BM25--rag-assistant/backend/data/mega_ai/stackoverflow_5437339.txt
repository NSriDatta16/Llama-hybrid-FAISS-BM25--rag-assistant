Almost every (or every?) collection in Magento inherits from a Varien Data Collection . A collection is a special object that holds objects of another type. There's no method for merging collections, but you can add additional items of the appropriate type to the collection. Code like this should get you where you want to go, although there's probably more efficient ways to loop and do the actual merging. $collection1 = Mage::getModel('catalog/category')->load(148)->getProductCollection(); $collection2 = Mage::getModel('catalog/category')->load(149)->getProductCollection(); //load an empty collection (filter-less collections will auto-lazy-load everything) $merged = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->getCollection()->addFieldToFilter('entity_id',-1); //add items from the first collection foreach($collection1 as $item) { $merged->addItem($item); } //add items from the second collection foreach($collection2 as $item) { //magento won't let you add two of the same thing to a collection //so make sure the item doesn't already exist if(!$merged->getItemById($item->getId())) { $merged->addItem($item); } } //lets make sure we got something foreach($merged as $product) { var_dump($product->getName()); }
