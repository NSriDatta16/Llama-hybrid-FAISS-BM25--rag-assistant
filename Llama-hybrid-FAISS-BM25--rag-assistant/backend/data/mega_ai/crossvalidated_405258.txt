Which classifier to use?

I have a scenario in which I have many (100k+) files containing lines of text. I would like to know if the text contains "Storage" information and the type of it (If available). However, the text in these files are unstructured. "Storage" information has no fixed format. They can range from: "Store at X to Y degree Celsius." "Keep at room temperature" "Refrigerate at X temperature." "Freeze at X temperature" and combinations of the above. There might also be spelling error in the data. Eg, Store might become "Stor",Stoer","Sto" or even be absent. Is there way to use machine learning classifiers to find files containing "Storage" information and split them into the categories: Room Temperature Refrigerate Freeze I have seen a few classifier algorithms but have no idea how to get started with them. I am new to machine learning.
