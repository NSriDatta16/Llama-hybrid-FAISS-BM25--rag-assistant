How to edit an default Xcode template?

When I create an NSObject subclass, I always get an empty implementation. There are some things I always put in my code like pragma marks and -dealloc methods. I prefer to just delete stuff that I don't need over writing it with typos from scratch every time I need it. I need -dealloc and -init almost always, but they don't ship with the default template. Is there a way to customize what's in there?
