Well, the preincrement operation ("++x") returns the result of the variable after the increment has been done, whereas the postincrement operation ("x++") returns the result of the variable before the increment has been done. The compiler COULD (and strong emphasis on COULD) optimize easier using the preincrement (because only one value is effectively being used; in the postincrement case, there are two values; the value of the variable before the increment, and the value of the variable after; the compiler might be able to optimize the preincrement to use the storage that contains the variable itself). Note that this is very much theoretical; it very much depends on your compiler optimization. In most situations, and for most purposes, they'll effectively be equivalently efficient.
