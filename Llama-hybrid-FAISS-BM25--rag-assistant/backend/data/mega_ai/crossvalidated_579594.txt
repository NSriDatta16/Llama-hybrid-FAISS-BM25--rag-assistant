To elaborate on @Bayesian's (correct) answer, consider a logistic regression model where cases of diabetes ( $y$ ) are predicted by sugar intake ( $x$ ). The model learns $P(y = 1 | x) = \text{logit}^{-1}(\alpha + \beta x)$ - that is, $P(\text{Diabetes}|\text{Sugar intake})$ , but since it doesn't learn the distribution of sugar intakes in the population, $P(x)$ , it can't generate samples from the distribution of diabetes cases, $P(y)$ .
