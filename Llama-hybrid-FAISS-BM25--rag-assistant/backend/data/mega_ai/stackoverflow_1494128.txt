i'm not sure to understand how you go about it, just being lazy trying to figure out your code :) but i've noted that you use the startDrag function , which i personally tend to avoid. lee brimelow has a very good tutorial about an OOP scrollbar where he explains a way around this. granted, this hasn't got much to do with video but i now used this technique anytime i need to register some MouseMove events. in any case, i really think it would solve your 'jumping' problem. the basic idea is to register your mouse position on mouse down , taking account of any possible offsets , then add a listener to mouse move events which will update any scrubber info you may need... hope this helps! check http://www.gotoandlearn.com/play?id=71
