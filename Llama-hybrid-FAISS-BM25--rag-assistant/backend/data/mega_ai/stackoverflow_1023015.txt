In the beginning it may seem quicker to start without a framework. I compare it to loading a dishwasher. You'll have to do the work the work sooner, or later. Either you load the dishes in an organized way beforehand, or take the time to sort it out when taking it out. As you build, deploy, extend your project, you will increasingly wish for / start building in ways to increase code re-use, structure, and framework. See if there's a framework that you can start quickly building with. I think it's worthwhile.
