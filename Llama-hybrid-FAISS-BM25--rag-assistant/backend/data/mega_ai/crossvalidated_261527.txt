Testing heteroscedasticity in seasonal ARIMA model

I have estimated seasonal ARIMA(1,2,1)x(0,0,2) and then to test for heteroscedasicity transformed it to lm object with x , with m = auto.arima(ts.loggdpq,stepwise=FALSE) and ts.loggdpq is quaterrly, logged gdp data. Testing for heteroscedasicity with bptest(x) resulted with studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: x BP = 3.429e-30, df = 0, p-value meaning that I can't reject the null hypothesis. Does this mean that my model is not effective? Should I transform it to ARCH(q) model?
