Are multiple classes in a single file recommended?

Possible Duplicate: How many Python classes should I put in one file? Coming from a C++ background I've grown accustomed to organizing my classes such that, for the most part, there's a 1:1 ratio between classes and files. By making it so that a single file contains a single class I find the code more navigable. As I introduce myself to Python I'm finding lots of examples where a single file contains multiple classes. Is that the recommended way of doing things in Python? If so, why? Am I missing this convention in the PEP8 ?
