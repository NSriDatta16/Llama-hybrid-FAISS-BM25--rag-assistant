Is it valid/relevant to do PCA on data which has multiple independent variables?

I have lots of data on the effects of different drugs on ~100 cell variables, and want to perform PCA on the data to reduce its dimensionality so the effects can be more easily visualised. The thing is I have results for different drugs at 3 different concentrations. Should I perform PCA on the effects of all drugs at one concentration, then at a different concentration, thus having only 1 independent variable for each PCA? Or alternatively should I do PCA on all the data, having identified and discarded outliers? Should I include all control data in the PCA as well?
