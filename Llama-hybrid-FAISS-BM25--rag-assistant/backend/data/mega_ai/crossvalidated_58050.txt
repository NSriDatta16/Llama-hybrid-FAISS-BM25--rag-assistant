Measuring some of the patients more than once

I'm conducting a clinical study where I determine an anthropometrical measure of the patients. I know how to handle the situation where I have one measure per patient: I make a model, where I have a random sample $X_1,\dots,X_n$ from some density $f_\theta$, and I do the usual stuff: write the likelihood of the sample, estimate parameters, determine confidence sets, and test hypothesis, or even do some Bayesian analysis if the boss isn't watching. ;-) My problem is that for some patients we have more than one measure, because we believe that it is a good idea to have more than one researcher handling the measuring device, when this is possible (some times we have just one researcher working at the clinic). Therefore, for some patients we have one measure made by one researcher, for other sample units we have two measures made by two different researchers, and so on. The measure in question is the thickness of a specific skin fold. My question: which kind of statistical model is adequate for my problem?
