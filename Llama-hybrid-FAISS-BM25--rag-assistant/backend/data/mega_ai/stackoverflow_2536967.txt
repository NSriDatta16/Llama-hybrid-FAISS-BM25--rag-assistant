To get second p element of div with class box you'd do this: var paragraph = null; var divs = document.findElementsByTagName('div'); for (var i = 0; i 1) paragraph = paragraphs[1]; break; } } The paragraph would then be in the paragraph variable (or null if it wasn't found). However you can do this much easier with a library such as jQuery : var paragraph = $('div.box p:eq(1)');
