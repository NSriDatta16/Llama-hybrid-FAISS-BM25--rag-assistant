You're trying to load a page fragment rather than the whole page. If you dig deeper into the documentation, you'll see you need to change your targetPage variable just slightly. var targetPage = $(this).attr('href'); targetPage += " #content-wrap"; This will change the targetPage variable to something along the lines of http://site.url #content-wrap and will fetch the contents of the #content-wrap element rather than the whole page. See the Loading Page Fragments section of the .load() documentation for more.
