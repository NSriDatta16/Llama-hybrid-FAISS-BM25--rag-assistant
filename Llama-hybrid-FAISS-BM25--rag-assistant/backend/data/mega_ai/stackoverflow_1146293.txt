If leading and trailing spaces are unimportant, then I'd trim them off before inserting or updating. There should then be no unnecessary spaces on a select. This brings some advantages. Less space required in a row means that potentially more rows can exist in a data page which leads to faster data retrieval (less to retrieve). Also, you are not constantly trimming data on SELECTs. (Uses the DRY [don't repeat yourself] principle here)
