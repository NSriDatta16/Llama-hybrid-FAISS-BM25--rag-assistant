I followed the guide at http://sharebear.co.uk/blog/2009/01/21/code-coverage-maven-projects-netbeans/ and it did work for me, using Netbeans 6.8. One mistake I made was to create a first dummy unit test case with only an assert(true), and not accessing any of the instrumented code. This produced no coverage.ec file, which got me stumped for a while.
