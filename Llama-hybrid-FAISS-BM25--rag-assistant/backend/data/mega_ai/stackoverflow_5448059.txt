You seem to have the obvious bases covered - @Stellaire's additions included. Billing/renewal, client login for feature additions/removals, usage logs, signups, etc. - I think you've pretty much got the boilerplate set of admin tools covered. --- a user forum or bug-tracking-type forum may benefit you AND your customers (at least they'll be able to see you're addressing various issues, etc.) Your customers are going to be your best (and most profitable) source for a conclusive answer. Before pushing it out into the wild, do some research with an organization (or 3) that you believe will be your bread-n-butter demographic. Things are sure to change when a variety of people/business models start using your product. You may get lucky right out of the gate. Or your app may seem lame in your new customer's eyes - as what IS missing is critical for whatever reason THEY deem. Not knowing what the app does, makes it hard to say what you're going to need (or wish you had) until you've got some real client feedback. Huge difference between enterprise calendar/planning software versus a project management application.
