Using a "hyperlink" effect in Winforms applications

What do people think about using pretend hyperlinks, in Winforms apps? Example: In my example you would click "into" the Organisation record card for Acme Corp Inc or "into" the details of the next appointment. If we ignore, for the moment, how the user edits the Organisation or adds/removes an appointment, is it a sensible UI in Winforms to use blue & underline to signify click here and i'll take you to a new screen As in: TextBox1.Font = New Font("Blah", 8.25!, FontStyle.Underline etc TextBox1.ForeColor = Color.Blue Not forgetting: TextBox1.Cursor = Cursors.Hand This would be for a reasonably rich application (for example a CRM) where you have a lot of different kinds of screens and the user is navigating between all sorts of records. And you want to show the user that he can navigate between detail views, grids, children, parents, siblings etc. Pros: it's familiar to users and it's obvious, without being obtrusive or taking up any screen real estate easy to implement the often-used alternative (a button with an icon or even just three dots [...]) looks a bit old-fashioned, doesn't work very well in grids, and takes up space Cons: with all the flexibility and control you have in a Winforms front end, you should be able to devise a smart ui without needing to borrow from browsers (maybe???) these pseudo links won't behave as true anchor tags (there won't be any "visited" [ie. turn me purple if I've already been in here] or "hover" behaviour and no open-in-new-tab features, without a lot of work) ... potentially annoying to users? detracts from genuine hyperlinks (as in email addresses etc) - these no longer stand out as links "out to the internet" (to the browser, to email client) ... very minor issue?
