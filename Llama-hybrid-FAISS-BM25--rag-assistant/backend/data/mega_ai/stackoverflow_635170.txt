SWT DropTargetListener has empty event data under Mac OS X

I'm currently experiencing a weird platform inconsistency between Mac OS X and Windows/Linux. I've implemented an SWT DropTargetListener and tried to analyze the data dropped in the dragEnter method. Unfortunately, the data attribute of the TransferData contained in the DropTargetEvent parameter is always null on OS X (but becomes valid in DropTargetListener.drop method where it's too late to give user feedback). It works fine under Windows and Linux. Can anybody help me out? Or is this a known limitation of SWT DND under OS X?
