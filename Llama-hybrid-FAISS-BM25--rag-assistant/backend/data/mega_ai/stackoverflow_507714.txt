Now that my flame retardent suit is safely secured, I can say it: I dislike OOP. The central problem I have with it is that it tries to come up with a single taxonomy in which every unit of functionality truly belongs. There are a couple of problems with this. First, producing a good taxonmy is hard . People suck at creating them. Secondly, I am not convinced that you can actually structure a sensible, maintainable, hierarchy that will withstand change in a project containing a lot of entities; the whole practice of refactoring is basically acknowledging the difficulty of creating large, all incompassing taxanomies. Actually, I think that OOP is over-engineered. Everything you can do with OOP can be done with higher-order functions (HOFs). HOFs are much more elegant, much more flexible solution to the same problems that OOP tries to address. So if you're asking of another way to do OOP style stuff, HOFs are probably the closest alternative technology that has a similiar level of flexibility.
