Are there any Simple and Clean Methods to implement Maps (Google or otherwise) in RoR 3?

I'm looking into building a group work app for my final year project next year. One of the core parts is organising group meetings. I plan to make this as powerful as possible and adding a map can help get rid of excuses such as "I didn't know where it was". I have been unable to find any simple solutions to embed maps into my Rails apps so far. An important issue is I need Rails 3 Compatibility. What are your suggestions? Gems, plugins or even something totally different?
