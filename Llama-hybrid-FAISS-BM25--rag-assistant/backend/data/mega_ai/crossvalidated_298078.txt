What are the consequences of including unnecessary random effects?

In mixed models (GLMMs), random effects are often used to account for non-independence between observations e.g. of the same patient, or of animals from the same farm. I sometimes see multiple random effects being included just because there might be an effect. What are the consequences of including multiple random effects if they don't explain additional variance? I suspect it will affect the degrees of freedom and make the test overly conservative. At least in p-value based hypothesis testing. If several models are compared in an AIC framework but all have the same random effect structure will there be any effect on which fixed effect structure is identified as best? Will the estimates of fixed and/or random effects be biased or their standard errors increased? Will model convergence be impeded? And hence is the inference from a bayesian/MCMC model such as MCMCglmm (in R) likely compromised?
