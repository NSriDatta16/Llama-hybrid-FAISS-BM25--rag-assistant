Can I convert the feature values of a new observation into factor values given a prior factor analysis?

I'm pretty new to factor analysis, but am able to go through the basic process including doing the initial analysis, getting the varimax rotation, and pca scores for each observation in R. In my specific case, I am reducing 16 features into 3 factors. However, if I wanted to look at a new observation (i.e., not one in which I conducted the initial analysis) with the aforementioned 16 features, how could I get its values in terms of the 3 factors obtained in the earlier analysis? TIA
