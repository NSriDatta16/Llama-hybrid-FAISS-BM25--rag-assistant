In the machine learning terminology you are refererring to a classification problem and not to a regression problem. The difference being that in classification problems the response (dependent) variable is discrete while in regression problems your response variable is continuous. Having said this, you may convert a regression problem into a classification problem as follows. Map your continuous response (obtained from a regression problem) into the [0,1] inteval, by means of a suitable transformation, such as the logistic function. In the binary case, classification is then done by means of a sgn(x-0.5) function, where x is the transformed continuous response obtained from the regression model. In a multiple categories classification setting, you may perform one binary regression model for each category and choose the category with the highest response.
