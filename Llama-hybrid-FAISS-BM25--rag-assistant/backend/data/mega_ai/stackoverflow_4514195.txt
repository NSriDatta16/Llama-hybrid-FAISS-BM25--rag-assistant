Android Sql or XML storage question

I have about 100 xml files on my sd card the xml files each contain about 30 elements each and are 5KB each in size. I do not need to run any complex queries (1 element in the xml file is a link to another xml file is about as complex as it gets) I am an android newbie and have a steep learning curve ahead so was hoping to leave learning the sqlite until later. My plan was to read each file into a DOM and just get the elements as needed (will only ever need 1 file at a time and 1 DOM instance at a time). A cunning plan yes/no? Do you know if there any advantages in this scenario to putting the xml into an sqllite database ? If you have any thoughts please reply Thanks Ste
