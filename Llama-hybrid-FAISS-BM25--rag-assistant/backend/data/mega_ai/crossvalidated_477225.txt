Assumptions for machine learning algorithms

Every machine learning assumes that data has some characteristics like in linear regression, the features should not correlated and the variance in the error is constant, etc. Is there a reference that summarizes the assumptions of each algorithm or at least the common ones like SVM, neural networks, trees and random forests?
