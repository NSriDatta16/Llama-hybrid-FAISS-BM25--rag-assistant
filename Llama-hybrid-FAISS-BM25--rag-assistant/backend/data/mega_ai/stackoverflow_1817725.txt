Importance of table alias(a glimpse from the whole) 1) A shorthand notation that is handy to use if you have to reference the table(or view) again and again(table alias).It's much easier than typing the full table name each time. e.g. select tableA.col1 , tableA.Col2,tableB.Col1,tableC.Col2 from tableA join tableB on tableA.id = tableB.id join tableC on tableC.id = tableB.id and tableC.id = tableA.id Can be rephrased as select a.col1 , a.Col2,b.Col1,c.Col2 from tableA a join tableB b on a.id = b.id join tableC c on c.id = b.id and c.id = a.id 2)Removes the ambiguity of the column names 3)Improves code redeability 4)Suppose you have a derived table like SELECT col1,col2 FROM (select * from mytable where col3 = 'somevalue') x in which case alias is a must Note:- Column alias gives a meaning full name to the columns e.g. select avg(col1) from mytable which gives the output as [No Column Name] ----------------- 30 can be beautify by select avg(col1) "Average" from mytable or select avg(col1) AS "Average" from mytable Output: Avegare ------------- 30 However, the AS keyword is optional. Hope this gives you some insight as to why we should go with table alias
