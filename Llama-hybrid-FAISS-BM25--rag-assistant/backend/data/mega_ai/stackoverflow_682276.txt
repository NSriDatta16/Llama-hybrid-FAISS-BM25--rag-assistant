If you have the image processing toolbox then you can use blkproc to process nxm blocks of your image using custom defined functions. Here is an example function Ip = imageProcessed(II,blockSize) % FUNCTION imageProcessed calculates average value of blocks of size nxm % blocks if nargin 1, % blkproc requires a grayscale image % convert II to gray scale if it is RGB. II=rgb2gray(II) end % Custom average function. myAveFun = @(x) ones(size(x))*sum(x(:))/length(x(:)); % use blkproc to process image Ip = blkproc(II,[blockSize(1), blockSize(2)],myAveFun); end Note: As of MATLAB 2009b's Image Processing Toolbox, blkproc was depcrecated and replaced with blockproc (see R2099b section here ). So the last two lines could be changed to: myAveFun = @(blkstrct) ones(size(blkstrct.data))*mean(blkstrct.data(:)) Ip = blockproc(II,blockSize,myAveFun);
