Different Methods for Forecasting

Data - Monthly Rainfall of a region for the past 20 years Objective - To Forecast for the next 2 years I am new to time series forecasting and I am looking for suggestions on various methods that I can use in order to forecast from the above-mentioned collected data. I have already used a SARIMA model and predictions have been done using R. Now I need other different methods that I can use with this data for forecasting and choose the better performing model among them. I apologize in case of the lack of clarity in the question put forth.
