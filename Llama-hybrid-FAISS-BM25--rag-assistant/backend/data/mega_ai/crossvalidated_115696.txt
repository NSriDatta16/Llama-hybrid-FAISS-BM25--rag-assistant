A useful and specific documentation from Gregory B. Anderson , titled PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS IN R AN EXAMINATION OF THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AND METHODS TO PERFORM PCA has given more information on this topic. Updated link (7 Jan 2021). The following two paragraph were extracted from the introduction: In R there are two general methods to perform PCA without any missing values: (1) spectral decomposition (R-mode [also known as eigendecomposition]) and (2) singular value decomposition (Q-mode; R Development Core Team 2011). Both of these methods can be performed longhand using the functions eigen (R-mode) and svd (Q-mode), respectively, or can be performed using the many PCA functions found in the stats package and other additional available packages. The spectral decomposition method of analysis examines the covariances and correlations between variables, whereas the singular value decomposition method looks at the covariances and correlations among the samples. While both methods can easily be performed within R, the singular value decomposition method (i.e., Q-mode) is the preferred analysis for numerical accuracy (R Development Core Team 2011). This document focuses on comparing the different methods to perform PCA in R and provides appropriate visualization techniques to examine normality within the statistical package. More specifically this document compares six different functions either created for or can be used for PCA: eigen, princomp, svd, prcomp, PCA, and pca. Throughout the document the essential R code to perform these functions is embedded within the text using the font Courier New and is color coded using the technique provided in Tinn-R ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinn-r ). Additionally, the results from the functions are compared using simulation procedure to see if the different methods differ in the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and scores provided from the output.
