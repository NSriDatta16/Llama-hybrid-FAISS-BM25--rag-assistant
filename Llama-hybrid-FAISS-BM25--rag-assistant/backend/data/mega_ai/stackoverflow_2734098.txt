The Hibernate online documentation has some very good information on mapping your classes, in particular this section on setting up subclasses: http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/core/manual/en/html/mapping.html#mapping-declaration-subclass You want to pay special attention to using discriminator values and such if you are storing your sub-classed objects in a common table. You might also consider picking up a copy of Java Persistence with Hibernate, which is considered the "Hibernate Bible" amongst my co-workers. http://www.amazon.com/Java-Persistence-Hibernate-Christian-Bauer/dp/1932394885/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1272501916&sr=8-1
