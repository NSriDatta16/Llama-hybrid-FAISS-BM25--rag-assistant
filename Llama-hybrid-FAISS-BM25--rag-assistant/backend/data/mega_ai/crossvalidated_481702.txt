What is the best method for time series forecast for a time frame longer than data available

I am very new to data science, my question is what model should I use to predict for, let's say, the next 2 years if I only have data available for less than a year? From what I read online, most models require to lag the data for the same time frame as I want to predict it, which I cannot do in this case, any suggestions?
