There is no given best threshold. It depends on your cost of false-negative and false-positive and your plan of operation. Example: Some model classifying either GOOD or BAD investments could be applied with different thresholds when used by a banker or venture capitalists. The careful banker would prioritize to have a very low FALSE-GOOD to never loose money. The daring venture capitalist would accept a higher FALSE-GOOD to avoid ever missing out on big investment opportunities(FALSE-BAD). ROC-plot shows the "sensitivity" vs "1-specificity" for any possible threshold. The AUC could be understood as summarizing the ' average ' classification performance over any threshold. AUC is of course not an optimal metric if you already have chosen one specific threshold. In practice you would probably: build a model first investigate your cross validated ROC-plot wonder how to utilize such predictions decide for a hard threshold (or stay in probability land)
