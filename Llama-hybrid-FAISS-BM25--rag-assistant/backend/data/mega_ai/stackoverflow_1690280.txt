iPhone Unlock Slider With Mootools?

I try to make a slider similar to the iPhone unlock Slider, that forwards to a linked site, when complete, and returns to its initial position when the slider wasn't dragged to the end. This is not meant to be a iPhone webapp, i just want to put this to a general website as a effect. So far I've tried those two tests, but i'm stuck on both. The first is: // First Example var el = $('slideOne'), // Create the new slider instance var sliderOne = new Slider(el, el.getElement('.slider'), { steps: 20, // There are 35 steps range: [8], // Minimum value is 8 }).set(20); Problem here is that i can't fire an event on (0) not on (20) aswell, i tried onComplete but this fires the function immediatly after the page is load!? The second $$('.textslider').setStyle('opacity', 0.8); $('slider1').makeDraggable({ snap: 0, container: 'slideOne', droppables: '.slidedrop1', onDrop: function(element, droppable, event){ if (!droppable); else console.log(element, 'dropped on', droppable, location = 'index.php/kredite.html', event); }, }); Problem here is , that the droppable don't work as fine as i hoped, sometimes i move the the slider on the invisible droppable, which indicates if the slider is dragged to the end, and nothing happens, sometimes it works fine, i think this may be due the different position of the cursor on the slider. and i can't get it done that it is only possible to slide horizontal , since it is that drag not the slider function, so i think this won be the proper way. On both Tests, i didn't figured out who i could return the slider back to its initial position, with a slide Effect. Are there some mootools cracks around who maybe could help me with this? Thanks already for the great ideas of y'all.
