Placing code behind for a DNN page

I'm having troubles finding where I can put code-behind for my dnn pages. For example: MyPage.ascx already has which it needs in order to be cast to a skin. However, I want to be able to add a VB function that is executed on Page_Load, so I made my own code-behind file. But I can't take out the current control (one referencing skin.vb) to put in my own, and you can't have more than one Control. I also tried embedding the code in a tag, but I need to do some Imports which give me an error saying they must be declared at the beginning of the file etc etc... Anyone know how to properly add code-behind for DNN pages?
