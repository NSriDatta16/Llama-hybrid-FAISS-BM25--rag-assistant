I would advise against using z -scores for markedly skewed data. For a skewed distribution, both the mean and the standard deviation are affected by the skew in a way that make the z -score results less representative of what you're trying to convey. I think a more direct way of indicating what you want is to use percentiles. Percentiles are in a sense robust against the skew in the distribution. You could use 50th percentile (the median), and say, for example, those above the median are "more engaged". Of course, you could also use the 75th percentile, or 90th percentile, as makes sense for your application. As an example of this application, consider a classic skewed distribution, income, in this case the distribution of U.S. income from 2010 . Note that the figure indicates the 50th (median), 75th, and 90th percentile of income. As others have mentioned, the practical interpretation of these percentiles require some caution. You can confidently say that those with an income greater than the median have a higher income than the "average household"†. But practically speaking --- and living in the U.S. ---, I wouldn't say that those with greater than the median income are "high income"‡. I also wouldn't say that those with greater than 90th percentile income are "high income". It's difficult to assess, of course, because the U.S. is highly heterogeneous in this respect, so that $100,000 a year in New York City or San Francisco may not get you a place to live, whereas in some places in the country that's a really comfortable income. † This is typical language in this application. ‡ I may have a somewhat skewed perspective since I live in New Jersey where the median income is about $80,000.
