What is the best Delphi n-tier low bandwidth technology?

I need to deploy a Delphi app in an environment that needs centralized data and file storage system (for document imaging) but has multiple branch offices with relatively poor inter connectivity. I believe a 3 tier database application is the best way to go so I can provide a rich desktop experience with relatively light-weight data transfer needs. So far I have looked briefly at Delphi Datasnap, kbmMW and Remobjects SDK. It seems that kbmMW and Remobjects SDK use the least bandwidth. Does anyone have any experience in deploying any of these technologies in a challenging environments with a significant number of users (I need to support 700+)? Thanks!
