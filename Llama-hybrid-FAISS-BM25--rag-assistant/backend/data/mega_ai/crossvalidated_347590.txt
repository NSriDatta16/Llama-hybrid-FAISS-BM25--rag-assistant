Have you performed a varimax rotation on your coefficients? If not then that might explain why they are so low. Varimax can be applied to your coefficients in MATLAB using the 'rotatefactors' command on the coefficients from your selected principle components (not all the components). So if you want to look at the varimax rotated coefficients of the first 5 principle components then the code would be: RotatedCoefficients = rotatefactors(PCACoefficients(:,5));
