Simple Jquery Question

HI there ... im am trying to create a simple Jquery within Droppable. The page works and allows me to drop a video onto the selected droppable area (div class="roundedVideoDrop"), but I want to stop the user from being able to drop more than 1 video in each div, which has been created. My code for this is : $("div.roundedVideoDrop").droppable({ activeClass: 'highlight', hoverClass: 'highlight-accept', drop: function(event, ui){ if $(this).sibling('video').count() == 0 { return true; } else { return false; } What im attempting to do is to check and see if there is another sibling (i.e another within the ) if there is then the video being dragged cannot be dropped into the , otherwise it is allowed. This will not work, in fact is kicking up a parse error within Safari and I have been trying all morning to get it working but no luck. Could anyone tell me the correct way of doing it? Thanks so much
