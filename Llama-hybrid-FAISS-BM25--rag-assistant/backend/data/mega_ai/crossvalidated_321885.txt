Poisson distribution; double check method?

Using Poisson Distribution On average, 20cabs drive past your office every 30 minutes. What's the probability that 30 cabs will drive by in 1 hour? To do this, I'm using the formula $$P(x) = \frac{(e^{-u}*u^x)}{x!} $$ where u is the mean number of successes. I let u = 40 (since it's 20cabs/30 minutes) and let x=30, and got that P(x)=.0185 Is this the right approach? Thank you
