Mailing Exception logs in a live Grails webapp

I'd like my Grails web-app to send an e-mail for each exception that reaches the end-user. Basically I'm looking for a elegant way to achieve something equivalent to: try { // ... all logic/db-access/etc required to render the page is executed here ... } catch (Exception e) { sendmail("exception@example.com", "An exception was thrown while processing a http-request", e.toString); }
