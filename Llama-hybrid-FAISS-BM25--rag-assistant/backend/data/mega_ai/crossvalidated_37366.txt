There's no difference in assumptions for statistical models 1-4. Each one of those models is a form of OLS regression. The assumptions are the same. The assumptions generally relate to the central limit theorem. If your variables don't have a standard normal distribution then you most likely have a problem. Common problems: Heteroskedasticity, Multicollinearity, Autocorrelation (time series) Did this help answer your question?
