C basic datatype problem - const char * to LPCTSTR

#include "stdafx.h" #include "string.h" #include "windows.h" bool SCS_GetAgentInfo(char name[32],char version[32], char description[256], const char * dwAppVersion) { strcpy(name,gName); strcpy(version,gVersion); strcpy(description,gDescription); notify(dwAppVersion); return true; } void notify(const char * msg) { MessageBox(NULL, TEXT(msg), NULL, NULL); } I have managed to work with the first three fields fine, but I am running into issues with the const char *. I have tried passing and casting in alot of different ways, but can't get it to work. I googled around, but couldn't find much on Lmsg. I am new to alot of this. I have read around and I think it may have to do with encoding. What really confuses me is LPCTSTR is defined as a const char *, but straight typecasting doesn't give me anything from the field. I get an error that Lmsg is undeclared which I am guessing means that the Macro expansion of TEXT is causing this. How can I get this working? Doing MessageBox(NULL, (LPCTSTR)msg, NULL, NULL); instead gives me a bunch of boxes indicating it probably is referencing the wrong characters, but copying the dwAppsVersion parameter into the description shows the correct information.
