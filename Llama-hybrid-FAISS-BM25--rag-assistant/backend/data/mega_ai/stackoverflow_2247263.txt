Subsonic 3 Class Library & Winforms App Null IDataProvider BUG

I have got a class library project and a winforms app. Everything is getting geerated fine and my Winforms app references the class library but as soon as I run it and try to retreive data it comes up with dataprovider is null. The one thing to note is that I do not have a app.config in my Winforms app only in the class library. Do I need one in the Winforms app and if so what do I put in it? Thanks UPDATE: I think I have found a bug in Query\Select.cs public Select(IDataProvider provider, params string[] columns) { //_provider is null //provider is populated correctly this.sqlFragment = new SqlFragment(_provider); _provider = provider; SelectColumnList = columns; SQLCommand = this.sqlFragment.SELECT; }
