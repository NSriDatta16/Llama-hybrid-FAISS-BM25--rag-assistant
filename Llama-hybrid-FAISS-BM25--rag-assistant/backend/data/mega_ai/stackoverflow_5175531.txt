Getting the last item from a Drupal db_fetch_object

What's the best way to do this? I've been falling back onto doing a while() loop over the result and snagging the last one as it goes by, but this seems a little, um, inelegant. D7 offers some help here, but is there any advice out there for D6? Thanks!
