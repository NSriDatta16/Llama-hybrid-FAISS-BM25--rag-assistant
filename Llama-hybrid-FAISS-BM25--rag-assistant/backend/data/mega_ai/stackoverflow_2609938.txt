What happened to the "Enable Nested Modules" option in m2-eclipse?

I contribute to and implement some open source projects that use a Maven2 build system organized into several sub-modules. I've also been an Eclipse user for several years. With these projects, I have historically leveraged the maven-eclipse plugin so that Eclipse can correctly recognise library dependencies in my project. It used to be the case that -- when I set up a new workspace or project -- I would have to right-click select "Enable Dependency Management" followed by right-click "Enable Nested Modules." Once I did these things, maven & eclipse would find dependent libraries properly in my .m2 local repo. But in my most recent install of Eclipse/m2-eclipse -- Eclipse Build 20100218-1602, m2-eclipse 0.10.0.20100209-0800 (sorry, the "About" dialog doesn't provide anything better than that) -- the "Enable Nested Modules" option is missing. Nor does the project seem willing to find my nested modules without it. After much digging and some trial & error, I got the IDE to recognize my sub-modules by setting... includeModules=true In my org.maven.ide.eclipse.pref file manually. But my question is: what gives? Why did this option disappear? Is there some newer, better way that I should be using m2-eclipse to find nested modules? How are other Maven & Eclipse users dealing with this issue?
