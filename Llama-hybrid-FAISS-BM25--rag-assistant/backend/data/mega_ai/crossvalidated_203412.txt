First, as I understand the model you presented I think it is a bit different to Gelman proposal, that more looks like: A ~ Distribution(locationA) B ~ Distribution(locationB) C ~ Distribution(locationC) locationA ~ Normal(commonLocation) locationB ~ Normal(commonLocation) locationC ~ Normal(commonLocation) commonLocation ~ hyperPrior In practice, by adding this commonLocation parameter, the inferences over the parameters the 3 distributions (here locations 1, 2 and 3) are no longer independent from each other. Moreover, commonLocation tends to shrink expectational values of the parameters toward a central (generally estimated) one. In a certain sense, it works as a regularization over all the inferences making the need of correction for multiple correction not needed (as in practice we perform one single multivariate estimation accounting from the interaction between each of them through the use of model). As pointed out by the other answer, this correction does not offer any control on type I error but in most cases, Bayesian method does not offer any such control even at the single inference scale and correction for multiple comparison must be thought differently in the Bayesian setting.
