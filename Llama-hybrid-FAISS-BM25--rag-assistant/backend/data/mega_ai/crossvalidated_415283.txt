What is the Markov blanket of a deterministic variable?

The following Bayesian network contains a node which is deterministically dependent on its parents: the variable $either$ is simply the $OR$ function of its parents $tub$ and $lung$ . By the graph, the Markov blanket of $either$ is the set $\{tub, ~lung, ~xray, ~dysp, ~bronc\}$ , namely the parents, children and spouses of $either$ . But $either$ is a function of $tub$ and $lung$ , completely determined by them. It doesn't add any extra information (except being $OR$ ). It is completely independent of its children given its parents, let alone the entire network. Thus, can the Markov blanket be just $tub$ and $lung$ ? I implemented a Markov blanket finding algorithm myself (IPC-MB), and it returns only $\{tub, lung\}$ as the Markov blanket, using the G-test as a conditional independence test. But by the d-separation criterion applied on the graph of the network, that wouldn't be enough. What is the actual Markov blanket of $either$ , knowing it is a function of its parents?
