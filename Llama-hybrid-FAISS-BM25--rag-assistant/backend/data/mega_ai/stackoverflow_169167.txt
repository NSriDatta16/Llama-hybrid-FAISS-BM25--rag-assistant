In MS Sql Server, we can bastardize the standards and create a view such as: SELECT TOP 100 PERCENT * FROM TABLE ORDER BY 1 which lets us get around issues like this. Since Sybase and Sql Server share T-SQL, I'd think there's a good chance you could do that as well. Alternatively, you can set a clustered index on the field that it should be ordered by. This will force storage order, which will* return in that as "natural order". This is, admittedly, an implementation detail. The SQL standards (nor any specific vendor, AFAIK) don't guarantee ordering without an order by clause...but, hey, if you could use that, then you wouldn't be asking.
