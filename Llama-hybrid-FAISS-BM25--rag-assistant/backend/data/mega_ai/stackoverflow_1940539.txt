An alternative to using intelligent skins like substance is to create the following utility method: public final static void checkOnEventDispatchThread() { if (!SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread()) { throw new RuntimeException("This method can only be run on the EDT"); } } Call it in every method you write that is required to be on the event dispatch thread. An advantage of this would be to disable and enable system wide checks very quickly, eg possibly removing this in production. Note intelligent skins can of course provide additional coverage as well as just this.
