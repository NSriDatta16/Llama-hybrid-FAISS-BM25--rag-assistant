Correct usage of HTML5 tag

I'm writing a new webpage for a company and I have (a sane subset of) HTML5/W3C recommendations in mind. After reading the semantic meaning of , I was wondering if this was a good place to use it: 2002 Dolorem ipsum dolor sit amet in 2002, consectetur [...] Link A Link B My line of reasoning is that, yes, that represents a thematic change from section description to section links , but I'm unsure about that. Maybe "thematic change" means to have a new paragraph later on another subject, and thus my example wouldn't be "correct". What do you think? (ps.: Yes, that is CSS-styled to fit a single line and look cool)
