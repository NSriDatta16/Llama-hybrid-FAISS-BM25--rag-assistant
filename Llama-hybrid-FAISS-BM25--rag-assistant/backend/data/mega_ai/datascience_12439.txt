I'm sorry I'm not a Java user and I never worked with StanfordNLP. But I do know that the gini impurity criterion with and without decision tree were successfully applied for text classification. Moreover these tools have the ability to let you easily understand which features ( i.e. words in your case) contribute to the decision. I know that convolutional neural network are a lot apply to sentiment analysis but you will have a really hard time trying to understand the intern-behaviour of the network. I know this is not really an answer but I hope it might help :)
