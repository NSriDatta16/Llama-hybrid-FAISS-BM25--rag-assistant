Issue displaying PDF figures created with R on iOS devices

I'm making some plots in R. The resulting PDFs don't display properly on iOS devices like the iPhone. For example, here's a stock ggplot2 figure created as a PDF: library(ggplot2) mpg.eg When viewed on an iPhone, the dots in the dotplot are not displayed. See, e.g., the resulting pdf if you're on an iOS device. I understand from reading the docs that this is most likely a problem with limited font availability and the vagaries of PDF rendering on iOS, not an issue with pdf creation in R. I had thought that maybe embedding fonts in the PDF with embedFonts("figures/ios-example.pdf") would sort things out, but it doesn't. Is there something I can do to work around this iOS issue beyond just making the figure available in some other format?
