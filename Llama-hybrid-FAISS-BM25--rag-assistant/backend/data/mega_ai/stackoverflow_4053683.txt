Just found this response, it helped me out but there was one more thing that was preventing the Cache-Control: Public on my setup: if you use multiple Response.Cache.SetCacheability() like: cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.ServerAndPrivate); ... cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); calls, it is the first one winning, so subsequent calls to SetCacheability() do not overwrite the previous setting.
