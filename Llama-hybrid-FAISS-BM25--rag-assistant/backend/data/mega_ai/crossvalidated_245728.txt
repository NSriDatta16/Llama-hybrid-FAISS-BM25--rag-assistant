Alex R.'s answer is almost sufficient, but I add a few more details. In On the Markov Chain Central Limit Theorem â€“ Galin L. Jones , if you look at theorem 9, it says, If $X$ is a Harris ergodic Markov chain with stationary distribution $\pi$ , then a CLT holds for $f$ if $X$ is uniformly ergodic and $E[f^2] . For finite state spaces, all irreducible and aperiodic Markov chains are uniformly ergodic. The proof for this involves some considerable background in Markov chain theory. A good reference would be Page 32, at the bottom of Theorem 18 here . Hence, the Markov chain CLT would hold for any function $f$ that has a finite second moment. The form the CLT takes is described as follows. Let $\bar{f}_n$ be the time averaged estimator of $E_{\pi}[f]$ , then as Alex R. points out, as $n \to \infty$ , $$\bar{f}_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i) \overset{\text{a.s.}}{\to} E_\pi[f].$$ The Markov chain CLT is $$\sqrt{n} (\bar{f}_n - E_\pi[f]) \overset{d}{\to} N(0, \sigma^2), $$ where $$\sigma^2 = \underbrace{\operatorname{Var}_\pi(f(X_1))}_\text{Expected term} + \underbrace{2 \sum_{k=1}^\infty \operatorname{Cov}_\pi(f(X_1), f(X_{1+k}))}_\text{Term due to Markov chain}. $$ A derivation for the $\sigma^2$ term can be found on Page 8 and Page 9 of Charles Geyer's MCMC notes here
