Yes, unless steps are taken to compensate models will often generalize poorly to even trivial changes in the inputs, like a different microphone. One approach to generalize better, often used in deep learning, is Data Augmentation. It works by generating new training data by modifying input samples. For generalizing across different microphones, the most relevant augmentations are: changing the volume, adding noise (synthetic) and changing frequency response. Other common audio augmentations are time shifting, time stretching and mixing with real noise sources.
