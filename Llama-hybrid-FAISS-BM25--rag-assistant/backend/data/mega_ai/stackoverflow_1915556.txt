I couldn't find a decent answer last time I looked. I wanted to keep the current element selected in the grid but that wouldn't work on an ICollectionView refresh (I use MVVM and get automatic updates from the server). ScrollIntoView() was not an option for me because the currently selected item may NOT be in view. Having the CurrentChanged event firing out of control was also quite a bother. In the end, I used the Infragistics grid and it does just that out of the box. Problem solved for me. You may have a look at the DevExpress free grid. I think it had the same nice behaviour (I tested it but I can't remember the outcome).
