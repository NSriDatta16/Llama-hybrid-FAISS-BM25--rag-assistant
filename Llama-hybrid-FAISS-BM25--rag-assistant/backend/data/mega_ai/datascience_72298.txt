Data science master thesis in robotics

I am writing my data science master thesis on "Decision making with sensor fusion and machine learning in unmanned systems" What are the sub topics similar to "Collusion avoidance", "Navigation" and "Object Detection"? Are there publications about using big data in robotic systems, apart from these three?
