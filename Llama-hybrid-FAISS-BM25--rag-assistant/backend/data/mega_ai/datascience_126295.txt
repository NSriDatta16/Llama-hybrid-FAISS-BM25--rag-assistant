In my view, your labels could be classified as ordinal data. I think so because they are categories with some particular order - less or more baked chicken. Thus, the name of the task you are looking for could be ordinal regression or ordinal classification . I found a nice research using CNN (but there is a plethora of them) in an ordinal problem and it even has a comparison to a plain classification approach: Rosati, R., Romeo, L., Vargas, V. M., Gutiérrez, P. A., Hervás-Martínez, C., & Frontoni, E. (2022). A novel deep ordinal classification approach for aesthetic quality control classification. Neural Computing and Applications, 34(14), 11625-11639. You can start from this one. I hope you find it helpful.
