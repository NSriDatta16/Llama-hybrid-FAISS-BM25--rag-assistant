This is by design. All events belonging to a continuous touch (from touch down until touch up) go to the view that received the first touch down event. So you will never receive a UIControlEventTouchDragEnter unless the user moved the finger away from the control and back. To do what you want, you would have to capture the touches on the control's container view and determine manually when the touch coordinates enter your control's frame rect (possibly by calling pointInside:withEvent: for every touch you receive).
