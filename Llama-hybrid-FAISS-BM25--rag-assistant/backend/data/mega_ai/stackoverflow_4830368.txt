Drag and Drop in PyQt

I'm new to PyQt and I have a problem, search de google, PyQt docs, Mr. Summerfield's book, but was unable to find a way of sort it. I have a QListWidget and a QTableWidget all have the drag and drop enable, I use this example: http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/dragdrop/ it works fine because the text in the ListWidget goes to the TableWidget and I can further process it, but I need to pick the text immediately after it is drooped in the WidgetList without the need of click in the cell. Tried: SIGNAL("itemChanged(QTableWidgetItem*)") SIGNAL("currentItemChanged(QTableWidgetItem *,QTableWidgetItem *)") without result. If any one can help I really appreciate. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
