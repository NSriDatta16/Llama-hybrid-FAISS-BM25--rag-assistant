Use the search API and boolean OR operator. For example here is the URL for CNN Breaking News and NPR All Things Considered: http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=from%3acnnbrk+OR+from%3anpratc The query is URLEncoded so use Fiddler Tools -> Text Encode/Decode or your favorite tool to see that the correct format in plain text is: q=from:cnnbrk+OR+from:npratc Hope that helps.
