for anyone who is looking into similar questions, I have performed DBSCAN(metric using cosine similarity) on word embeddings of 50 dimensions as well as tsne 2d dimensions. For my corpus containing 1600 lines, I have exactly the same clustering groups (same number of cluster, same items in the groups, same number of noises). Sometimes theoretically the problem becomes too complex and you just have to take the engineering approach.
