Can I replace the distribution in Gaussian Process Regression with a different regression?

Sorry for the confusing title. Let me try to clarify: I have a time series of wind speeds with some missing points here and there. I want to interpolate these points and have tried mainly polynomial and spline interpolation (also weighted interpolation), but for some cases, these just did not work well. Moreover, these interpolation methods do not take into account what a reasonable wind speed value range would be. Looking into Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), that seems to basically do what I want and uses an underlying Gaussian distribution for the regression / interpolation. What I am now wondering is if it is possible to use the underlying principle of GPR with a distribution different than Gaussian distribution (e.g. Weibull distribution would make a lot of sense for wind speeds). If I understood it correctly, the used kernel is independant of the distribution, so the kernel should not be a problem here. So, would it be possible to simply replace the distribution for this method? Or is it simply not possible for some mathematical reason? I have a quite weak mathematical understanding of the GPR, so that is entirely possible. The Wiki article on the topic was pretty hard to understand for me, so I would appretiate it if you could include a simple-to-understand explanation in your answers. Thanks a lot in advance!
