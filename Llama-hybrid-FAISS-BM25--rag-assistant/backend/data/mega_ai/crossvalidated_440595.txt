t-sne embedding to medium-dimensions (e.g. 100 dimensions)?

I am using t-sne on 252 dimensional data to embed to lower-dimensions. I am curious to know if it is academically justifiable to embed it into medium dimensions such as 100 dimensions, or 80 dimensions, instead of 2 dimensions. I have read many examples of t-sne that embeds high-dimensional data to 2 dimensions for plotting. However, I haven't seen much examples of embedding data from 252 dimensions to 100 dimensions. Can we academically justify embedding to medium-dimensions(e.g. 100 dimensions) using t-sne?
