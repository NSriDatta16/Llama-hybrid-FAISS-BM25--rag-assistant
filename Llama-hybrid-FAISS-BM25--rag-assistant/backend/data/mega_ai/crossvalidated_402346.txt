How do I deal with `NA` in a numeric vector when they provide information?

I have a dataframe with variables days to first booking and booked . Booked is boolean and indicates whether a room has been booked. Days to first booking will show the number of days from today until the first booking, except in cases where there are no bookings in which case it is NA . I want to use those variables as part of a logistic regression, but I don't know how to deal with the NA . I don't want to get rid of the numeric altogether because it provides valuable information.
