A simple approach to do that would be using a sliding window. More specifically: You train a CNN or your classifier against $x \times x$ sized logos. (Maybe, you could add an extra class for random images as well) Your images are larger than $x \times x$, so you will create a sliding window sized $x \times x$ to go all over your image. The sliding window will be used as input in your classifier of step 1. Therefore, it will output probabilities, which can help you locate the areas of interest. You could also use heat maps to visualise them. This is a simple approach but it would work, if you are looking something more advanced you could have a look at papers like this: http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1842 .
