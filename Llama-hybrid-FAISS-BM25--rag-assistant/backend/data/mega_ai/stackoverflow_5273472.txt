Look at this bit: "hd_aanvragen.outlook_id" + "FROM hd_aanvragen " + So your SQL will contain: hd_aanvragen.outlook_idFROM hd_aanvragen I don't think you meant that... (note the lack of space that the end of the first line quoted above) Suggestions: Consider using stored procs, an ORM, or anything else that keeps such huge SQL out of your C# code Potentially read SQL from a text file Use a verbatim string literal, assuming your data source can handle line breaks in its SQL: string select = @"SELECT aanvrager.werknemersnaam AS melder , hd_aanvragen.aanvraag_titel, hd_aanvragen.aanvraag_omschrijving, hd_aanvraag_fase.fase_datum, hd_melding_niveau_1.niveau_omschrijving AS 'Niveau 1', ... WHERE hd_statussen.status_id = 16"; Also, if you're going to claim: In SQL Query Analyzer I run this statement and I don't get anny error make sure you're actually running the same SQL query. Copy the actual value of select in the debugger, paste it into SQL Query Analyzer and you'll see exactly the same problem.
