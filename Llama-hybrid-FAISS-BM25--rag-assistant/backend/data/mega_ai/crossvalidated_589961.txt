Principle Component Analysis for Feature extraction from Voltage and Current Signals

I am doing research work on fault classification in power transmission lines. I generated fault datasets in MATLAB/Simulink and collected it in matrix format with 6 various i.e. 6 variables in 6 columns of matrix. I have performed Principle Component Analysis to reduce dimensions to one-dimension for feature extraction to be applied to the machine learning classifiers. I am confused about it whether it will provide the correct features (maximum features in the first principle component)? Can anyone explain it as first PC contain almost 69% features whereas first two PCs show 100% features. May I use it as a sequence or time series with a label in this format or anything else?
