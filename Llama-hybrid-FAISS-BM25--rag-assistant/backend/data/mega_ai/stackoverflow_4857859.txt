Does it matter if you don't select the first 1000? i.e. if you just use... Select top 100 * From table Order by column You get the same result and as pointed out elsewhere you won't are likely to degrade performance rather than improve it. If you want to optimize this query then ensure that there is an index on the column then the SQL server will be able to optimise the retrieval and sorting of the records to give you just what you want.
