Try features in the frequency domain (fft related features), but also general statistics (mean, std, max, min,...). An algorithm that works generally well when you don't really know which features are most significant and you have quite a few of those, is Random Forests. They're easy to train and available in most ML libraries. This approach is commonly used for activity recognition based on IMU sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope,...).
