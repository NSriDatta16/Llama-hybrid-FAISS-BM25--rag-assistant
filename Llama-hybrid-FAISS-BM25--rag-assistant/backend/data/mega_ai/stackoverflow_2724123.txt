OpenId authentication and automatic registration with Spring Security 3.0.2

I'm implementing an app using spring security 3.0.2 with OpenId login and registration. I can login succesfully, but if the user isn't registered i want to do: 1) Get some OpenId attributes like email and name. 2) Show to the user a registration form with just these two fields and the OpenId URI filled. I've been searching a lot but i didn't find an "ellegant" way of doing this. I wonder if some of u can come out with a solution to implement this strategy in my app. Thanks in advance.
