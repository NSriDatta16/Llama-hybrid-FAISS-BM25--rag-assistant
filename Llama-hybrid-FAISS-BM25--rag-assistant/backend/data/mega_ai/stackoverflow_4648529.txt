There's no supported way to do this in C# without any IE Addons unless the WebBrowser control is running in-proc, in which case you can use the UrlMkSetSessionOption() API. See The User-Agent String: Use and Abuse If you are willing to use add-ons , see http://www.enhanceie.com/ietoys/uapick.asp Now, there's an unsupported hack to do this that I wouldn't recommend-- namely, you could replace the COMPATIBLE string with the remainder of the Firefox UA , followed by a CRLF and the text IGNORE: . This would cause the HTTP header to "wrap" into a new header, so you'd be sending Headers that look something like: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 IGNORE: MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; AskTbMP3R7/5.9.1.14019)
