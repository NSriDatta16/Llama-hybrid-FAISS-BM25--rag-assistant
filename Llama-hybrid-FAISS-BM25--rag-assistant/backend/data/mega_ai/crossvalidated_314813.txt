First, you mean $$\hat{y}_{t+1} = \alpha \sum_{i=0}^\infty (1-\alpha)^i y_{t-i}.$$ That is the optimal prediction for several models, as explained in Chatfield et al (JRSSD 2001) . The best known of these models are the ARIMA(0,1,1) process where the moving average parameter $\theta=1-\alpha$ and the ETS(A,N,N) and ETS(M,N,N) models. See http://otexts.org/fpp2/sec-7-ETS.html for details.
