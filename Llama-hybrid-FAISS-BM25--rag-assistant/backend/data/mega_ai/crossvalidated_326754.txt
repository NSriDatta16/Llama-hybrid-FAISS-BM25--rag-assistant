q-value is a tail probability as you can see by your definition, it is the minimum pFDR in which you will still reject the corresponding hypothesis. pFDR is defined as $E(V / R | R > 0)$, which I encountered also as Bayesian FDR. The local FDR ($fdr$) is the probability that the hypothesis comes from the null at a specific value of the statistic. The connection between the two is the following: $pFDR(z) = P(H_i = 0| R_i = 1) = E_{Z|R_i=1}P(H_i=0|Z)=E_{Z|R_i=1}fdr(Z_i)$
