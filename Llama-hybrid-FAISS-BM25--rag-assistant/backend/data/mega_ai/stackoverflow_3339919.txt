I realise I'm fairly late to this question, but I've been hunting for an answer and I may have found a fairly elegant solution. Have a look here: http://www.getharvest.com/blog/2009/12/dropdown-problems-on-internet-explorer/ http://www.dougboude.com/blog/1/2008/05/Viewing-Option-Text-in-IE7-thats-Wider-than-the-Select-List.cfm The first link talks about a couple of solutions before recommending a solution based on the second link. The idea is that on click, you change the width of the tag such that it is big enough to show the full text of the options. By keeping the tag inside a div with overflow set to 'hidden', it doesn't screw with the rest of the page. Try it out - it's a pretty good solution.
