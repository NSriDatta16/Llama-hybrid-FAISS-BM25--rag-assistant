How to increase the total number of iterations it takes to converge a MDP?

I was reading about Policy Iteration . What are the factors that influence the total number of iterations the algorithm takes to converge? For a given MDP which converges in 3 iterations, what setting needs to be influenced for the MDP so that the total number of iterations increase? I am experimenting with my simple MDP and trying to understand the conditions, under which a normal MDP might take a lot many iterations before it converges. I have assumed a constant discount factor of 0.75
