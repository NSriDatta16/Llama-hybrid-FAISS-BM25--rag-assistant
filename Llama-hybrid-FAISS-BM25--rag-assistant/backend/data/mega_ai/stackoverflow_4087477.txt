Secure dealloc of an ObjC object on an iOS device

What happens to an object when it's dealloced? Is all the memory nulled out, or do traces still remain? If I understand it correctly, an app's memory is saved to flash storage if it resigns active. Assume a resourceful hacker that is able to read out this memory. Will he theoretically sometimes be able to read out the contents of a dealloced NSString if that memory hasn't been overwritten with something?
