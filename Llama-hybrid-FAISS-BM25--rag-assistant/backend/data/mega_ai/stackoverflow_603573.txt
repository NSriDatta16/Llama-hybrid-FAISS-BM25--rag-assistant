Add this to global.asax and it will set the no-cache headers for all pages in the web application. Be sure that disabling caching is really what you want to do however - because caching is a performance benefit. You can of course, also apply the same Response.Cache commands to pages individually. This works in FireFox 3, IE7, and somewhat in Opera 9.6. (In Opera, it will work if you don't to any post requests. If you do, the page will still be accessible from the back button the first time, but not afterwards.) protected void Application_PreSendRequestHeaders(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (!Request.Path.Contains("/Content/")) //We WANT images, css, javascripts to be cached! { //Otherwise, all of our pages contain sensitive information, and we don't want them cached. Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.Cache.SetRevalidation(HttpCacheRevalidation.AllCaches); //for Opera. May only work on https sites Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); } }
