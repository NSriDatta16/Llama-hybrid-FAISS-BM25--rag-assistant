What are similarity and distance metrics in classification?

I have an assignment to train a model to classify text data, the brief for the assignment mentions that any for any learning model used I have to provide a reasoning for the similarity or distance metric used. What does this refer to? My initial thought was that, for example, in logistic regression, the normalisation used would be L1 (Minkowski) or L2 (Euclidean). Would this be correct?
