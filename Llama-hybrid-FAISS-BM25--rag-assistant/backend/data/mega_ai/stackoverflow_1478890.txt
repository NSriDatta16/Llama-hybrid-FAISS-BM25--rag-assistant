ZeroLink is deprecated and has been removed from Xcode for several versions. Pay no attention to it. The linker is faster now and ZeroLink was problematic. If you must link with Tiger's sqlite3, all you need to do is add this to your Other Linker Flags: -l/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib/libsqlite3.dylib That will force linkage with the 10.4 version of sqlite.
