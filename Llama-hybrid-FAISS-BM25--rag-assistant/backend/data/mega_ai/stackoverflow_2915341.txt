Which machine learning library to use

I am looking for a library that, ideally, has the following features: implements hierarchical clustering of multidimensional data (ideally on similiarity or distance matrix) implements support vector machines is in C++ is somewhat documented (this one seems to be hardest) I would like this to be in C++, as I am most comfortable with that language, but I will also use any other language if the library is worth it. I have googled and found some, but I do not really have the time to try them all out, so I want hear what other people had for experiences. Please only answer if you have some experience with the library you recommend. P.S.: I could also use different libraries for the clustering and the SVM.
