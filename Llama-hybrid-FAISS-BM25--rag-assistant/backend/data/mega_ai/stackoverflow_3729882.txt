I separate my controllers from my database with events. I fire some abstract "SaveWhateverComplicatedData" event from my controller, and a different class (who knows about all of my data storage specifics) listens for those events and interprets them. It's working quite well for me, and, though I only have one DB, I don't see any reason I couldn't have more. This is a custom framework I've set up myself, but you could hook into another framework by wrapping these "data events" up in an interface that looks like a database. You could implement whatever interface your framework needs WITH the data events, and still have your listening multiple-database class doing the real work.
