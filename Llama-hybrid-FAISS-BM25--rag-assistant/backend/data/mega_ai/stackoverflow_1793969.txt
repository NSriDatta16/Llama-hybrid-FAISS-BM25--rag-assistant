i use the techniques on this site for a general drag and drop. tree view can get messy, if you want to know which node you are preivewMouseDown 'ing on, to then use as your drag item you can end up walking the visual tree. there is some code to do that here . another way is to subclass treeview, and treeviewitem, then you can override the preview mouse down on each tree view item, and tell your derived parent treeview about it, which could set the tree view item to be the selected item.
