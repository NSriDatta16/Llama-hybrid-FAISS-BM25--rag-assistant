That is problem commonly called time series anomaly detection / outlier detection. Most systems start with combinations of static and dynamic thresholding. Dynamic thresholding for example can use percentile value as the threshold. One common algorithm is Isolation Forest where the features can including different length moving average windows. One of the best ways to handle occasionally shifting baseline is to take a Bayesian approach. Generate a posterior estimate which is updated in an online fashion as the data distribution changes.
