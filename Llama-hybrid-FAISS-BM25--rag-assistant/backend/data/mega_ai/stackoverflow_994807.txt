In HTML 4.01 there is a deprecated value attribute on : makes this list item number 30. makes this list item number 40. makes this list item number 41. The non-deprecated (CSS) answer is (as so often) more elegant but less... direct :) The spec is somewhat dry; googling turns up more immediately usable stuff such as this : Just like continuing the numbering from the previous list youâ€™ll need to set the CSS property for incrementing the proper counter. But to make it start incrementing from a different starting point you can pass an optional second parameter in counter-reset property of a number. So starting from 5 would look something like this in your CSS: ol.continue { counter-reset: chapter 4; /* Resets counter to 4. */ } Since the counter will always be reset before it is incremented, to start our list with the number 5 we will have to set the counter to 4.
