A likely source of the predefined macros for a specific combination of compiler and platform is the Predef project at Sourceforge. They are attempting to maintain a catalog of all predefined macros in all C and C++ compilers on all platforms. In practice, they have coverage of a fair number of platforms for GCC, and a smattering of other compilers. They achieved this through a combination of careful reading of documentation, as well as a shell script that figures out what macros are predefined the hard way: it tries them. My understanding is that it actually tries every string it can find in the executable image of the compiler and/or preprocessor to see if it has a predefined meaning. They will happily add any info they don't have yet to their database.
