The AR, MA, and ARMA models are examples of univariate time series models. Each of these models has a multivariate counterpart: Vector Autogression (VAR), Vector Moving Average (VMA), and Vector Autoregressive Moving Average (VARMA), respectively. VAR might be the simplest to reason about if you are more familiar with linear regression. An AR(p) model regresses a time series against its p lags. Correspondingly, a VAR(p) model is a series of regressions, such that each series is regressed against its p lags and the p lags of all the other variables. After performing the regressions, you can calculate residuals from each series and evaluate how correlated the residuals are. As with univariate models, stationarity is also an important issue for multivariate models. This leads to models like the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), which allows for variables to have share a stable long-term trend with short-term deviations.
