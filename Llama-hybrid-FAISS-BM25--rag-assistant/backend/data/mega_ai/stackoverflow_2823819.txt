Xcode 3.2.2 now includes a Build and Archive option on the Build menu. As long as you have Device + Release (or Distribution) selected, it will be available for selection. It will build your project, archive it for you and then open the Organizer to "Archived Applications" where you can Validate the binary, Share it (adhoc) or Submit it to iTunes Connect for distribution.
