Model uncertainty (model averaging) and R-Squared ($R^2$)

Is it possible to calculate r-squared for an "average model"? Lets say I have 4 different response variables that I want to model to a set (or subset) of 4 independent variables. I'd then like to compare the variance explained (R-squared) for the best model for each response variable. Unfortunately, for each of the 4 response variables there is no clear best model, so I need to model average to account for this model selection uncertainty. Now, is there still a way to compare the variance explained by the averaged model for each of the response variables? Or do I simply compare the r-squared values of the global model for each response variable? My question is similar to this old unanswered question; Generalized $R^2$ for average model Thanks for any help and please let me know if I can improve this question.
