If I understood well, the critical point in the second step of the HMC algorithm is that the proposal is volume preserving and reversible, but I am free to use another position energy function than the negated log-likelihood of the target. I am aware of the fact that this would be very inefficient because the acceptance rate of HMC depends of the use of Hamiltonian dynamics to visit high-density regions. Is my understanding correct or did I miss something ? You are correct that you could use this approach and could still use it to generate a Markov chain with the correct invariant measure. This will usually lead to a worse Markov chain, but may be cheaper if the `wrong Hamiltonian' is faster to compute. An example would be this paper , in which the author uses a cheap surrogate to the desired probability to generate approximate HMC trajectories quickly.
