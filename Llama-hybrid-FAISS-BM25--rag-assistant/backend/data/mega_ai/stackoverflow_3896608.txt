What is in the future for JADE?

I'm starting my thesis on Agents and Smart Objects interaction and I'd like to know what's in the future for JADE , the Java Agent framework. I find the whole concept of agents, programmable behaviors, federations and their help in solving Artificial Intelligence problems very interesting but will it always be an academic field, like Haskell? What's being done with JADE?
