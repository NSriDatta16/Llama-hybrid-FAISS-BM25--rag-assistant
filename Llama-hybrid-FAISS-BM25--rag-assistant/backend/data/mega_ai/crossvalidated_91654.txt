Logistic regression

I want to categorize 20 responses from the BBC survey into average ability (chance level) and greater ability. I read somewhere that 25% above chance is no longer chance. Is it appropriate to use 12.5% above 50% (62.5%) as the category "greater ability" for logistic regression? Have I calculated this correctly? I am using the BBC survey "Spot the fake Smile" as the responses for ability. http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/index_surveys.shtml I have 20 predictor variables to create a composite variate of personality.
