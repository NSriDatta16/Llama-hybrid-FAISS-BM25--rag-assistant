How to port a project?

I want to port a simple game someone else has written in Java to GWT. He organized it mainly into two packages: One for the user interface and one for the game logic. Hopefully, I can reuse his game logic and just rewrite the user interface, but I might need to change some things in order to make it compile with GWT. I'm wondering on how to best reuse his game logic code. It's open source, so I have a range of possibilities. Should I use git's subtree merge or submodules features to somehow fumble his code into my repository? Or should I just gulp copy and paste the game logic code? If I do the latter, it would be extremely difficult to contribute back to the main project or inherit improvements and bug fixes from it. I asked him whether he would like to split his game into two projects: One for the UI and one for the game logic, but this would lead to problems as soon as I have to change the game logic code to make it compile in GWT. Furthermore, he didn't like the idea of splitting a single application into several projects, he wants to keep it simple and I respect that. How can I best approach this port? I presume it has happened before, i.e. when porting piece of Java software to JavaME or vice versa.
