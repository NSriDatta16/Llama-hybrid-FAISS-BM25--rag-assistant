Fine tunning in information retrieval is a way to report the optimized performance of your model with free parameters. I cite Learning Information Retrieval Functions and Parameters on Unlabeled Collections , After k folds, the average of the performance of M on all the subsets is reported. In this case, $MAP_{opt} = \frac{1}{10}\sum_{i=1}^{10}MAP_i$ , where $MAP_i$ is the $MAP$ value in the $K_i$ test set with the optimal $P_i$ . But, if you need one "optimal" $P$ you can choose the $P_i$ most frecuent as Probabilistic and machine learning-based retrieval approaches for biomedical dataset retrieval .
