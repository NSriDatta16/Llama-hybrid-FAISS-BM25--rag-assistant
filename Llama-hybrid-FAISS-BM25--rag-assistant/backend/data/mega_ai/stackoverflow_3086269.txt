Reuse a ToolStripMenu for a ToolStrip or a ContextMenuStrip?

In my application, I have a ToolStripMenu (File, Edit, Notes), a ToolStrip right above my work area and a context menu for the work area itself. Now the Notes ToolStripMenu, the ToolStrip and the ContextMenuStrip all have the same content that performs the same actions. I was wondering, is there an elegant way to just design the ToolStripMenu and have the other two "mirror" it's function and content instead of rewriting everything 3 times? I saw that all 3 controls use ToolStripItems and ToolStripItemCollections and as such I would think this would be quite easy to do, but the properties are mostly read only, and if I try to loop through one's item to add them to the other, they are removed from the initial owner, and there are no Clone method for ToolStripItems. Thanks.
