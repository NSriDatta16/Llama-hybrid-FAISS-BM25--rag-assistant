You can presume from its usage in the standard library that a namespaced global factory is not implicitly wrong. Nothing prevents it from being correct. Your approach of wrapping the factory in a class is an organizational change. Organization itself is neither good nor bad. It can be done well or poorly. You should be fine doing whichever approach feels comfortable for its context. I have also seen both approaches used many times and neither were particularly problematic.
