Specifying a model with nested subsamples within split-plot design

I am trying to specify a model for split plot design that acknowledges nested sub-sampling. Split plot designs are a little bit tricky to analyze, and I am new to R, so I provide my dataset along with instructions at the bottom in case anyone can solve this challenge. THE CONTEXT: In my MSc thesis, I am using a split plot design to test the effect of forest type ("Riparian" vs "sloped") and forest age (250 years/"old" vs 35 years/"young") on the biomass of salal, an understory plant of economic interest. The experimental design is similar to a two way factorial ANOVA. However, each old forest site is paired with a young forest site; before logging occurred they were within the same patch of forest or "historicstand". This pairing means that it is a split plot design (see figure). It took me some effort to learn how to analyze this split plot design, but now I understand it, and I can run this simple model fine in R base stats. This model in R is: aov(salalbio ~ foresttype + Error(historicstand/foresttype) + forestage+ forestage*foresttype, data = antfp) THE CHALLENGE :The problem with the above model is that it does not recognize that within each site I have two measurements: At each site there are two sampling plots "sample_plots" where we measured salal biomass. These measurements are not replicates so I need to acknowledge that they are nested within site, or I risk a Type I error. How do I rewrite the model so that it acknowledges that sample plot is nested within Siteid? In base R[stats] would be easiest for me to comprehend, but any package would do. fyi, I could just average the two measures by site and analyze it this way but my sample size is very small (n = 3 sites per each experimental level). When biomass is averaged I do not detect the effect. Analyzing the nested sub samples maybe, just maybe, will reveal an effect. Here is the data: saldata The below model (for split plot) needs to be modified so that sample plot "a" and "b" are recognized as coming from the same Siteid: M1
