e closing consolidates and connects objects to form more cohesive structures. Applications Digital camera images Digital cameras generally include specialized digital image processing hardware – either dedicated chips or added circuitry on other chips – to convert the raw data from their image sensor into a color-corrected image in a standard image file format. Additional post processing techniques increase edge sharpness or color saturation to create more naturally looking images. Film Westworld (1973) was the first feature film to use the digital image processing to pixellate photography to simulate an android's point of view. Image processing is also vastly used to produce the chroma key effect that replaces the background of actors with natural or artistic scenery. Face detection Face detection can be implemented with mathematical morphology, the discrete cosine transform (DCT), and horizontal projection. General method with feature-based method The feature-based method of face detection is using skin tone, edge detection, face shape, and feature of a face (like eyes, mouth, etc.) to achieve face detection. The skin tone, face shape, and all the unique elements that only the human face have can be described as features. Process explanation Given a batch of face images, first, extract the skin tone range by sampling face images. The skin tone range is just a skin filter. Structural similarity index measure (SSIM) can be applied to compare images in terms of extracting the skin tone. Normally, HSV or RGB color spaces are suitable for the skin filter. E.g. HSV mode, the skin tone range is [0,48,50] ~ [20,255,255] After filtering images with skin tone, to get the face edge, morphology and DCT are used to remove noise and fill up missing skin areas. Opening method or closing method can be used to achieve filling up missing skin. DCT is to avoid the object with skin-like tone. Since human faces always have higher texture. Sobel operator or other operators can be applied to detect face edge. To position human features like eyes, using the projection and find the peak of the histogram of projection help to get the detail feature like mouth, hair, and lip. Projection is just projecting the image to see the high frequency which is usually the feature position. Improvement of image quality method Image quality can be influenced by camera vibration, over-exposure, gray level distribution too centralized, and noise, etc. For example, noise problem can be solved by smoothing method while gray level distribution problem can be improved by histogram equalization. Smoothing method In drawing, if there is some dissatisfied color, taking some color around dissatisfied color and averaging them. This is an easy way to think of Smoothing method. Smoothing method can be implemented with mask and convolution. Take the small image and mask for instance as below. image is [ 2 5 6 5 3 1 4 6 1 28 30 2 7 3 2 2 ] {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}2&5&6&5\\3&1&4&6\\1&28&30&2\\7&3&2&2\end{bmatrix}}} mask is [ 1 / 9 1 / 9 1 / 9 1 / 9 1 / 9 1 / 9 1 / 9 1 / 9 1 / 9 ] {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}1/9&1/9&1/9\\1/9&1/9&1/9\\1/9&1/9&1/9\end{bmatrix}}} After convolution and smoothing, image is [ 2 5 6 5 3 9 10 6 1 9 9 2 7 3 2 2 ] {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}2&5&6&5\\3&9&10&6\\1&9&9&2\\7&3&2&2\end{bmatrix}}} Observing image[1, 1], image[1, 2], image[2, 1], and image[2, 2]. The original image pixel is 1, 4, 28, 30. After smoothing mask, the pixel becomes 9, 10, 9, 9 respectively. new image[1, 1] = 1 9 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{9}}} * (image[0,0]+image[0,1]+image[0,2]+image[1,0]+image[1,1]+image[1,2]+image[2,0]+image[2,1]+image[2,2]) new image[1, 1] = floor( 1 9 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{9}}} * (2+5+6+3+1+4+1+28+30)) = 9 new image[1, 2] = floor({ 1 9 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{9}}} * (5+6+5+1+4+6+28+30+2)) = 10 new image[2, 1] = floor( 1 9 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{9}}} * (3+1+4+1+28+30+7+3+2)) = 9 new image[2, 2] = floor( 1 9 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{9}}} *
