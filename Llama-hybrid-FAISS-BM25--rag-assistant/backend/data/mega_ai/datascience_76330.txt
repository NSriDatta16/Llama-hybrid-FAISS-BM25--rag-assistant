Confusion with using different classes in neural networks (training vs testing)

I am new to deep learning and I am confused about having a neural network trained on certain classes and tested on different ones. Suppose I want to have a convolutional neural network that learns authorship attribution (Identifying the author of a certain text). For example, this model is trained on 10,000 authors/classes over hundreds of thousands of texts. How does the model generalize what it learnt to predict the author of a new author/class in a test set? Will it not be trained to identify the authors it was initially trained on and not the new one? For example, a CNN that learns whether an image is a cat or a dog is trained as such and when testing it predicts the same classes.
