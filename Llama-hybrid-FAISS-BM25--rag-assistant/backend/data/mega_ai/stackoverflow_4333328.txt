C: database for storing command history

I want to create a run dialog, i implemented interface and command run, but i'm stalled on following: i need some storage of strings which will be able to provide me slices beginning with specified string or all strings sorted by added date. I didn't find any solution :( I thought about sqlite, but it seems to be to much for such simple task. Plus such storage can be really big (i.e. atm i've got 5MB run history, ~7000 commands). Any ideas? Thanks.
