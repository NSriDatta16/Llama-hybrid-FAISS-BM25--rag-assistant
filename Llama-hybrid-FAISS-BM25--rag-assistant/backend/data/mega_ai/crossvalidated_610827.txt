Good question. I think it depends on what you are planning to do with that data. For a regression model or hypothesis tests, you'd probably consider 200 as the sample size as you are not including these non-responses in the model. On the other hand, if you are using something like a decision tree (or any machine learning extension like random forests), you might include missing responses as an explicit outcome (probably not for 800 out of 1000, but in principle you might). I believe in your use-case it would be 200.
