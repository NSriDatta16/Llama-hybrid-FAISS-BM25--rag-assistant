We too have a complex deployment and I think we also may be in need of simplifying the process prior to finding a tool. It's like a recent lifehacker post about organizing what you have prior to buying more organization tools like little plastic hanging folders and the like. Reduce/Rethink/Redesign prior implementation should mean a cleaner easier process that could make due with simple deployment tools like rpm. I think step one is for us to rethink the process from the base goals onward and to push hard on each requirement with the question: what-does-that-buy-us? If there's no payoff for a step in clarity, risk reduction or basic functionality, then it doesn't need to be in the process any more. At least, that's how I've been approaching problems here with some success.
