Actually, classification methodology has been around in classical probability and statistics for the better part of a century, well before "machine learning" was a deal. See, e.g., the classic multivariate analysis text by Johnson and Wichern, Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis, 6th Edition , Section IV. CLASSIFICATION AND GROUPING TECHNIQUES (subsection "Classification with Several Populations"), for the optimal (nonparametric, even!) approach to this problem. Machine learning algorithms are simply attempts to approximate this historically well-known (at least by statisticians) optimal solution.
