Pros and Cons of the MySQL Archive Storage Engine?

For a website I am developing, I am going to store user activity information (like Facebook) and HTTP requests to the server into a MySQL database. I was going to use InnoDB as the storage engine, however, I briefly read about the Archive storage engine and this sounds like the way forward for information which is only Inserted or Selected and never Updated or Deleted. Before I proceed, I would like to know the any pros and cons to help me make a decision whether to use it or not.
