Detecting authentication timeout in handler and redirecting entire page to login page

I am writing an application where by someone can edit paragraphs on a web page. jQuery is used to send and receive the edited paragraph data to a handler, which saves it or reads it from a database. The problem is that if the forms authentication has timed out, I get the login page back from my handler. Is there any way I can detect at the client or server if the authentication has timed out and redirect the entire page to the login page?
