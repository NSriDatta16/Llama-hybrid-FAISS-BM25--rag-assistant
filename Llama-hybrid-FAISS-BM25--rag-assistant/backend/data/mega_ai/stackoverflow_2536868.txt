The convention is to do this at construction time with a constructor that takes one parameter of its own type. MyObj myObj_2 = new MyObj(myObj_1); There is no Java convention to overwrite the existing properties of an object from another. This tends to go against the preference for immutable objects in Java (where properties are set at construction time unless there is a good reason not to). Edit: regarding clone(), many engineers discourage this in modern Java because it has outdated syntax and other drawbacks. http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=71
