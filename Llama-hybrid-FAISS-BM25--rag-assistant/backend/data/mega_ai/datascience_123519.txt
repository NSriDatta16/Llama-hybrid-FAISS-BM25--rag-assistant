Are the terms "vector embedding" and "embedding vector" interchangeable?

Googling "vector embedding" gives me ~40k results, including from Pinecone, Weaviate, and OpenAI. Googling "embedding vector" gives me ~150k results, including from TensorFlow, Microsoft, and academic sites. Googling "vector embedding" vs "embedding vector" just gives me results mentioning both, not discussions about any difference. So it doesn't feel like there's a strong consensus that one form is preferred. Is that correct?
