Meta's SAM model: can extract semantic embedding vector?

I'm interested in finding an embedding vector for each segment found by the Facebook/Meta Segment Anything model (for classification and tracking of segments). Can SamPredictor.features (the output of model.image_encoder(input_image) ) be used for this? Its not clear to me how to interpret this data. I see its a 1x256x64x64 tensor - does the 256 corresponds to 0..255 possible segments, and can the 64x64 component be flattened and sensibly treated as a point in an embedding space? Thanks in advance.
