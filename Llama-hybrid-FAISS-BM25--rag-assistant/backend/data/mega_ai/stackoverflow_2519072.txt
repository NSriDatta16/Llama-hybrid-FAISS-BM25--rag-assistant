A deck of cards is comprised of the same range of values (1 - 13) in each of four suits, which suggests a Cartesian product . List comprehension is an elegant, dense syntax for doing this: values = range(1, 10) + "Jack Queen King".split() suits = "Diamonds Clubs Hearts Spades".split() deck_of_cards = ["%s of %s" % (v, s) for v in values for s in suits] in python 3 : deck_of_cards = ["{0} of {1}".format(v, s) for v in values for s in suits] That's how they are when you take a brand new deck out of the box; to play you need to shuffle them: from random import shuffle shuffle(deck_of_cards)
