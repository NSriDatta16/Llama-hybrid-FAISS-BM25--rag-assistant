Logistic regression versus t-test, which is better for this comparative-descriptive study?

Which type of test is most appropriate for this comparative-descriptive study? I have two groups of subjects (250 in each). My goal is to determine if the two subject groups are different and if so, how. I'm using an online survey of 50 statements (embedded are 5 statements about 10 different possible factors). Subjects rate these statements on a Likert scale from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree". Do I have to use a t-test or a logistic regression to determine categorical differences, and predictors?
