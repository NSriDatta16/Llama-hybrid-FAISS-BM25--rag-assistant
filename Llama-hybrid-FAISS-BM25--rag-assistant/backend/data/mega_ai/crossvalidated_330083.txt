Transforming a multivariate binary time series to be stationary

I have a multivariate (multi-response) dataset with, for example, 10 different binary responses. I'm interested in an AR(p) model, determining how the responses at previous time steps relate to the current responses. That is, I'm looking for: $P(Y_t \mid Y_{t-1}, ... Y_{t-p}) = \ell(\beta_0 + \beta_1Y_{t-1} + ... + \beta_p Y_{t-p})$ where each $Y_t$ is a length-10 binary vector, that is (I hope this notation works) $Y_t \in \{0, 1\}^{10}$, and $\ell$ is a link function (which I think I need - so something like probit or logit?). I was thinking of using the VAR package in Python , but this requires stationary data and I'm all but certain my data are non-stationary. How can I transform my binary multivariate time series data to be stationary?
