OpenGL ES 2.0 multithreading

I have been trying to use OpenGL ES 2.0 to make a photo viewing application. To optimize the code I'm changing the textures loaded with the objects as the user scrolls down. But image loading into the texture takes some time and thus the effect is not good. To solve the above problem I tried using multithreading with the following ways: Create a separate context for the new thread and then share the resources (texture object) with the other context Use multiple threads and a single context. Make the context current while executing gl commands in the threads. But wasn't successful in either of them. So if anyone has tried similar things with opengl earlier, could you please tell which of the above ones would work and the things I need to pay attention to while doing the same? Also would FBO's and pbuffers be of any use in this case? Thanks for any help. Himanshu
