Using tensorflow for any type of dataset

I have a problem that I have been working on with logistic regression which involves classifying clients based on their income and socio-demographic variables, all of which are categorical into those who have defaulted on their credit and those who haven't. I have recently had tensorflow recommended as a package to use for neural networks, however on their website https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tutorial_mnist_beginners.html they discuss tensorflow in terms of image classification. My concrete question is thus: 2) Can tensorflow be used for any type of classification problem, for example, a binary classification of observations based upon categorical variables? Cheers, Steve
