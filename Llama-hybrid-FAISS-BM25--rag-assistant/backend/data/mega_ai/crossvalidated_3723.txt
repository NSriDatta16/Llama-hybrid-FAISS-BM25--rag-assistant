Error propagation won't work in the way handled by the uncertainties package. As you note, they're dependent, so you have to take the covariances into account. You can obtain the variance of your distribution P(B|A) using the Delta Method and use that to obtain a confidence interval. With Bayesian inference, you might find it simpler to use a credible interval . The following slides do a good job of explaining how to obtain this: Bayesian analysis of one, two, and n-parameter models A Brief Tutorial on Bayesian Thinking
