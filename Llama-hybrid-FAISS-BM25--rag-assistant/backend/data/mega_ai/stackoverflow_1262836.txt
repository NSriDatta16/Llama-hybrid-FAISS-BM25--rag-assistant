How to deploy a desktop .Net application with custom settings per user

This seems like a simple question but the intergoogles have not been kind. I have a C# desktop application. There are certain properties that need to be customized per customer, such as each customer's organization's name, that are otherwise independent of the actual functionality of the application and therefore do not need to be compiled into it. What is the best/preferred method to pull this data out of the application, manage it in VS (2008), and deploy it to customers' desktops? For example, say I have two separate users in two separate organizations, so they each need a separate set of settings. Do I just create a new app.config file for each of them? Would I have to rebuild the setup project for each user in order to accommodate that new app.config file? thank you
