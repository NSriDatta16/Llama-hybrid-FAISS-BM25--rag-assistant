Add samples to given set to match distribution

I have a distribution from which I can draw random (iid) samples. I also have a (non-random) "sample" from that distribution that is given and skews heavily towards the lower end of it. I would now like to draw samples from the distribution to "fill in the gaps". I know the mean of the distribution and I would like to draw another sample such that at least the final average of all samples matches the expected value (or everything looks just like a random sample from the distribution). I was thinking I could (maybe iteratively!?) draw a random sample and then reject or accept it based on some criteria, but I don't know what it would be exactly. The number of additional samples I can draw is fixed and usually larger than the number of given values.
