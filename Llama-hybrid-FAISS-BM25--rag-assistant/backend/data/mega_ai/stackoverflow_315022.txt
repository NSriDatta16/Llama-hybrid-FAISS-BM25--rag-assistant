I always included the namespace or relative path in the include guard, because only the header name alone has proven to be dangerous. For example, you have some large project with the two files somewhere in your code /myproject/module1/misc.h /myproject/module2/misc.h So if you use a consistent naming schema for your include guards you might end up with having _MISC_HPP__ defined in both files (very funny to find such errors). So I settled with MYPROJECT_MODULE1_MISC_H_ MYPROJECT_MODULE2_MISC_H_ These names are rather long, but compared with the pain of double definitions it is worth it. Another option, if you don't need compiler/platform independence you might look for some #pragma once stuff.
