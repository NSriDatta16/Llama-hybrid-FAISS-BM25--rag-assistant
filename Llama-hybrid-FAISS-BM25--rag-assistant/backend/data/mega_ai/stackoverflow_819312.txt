For plain comments I usually resort to LaTeX's or Word's syntax. But usually Word, since e. g. β is more readable than \beta . Since my source files are usually Unicode this doesn't pose a problem. Also I don't like too many braces around everything :-) Sometimes I got bored with Javadoc and using much HTML to get formulas in Javadoc show up prettily but that doesn't help source readability (and exploits the fact that Javadoc only builds to HTML, no luck in .NET here). I'd have written Pax's sample as // Work out average as: // ∑(values)/|values| // and distance between points as: // d = √( (x_1 - x_0)² + (y_1 - y_0)² ) // and the following function: // f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d I rarely use Unicode subscripts, though, as they aren't in every font, especially not those suitable for code :)
