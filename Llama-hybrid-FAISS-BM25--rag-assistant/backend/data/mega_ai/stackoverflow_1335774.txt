Firebird + FreeadhocUDFs + IBExpert, and just programming. we have 2 systems in production for 6 years (20 domains, 200 tables, 50 views, 370 stored procedures, 600 triggers, 205 generators, 11, roles, etc, etc) and have been tested to migrate to PostgreSQL (only test, we love Firebird). In tables with traditional data types (integer, varchar, date, numeric, etc, etc.) differences could be for one or the other, as appropriate, but in stored procedures, Firebird is much more powerful than Postgresql, much more simple and elegant. Two or three years, any Linux distribution, not including Firebird, only Mysql and Postgresl. Not for nothing today, but tradicionesles distributions (ubunutu / opensuse / fedora / centos, etc, etc) and Firebird include in their repositories. Postgresql do not say that is worse than Firebird, Firebird is not that much better than Postgresql. But without hesitation I say that Firebird has nothing to envy to Postgresql, and in many ways is more powerful. (sorry for my bad english)
