$('a') selects all the links ( HTMLAnchorElement s) on the page. Elements are DOM nodes defined by their identity and presence in the document. They are not simple values that JSON can represent. If you look at what JSON.stringify() returns for them, it's just {} : JSON says all it knows about the object is that it's an Object . It doesn't make any sense to attempt to put a Node inside a localStorage ; what do you expect to get back when you read the storage tomorrow? A Node object that was part of a document the user closed and destroyed yesterday? If you want to remember where the links pointed to, you should get that from their href properties, as a String â€”a simple value type that can safely be remembered by localStorage .
