VSTO for the Mac?

I have built a custom Outlook toolbar option using VSTO which logs an email in a database. This works fine in Windows. However, Iâ€™ve been asked if we can migrate this to the Mac for Entourage which I think is the Mac version of Outlook. Can a VSTO application be ported to the Mac? Is it possible to build custom toolbar options in Entourage?
