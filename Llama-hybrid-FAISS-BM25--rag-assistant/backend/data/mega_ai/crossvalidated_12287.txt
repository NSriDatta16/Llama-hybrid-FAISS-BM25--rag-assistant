You should investigate Transfer Function Modelling ( A.K.A. Multiple time series modelling with 1 endogenous series ) and take care to identify via INTERVENTION DETECTION any Pulses, Level Shifts , Seasonal Pulses and or Local Time Trends. Furthermore finding break-points in parameters would be a useful diagnostic while also checking for deterministic variance changes in the errors.
