How Conditional Random Fields and Logistic Regression could be the same?

If you have read this tutorial about CRF , on page 4 under the section Classification , it wants to relate CRF to Logistic Regression (or Maximum Entropy , as it is known by this name in NLP community). The formulation of Logistic Regression is said to be $ p(y|x) = \frac{1}{Z(X)}exp \{ \lambda_y + \sum_{j=1}^{K}\lambda_{y,j}x_{j}\} $. On the other hand, on the Wikipedia page for logistic regression, the formulation is $ f(t) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-t}} $ and the classifier's formulation is the explanation of this formulation which is derived from Logistic Function. My question is, first, how Logistic Regression and Maximum Entropy Classifier are related to each other and are identical? Second, the CRF tutorial says Logistic Regression (or Maximum Entropy Classifier) is simple CRF model, how?
