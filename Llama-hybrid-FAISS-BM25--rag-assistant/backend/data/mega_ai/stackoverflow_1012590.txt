I agree with Horcrux (cant vote it as dont have enough rep) if the file is less than 300KB, then this wont work, but for large files, then adverage over the course of the whole file download will be 300Kbps... I'm assuming the idea is like a rapidshare idea, premium users will have full speed downloads? Also, while one thread(user) is waiting for a second, another thread can be downloading. Queue the downloads, and only let X amount run at the same time, and your away in a hack!
