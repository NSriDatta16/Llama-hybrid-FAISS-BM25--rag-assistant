What if the MVUE depends on the parameter?

The minimum variance, unbiased estimator $\hat \theta$ of $\theta$ is defined by $$\hat \theta = \text{argmin}_{\hat \theta} \; \mathbb{E} \left( (\hat \theta - \theta)^2 \, | \, \theta\right), \quad \text{ subject to } \quad \mathbb{E} \left( \hat \theta \, | \, \theta\right) - \theta = 0 $$ where the expectation, $\mathbb{E}$, is taken over the data, $Y$ (given the parameter $\theta$). This yields an expression for $\hat \theta$ in terms of $y$. I.e. $\hat \theta = \hat \theta (y)$. But if instead we obtain $\hat \theta = \hat \theta (y; \theta)$, what do we do then? As far as I can tell, there's nothing in the definition of MVUEs above that guarantees independence of $\hat \theta$ from $\theta$. One could achieve such independence by letting the expectation be over $\theta$ as well as the data $Y$. But this assumes that $\theta$ is a random variable, and then we're doing Bayesian inference. What if we have a strictly frequentist perspective? For example, the ordinary least squares estimator, $(X'X)^{-1} X' \boldsymbol{y}$, is the BLUE (so the MVUE among linear, unbiased estimators) for the model $ \boldsymbol{Y} = X \boldsymbol{\theta} + \boldsymbol{\eta}$, and it does not have explicit dependence on $\theta$. Jolly good. Unfortunately I can't think of a case where the expression for the MVUE does depend on the parameter, however, again, there is nothing apparent in the definition of MVUEs above that can guarantee this. Edit If the requirement "for all $\theta$" is added the the definition of MVUEs (also called uniform MVUEs (UMVUEs), that implies that there is not dependence on the parameter itself in the expression of the estimator. However, UMVUEs may not exist. As I mention in the comments, it seems weird that a frequentist would completely have to abandon the MVUE criterion in these "degenerate" cases, while a Bayesian could easily make sense of them too by taking expectations over the parameter as well, instead of requiring uniform optimality.
