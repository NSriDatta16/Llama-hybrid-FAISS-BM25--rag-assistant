I agree with both answers so far, just want to add 2 things: For covering indexes, SQL Server 2005 introduced the INCLUDE clause which made storage and usage more efficient. For earlier versions, included columns were part of the tree, part of the 900 byte width and made the index larger. It's also typical for your indexes to be larger than the table when using sp_spaceused. Databases are mostly reads (I saw "85% read" somewhere), even when write heavy (eg INSERT looks for duplicates, DELETE checks FKs, UPDATE with WHERE etc).
