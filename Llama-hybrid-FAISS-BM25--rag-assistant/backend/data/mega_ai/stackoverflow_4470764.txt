The most popular way these days is to use some sort of message queue, with a helper library like Celery. The way this works is that you will have a number of daemons running, listening on a message queue. In your application, you will add messages to the queue which will be picked up by the workers. This is pretty complex, but it's pretty fast. However, it feels to me like completely overkill for your application. The cron way of doing things is much simpler and less fragile. It also makes for easier debugging and testing of your code. As a heretic side note, if your use case really is "check a specific table and perform some calculations that go into some other table", you could use a database trigger to do the work.
