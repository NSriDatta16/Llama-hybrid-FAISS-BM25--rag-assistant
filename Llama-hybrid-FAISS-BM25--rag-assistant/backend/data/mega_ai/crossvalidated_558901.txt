Great questions. Not sure if they are exclusive. See a nice view on Econometrics and Machine Learning , describing overlaps. Probably, why data-centric approach had a less hyped impact in Econometrics appears to be causal inference. Traditionally, econometric models embraced causal modelling. See a recent exposition from HÃ¼nermund-Bareinboim, Causal Inference and Data Fusion in Econometrics .
