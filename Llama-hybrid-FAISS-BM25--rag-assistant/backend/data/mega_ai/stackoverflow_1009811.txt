You will need to familiarise yourself with the principles of designing a secure system, which goes beyond picking a particular encryption algorithm. In principle AES is designed to be secure encrypting packets in their smallest size (16 bytes). But you need to pay attention to its usage in the overall security scheme. Pay attention to your overall protocol design. For example I've heard of some online game in the past (can't locate a reference sorry), which encrypted all its data. The problem was, it didn't include any "seed". So the command to do something in particular, such as give the player an extra life, was the same sequence of (encrypted) bytes every time. So a player could just duplicate that packet, and resend it to the server many times, without ever having to know what unencrypted data was contained in the packet.
