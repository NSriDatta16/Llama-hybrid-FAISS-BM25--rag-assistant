What sort of audit information is stored by sql server when a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE operation is performed?

The inspiration for this question is a stored proc broke on me because it called another stored proc that inserted data in a table whose schema was completely altered. The question is you have a table in a SQL Server database, and you don't know how it got there. You don't have any DDL triggers in place for custom audit information, and there is no record in your source control repository of the tables DDL. Using only SQL Server, what forensic data can you obtain about the table. Myself, and whoever stumbles across this question in a similar situation, is not going to be helped by suggestions regarding version control and DDL triggers. Those are great go forward solutions, and there is plenty of info on this blog about those topics, if corporate politics allows us to implement those solutions. What I, and people in my situation really need is to be able to gather as many fragments of data as possible from SQL server, to combine with whatever other data we can come up with.
