Determine precision of average estimated with MCMC

I am using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method (Metropolis-Hastings) to estimate the mean of a distribution. What practical methods can be used to efficiently determine the precision of this estimate, especially when the acceptance rate drops? Specifically, is there a better way than to recompute the average several times and look at the spread of the results? The keyword here is efficiency : I'm hoping to find a way to calculate the average relatively precisely and estimate that precision without increasing the computation time. The long computation time is a problem in my application. It will not be possible to calculate the average precisely in all cases (when the acceptance rate drops), and it's especially important to have an estimate of the precision when this happens.
