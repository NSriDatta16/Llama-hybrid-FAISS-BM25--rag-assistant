Get SQL Agent job status without polling?

I'm trying to find a way to have the SQL Server 'SQL Agent' run a particular piece of code on job step events. I had hoped that there was a way using SMO to register a callback method so that when job steps begin or change status, my code is called. I'm not having any success. Is there any way to have these events pushed to me, rather than polling?
