Consider the following linear Gaussian system: where $p(x)$ is our prior. The Bayesian inference problem can be expressed in closed-form as 1 : Where can I find an equivalent "frequentist" estimation procedure? Can they also be expressed in closed form? 1 "Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective" , 2012, pp. 119. Kevin Murphy.
