What is the role of temperature in Softmax?

I'm recently working on CNN and I want to know what is the function of temperature in the softmax formula? and why should we use high temperatures to see a softer norm in probability distribution? The formula can be seen below: $$\large P_i=\frac{e^{\frac{y_i}T}}{\sum_{k=1}^n e^{\frac{y_k}T}}$$
