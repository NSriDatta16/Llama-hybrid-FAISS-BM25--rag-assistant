Jane, The save-as dialog only appears on page load. You need to redirect your user either directly to the file you want them to save, or to a server-side page that serves up the file. Once you know the address of the file, do something like window.location = http://yourserver.com/generatedfiles/file_2342342.txt Alternatively, do something like this: window.location = http://yourserver.com/getgeneratedfile.aspx?fileID=2342342 ...which would redirect the user to a page that feeds the generated file. You then need to specify the content-disposition and filename in the header that comes from that page, as mentioned in Gandalf's reply. Edit: Ah, you're using Apache. Probably won't have ASPX files on there then.
