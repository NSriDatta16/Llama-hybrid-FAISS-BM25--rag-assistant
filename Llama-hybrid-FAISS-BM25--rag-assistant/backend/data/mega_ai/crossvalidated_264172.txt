Adjustment for chance is (score - estimate)/(optimum - estimate) . The estimate usually is analytical, not by sampling ,and not based on the evaluation subject, so it's the exact average from "throwing dices". The resulting scores are well interpretable: A value close to 0 is a result "as good as random" A value close to 1 is close to optimal. A value much less than 0 is worse than random, i.e. there is a pattern to how it is different. Speaking of dices: a fair 6 sided dice has an estimated value of 3.5; "constant" unfair dices would yield adjusted for chance scores of -1, -0.6, -0.2, +0.2, +0.6, +1 . If you have the choice of an adjusted for chance score, always use the adjusted version . You lose nothing, but gain interpretability.
