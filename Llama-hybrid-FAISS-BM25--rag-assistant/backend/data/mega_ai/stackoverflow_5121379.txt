The usual problem here is an event. BinaryFormatter includes events, which many people don't expect. The event field must be marked, for example: [field:NonSerialized] public event EventHandler Foo; It is painfully easy to get an event subscription that you didn't anticipate break the serializer (a capture class, perhaps). However, I also encourage you: don't use public fields; use properties don't use BinaryFormatter - it bites most people eventually; and bites hard If you want a binary serializer that works with XNA, consider protobuf-net; it is faster, has smaller output, adapts to change more gracefully ... and is free. Caveat: I wrote it.
