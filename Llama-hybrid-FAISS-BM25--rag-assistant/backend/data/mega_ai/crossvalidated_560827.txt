Is there any paper explaining which machiine learning algorithms needs scaling in data pre-processing?

I can see on many blogs and tutorials that data scaling (e.g standardization) allow better performance for logistic regression and neural networks, but does not improve tree-based models (classification tree, random forest) performance. But is there any good references (papers) that I could cite in an article to support this?
