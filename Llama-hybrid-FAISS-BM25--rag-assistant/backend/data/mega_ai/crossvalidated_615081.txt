Counterfactual modeling where variable is present in treatment but not control group?

I'm working with patient-level healthcare data in a pre vs. post difference-in-differences analysis where the goal is to estimate the average treatment effect for nursing care. Patients in the treatment group received home visits from a nurse while patients in the control group did not receive visits. Given that: 1) nurses often treated multiple patients, 2) outcomes of interest are correlated within nurse ID, and 3) coding fixed effects for each Nurse ID would overfit, a random intercept linked to the Nurse ID for each patient seems appropriate. One problem: How should a random effect be coded for patients in the control group, who received no nursing care? Should all control patients receive the same proxy "nurse ID"?
