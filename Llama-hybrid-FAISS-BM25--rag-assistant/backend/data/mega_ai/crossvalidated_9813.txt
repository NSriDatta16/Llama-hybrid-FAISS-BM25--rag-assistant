Averages of random subsets of variables

Consider data where each observation was generated as follows. We draw $Z_1,...,Z_m$ from some distribution. (Possibly they're independent or related in some other simple way.) Next, based on the $Z_1,...,Z_m$, we choose a sequence $0=I_0 We generate the observed variables $X_1,...,X_N$ as $X_k=$ the average of $Z_{I_{k-1}+1},...,Z_{I_k}$. For example, the hidden sequence $Z=(0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 1.3, 1.2, 0.1)$ might lead to the observed sequence $X=(0.2, 1.25, 0.1)$ [or perhaps to $X=(0.2,0.86)$ due to (i) above]. Does anyone here know whether this type of setup has been studied before, and if so, what are some keywords to search for or papers/books to look at? Thanks in advance for any answers! Added on Apr 21: The motivation is as follows. Think of each $Z$ sequence as SNP data from a single patient. In order to anonymize the data for a public release a procedure like the one I described above can be performed. Based on the anonymized data $X$, I want to predict survival and/or to identify SNPs that are relevant to survival. Note that $I$, $N$, and $X$ are all functions of $Z$, so they will be different for each patient. Also note that that $I$'s are observed, i.e., I know which $Z_j$'s were averaged to produce each $X_k$.
