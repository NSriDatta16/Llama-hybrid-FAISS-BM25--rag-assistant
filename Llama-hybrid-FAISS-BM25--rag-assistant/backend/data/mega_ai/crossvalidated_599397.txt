Bayesian terminology for experiments

I am learning about bayesian experimental design and confused about the "Bayesian" terminology. Multi-armed bandits are normally in the syllabus of bayesian experiments. But there are techniques like Thompson sampling which uses bayesian optimisation and there are also non-bayesian bandit algorithms. So my question is: Can experiments conducted using epsilon greedy bandit algorithms called bayesian experiment? Is bayesian optimisation different from bayesian experimental design?
