Adding copyright information to a Website

I'm working on a website for a client that is a non-profit. The want a Copyright link at the bottom of the site. My question is do they have any legal rights? What kind of info should i put? etc etc. Is it good enough to basically just add something like "(c) 2010 [My Client]. All rights reserved."? Additionally for a user agreement and privacy policy can just copy one that fits our site kind like these: http://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement http://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy Edit: We are based in the USA if that helps.
