You can do this with factor analysis. The basic idea is that each of the items loads onto a lower dimensional set of factors. You can do this in R with the lavaan package with something like: model = "general =~ F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 + F5" fit = cfa(model, data) Then to get the factor scores, you can use predict(fit) . Note you'll have to pay special attention to the type of estimator that you use when you fit the model, as well as the model specification. Here is the lavaan documentation ( http://lavaan.ugent.be/ ) .
