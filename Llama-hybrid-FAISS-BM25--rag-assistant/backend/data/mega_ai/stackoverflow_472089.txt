As you have now discovered, #warning is not a standard feature, so you cannot use it with compilers that don't suppport it. If you want your code to work across platforms, you won't use #warning at all - or, at the least, not in code that MSVC is intended to process (it could be preprocessed out by #ifdef or equivalent). Hence: #ifdef __GNUC__ #warning(warning message) #else #pragma NOTE(warning message) #endif But that repeats the message and I'm sure you had in mind not doing that - and it is bulky ; you'd only use it very seldom. You might also need to deal with other compilers than GCC (and I'm not familiar enough with MSVC to know how to identify it reliably). It would be nice if #warning were standardized; it is not standardized in C99. (There was, once upon a long time ago, an SO question about such features that could be added to C and #warning came up there.) See also: Portability of #warning preprocessor directive
