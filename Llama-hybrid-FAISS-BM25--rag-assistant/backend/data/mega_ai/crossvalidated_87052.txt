I think you have some mistaken notions about PCA. The maximum number of principal component is D. Principal components are orthogonal to each other, so once you have D of them, you span the entire space. You wouldn't be able to find a D+1 principle component in a space of D dimensions, regardless of N>D. The first part is as expected. When you express your N data points in D principal components, it is a simple change of basis. Change of basis should be reversible, if the new basis is full ranked, which it is in this case. If D>N, your N datapoints lie within a smaller subspace of at most N dimensions. By using N principal components, you should be able to span that N subspace. The PCA would only be able to find N principal components. If your new data, e.g. point N+1, lies outside of the subspace spanned by the N principal components, you don't have the basis to represent the point N+1. Thus you get reconstruction error. If you do PCA again including the new data points, you will again get zero reconstruction error on your data.
