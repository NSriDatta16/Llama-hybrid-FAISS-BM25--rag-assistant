Depending on how different the cells are, you might have a separate class for each type. You can utilize the table view's built-in cell reuse to have it cache cells of different types using different reuse identifiers. Apple discourages loading table view cells from nibs, probably because it performs badly (i.e. results in jittery scrolling). But if you have a very complicated cell layout, it can be annoying to set it all up in code. I guess you'd just have to try it for yourself. Though I would recommend putting each different cell type into a different nib.
