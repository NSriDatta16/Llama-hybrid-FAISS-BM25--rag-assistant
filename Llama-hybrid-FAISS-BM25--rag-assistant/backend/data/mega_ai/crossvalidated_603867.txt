Alternatives to logistic regression if there are zero counts

I have three variables (let's call them $A$ , class (both binary) and age (numerical)), and I want to test if there is a difference in the presence of A between the two classes, with age as a potential confounder. I have been modelling this using a logistic regression, with logit link using a model like $$A \sim \mathrm{logit}\,(\alpha+\beta_0\, \mathrm{class} + \beta_1\,\mathrm{age})$$ and reading off the $\beta_0$ coefficient for the log-odds-ratio between the two classes, and using its $p$ -value to test significance between the two classes (the presence/absence of $A$ could be explained by different ages). This is easily tested using glm in R. However, this only works if there is at least one count of $A$ in each class. With a zero count, this doesn't converge (obviously). Removing age as a variable means that there is a 2x2 contingency table (the totals in each class are known), and a Fisher exact test can be applied. There is an obvious cut-off into two age groups, which means that the model can be effectively reduced into a 2x2x2 contingency table, along these lines: Age-group 1: A not-A Class 1 0 1250 Class 2 2 100 Age-group 2: A not-A Class 1 0 850 Class 2 10 20 (example data) Aside from running two separate Fisher tests on each, and correcting the p-values that arise from it, is there a test I can run to do both tests simultaneously, and extract the "class" effect?
