There's too little detail in your requirements to give good suggestions. For example are you free to pick your storage medium? Will it be a file system, database or something else? What does "minimum memory consumption" mean? Are you running on a constrained platform? Must you share resources with other applications? Is a 1GB footprint small enough if your computer has 4GB of memory? Will your data sit in memory or only the parts you are working on? If the platform was Java, I'd start with its standard serialization and then investigate custom serialization if I wasn't happy with the performance.
