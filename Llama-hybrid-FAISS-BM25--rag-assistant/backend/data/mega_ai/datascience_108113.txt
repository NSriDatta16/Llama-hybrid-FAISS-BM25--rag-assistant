Your dataframe new is already the correct embeddings to use for the test set. Just tokenize the test reviews, limit to those words in your training vocabulary, and use the vectors in new . I can't pass the whole corpus (train+test) to the Word2Vec instance as it might lead to data leakage. Correct. Should I simply pass the test list to another instance of the model No, then the embeddings would have nothing to do with each other, and any subsequent sentiment analysis model will be very confused. assign indexes to all the words in train, train word2vec on train, assign same index to similar words in test set and map the embeddings from train to test. But then again in the second method there is the problem of OOV words. Not all words present in the train will be present in test and vice versa! Not similar words between train and test, only exact matches. Doing some manual intervention might be fine, but any score thus obtained would be based on you doing the same interventions on the model in production... As for out-of-vocabulary words, that's just how these things work generally. You (rather, your model) don't know anything about those words, so you just have to discard them.
