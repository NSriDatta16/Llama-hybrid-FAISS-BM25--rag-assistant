Testing Weblogic webservices using SOAP UI

We have implemented webservices on Weblogic 10.3. I am trying to test the webservices using the SOAP UI client (soapui.org). but I get following error message: Error 401--Unauthorized Error 401--Unauthorized From RFC 2068 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 : 10.4.2 401 Unauthorized The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.46) containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field (section 14.8). If the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then the user SHOULD be presented the entity that was given in the response, since that entity MAY include relevant diagnostic information. HTTP access authentication is explained in section 11. Any idea if I need to do special config on SOAP UI. Update: after following Zeger's advice, I did a basic authentication i.e. set the username and pwd (weblogic / weblogic) to header of SOAP request (in SOAP UI). However now I get following error: wsse:InvalidSecurity Error codes: 1061 2661 1028 Error code:1061
