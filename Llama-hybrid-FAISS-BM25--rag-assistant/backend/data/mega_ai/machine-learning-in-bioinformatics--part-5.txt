ccuracy of approximately 84% when tasked to classify the amino acids of a protein sequence into one of three structural classes (helix, sheet, or coil). The theoretical limit for three-state protein secondary structure is 88â€“90%. In 2018, AlphaFold, an artificial intelligence (AI) program developed by DeepMind, placed first in the overall rankings of the 13th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP). It was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structures for targets rated as most difficult by the competition organizers, where no existing template structures were available from proteins with partially similar sequences. AlphaFold 2 (2020) repeated this placement in the CASP14 competition and achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other entry. Machine learning has also been applied to proteomics problems such as protein side-chain prediction, protein loop modeling, and protein contact map prediction. Metagenomics Metagenomics is the study of microbial communities from environmental DNA samples. Currently, limitations and challenges predominate in the implementation of machine learning tools due to the amount of data in environmental samples. Supercomputers and web servers have made access to these tools easier. The high dimensionality of microbiome datasets is a major challenge in studying the microbiome; this significantly limits the power of current approaches for identifying true differences and increases the chance of false discoveries. Despite their importance, machine learning tools related to metagenomics have focused on the study of gut microbiota and the relationship with digestive diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), colorectal cancer and diabetes, seeking better diagnosis and treatments. Many algorithms were developed to classify microbial communities according to the health condition of the host, regardless of the type of sequence data, e.g. 16S rRNA or whole-genome sequencing (WGS), using methods such as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator classifier, random forest, supervised classification model, and gradient boosted tree model. Neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Hopfield neural networks have been added. For example, in 2018, Fioravanti et al. developed an algorithm called Ph-CNN to classify data samples from healthy patients and patients with IBD symptoms (to distinguish healthy and sick patients) by using phylogenetic trees and convolutional neural networks. In addition, random forest (RF) methods and implemented importance measures help in the identification of microbiome species that can be used to distinguish diseased and non-diseased samples. However, the performance of a decision tree and the diversity of decision trees in the ensemble significantly influence the performance of RF algorithms. The generalization error for RF measures how accurate the individual classifiers are and their interdependence. Therefore, the high dimensionality problems of microbiome datasets pose challenges. Effective approaches require many possible variable combinations, which exponentially increases the computational burden as the number of features increases. For microbiome analysis in 2020 Dang & Kishino developed a novel analysis pipeline. The core of the pipeline is an RF classifier coupled with forwarding variable selection (RF-FVS), which selects a minimum-size core set of microbial species or functional signatures that maximize the predictive classifier performance. The framework combines: identifying a few significant features by a massively parallel forward variable selection procedure mapping the selected species on a phylogenetic tree, and predicting functional profiles by functional gene enrichment analysis from metagenomic 16S rRNA data. They demonstrated performance by analyzing two published datasets from large-scale case-control studies: 16S
