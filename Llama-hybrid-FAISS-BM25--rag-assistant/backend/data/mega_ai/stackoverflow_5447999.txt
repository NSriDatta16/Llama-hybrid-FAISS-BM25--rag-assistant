I have had to copy full databases (as well as just selected tables) between servers before and a SQL dump can be cumbersome if you have a lot of data. If you have access to both servers you might consider an application called "Navicat". It is a MySQL GUI interface to manage databases. You can have multiple databases on separate servers open at the same time, and can even "drag and drop" tables between databases and databases between servers.
