Expectation of a first difference of I(1) stationary?

I have a simply but still challenging question (at least to me). My question boils down to the following, if the first differences $\Delta y_t$ of an I(1) process is stationary, is then also the expectation of this $E[\Delta y_t]$ stationary? And if yes/no, why? In greater detail: I have two I(1) time series processes $y_{2t}$ and $y_{1t}$ and I am meant to show that they can be cointegrated with vector (1 -1). What I obtain is $y_{2t}-y_{1t}=E_t{\Delta y_{1t+1}}$ . Which means if $E_t{\Delta y_{1t+1}}$ would be stationary, then this would be true.
