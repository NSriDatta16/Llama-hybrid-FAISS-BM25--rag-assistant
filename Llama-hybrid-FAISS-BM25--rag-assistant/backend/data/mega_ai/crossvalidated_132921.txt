Well from my own perspective, quite often I am interested in the predictive distribution of the response variable, rather than just the conditional mean, and in that case it is better to use a likelihood that more correctly represents the target distribution. For instance, I like to use kernelised linear models rather than (say) support vector regression, because I can use a Poisson likelihood if I want to. As a lot of machine learning people are Bayesians, I suspect that using a different likelihood will seem more elegant than transformations (choosing an appropriate likelihood is generally the first step).
