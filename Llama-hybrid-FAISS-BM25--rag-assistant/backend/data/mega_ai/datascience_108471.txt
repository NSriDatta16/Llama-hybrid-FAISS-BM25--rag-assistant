Precision and recall are defined for a single binary classification problem, they cannot be used directly for either multi-class or multi-label classification. However one can use micro-average or macro-average precision (or recall), this is the standard way to evaluate with multiple classes. Apparently you're using macro-average and your example should be interpreted like this: class 1 class 2 class 3 Ground-Truth: [[1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1]] Prediction: [[1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]] With precision being calculated for class 1. If so you have a mistake for class 3, the precision is also 1, not 0.5. To answer your question: in the case of class 2, precision is not zero, it's undefined (NaN) since there's no instance predicted positive. Strictly speaking, the macro-average is also undefined because one value is NaN. But if you must calculate the macro-average value, it makes much more sense to discard class 2 as in option (a) rather than count its precision as zero as in option (b), which is incorrect.
