Quantifying Uncertainty in Regression Models

I have the following question about quantifying uncertainty in regression models. As an example, I took a publicly available data set on heights and weights ( https://gist.github.com/nstokoe/7d4717e96c21b8ad04ec91f361b000cb#file-weight-height-csv ) and fit a linear regression model to this data (predicting height using weight) with the R programming language. #load libraries library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(broom) library(ggpubr) #load data my_data = read.csv("height_weight_data.csv") head(h) Gender Height Weight 1 Male 73.84702 241.8936 2 Male 68.78190 162.3105 3 Male 74.11011 212.7409 4 Male 71.73098 220.0425 5 Male 69.88180 206.3498 6 Male 67.25302 152.2122 #fit regression model > linear_model summary(linear_model) Call: lm(formula = Height ~ Weight, data = my_data) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -5.8142 -0.9907 0.0263 0.9918 5.5950 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 4.848e+01 7.507e-02 645.8 As expected, a plot of data along with the regression model indicates that height and weight have a linear relationship - the taller someone is, the more they are expected to weigh. We can see the regression model over here: Height = 4.848e+01 + 1.108e-01 * Weight My Question: Although completely illogical, there is technically nothing stopping this regression model from predicting the (non-sensical) height of a person with negative weight, or the height of a person with an extreme weight. For example: Height = 4.848e+01 + (1.108e-01 * - 300 lbs) = 15.24 inches Height = 4.848e+01 + (1.108e-01 * 6720 lbs) = 793.056 inches Is there where the advantages of Bayesian Models comes into play? Assuming a similar Bayesian Linear Regression model was made that had "logical and realistic" priors on the model parameters - in the case where the user would try to predict the height of a "non-sensical" weight, could the Bayesian Model provide a "Red Flag"/sanity check by showing that the uncertainty on the height estimate of a person weighing 7800 lbs is very high, thereby cautioning the user to trust this estimate and review the source of this new data point? Thanks!
