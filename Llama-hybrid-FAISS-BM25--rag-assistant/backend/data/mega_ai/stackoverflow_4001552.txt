This is logical row reads* averaged over whatever the top of SHOW INNODB STATUS says it's running the report for. So it's not the same as the pages section (which contains physical page operations). It's a good performance metric to model, since it can show the general demands on your database from your application. If the demands don't increase, but your performance gets worse, look at if your data set has increased, etc. Maybe this is causing more physical IO? [*] A logical row read may have to still read many pages, for example if it has to find an older version (MVCC) from undo.
