There are two default parameters to auto.arima() that are relevant here. First, auto.arima() by default limits the orders of AR and MA coefficients, as well as the amount of differencing. Here are the relevant parameters with their default values: max.p=5, max.q=5, max.d=2 . There are very good reasons for this default behavior: Why does default auto.arima stop at (5,2,5)? and Order of ARMA models . Second, even if you were to specify higher maximum orders, auto.arima() might not find the AIC-minimal model, because it does by default not search all possible models, but proceeds in a greedy stepwise fashion ( stepwise=TRUE ). You can of course both increase the maximum orders and set stepwise=FALSE . Be prepared for a long model selection and fitting process, especially if you have a long time series. (Or multiple series.) In any case, as per above , there are good reasons not to spend too much time on higher ARIMA orders. The authors of the forecast package know what they are doing, and higher orders may well yield lower AICs, but they will typically not lead to smaller out-of-sample forecast errors. Have you assessed your more complicated models on holdout samples? I would strongly recommend you do so.
