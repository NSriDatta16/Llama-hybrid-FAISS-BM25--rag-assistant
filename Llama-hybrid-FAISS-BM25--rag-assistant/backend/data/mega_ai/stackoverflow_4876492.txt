So you want to take an image and "blend it into a single color". Are you trying to get the 'average color' for the image? If so, using a Gaussian filter is perhaps overcomplicating it, since the output you require is simply a single RGB value. The easiest way to do this is to compute the average for each color channel (red, green and blue): int r,g,b; r=g=b=0; for (y=0 ; y A Gaussian filter is a center-weighted filter , meaning that the pixel in the center of the filtering window is weighted more heavily than the others. If you want to blur an image, then this is appropriate, but for blending an entire image, equally weighting all pixels, as in the pseudo-code above, is just as effective.
