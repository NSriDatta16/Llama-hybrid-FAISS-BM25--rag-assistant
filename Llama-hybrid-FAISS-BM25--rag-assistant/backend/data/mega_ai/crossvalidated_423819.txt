I don't think this is really about Type 1 and 2 errors. This looks more like an optimization problem. Nevertheless, considering what we discussed in the comments, solving this is a simple problem. What we need to do is, for every value of alpha (CDF of the null distribution in the upper tail) multiply it by 100, that is how much you will pay on average for type 1 errors. To this you add how much you will pay for type 2 at this point, which is the CDF / probability / p-value of the second distribution in the lower tail. You can repeat this for many such points and find the minimum, that is minimize loss.
