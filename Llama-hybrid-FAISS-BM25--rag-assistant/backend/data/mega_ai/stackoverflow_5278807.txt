I have never heard of or seen redundant cast optimizations on the CLR. Lets try a contrived example object number = 5; int iterations = 10000000; int[] storage = new int[iterations]; var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew(); for (int i = 0; i On my machine, running under release, I am consistantly getting about 350k ticks for redundant redundancy and 280k ticks for self optimzation. So no, it looks like the CLR does not optimize for this.
