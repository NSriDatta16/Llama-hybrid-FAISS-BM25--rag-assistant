I would steer clear of filemaker pro for several reasons. It costs money, which being a non-profit organisation could be better spent elsewhere. You can only use File maker pro on the one computer. If you need it on another computer you will have to fork out for a filemaker server licence. It can get slow with lots of records. It's proprietary, so there's no avenue for troubleshooting under the hood if problems arise down the track The CiviCRM looks good. It's web based which means you can have unlimited users accessing your database It's open source, which means finding a developer to do the transfer of your existing database will be easier. Because its open, any features it may not have can be built in. It's free! Tim
