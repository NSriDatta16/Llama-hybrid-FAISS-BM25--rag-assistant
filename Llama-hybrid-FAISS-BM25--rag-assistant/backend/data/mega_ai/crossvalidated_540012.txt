What transformation to apply before linear regression?

I'm trying to remove the autocorrelation from a time series with linear regression based on past values. But as this plot shows ( y is 1-step head values averaged for each x which is 100 groups of ordered previous values), the relationship is highly non-linear: Since there's a very distinctive shape, is there a standard approach to transforming the data before using ordinary least squares?
