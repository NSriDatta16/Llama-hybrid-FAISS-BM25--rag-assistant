It comes down to experimentation and two things: The total observations on the dataset Do you know how many categories? Sample size [ [20,10k) Minibatch k-means, just to have a second option Hierarchical clustering. [>10k] k-means or Spectral clustering. Number of categories If you don't know how many classes you have on your data and you're exploring this try with the "Mean Shift" model which will also need you to initialize the fitting process with a candidate centroid. Variational Gaussian Mixture models are stable and can help you to find the “ideal” number of classes but I would suggest finding the ideal number of classes with these methods: Elbow method, Average silhouette, Gap statistic
