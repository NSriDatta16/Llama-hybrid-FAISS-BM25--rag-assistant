I have done this recently and had to write a JNI to capture the video and encode it or decode it. It is a pain because you have to write the JNI for each platform like Windows 32 and 64 bit, OSX 32 and 64 bit and Linux 32 and 64 bit. Using JNLP (Java web start) is a better choice than an applet as it allows you to set it up so it will automatically download and install the correct JNI for the current O/S. Either a JNLP or Applet will require you to generate a signed jar to work.
