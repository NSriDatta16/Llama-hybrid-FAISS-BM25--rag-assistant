You're right. Mathematically speaking, your vectors belong to different vector spaces, so they can't be compared or aggregated directly. Unless you somehow project them into the same vector space. In this sense, given the data in these vectors are probabilities, isn't it the case that the probability of an item that does not belong to a particular vector is $0$ ? Namely, $w_1 = \left[0.1,0.2,0.7\right]$ for $A,B,C$ imply $\mathbb{P}(D)=0$ . If that's so, you can project them all onto $\mathbb{R}^{26}$ , and this would allow you to aggregate (e.g. sum, average, etc.) them properly. By this I mean that the resulting projection of the $w_1$ of my example would be $w_1^{*} = \left[0.1,0.2,0.7,0,...,0\right]$ .
