Are Bayesian methods robust to violations of normality?

Consider the simple case $$x|\sigma^2 \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$ $$\sigma^2\sim IG(\alpha,\beta)$$ Then, marginally, $f(x) \propto (\beta + x^2/2)^{-\alpha}$ , is a t-distribution. Does this mean that the current model (and generally similar Bayesian models) are robust to violations of normality?
