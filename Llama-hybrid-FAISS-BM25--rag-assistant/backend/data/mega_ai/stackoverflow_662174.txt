I use state-based programming and a trick I've always wanted to employ was to reserve one output port for the current state in binary. Then hook up a logic analyzer and see the timings of the state changes. You could do something similar here: Do what Robert said and create a global variable and change its value at key points - preferably with a function that immediately sets the value of the port to the current state (ie changeState(nextState); ) Change the state when you enter the function that kicks the dog, then change it back to the previous state before you leave the function. You should be able to see from what functions it DOESN'T get kicked and then you can work on those. Good luck, it sounds like a timing problem and those are tough to solve.
