Is Sarima(0,0,0)(5,0,0,12) the same as the 5 year avg of a given month?

Trying to understand big P,D,Q in sarima better. Could probably ask a broader question to get more info but my first question is making sure I understand at least the seasonal AR term. With m=12 (monthly data), say the month being forecast is May, would Sarima(0,0,0)(5,0,0) just return the average of the value for May the past 5 years?
