SD-Card Life while using it to store a data structure

I have come up with a disk-based data structure to store incoming realtime data, this is not in memory becuase the array can fill up and cause the jvm to crash. The data-strcture and algorithm work great. My only question is that does this greatly affect the life of an sdcard? I know sdcards have limited read and writes on them, but how much is "limited". Will writing to the sd Card for say on average 20 minutes per session affect the sd card greatly to the point where the user sees that it was this app that killed it?
