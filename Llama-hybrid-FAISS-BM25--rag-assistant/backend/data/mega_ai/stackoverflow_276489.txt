Full text search on a mobile device?

We'll soon be embarking on the development of a new mobile application. This particular app will be used for heavy searching of text based fields. Any suggestions from the group at large for what sort of database engine is best suited to allowing these types of searches on a mobile platform? Specifics include Windows Mobile 6 and we'll be using the .Net CF. Also some of the text based fields will be anywhere between 35 and 500 characters. The device will operate in two different methods, batch and WiFi. Of course for WiFi we can just submit requests to a full blown DB engine and just fetch results back. This question centres around the "batch" version which will house a database loaded with information on the devices flash/removable storage card. At any rate, I know SQLCE has some basic indexing but you don't get into the real fancy "full text" style indexes until you've got the full blown version which of course isn't available on a mobile platform. An example of what the data would look like: "apron carpenter adjustable leather container pocket waist hardware belt" etc. etc. I haven't gotten into the evaluation of any other specific options yet as I figure I'd leverage the experience of this group in order to first point me down some specific avenues. Any suggestions/tips?
