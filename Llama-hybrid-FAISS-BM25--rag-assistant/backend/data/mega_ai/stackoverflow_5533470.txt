Regarding the inline scripts, there is a programmatic solution. You could write an Observer that binds to the core_block_abstract_to_html_after or controller_action_layout_render_before Events which fire immediately prior to outputting the rendered HTML. In your Observer, you could use a preg_replace to insert a head.ready statement immediately after each tag. It would add a fraction more to the render time, but I suspect it would be less than the latency of downloading the libraries. And if you're using full page caching, then the function would only be called once. You could use the inbuilt Magento Profiler to test the impact. Worth a try at least. HTH, JD
