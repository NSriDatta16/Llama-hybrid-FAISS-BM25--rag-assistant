jackknifing blocks (*not* time series)

I have the following problem. There are 50 subjects. Each subject does a block of 100 trials. At the end I want to compute a complicated statistic s() on the data x. Now I want to be able to compute a confidence interval on this statistic, and so need an estimate of SD(s(x)). Please let me know what you think of this idea: do a jackknife, but instead of computing s() for x[-i], i=1 to 50 (where -i means delete observation x[i]) in the usual jackknifing way, instead compute s() deleting each subject . Then get the SD estimate the usual way. So I'll have 50 pseudovalues instead of 5000. The idea of this is that fundamentally, most variability in s() will be caused by subjects anyway, so it makes sense to jackknife those. And in reality it would have been impossible to miss a single x value (they were always collected in blocks of 100), but certainly possible to have a missing subject. Thanks for any help. My google searches for "jackknife blocks" have only turned up refs relevant to time series.
