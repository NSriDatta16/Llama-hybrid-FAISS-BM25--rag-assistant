It is not necessary for $p(z)$ and $q(z|x)$ to be normal distributions in a VAE. We can have discrete VAEs too wherein $z$ are discrete. The distribution you've shown for $z$ is completely valid. It's a multinomial/categorical distribution. However, a mistake in your example is that you take $z$ to be observed (you know the value of the sum $S$ = $z$ ). In VAEs, $z$ is supposed to be latent/unobserved, and $x$ is observed. So I don't think your example is valid. Here's my attempt at a real-world example using Discrete VAE. Let's say your data $X$ is the output of rolling a die, so $X = \{1, 3, 5, 6, 1, 4, 2, ...\}$ . You want to figure out what the probabilities of the six faces are. The die is loaded, so it isn't just 1/6 for each face. Now comes the modeling part. You assume that there is some hidden (latent) variable $z$ that determines how the die is loaded. If $z = 0$ , then the die favors {1,2,3}. If $z = 1$ , the die favors {4,5,6}. So the generative story is as follows Sample $z$ from $p(z)$ = Bernoulli( $\theta = 0.5$ ) - like a coin toss Sample $x$ from $p(x|z)$ = Multinoulli( $[p_{01}, p_{02}, p_{03}, p_{04}, p_{05}, p_{06}]$ ) if $z$ is 0 or Multinoulli( $[p_11..p_16]$ ) if $z$ is 1 (just a vague model) You'd expect that $[p_{01}, p_{02}, p_{03}]$ are higher as compared to $[p_{04}, p_{05}, p_{06}]$ , and vice-versa for $z = 1$ case. The parameters you learn with VAE-style training are 12 $p_{ij}$ s for the decoder part. For encoder, you could approximate the posterior with $q_{\phi}(z | x) = Bern(\phi)$ . Effectively, you are gaining two things by modeling the die problem as above. Given this data $X$ , can I tell if my die is {1,2,3}-ish loaded or {4,5,6}-ish loaded? This comes from "Encoder" q(z | x). I'm being vague about what $z$ means because that's what it is. It's unknown. We just hope that it means something (like {4,5,6}-ish). If I sample $z$ (0 or 1) - can I tell what $x$ I'd get? This is "decoding" -- $p(x|z)$ . This gives me the power to "generate" data that looks almost similar to rolls of the die. Another example - data $X$ = heights of students (continuous), and hidden $z$ could be the grades they belong to (discrete). Check this answer for an understanding of continuous VAEs with a better example. Here, $x$ is an image (discrete pixel data of MNIST digits), and $z$ is continuous. The directions/vectors in z-space could be "italic", "bold" etc. Generative story for a variational auto encoder
