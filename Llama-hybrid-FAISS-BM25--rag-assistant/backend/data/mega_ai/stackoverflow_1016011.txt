So, it looks like user profiles are just too situation specific for any framework. Shame, because there's a lot of basic functionality that could be served by a basic framework. On the "solution" front, I'm attending the Open Source Bridge conference in Portland, Or. and recently saw topics on Scala (Two word description: Java scripting) and a framework built on that called Lift (three word description: CodeIgniter for Java). In short, these technologies rock my world. Anyone looking for robust web frameworks should check out Lift. Scala allows people who love programming in Python and Ruby to use Java's JVM without the cost, with a lot of syntactic elegance (Scala is somewhat more intuitive to my Python-centric mind than Clojure). Lift is a MVC-style framework built on Scala which is just plain beautiful- and frighteningly easy to use. Normal disclaimers, but the upshot is that it will take significantly less time to build an app-specific solution for a scalable Java app using these technologies than trying to find a user profile framework to use.
