Are you looking for cyclomatic complexity (Wikipedia) ? It basically computes the number of paths through a piece of code. There are some projects to compute that for Python code, for example PyMetrics or this one . Google will certainly bring up more. But I don't know of any further integration with unit tests that will show you the coverage.
