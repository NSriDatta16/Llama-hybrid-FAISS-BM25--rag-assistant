Distributing Inline Elements Using CSS

Is there an easy way to distribute inline elements within a parent block container using CSS? Setting margins to auto doesn't work since the margins between inline elements are set to 0 and I don't want to mess around with percentages as the content is dynamic. In particular, I have several anchor elements (a) within a paragraph (p) that spans 80% of its container and I'm looking for an easy way to distribute them evenly within the paragraph. EDIT (@cletus): The paragraph will not wrap and the anchors are the only thing in the paragraph. By distribute evenly, I mean that the space between the left (right) edge and first (last) element and the elements themselves is equidistant.
