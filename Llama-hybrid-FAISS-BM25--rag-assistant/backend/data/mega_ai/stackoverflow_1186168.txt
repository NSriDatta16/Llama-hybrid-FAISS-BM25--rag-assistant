I am suspicious that two developers, one .NET and one PHP, of the same skill level and seniority, in the same region, have any statistically significant difference in their respective rates. It is possible that, given PHP's much lower barrier to entry, the PHP skills market is more saturated with beginner level and relatively unskilled programmers, compared to .NET. That could skew averages, but that is very different than saying "PHP developers are cheaper than .NET"
