Your question contains a "contradiction". The way you have described it, the variable defined as $X$ cannot have a Poisson distribution . I'll explain why. So, you choose a cut-off point, $y_{0}$, and define the original variables $Y_{i}\:(i=1,\dotsc,r)$. You then take a new variable $X_{i}$ and define it as: $$ X_{i} \equiv \Bigg( \begin{matrix} 1 & Y_{i} > y_{0} \\ 0 & Y_{i} \leq y_{0} \end{matrix} $$ Then $X=\sum_{i} X_{i} \sim Poisson(\lambda)$. Raikov's theorem Says that this implies the individual terms are also poisson $X_{i}\sim Poisson(\frac{\lambda}{r})$. But this is impossible, for as $X_{i}$ has been defined, it can only have two values $(0,1)$, a Poisson has support $(0,1,2,\dots)$. Therefore $X$ cannot be poisson. From the way it has been defined in the question $X$ is binomially distributed $$X \sim Bin(r,\theta)$$ where $$\theta \equiv Pr(Y_{i}>y_{0})=1-F_{Y}(y_{0})$$ What your bootstrap procedure is doing is attempting to estimate $E(X)=r\theta$, but the estimate of $\theta$ is just given by $\hat{\theta}=\frac{X_{obs}}{r}$ and has variance of $\frac{\hat{\theta}(1-\hat{\theta})}{r+I_{B}}$ where $I_{B}$ is what I call the "Bayesian indicator". If you are Bayesian, with haldene prior, $I_{B}=1$, if you are frequentist then $I_{B}=0$. You could do a bootstrap if you wanted, by because the maths is there, I'm sure you would get the same answers for big enough bootstrap samples (the simulation will only demonstrate the maths). Also note that the binomial is "under-dispersed" with the mean being greater than the variance, as your bootstrap shows. Also your 3 iterations are "approximately" in line with theoretical mean $r\hat{\theta}=2$ and theoretical variance $r\hat{\theta}(1-\hat{\theta})=1.2$. From looking at the bootstrap samples, this is to be expected (your average/variance being below the theoretical average/variance) as you sampled the "high" number disproportionately in 2 of the simulations.
