Input Tensor Shape for CNN Binary Classification of Time Series Data

I want to predict whether a machine will fail based on the most recent set of measurements taken by on-board sensors. I have several dozen machines, each with a sensor that takes a measurement at regular intervals. Some machines have already failed, but most have not. The resulting dataset looks something like the example data below, with one row for each machine, showing the 30 most recent sensor measurements as well as a "failure" designation, where 0 indicates that the machine is still operational, and 1 indicates that the machine failed after the measurement taken at time30 .

Should my input tensor have the shape of ( num_of_samples , 1, 30), or ( num_of_samples , 30, 1), where the 30 is the number of time point measurements per sample? I've made a related post here that is more code-focused and has additional specifics about the structure of my CNN using PyTorch.
