You can use OLS! Remember that VAR have structural qualities that permit OLS for estimation equation by equation. Namely, in VAR models each dependent variable is a linear function of both lagged values of itself as well as the other time series included in the model. If you expand your equations by multiplying out the matrices, you will see how the errors affect the other estimates. With reference to your question about "distortion" do you mean bias or inefficiency in the parameter estimates? I think I know how to answer your question but I want to make sure I understand it first. LMK!
