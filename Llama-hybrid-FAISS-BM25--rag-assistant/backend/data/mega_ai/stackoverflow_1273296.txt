How to check what connections a given process has created to the internet

I mean, if you use tools like NetLimiter, they let you know that a given process that connections to IP1, IP2, etc. I am using packet sniffing for my application, but I only need to packet sniff one application, so I'd like to know to what ip addresses that application is connected. Any easy way to do this? I am using a wrapper for WinPCap. edit: After googling I came to know about the -netstat -bno command. It seems to do what I want, but I'd like to know if there are any specific functions do do it. Otherwise, I'll use this. edit2: w i n d o w s !
