thanks for the help. I found the solution. I thought it might be a module or a coding change I have made so I decided to create a new drupal install and only install the modules needed. I still had the same problem, very strange indeed. I eventually found the this article, with someone whom has had the same issues. http://drupal.org/node/699458 The following needs to be added to the pageroute.module options['neighbours']['forward']) ) { drupal_redirect_form($form, $route->path.'/'.$page->options['neighbours']['forward']); return; } /* hack saturnino part */ // no page access -> try redirect if (!$route->checkPageAccess($page->name, $form_state['target'])) { unset($form_state['storage']); $form_state['rebuild'] = FALSE; if ($route->options['redirect_path']) { drupal_redirect_form($form, pageroute_get_redirect_path($page)); return; } drupal_not_found(); pageroute_exit_now(); return; } $form_state['rebuild'] = TRUE; } ?> thanks for your help
