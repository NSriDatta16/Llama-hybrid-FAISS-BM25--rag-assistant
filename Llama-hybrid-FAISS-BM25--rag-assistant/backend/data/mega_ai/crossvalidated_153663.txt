How to get the most important variables in random forests in R?

I am building a random forest in R and was wondering how to extract the most important variables. I am using a random forest to classify if a click is fraud or not, and the goal is to identify characteristics that increase the probability of a click being fraud. Would the importance() and varImpPlot() R functions be helpful in identifying these variables or are there any other ways? The idea is to describe to a nontechnical client what the most important variables are. Are there any plots I could use to show the importance of these variables?
