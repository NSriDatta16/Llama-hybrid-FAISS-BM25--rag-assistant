logistic regression with dummy regressors

I'm considering a logistic regression of $Y$ on $X_1,...,X_K$ where $X_1,...,X_K$ are all dummy variables. I'm wondering if the MLE of such a logistic regression is statistically valid since non of $X$ is continuous. If valid, how can I interpet the estimation results?
