jquery prevent removing every table row

Table rows can be added or removed. I've set up a confirm to warn the user if they try to remove their own row (the first row that's loaded from the database); if they are setting it up for someone else, they may need to do that. The second row (class=leaderrow) is empty and that leaderrow is what is cloned when the addRow button is clicked. How can I prevent (or at least warn) the user from removing every leaderrow in the table? If all the leaderrows are removed, the add button fails. Here's the jQuery: $("a.self").live('click', function(){ go=confirm('After saving you will lose the ability to edit this organization. Continue to remove yourself?') if(go){ $(this).parent().parent().remove(); } return false; // prevent link to jump to a page. }); $("a.remove").live('click', function(){ $(this).parents('tr').remove(); return false; // prevent link to jump to a page. }); Here's the table, which is part of a form: Name* Action User's own name remove Sue Jeannie Kerry Travis remove
