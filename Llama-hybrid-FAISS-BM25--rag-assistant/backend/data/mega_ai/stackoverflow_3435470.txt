jQuery-UI Draggable Droppable event handler You need to get the droppable dom object from the event arguments passed to the drop method. $( ".selector" ).droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { // $(this) represents the droppable. alert($(this).attr("id")); } }); the draggable object can be referenced through ui.draggable . Most of this was taken from the jQuery-UI documentation found at the jQuery-ui Website Adding Droppable to a Dynamically Added Element In the event that the elements, let's call them stage targets, are being added dynamically to the "stage" then you would want to call the droppable method on those elements when they are created. function makeStageTargets(i) { for(i;i--;true){ var d = $("div").attr("id","item_"+i); // this will make a div id item_i $("stage").append(d); d.droppable( drop:function(e, ui){ var param = $(ui.draggable).attr('src'); $("stage").remove(ui.draggable); // this will remove an item when dropped addlist(param); }); } } makeStageTargets(60); If I have missed the spirit of your question please advise.
