ip.onblur is an event handler... i.e. it's a function Now, when you alert a function, FF will show you the source code for that function (if it's user defined). That is why you're seeing the plain text of the variable name. For an event handler, this is the element that is currently handling the event. So, if you're setting the onblur handler of an input box, you will have access to the contents of that input box. The code sample that you provided: ip.onblur = function onblur(event){stopCalcUpInt(this,this.value);} should work correctly. Try ip.onblur = function onblur(event){alert(this.value); stopCalcUpInt(this,this.value);} if you want to be sure
