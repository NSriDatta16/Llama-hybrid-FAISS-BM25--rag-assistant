How to up-cast to a generic object?

I have an array of Castle windsor registration components of type IRegistration[] In this case ComponentRegistration : IRegistration For each element in my array, if it can be upcast to ComponentRegistration<> I would like to upcast it back to ComponentRegistration and process it. How exactly would I do this? I got as far as foreach (var r in registrations) { if(typeof(ComponentRegistration<>).IsAssignableFrom(r.GetType())) { var cr = CAST r SOMEHOW DoStuff(cr); }
