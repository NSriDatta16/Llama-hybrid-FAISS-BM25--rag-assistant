How can i get content of web-page

i'm trying to get web-page data in string that than i could parse it. I didn't found any methods in qwebview, qurl and another. Could you help me? Linux, C++, Qt. EDIT: Thanks for help. Code is working, but some pages after downloading have broken charset. I tried something like this to repair it: QNetworkRequest *request = new QNetworkRequest(QUrl("http://ru.wiktionary.org/wiki/bovo")); request->setRawHeader( "User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); " "en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070206 Firefox/3.0.1" ); request->setRawHeader( "Accept-Charset", "win1251,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7" ); request->setRawHeader( "charset", "utf-8" ); request->setRawHeader( "Connection", "keep-alive" ); manager->get(*request); Any results =(.
