Why is recommended depth of Boruta random forest between 3 and 7?

On the BorutaPy GitHub page, the authors state: "We highly recommend using pruned trees with a depth between 3-7" ( https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/boruta_py ). What justification is there for using a depth in this range? I've seen this recommendation reiterated many times by others citing the BorutaPy authors without explanation. If I have many features and suspect that there are highly complex patterns in my dataset, would you recommend deviating from this suggestion and using a larger depth?
