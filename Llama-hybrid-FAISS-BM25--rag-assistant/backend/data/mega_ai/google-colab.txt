Google Colaboratory, or Google Colab for short, is a free, cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment provided by Google. It allows users to write and execute Python code through the browser, especially suited for machine learning, data analysis, and education. Google Colab provides an online integrated development environment (IDE) for Python that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. It offers free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs, making it popular among researchers and students working on deep learning and data science projects. Features Supports Python 3 Built on top of Jupyter Notebook Free access to limited GPU/TPU computing resources Integration with Google Drive for saving and loading notebooks Ability to share notebooks like Google Docs Multiple users can collaborate and work on the same document at the same time Compatible with popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn Limitations Idle timeouts and session limits Limited access to high-performance hardware without a paid subscription See also Amazon SageMaker CoCalc — does Jupyter notebooks, Markdown, LaTeX, RMarkdown, Linux terminal, SageMath, GNU Octave.
