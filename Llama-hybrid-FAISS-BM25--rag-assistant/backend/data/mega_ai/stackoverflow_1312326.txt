Not voting the question down, because a lot of people ask about this kind of thing. However... The next words out of anyone's mouth after this is asked should be, " Popular with who? ". Popular is a useless word to apply to programming languages. There is no universally accepted meaning of it, so there's objective way to measure it. For example, the obvious thing to do would be to go out and count up worldwide deployed LOC in every software project in use. When you do that, you'd discover that hands-down the most popular language is Cobol . Someone else might think the obvious way to measure would be by Google hits. Doing that, they'd find that Java gets 282 million results, while C# gets 48 million , and Cobol only gets 6.5 million . So clearly Java is more popular than C#, and way more popular than Cobol. A third person might think the obvious way to check is to look at SO tags . They'd find the single most used tag here is C# (34K uses so far). Cobol only has been used 65 times here. So clearly C# is the most popular, and almost nobody uses Cobol. So who is right? All three are. It depends on what you really meant when you asked the question. For those who are surprised at my Cobol assertion, I suggest reading this (somewhat dated 2003) article on the subject. It will be a real eye-opener. It could be argued that we non-Cobol programmers are all working around the margins of a gigantic Cobol world.
