Conceptualizing Cocoa Touch Views, Controllers & OO programming in general

This is pretty high level but Cocoa is big and I'm still trying to get my head around it. Can someone validate my expectations... Say I'd like to have a variable number of views (images of cars for example) on the screen that the user can touch and move around. Would you start by subclassing UIView with UIImage property (as opposed to UIImageView or a UIButton). Then instantiate say "red", "blue" and "yellow" cars in the view controller and store them in an NSMutableArray? I could set up the initial layout in Interface Builder but not sure how to connect the custom objects back to the array? Some need to start in a rotated state. Haven't been able to figure out how to rotate in IB either?!? So I'm guessing in this case it'd be better to build the initial state in code before view displays. Finally, once displayed, handle the touchesBegan, Ended, etc., the animation and the logic of adding, removing and counting "cars" in the view controller?
