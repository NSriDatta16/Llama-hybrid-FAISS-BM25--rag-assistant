Test for nonlinearity in cross-sectional time series data in R

I have a cross sectional time series dataset that looks like this: Country Year X1 France 2008 1 France 2009 2 France 2010 3 France 2011 4 France 2012 5 Germany 2008 1 Germany 2009 2 Germany 2010 3 Germany 2011 4 Germany 2012 5 Is there a simple approach to determining with a hypothesis test whether a linear or nonlinear regression is most appropriate for modeling X1's relationship with time? Solution within R is preferred. Thank you.
