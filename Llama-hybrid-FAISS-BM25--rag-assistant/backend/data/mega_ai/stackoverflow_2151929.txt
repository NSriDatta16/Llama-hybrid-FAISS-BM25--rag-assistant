Personally, I like to be able to "see" everything. Then again, I have a pretty decent monitor. But seriously, I like nice and small functions vs. gigantic functions with nested "if" statments. Same with a lines of code. At the end of the day, it comes down to personal preference and whatever you and your team members decide. Be consistent. And favor readability for the next guy that looks at your code.
