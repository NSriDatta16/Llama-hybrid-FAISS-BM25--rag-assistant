Feature Engineering with Focus on KNN

I have seen a number of helpful posts such as this one on feature engineering, but I am specifically looking for something that may be helpful when using KNN. In my experience, some features work best with one model but when transferred to KNN fail to produce good results. Thanks in advance.
