A data driven prior is not necessarily what you need. It sounds more like you need a hierarchical prior or a multi-level model. This involves the use of so called "random effects" in your model. The most basic form of such a model is given as $$(y_{ij}|\beta_0,u_i,\sigma^2)\sim\mathcal{N}(\beta_0+u_i,\sigma^2)$$ Where i indexes your source, and j indexes the specific measured conversion. We then specify a prior for the $u_i$ by using another parameter: $$(u_i|\tau^2)\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\tau^2)$$ Then you complete the prior by specifying a distribution for $p(\beta_0,\sigma^2,\tau^2)$. Usually uniform is fine. What this structure does is to cause the predictions for a to be a weighted average of the prediction using all the data and the predictions using only the data from the ith source. This sounds like what you're looking for.
