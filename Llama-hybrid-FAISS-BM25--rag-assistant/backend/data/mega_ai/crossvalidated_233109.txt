The estimator of the population variance is biased when applied on a sample of the population. In order to adjust for that bias on needs to divide by n-1 instead of n. One can show mathematically that the estimator of the sample variance is unbiased when we divide by n-1 instead of n. A formal proof is provided here: https://economictheoryblog.com/2012/06/28/latexlatexs2/ Initially it was the mathematical correctness that led to the formula, I suppose. However, if one wants to add intuition to a formula the already mentioned suggestions appear reasonable. First, observations of a sample are on average closer to the sample mean than to the population mean. The variance estimator makes use of the sample mean and as a consequence underestimates the true variance of the population. Dividing by n-1 instead of n corrects for that bias. Furthermore, dividing by n-1 make the variance of a one-element sample undefined rather than zero.
