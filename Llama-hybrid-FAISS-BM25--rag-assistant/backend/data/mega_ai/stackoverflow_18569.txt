The only reason we store images in our tables is because each table (or set of tables per range of work) is temporary and dropped at the end of the workflow. If there was any sort of long term storage we'd definitely opt for storing file paths. It should also be noted that we work with a client/server application internally so there's no web interface to worry about.
