The "feature" you describe is called register_globals. It was a failed attempt to make coding easier by magically creating variables from external input. In the end, it only lead to insecure and hard to maintain code. The PHP manual itself warns about it: http://es.php.net/manual/en/security.globals.php It's been discouraged for several years now. In PHP/5.2 it was no longer the default setting, in PHP/5.3 it was tagged as deprecated and it's expected to be removed from the language some day. If you are going to dig into a pile or poorly written old code, you should really make the effort of porting it to the latest PHP version. Otherwise, it'd be better to just configure your server so it can run the legacy code as-is. To sum up: If you want to keep the legacy code, enable register globals: http://es.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.register-globals If you want to rewrite the code, install PHP/5.3 in your development box, make sure register_globals is disabled and enable full error reporting: http://es.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting Update You apparently need to enable magic quotes as well. Escaping input data for SQL queries is often regarded as a security issue but that's not entirely true: you need to escape input so your app does not crash when the user types a legitimate single quote.
