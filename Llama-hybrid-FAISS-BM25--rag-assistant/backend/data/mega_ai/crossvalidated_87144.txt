Computing scalar/dot product between principal component and data

I am very new to R and statistics so this may be a simple question. I have a matrix (1000,756) containing 1000 years of winter sea-level pressure data (SLP) at 756 locations in the North Atlantic. I need to identify an oscillation in SLP anomalies (i.e. the difference between high and low regions in the North and South), called the North Atlantic Oscillation. I have done a principal component analysis of the data using princomp . According to the literature I need to use the leading PC and ... project the time series of SLP anomaly Ô¨Åelds on to this pattern (i.e. compute the scalar or dot product between field and pattern). Can anyone help me with how to do this?
