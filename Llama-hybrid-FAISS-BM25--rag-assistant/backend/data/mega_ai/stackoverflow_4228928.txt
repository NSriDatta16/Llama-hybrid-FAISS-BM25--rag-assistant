How To Write a Section/Part/Chapter Title with Words from Multiple Languages in LaTeX

I have been looking for an answer to this for a while. To clarify what I want just in case my question title might seem ambiguous: \section{Привет and Xin Chào!} Some text... I am using the babel package to use different languages in my paragraphs and I thought I could use the commands inside \section{} but it didn't work. Commands such as these: \selectlanguage{language} \begin{otherlanguage}{language} text \end{otherlanguage} I also tried declaring a variable for the particular section title like this: \newcommand{\multiLangSectionTitle}{ \selectlanguage{russian} Привет \begin{otherlanguage}{vietnam} and Xin Chào \end{otherlanguage} } Thinking that it will act like as a unit when I do \section{\multiLangSectionTitle} but it didn't work either. Any ideas welcome. Many thanks for your help! LD
