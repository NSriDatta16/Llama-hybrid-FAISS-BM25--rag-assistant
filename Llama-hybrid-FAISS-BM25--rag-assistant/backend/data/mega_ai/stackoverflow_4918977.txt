Does C# 3.0 support the concept of partial properties?

I am using Linq to sql concept to manipulate my data from asp.net mvc application to sql server. In the middle of flow, I need to serialize the objects, but for some reason LINQ doesn't support circular class associations. I used [Scriptingnore] attribute to those properties which are not able to serialize. This works fine. But I want to avoid to changing the designer.cs file generated by the framework again and again. So I was just thinking about how if I can create partial class of those classes and make partial those properties too in these partial classes. That way I would not need to change the designer .cs file. So is there any such concept, so that I can avoid adding the attribute to the property in the designer.cs class? That way I would get relief from making the changes every time I drag the tables on .dbml file. ( it needs me because slide change in db or that class's name table need to recreate that class or designer class totally)
