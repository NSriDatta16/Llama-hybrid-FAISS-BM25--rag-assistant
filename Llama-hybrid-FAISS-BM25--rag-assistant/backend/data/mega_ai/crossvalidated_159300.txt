The test for a mean (intercept) of a time series being constant requires that you account for any ARIMA structure and of course any pulses/seasonal pulses and any non-constant error variance. If the adjusted Y i.e. the errors from an ARIMA model evident a level shift this would be found via Intervention Detection procedures. If the ARIMA model contains a differencing operator/factor or a near non-stationary AR factor this is equivalent to testing the hypothesis of a constant intercept.
