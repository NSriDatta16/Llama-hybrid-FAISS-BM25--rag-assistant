If you are not opposed to using WPF, Josh Smith has created a pretty neat canvas that I am currently using for a project. It allows you to add controls and drag them around the canvas. You would have to handle what is loaded on the canvas and where on the next load of the program, but that is pretty simple. http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/DraggingElementsInCanvas.aspx
