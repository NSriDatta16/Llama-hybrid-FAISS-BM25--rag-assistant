Choosing between mean, median, and mode as estimator

I am testing my estimation procedure on simulated series of a Markov-Switching Vector Autoregression (MS-VAR), meaning a VAR where the parameters switch via an underlying Hidden Markov Chain. I simulate data of length $K$, $N$ times from a model where I know the parameters. And then run MLE on each simulated data set. I am finding the MSE of my estimates is 3% and 1%, when I use the mean & median as the estimator respectively. Should this cause me concern? When am I theoretically justified in using the median as opposed to the mean?
