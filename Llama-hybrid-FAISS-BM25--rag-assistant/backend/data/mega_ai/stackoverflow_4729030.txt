The tkexamp function in the TeachingDemos package helps you to create a graph with controls to change various options in the plot, there are several examples on the help page that can be run to see how it works. The TkIdentify function in the same package allows you to drag labels (along with lines pointing from points to labels) to a desired position, you could start with the code from that function (all R, nothing compiled) as a basis for your own dynamic plot that would allow dragging a line.
