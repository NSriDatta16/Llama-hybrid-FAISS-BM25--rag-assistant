What you need to do firstly is install the BPI client software from your server to be able to log in. I am coding in C# and include the Process Agent install files to avoid using CreateObject() , if you want to use VB .Net you only have to install the EBPI Client , you will note that the Start->Programs->Process360 9.5 icons point to the server the Setup.exe was run from. The dll's provided by Global360 are COM Wrappers, when you call them you also need to release the resources, example: Marshal.ReleaseComObject(object); The most common dll's you need to reference are; Global360.MxBase.Interop.dll Global360.MxDoc.Interop.dll Global360.MxLib.Interop.dll Global360.MxMkup.Interop.dll The PageInfo class resides in MosaixMarkups.PageInfo , the dll for that is Global360.MxMkup.Interop . In C# you would use MosaixDoc.ImageDocument.get_PageInfo(int page); Would you like the API Guide?
