Magento Headers already sent

I have this problem with Headers already sent with Magento. I get this error: HEADERS ALREADY SENT: [0] /var/www/etam/trunk/src/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Controller/Response/Http.php:44 [1] /var/www/etam/trunk/src/lib/Zend/Controller/Response/Abstract.php:727 [2] /var/www/etam/trunk/src/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Controller/Response/Http.php:75 [3] /var/www/etam/trunk/src/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Controller/Varien/Front.php:188 [4] /var/www/etam/trunk/src/app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/App.php:304 [5] /var/www/etam/trunk/src/app/Mage.php:596 [6] /var/www/etam/trunk/src/index.php:139 I saw this topic but didn't help me much. I have found that this log I get only when navigating through Admin Panel and going to edit pages with WYSIWYG editor. When in the content of such edit there are .jpg images then I get this headers already sent error. As far as I discovered it is not for all images but for some of them. For example when there is only 1 image no error then. When there are 3 of them, just for one I get this error. I can't find any white spaces or unwanted echo nor print . I'm stuck with this and I'm out of ideas what to search for. Maybe you could give me some advices? I know it is harmless, still we don't want to have any errors in system.log.
