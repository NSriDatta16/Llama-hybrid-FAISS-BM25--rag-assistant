Void is considered a data type (for organizational purposes), but it is basically a keyword to use as a placeholder where you would put a data type, to represent "no data". Hence, you can declare a routine which does not return a value as: void MyRoutine(); But, you cannot declare a variable like this: void bad_variable; However, when used as a pointer, then it has a different meaning: void* vague_pointer; This declares a pointer, but without specifying which data type it is pointing to.
