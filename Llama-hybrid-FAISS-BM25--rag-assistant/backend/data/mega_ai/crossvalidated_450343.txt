lmer and mixed-effects modeling

I am trying to model, for marine plants (known as seagrasses), the effect of four factors: between-subjects factors Season and Depth, and within-subjects factors Class and Section (subjects are seagrass Shoots, pooled during sample treatment prior analysis; see fig. below), on the response variable 'concentration of the organosulfur compound DMSP'. The structure of the dataframe is: > 'data.frame': 230 obs. of 5 variables: $ DMSP : num 102 93 96.5 74.7 66.3 ... $ Season : Factor w/ 5 levels "2017-08","2017-11",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ Depth : Factor w/ 5 levels "10","15","20",..: 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 ... $ Class : Factor w/ 3 levels "int","inter",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ Section : Factor w/ 4 levels "0-10","10-20",..: 1 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 ... > The experimental design is described in the below picture: This is, if I am right, a nested structure with fixed and random effects, isn't it? I have started writing a lmer model (lme4 package) in R. I can write the model for the two between-subjects factors Season and Depth (fully crossed), but I am not sure how to properly code for the within-subjects factors Class and Section (... to be completed). lmer. Could anyone help with that case study and give some explanations on the model writing? Thanks.
