Paired tests for one-to-many matched observations

I have a propensity score matched data after 1-to-2 matching. Each treatment case is matched to one or two control cases. May I use paired tests to compare the outcomes? The discussion https://www.researchgate.net/post/how_is_paired_t-test_performed_for_21_case_controlled_studies_on_SPSS suggests that if a treatment case is matched to two control cases, the average of the outcomes of these two cases be compared with the treatment case outcome. Are there any other approaches? For instance, instead of the averaging, we may "double" the treatment cases matched to only one control case (and double this control case as well)? Or may be just put into the analysis all matched pairs as different pairs (each treatment case may participate in one or two such pairs)? Or are there some special tests for one-to-many matching?
