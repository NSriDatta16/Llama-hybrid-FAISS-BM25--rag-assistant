RSpec documentation...where is it hiding?

Having a terrible time finding RSpec-2 (and rspec-rails ) documentation. Specifically I want to look up all available Matchers... but how? I've tried: RSpec.info : outdated - RSpec 1.x rdoc.info : seems useless, to me anyway. (incomplete?) RSpec-Relish : confusing. incomplete? how would one look up available Matchers? GitHub Wiki : scattered info. unorganized. incomplete? Yes, I'm aware of The Book ...but, seriously, isn't this stuff online? Even tried rake doc:plugins but it didn't work. Too green to know why... apparently there used to be some decent 1.x docs on rspec.rubyforge.org . but they're appear to be long gone... Where are these docs hiding?
