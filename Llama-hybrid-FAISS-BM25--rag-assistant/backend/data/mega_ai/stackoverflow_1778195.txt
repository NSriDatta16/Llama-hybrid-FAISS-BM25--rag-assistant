I already answered your question in javagaming.org, please check. I think that in the way you're doing it, you are hiding the parent data member with a child data member, of which the parent has no knowledge, so parent's data member is called instead in parent's method. public class Enemy extends Combatant{ public Enemy() { name = "Dragon"; } } public class Player extends Combatant{ public Player () { name = "Hero"; } }
