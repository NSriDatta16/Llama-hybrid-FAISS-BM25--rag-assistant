As some others have suggested, moving to a more complex algorithm may provide an increase in accuracy. If you were to stick with logistic regression, perhaps oversampling your smaller cohort may help to enrich your predictive performance. This could be achieved using a weighted logistic regression weighted logistic regression . Thankfully social scientists have implemented many of these algorithms in R and SAS. Another strategy could be to use either forward or backward feature selection. Ultimately, my money would be to move to more complex models, and would give particular attention to random forests and boosting.
