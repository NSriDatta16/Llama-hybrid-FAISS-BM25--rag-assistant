C++ Server Pages

I came across this site a few months ago, but only remembered to download it today. It's called CSP (C++ Server Pages), and it's basically just C++ inside a webpage (like cscript, i think). Anyways: http://www.micronovae.com/ Do any of you have any experience with this? Have you used it on any website you've made/been involved with? And are there external resources floating around the web that I haven't been able to find yet? I've tried to search Google for "How to do X in csp" and "How to do Y in C++ Server Pages" ETC, but all I get is just a bunch of results that take me to sites where I can download the product from. It seems like there's no real community using it, or maybe not many people use it? Does C++ Server Pages support MySQL usage? I know it supports ODBC (but I don't know how to use that lol), but the cool thing about C++ Server Pages is that you can import any library that C++ has (even third party ones), so maybe I can import the MySQL Connector thing into C++ Server Pages and use mysql that way?
