The Nagelkerke $R^2$ come from comparing the likelihood of your full specification to an intercept-only model. The formula is $$R^2_N=\frac{1-\left( \frac{L_{intercept}}{L_{full}} \right)^{2/N}}{1-L_{intercept}^{2/N}}.$$ This measure is also called Cragg-Uhler $R^2$. Whenever the full model perfectly predicts success and has a likelihood of 1, this measure will be one. Similarly, we have ML (or Cox-Snell) one: $$R^2_{ML}=1-\left( \frac{L_{intercept}}{L_{full}} \right)^{2/N}.$$ The former has a denominator dividing the latter that makes sure that its range includes 1. It is very strange that your ML $R^2$ has a value of 1 since the maximum possible value is $1-L_{Intercept}^{2/N}$, which should be less than one. In fact, the max is $3/4$ . Finally, for completeness sake: $$R^2_{McF}=1-\left( \frac{ \ln L_{full}}{\ln L_{intercept}} \right).$$ Update: This seems to be a numerical problem with this command in Stata. Doing it by hand with display also fails: . display (1-(exp(-42288.463)/exp(-37993.107))^(2/71932))/(1-exp(-42288.463)^(2/71932)) . If I take your log likelihoods and plug them into Wolfram Alpha after exponentiating, I get $R^2_{ML}=0.11$ and $R^2_{N}=0.16$ . It makes sense that the McFadden $R^2$ behaves better since it uses log likelihoods.
