How to delete folder with files using Google Storage REST api?

I am trying to delete _$folder$ from Google Storage using their REST api. I have tried so far headerserver.com/testestset/* , headerserver.com/testestset , headerserver.com/testestset_$folder$ but neither seem to work when there are any files in the folder. The only approach I came up so far is to foreach all objects under the _$folder$ before attempting to delete it, however, this is highly inefficient. In a worst scenario: is it possible to batch/delete more than one file per one request?
