I think that give each thread calls for LoadLibrary() the system will allocate different memory segment for each DLL thus each thread will not have a mutual resource to work with thus they will be unable to exchange any information. but... Say we will link explicitly to the DLL using #Pragam Comment(lib, "myDLL.lib") I think that in this way you'll be able to share resources between threads because the DLL is fully loaded at the program startup. Jeff? .. is this right ?...
