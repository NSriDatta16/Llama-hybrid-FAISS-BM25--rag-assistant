Deleting the file will mean you will not be able to do point-in-time restoration - you will only be able to restore to the last database backup you made. If point-in-time restores are unimportant to you, you can safely delete the backup - otherwise store it somewhere safe (like a tape, or other removable storage). If you're not using anything that requires a transaction log (e.g. database mirroring) you could also consider switching the database into "simple recovery mode" which avoids transaction log use anyway.
