If your service doesn't provide JSON as an option already (what happens if you change MediaType.APPLICATION_XML to MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON?), then I believe you have a few options, which I list in order of my preference. Option 1: You have an XML schema for the the data If you have an XML schema for the returned XML, you could use xjc to generate the JAXB annotated java classes and then leverage jackson to convert the instances to JSON data. I think this will get you going fast by leveraging this libraries over doing the parsing youself. Jackson is a robust library, used by glassfish for their Jersey(JAX-RS) implementation and I don't feel there is any risk in depending on this library. Option 2: Use the json.org library, but I've had significant problem with this library having to do with its reflection-based methodology, etc. That said, it might work well for you...and you can test relatively easily and see if it does meet your requirements. If so...you're done! =) Option 3: You don't have the XML schema and/or you want more control as @Falcon pointed out, you can always use traditional XML parsing technologies to parse the XML into whatever you want. I'm partial to SAX parsing, but DOM could work depending on xml side Regards, Steve
