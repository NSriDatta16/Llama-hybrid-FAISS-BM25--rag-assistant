How to detect multiple handles used by the same individual?

Suppose a person (John Doe) uses different user names (handles) in different circumstances (for simplicity, let us limit the conversation to a single social network, e.g., twitter ). E.g., he posts pictures of kittens as john_doe , posts political rants as deplorable_john , shares technology news as super_doe &c (and each screen_name has a different id , so no short cut). How would you go about detecting that all these accounts are used by the same individual? SNA: look at who they follow (and maybe who follows them): if these sets are sufficiently similar, it's a good signal. NLP: compare the posted texts and try to detect that they have been written by the same author. Meta data: see if the accounts are usually active from the same geo location at the same time. What other approaches have been / could be tried? Any published work?
