No - MLE is closer in concept to the mode of the likelihood In a Bayesian sense starting with a flat prior, the posterior distribution would be proportional to the likelihood. The Maximum Likelihood Estimate would then correspond to the mode of the posterior distribution. If you had a squared distance loss function, the optimal choice for a point estimate would instead be the mean of the posterior distribution, while with an absolute difference loss function the optimal choice would be the median of the posterior distribution In general, there is no particular reason why the mode, median and mean of a distribution should be the same, unless you believe the distribution is symmetric and unimodal
