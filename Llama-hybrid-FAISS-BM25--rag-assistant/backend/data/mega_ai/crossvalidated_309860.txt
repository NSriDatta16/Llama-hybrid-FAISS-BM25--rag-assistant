The common Kernerl SVM requires a (valid) Gram matrix. You can turn your distance matrix to a Kernel matrix and feed it into the SVM to see what it spits. In general, Kernel matrix are "diagonal heavy" -ey (I'm pretty sure I read that term in this very site actually), in the sense that they do not measure distance, but a sense of similarity (so big distance should imply a small value in the Kernel matrix, while small distances convey large values in the Kernel matrix). This question provides some references which might guide you in the endeavor: Turn a distance measure into a kernel function
