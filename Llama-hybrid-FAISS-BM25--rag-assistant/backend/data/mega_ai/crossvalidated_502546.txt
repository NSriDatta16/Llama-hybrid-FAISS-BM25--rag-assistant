High-dimensional integrals with computationally tractable closed-form solutions

What are some high-dimensional integrals with multimodal integrand and correlated variables, that also have computationally tractable closed-form solutions? The goal of the above constraints is to prevent the construction of "trivial" integrals by using a series of independent densities. With the goal in mind, please leave a comment if there are loop holes in these constraints. Here are two examples of what would not fit the bill: Ising model - it is high-dimensional with a closed-form solution to its partition function, but the actual summation is computationally intractable. Sequence of scaled independent univariate Gaussian distributions, resulting in a single mode. I don't have a threshold for what is defined as high-dimensional, but the motivation is to look for a series of integrals to benchmark Markov chain Monte Carlo methods on.
