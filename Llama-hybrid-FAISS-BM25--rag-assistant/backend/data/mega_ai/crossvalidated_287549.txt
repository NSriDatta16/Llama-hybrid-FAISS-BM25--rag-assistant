I'm expanding on @ICannotFixThis 's answer with an example on how the four factors involved matter: Size of the effect Standard deviation of the characteristic Bigger sample size Significance level desired How these factors affect your results will depend on the statistic you are using. For example, if you wanted to guess at the mean of some variable you might use Student's T Test . Let's assume you want to figure out the average height of your employees with this survey. You don't actually know the standard deviation of the height of all employees at your company (without measuring everyone) but you could do some research and guess at 3 inches (it is roughly the standard deviation of height for males in the US). If you surveyed only 5 people then 95% of the time the average height you observe in your survey will be within 3.72 inches of the true average height. Now, how do our factors affect this: If you need to know the average height very precisely (e.g. the effect size is very small) then you will need a large # of samples. For example, to know the true average height within 2.66 inches you would need to survey 100 people. If the standard deviation is large then the precision you can obtain is going to be limited. If the standard deviation were 6 inches instead of 3 inches and you still had 5 responses you would only know within 7.44 inches instead of 3.72 inches the true average height. Skipping this point since it is the focus of the entire discussion. If you really need to be sure you have the correct answer then you will need to survey more people. In our example we saw that with 5 responses we could get within 3.72 inches 95% of the time. If we wanted to be sure our answer was in the correct range 99% of the time then our range will be 6.17 inches and not 3.72 inches.
