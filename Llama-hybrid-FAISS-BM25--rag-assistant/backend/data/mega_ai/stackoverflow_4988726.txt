I'll answer each of your questions separately. Yes, you have the basics of how you should learn. More than anything, it is important to understand the concepts of the Java language before you go too far in development because understanding those concepts can be the difference between a successful application and a failure (which will, ultimately, discourage you and perhaps cause you to give up). With respect to what IDE you can use to code, you can use Eclipse (my personal favorite), NetBeans , or, just a notepad. Oracle's Java Development Kit (JDK) is what provides the Java compiler that you actually need to build your code and get it to run. However, a solid IDE can ease the process as well as provide a large number of features to make your development much easier. It does not matter where you develop. A major advantage of Java is that it is platform independent. You can code Java on a Mac and it will work on a PC and it will work on Linux, etc, etc. All you need is the proper JDK to build Java for that specific platform. So, don't worry about that and work on the machine that is best suited for your needs. You may want to browse around StackOverflow for a bit and read up on some of the other beginner questions on Java. Other than that, I would highly going out and getting a good Java development book and reading the tutorials that are available online. Hope that helps get you started. Good luck and welcome to StackOverflow!
