Rails 3 Engine & Static assets

I'm building an engine I've bundled as a gem (gmaps4rails). I copied the /public of my engine in the /public of my rails app. Everything works fine in development but fails to work in production: it appears static assets (of my engine & my main app) aren't found. The logs tell the following (just an abstract): Started GET "/javascripts/application.js?1286294679" for 127.0.0.1 at Wed Nov 24 00:22:20 +0100 2010 ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches "/javascripts/application.js"): Rendered /Users/me/.rvm/rubies/ree-1.8.7-2010.02/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/actionpack-3.0.3/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/templates/rescues/routing_error.erb within rescues/layout (1.1ms) Started GET "/stylesheets/gmaps4rails.css?1290554221" for 127.0.0.1 at Wed Nov 24 00:22:20 +0100 2010 ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches "/stylesheets/gmaps4rails.css"): I've done a few things: in my app's production.rb, I set: config.serve_static_assets = true This Solves the problem but is not elegant enough, I'd like to keep it to false and add configuration in the engine :) I followed the advice here without success.
