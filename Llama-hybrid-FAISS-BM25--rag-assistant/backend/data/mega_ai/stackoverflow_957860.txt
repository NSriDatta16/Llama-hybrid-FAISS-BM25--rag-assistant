While working on a slightly related problem today, I found that the following PHP produced the SOAP request shown below: $sc = new SoapClient($url); $params = array('step' => 'ShippingInfo', 'value' => "hello"); $result = $sc->__soapCall('runStep', array('parameters' => $params)); ShippingInfo hello One catch I found was that if the parameters ($params) I passed did not conform to what was specified in the WSDL file, the message that the SOAP client generated would look similar to what you complain of--a message with a body contains no data value. I wonder if your problem lies here. Also, note how the above PHP uses two arrays to pass parameters. The first array contains the parameters and their names. The second contains the first array. Interesting syntax, I know. :-) FYI, the example code above being used to communicate with a C# .Net WCF service having the following contract: [OperationContract] string runStep(string step, string value);
