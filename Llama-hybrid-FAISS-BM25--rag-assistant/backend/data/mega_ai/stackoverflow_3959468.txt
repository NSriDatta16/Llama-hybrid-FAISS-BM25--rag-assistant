A program that gets Delphi source code, and then transforms it into Objective-C code is a compiler? Or a source code transformer?

I got in this argument at work. My coworker told that just something that generates machine code is a compiler. Then (after I mentioned the Google Closure Compiler) he changed his mind: apparently, for him, a compiler is something that generates optimized source code in any language (which doesn't make sense, since optimization is an optional step for a compiler.) According to him, a program that generates, for instance, Objective-C code is a source transformer, not a compiler. And from what i know, a program that gets source code in one language, and transforms it into any language, not just machine code, is a compiler. So, source-code transformer == compiler. So, what is a compiler?
