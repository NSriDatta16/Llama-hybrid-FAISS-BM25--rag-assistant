Looks like an issue with the HTML5 validator. That error does not come up if you validate is with HTML 4.01 Transitional, and the table html has not been changed that much in html5. http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://www.wowpanda.net/s9712&charset=(detect+automatically)&doctype=HTML+4.01+Transitional&ss=1&outline=1&group=0&verbose=1&user-agent=W3C_Validator/1.654 Reporting it is probably a good idea
