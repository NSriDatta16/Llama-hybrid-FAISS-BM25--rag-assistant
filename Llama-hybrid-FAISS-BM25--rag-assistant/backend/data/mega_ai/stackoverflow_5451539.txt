Flexviews ( http://www.leapdb.com ) is an open source PHP/MySQL based project. Flexviews adds incrementally refreshable materialized views (like the materialized views in Oracle) to MySQL, usng PHP and stored procedures. It includes FlexCDC, a PHP based change data capture utility which reads binary logs, and the Flexviews MySQL stored procedures which are used to define and maintain the views. Flexviews supports joins (inner join only) and aggregation so it can be used to create summary tables. Moreover, you can use Flexviews in combination with Mondrian's (a ROLAP server) aggregation designer to create summary tables that the ROLAP tool can automatically use. NOTE: Flexviews is no longer maintained as an open source project. It was ported to LeapDB and now supports CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW and other syntax for native materialized views. LeapDB also includes the WARP storage engine, a columnar storage engine with automatic bitmap indexing and star schema optimization.
