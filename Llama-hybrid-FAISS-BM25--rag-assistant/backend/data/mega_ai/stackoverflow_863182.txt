Changing fields to property is a breaking change under what scenarios?

While reading Jon Skeet's article on fields vs properties he mentions that changing fields to properties is a breaking change. I would like to understand the common scenarios in which this change can cause breaks. Along with the scenario, if you can, please provide any details. For starters, the following points have been mentioned elsewhere: You can't change fields to properties if you are using reflection on the class. This is obvious even though I don't have details. Serialization is one scenario where reflection is used to iterate over the object and changing fields to properties will break the serializer or change the output You can't easily bind against fields. (Why is this? I read it here ) ??? EDIT: Robert has a comprehensive list of reasons for choosing properties over fields and also explains how switching between them can cause a breaking change.
