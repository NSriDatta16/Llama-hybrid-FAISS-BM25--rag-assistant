First of all, this kind of HTML parsing would slow down your app quite badly. Also, the code would be quite fragile since HTML changes quite often for aesthetic enhancements. You should resort to 'HTML scraping' as the last resort. Most customers agree to opening up a web-service/data-service for this once you explain the disadvantages. If you really have no other alternatives, then I think your approach is good. But instead of waiting for the buffer to be full, you could have a set of threads writing into the buffer and a set of threads reading from the buffer simultaneously. I would suggest using more number of HTTP scraper threads and less number of DB-write threads since the HTTP request-response cycle and HTML parsing would be order of times slower than a database write.
