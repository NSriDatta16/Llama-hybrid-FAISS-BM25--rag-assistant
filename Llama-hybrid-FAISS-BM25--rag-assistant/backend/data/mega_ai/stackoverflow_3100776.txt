How to copy a directory in a Makefile?

I have a directory images/ that I want to copy to build/images/ from within a Makefile. The directory might contain multiple levels of subdirectories. What would be the most elegant way to do that? I want: avoid a full directory copy on each make run (i.e. no cp -r ) guaranteed consistency (i.e. if a file changed in images/ it should be automatically updated in build/images/ ) avoid to specify a rule for each image and each subdirectory in the Makefile solve the issue within make , so no rsync or cp -u if possible I am using GNU make, so GNU specific stuff is allowed.
