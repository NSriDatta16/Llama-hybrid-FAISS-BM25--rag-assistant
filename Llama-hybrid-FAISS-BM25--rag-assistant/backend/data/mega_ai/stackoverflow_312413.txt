Apparently, Telerik has begun adding jQuery to some of their RadControls, starting from release Q3. I use both jQuery and RadControls, but haven't had the time to look any further into this entanglement...could swing both ways.... I have an omnius feeling that this entails more clusterf***, but that's just based on general experience with some of this and a little bit of that ;-) Check out Atanas Korchev's blog at Telerik on just this subject : http://blogs.telerik.com/AtanasKorchev/Posts/08-11-06/ASP_NET_Ajax_Controls_and_jQuery.aspx and the best of luck to us all when MS, jQuery, Telerik, JP Morgan and McDonalds all mingle and mash upon our desktops... ;-)
