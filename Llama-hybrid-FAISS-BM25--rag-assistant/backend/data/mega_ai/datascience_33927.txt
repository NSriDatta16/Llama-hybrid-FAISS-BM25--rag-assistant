Converting ML Azure random forest to Python - what is "Number of random splits per node"?

I want to convert a random forest model from ML Azure to Python (using SKlearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor . However there is a hyperparameter called "Number of random splits per node". There is no equivalent in SKlearn's random forest implementation. Do you have any idea what it might refer to in SKlearn's random forest ?
