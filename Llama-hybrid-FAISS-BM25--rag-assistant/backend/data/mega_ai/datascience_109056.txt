What is training data for Python tslearn KNeighborsTimeSeries?

I have 100 two dimensional time series and I also have 1 (benchmark) time series of the same shape. I need to find k nearest neighbors of the benchmark. According to the documentation KNeighborsTimeSeries is unsupervised learning model. But it has fit methods which takes some training data (which is confusing for me, I thought that unsupervised models never have training data). What do I put to fit method to achieve my goal? I'm not sure about the metric yet, but I believe it can be whatever. I can research and play around with different metrics later
