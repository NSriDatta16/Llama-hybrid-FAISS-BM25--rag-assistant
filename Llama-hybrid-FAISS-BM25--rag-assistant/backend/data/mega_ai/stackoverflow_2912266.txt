What does this C++ code mean

I was trying to understand how webkit parses urls, and I'm having a hard time making heads or tails of this: Vector buffer(fragmentEnd * 3 + 1); This line is on line 1214 (you can see it here: http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/WebCore/platform/KURL.cpp#L1214 ). I get that it's making a vector of type char, with each entry being an array of char 4096 bytes large, but I don't get the buffer(fragmentEnd * 3 + 1) part. I think that it confuses me most b/c I can't find where the buffer variable is instantiated anywhere (shouldn't it be something more like Vector buffer = new Vector (...) ? Thanks in advance
