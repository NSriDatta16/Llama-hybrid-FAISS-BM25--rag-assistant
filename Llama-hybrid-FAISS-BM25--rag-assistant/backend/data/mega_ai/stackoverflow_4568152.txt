If you want a simpler starting point than doing surgery on the Silverlight Toolkit, you can use the same inspiration that the author of the Silverlight Toolkit drag-and-drop support used, Bea Stollnitz's article: How can I drag and drop items between data bound ItemsControls? And here's yet another implementation, that is more Blend-oriented: ItemsControl Drag Drop Behavior for WPF Don't be scared off if you don't have Blend; you can still use the MVVM-friendly behaviors with just the free Expression Blend SDK .
