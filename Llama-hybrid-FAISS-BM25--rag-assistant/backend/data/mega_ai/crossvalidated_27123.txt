If you thought of the weights as priors, as in a Bayesian network, then you've ruled out any possibility that those inputs could possibly affect the system. Another explanation is that backpropagation identifies the set of weights that minimizes the weighted squared difference between the target and observed values (E). Then how could any gradient descent algorithm be oriented in terms of determining the direction of the system? You are placing yourself on a saddle point of the parameter space.
