Accuracy : Arima Vs Feed-forward neural networks

I try to choose the best model between the Arima model and the Feed-forward neural networks . The script runs well and I use the accuracy function to compare the to algoritm. I use the RMSE to chouse the best model, is enough or I have to compare other parametres? I'd like to precise that the data set is equal and the numbers are normalization between 0 and 1. Below the results of the two algorithms: ARIMA MODEL ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set -2.284042e-06 0.005978466 0.003094135 -Inf Inf 1.006384 -0.0004549235 FEED FORWARD NEURAL NETWORKS MODEL ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set -7.196957e-06 0.00571893 0.003075926 -Inf Inf 1.000462 0.00461708 In this case I chouse the Feed Forward Neural Network because the RMSE is lower respect the Arima, but my question are: is enouth lower the RMSE? I have to do another type of test and consider also it? Thank in advance for any type of help.
