Exception Handling is generally considered much better than the alternatives. i.e. ignoring errors or checking retrun codes. Generally speaking there are three(or four) things you can do when you catch an error. 1 - handle it/ignore it. If you decide the exception does not interfere with the correct running of your program then this is the correct action. e.g. End of File type exceptions. 2 - Try an alternative. e.g. if "file not found" then create a new file containing default values and open it. 3 - Transalate the technical error into a user understandable error and notify the user. e.g. instread of the 30 line com.java.jdbc SQL exception ... message You tell the user 'No Price information for the requested product code' 4 - In the Java world only -- and everybody hates having to do this -- pass the exception through to the calling process. Number 4 is especially annoying as one of the main advantages of exception handling from a programming style viewpoint is the separation of fiddly error handling code from the "real" that does your business logic, the tedious process of declaring, catching and throwing exceptions which you do not want to handle in your code leads to a massive amount of distracting clutter in the average java program.
