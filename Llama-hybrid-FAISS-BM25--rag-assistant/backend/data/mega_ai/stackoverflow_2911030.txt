Does anyone know what is the 32 character string before the product image filename in Magento?

I ask this question, since I am trying to get the images I have just copied from Domain A to work in Domain B, (which is using the same database). http://DOMAIN_A/magento/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/ 9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95 /b/0/b0041-1.jpg I think knowing what the 32 character string is, which help me find a good explanation why the images are not being found in the front or backend of Magento after reinstall on DOMAIN B.
