Whether to transform non-normal independent variables in logistic regression?

I recently received the following email, which I paraphrase below: I want to do binomial logistic regression with the data and I have non-normally distributed IVs. I tried doing square root transformation on the non-normal IVs. This was successful in normalising the distribution; however, when I did the logistic regression on the data I got ridiculous results i.e. OR: 14, CI 6 - 180. So I transformed the variables back by squaring them, and then ran the analysis again. Questions Why do the odds ratios look ridiculous after applying square root transformation? Should one apply the square root transformation to non-normal predictors when doing logistic regression?
