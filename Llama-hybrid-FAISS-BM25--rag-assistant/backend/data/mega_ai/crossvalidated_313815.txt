This is not a trivial task as there are many ways to approach this problem, as well as things to take into consideration. Instead of proposing a model, I will give you some general advice. What you are describing is a time-series and predicting the number of guests in the future is a forecasting problem. A time-series can be modeled for example using a mixed model , modeling the days as random effects because they occur multiple times in the dataset. The first things you may want to consider are: Did the average number of guests remain fairly constant over the past years or has there been an increase/decrease? This determines whether the time-series is stationary or not. Are there any special days to take into consideration, such as national holidays? In a regression model, these could be included as dummy variables . What other factors might affect the number of guests on a given day? Surely the daily or weekly menu may have an effect, or perhaps there are a different number of guests depending on the season. Some other things that might help once you want to decide on a model: Excel is very limited when it comes to statistical analysis. Consider using R or Python, both of which are free programs. In R, there is a package forecast with a plethora of useful models exactly for the purpose of forecasting time-series. If you are going with a regression model, consider that the number of guests are count data. Independent counts are Poisson distributed, but since there will be returning guests, recommendations from other guests, changes in the daily menu and many other (possibly unknown) factors affecting the number of guests, you may want to consider a distribution that can model these extra sources of variance (overdispersion) by using e.g. a negative binomial distribution. You mentioned you want to report an expected number of guest with a lower and upper bound. Prediction intervals can give you this lower and upper bound for a given amount of uncertainty. The expected value depends on the distribution you intend to use. I imagine the restaurant won't wait for you to complete this analysis, so I should also note that for starters simply going with the mean number of guests might work reasonably well, especially considering the time investment to calculate it. You could even do this in Excel. Lastly, search for questions related to yours. There are many good questions about time-series on this site.
