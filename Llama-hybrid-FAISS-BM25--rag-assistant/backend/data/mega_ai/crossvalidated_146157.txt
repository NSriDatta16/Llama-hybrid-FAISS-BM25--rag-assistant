The simplest approach would be to estimate the current value of the derivative, and stop once its absolute value is low. To account for noise, you'll want to take the average derivative over some time window. For example, you could stop when $$ D(t) = \left|\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=t-N+1}^{t}(f(i)-f(i-1))\right|
