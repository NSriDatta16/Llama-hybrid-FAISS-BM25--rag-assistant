Calculating composite scores of abilities

I have created cognitive summary scores from a battery of 17 neuropsychological measures. I standardized the raw scores of my patient group to the mean and standard deviation of a matched healthy control group and then averaged these standardized scores to create a composite score. The resulting composite scores were normally distributed. A journal reviewer is implying that the raw scores on each of the neuropsych measures had to be normally distributed in the control group in order to use this approach. Is this so? Could you suggest a reference that speaks to this issue?
