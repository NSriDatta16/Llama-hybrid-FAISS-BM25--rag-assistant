I know that neural networks can deal pretty well with outliers. Not necessarily. It depends on your loss function and sample size. In linear regression, the loss function is MSE. MSE is not robust against outliers, so linear regression is not robust against outliers. Having larger sample will mitigate the impact of a outliers. Same principles applies to neural network. Are there choices in architecture / training which help the smoothing / averaging / removal of noise? That's just the problem of over fitting. @tom has covered the most commonly used techniques. The only thing I will add is using larger sample size. Sometime this can be achieve cheaply by using data augmentation techniques (i.e. image rotation etc).
