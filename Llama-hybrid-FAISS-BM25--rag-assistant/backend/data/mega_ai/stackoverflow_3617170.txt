Average timedelta in list

I want to calculate the avarage timedelta between dates in a list. Although the following works well, I'm wondering if there's a smarter way? delta = lambda last, next: (next - last).seconds + (next - last).days * 86400 total = sum(delta(items[i-1], items[i]) for i in range(1, len(items))) average = total / (len(items) - 1)
