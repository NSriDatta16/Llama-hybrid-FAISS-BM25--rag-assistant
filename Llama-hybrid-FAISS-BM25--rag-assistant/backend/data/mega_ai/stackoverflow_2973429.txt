how can i make IOCTL calls in kernel mode (windows)

In user mode IOCTL calls can be made via DeviceIoControl function. What can I use in kernel mode to issue IOCTL calls? I must use this inside a filesystem minifilter driver. BACKGROUND I am writing a filesystem minifilter driver , and I must issue IOCTL calls to storage devices to find out their serial number and capabilities (removable or not).
