Comparing if obseration sets come from the same HMM

I am using a recurrent network to try and "play" stock data. I want to ask the statistical question "is my model behaving randomly?" I have two Markov chains. Both have 3 states buy, sell, hold. The first Markov chain is has the transitions controlled by my RNN. The second Markov chain just has equal probability of moving to all three states at any given time. Both chains are hidden by the same market. I only observe the daily returns. I therefore have two time series, each representing the daily returns from either chain. Essentially, I want to know how to use these time series to test if the underlying Markov chains are significantly different. I am open to interpretation about what it means for the chain to be different. I have not found a nice statistical test for this online so maybe you have some suggestions? Or maybe you think is a better way to ask this question?
