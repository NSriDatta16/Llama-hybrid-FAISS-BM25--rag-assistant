More convert jquery object to string

Yes I have see the post here And I tried that but the problem is, my jquery object looks more like this: var $foo = $(' ' + line.title + ' '); $foo.click(function() { openLink(line.url) }); $foo.appendTo($myDiv); When $myDiv is fully populated I can do this: var html = $(' ').append($('#foo').clone()).remove().html(); And I will see all of the lovely HTML, but I don't know if the click stuff will be preserved. See, I want to save the entire DOM modification to localStorage so I can retrieve it quickly since it's pretty static. I need to be able to store it and all its attributes, then yank it back out and restore it, clicks and all. Does that make sense?
