WebKit does handle all of those things, and in fact has it's own JS engine as well (JavaScriptCore). It also does in fact render the controls and such, though in a different way than you might expect. Safari and Chrome do indeed look different, but that's because they both have different implementations of WebKit. AwesomiumDotNet provides its own implementation (just as Chrome and Safari do) of control rendering. For all intents and purposes, when you embed AwesomiumDotNet, you're embedding a full, pre-built browser control. WebKit itself, though, doesn't necessarily need to use each of the components of the full browser. For instance, Chrome implements its own JavaScript engine (V8). Hope this helps!
