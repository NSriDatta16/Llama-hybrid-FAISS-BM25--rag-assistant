I'll throw at you some standard names that the are you're building a project on has, every term that you don't understand, research it, it'll improve your knowledge a lot. First, there are great resources out there on NLP (Natural Language Processing)regarding classification problems such as this one: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html Which algorithm to use? It depends on your data , there are two topics that you have to pay attention: the over or underfitting of your model and the distribution of your classes, those two things if managed correctly can make your model way better than those that don't look at it. Try to explore your data, plot the distribution of the classes based on a single word, two words, a phrase, a hashtag, or something like that, try to see if they can describe one or more classes, your model will probably improving by doing that. Here are two articles about feature extraction on text data: https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-nlp-text-classification-using-scikit-learn-python-and-nltk-c52b92a7c73a https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-text-classification-with-scikit-learn-12f1e60e0a9f
