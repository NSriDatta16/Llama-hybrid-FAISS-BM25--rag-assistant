Why on earth would you think that you have the right to change anything located at str-1 ? You don't :) It appears you have yet another problem, which, because of the vividness of the first one went past my attention. the addresses you may acces vary from str + 0 to str + 19 . str + 20 is out of your realm :) Both these things result in what's called undefined behavior . Which means you can't get surprised at any behavior! Including failing free , debugger crash, or whatever else
