I see no reason, a-priori, why the appropriate link function for a given dataset has to be the logit (although the universe does seem to be rather kind to us in general). I don't know if these are quite what you're looking for, but here are some papers that discuss more exotic link functions: Cauchit (etc.): Koenker, R., & Yoon, J. (2009). Parametric links for binary choice models: A Fisherian-Bayesian colloquy . Journal of Econometrics, 152, 2 , pp. 120-130. Koenker, R. (2006). Parametric links for binary choice models . Rnews, 6, 4 , pp. 32-34. Scobit : Nagler, J. (1994). Scobit: An alternative estimator to logit and probit . American Journal of Political Science, 38, 1 , pp. 230-255. Skew-Probit : Bazan, J.L., Bolfarine, H., & Branco, M.D. (2010). A framework for skew-probit links in binary regression . Communications in Statistics--Theory and Methods, 39 , pp. 678-697. (This seems like a good overview of skewed links within a Bayesian framework) : Chen, M.H. (2004). Skewed link models for categorical response data . In Skew-Elliptical Distributions and Their Applications: A Journey Beyond Normality , Marc Genton, editor. Chapman and Hall. Disclosure: I don't know this material well. I tried dabbling with the Cauchit and Scobit a couple of years ago, but my code kept crashing (probably because I'm not a great programmer), and it didn't seem relevant for the project I was working on, so I dropped it. Most of this stuff has to do with differing tail behavior than the prototypical links (i.e., the function 'turns the corner' early and doesn't asymptote to 0 & 1 very fast), or are skewed (i.e., like the cloglog, they approach one limit faster than the other). You should also be able to replicate these behaviors, I believe, by fitting a spline function of $X$ with a logistic link.
