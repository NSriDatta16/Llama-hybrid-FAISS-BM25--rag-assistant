Inserting String as Elements to the DOM for javascript?

I have a test chunk of HTML, as an example:: The HTML is a string, and not a DOM element, but I'm trying to see if there i a way, or an approach that can be used to insert the string as the DOM, so it can be appended to the DOM. var test=' '; test=test+' test.php ' test=test+' '; test=test+' php '; test=test+' '; test=test+' '; var scriptTBL=document.getElementById("scriptsT"); scriptTBL.children[0].appendChild(test); Trying to do something like this... But "test" isn't a valid node, or element, so how can i add it to the element?? I thought about using the innerHtml, but there might already be an existing child for the table/tbody for the DOM. I've been exploring fragments, but this isn't clicking! The test html has the tbl: . . Pointers or thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
