The Export to PHP Option will export your test in a form that will (with a little extra work) run using the Selenium RC PHP driver. It does not export the page you're looking at. Out of the box Selenium IDE will not allow you to take the final source of your page and do anything with it. If I had to accomplish something like this I'd Reconsider my approach If I decided I wanted to do this with Selenium IDE, I'd look into using the user-extension.js mechanism to write a new Selenium action that would use Javascript to fetch the source of a page, and then POST it to a URL of my choosing Make the URL above the PHP page that does the rest of the processing. This is kind of hacky, would require some research into user-extension.js (not for everyone), and is extra custom work that's bound to be fragile. (See option #1)
