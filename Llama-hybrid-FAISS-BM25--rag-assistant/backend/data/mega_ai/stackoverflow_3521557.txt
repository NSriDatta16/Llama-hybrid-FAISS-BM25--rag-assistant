Windows Azure - restricting the IP address rage to access a WebRole

Is it possible to restrict the access to a Azure WebRole to a list of IP ranges. I saw there are a number of articles explaining how to configure the firewall for accessing an SQL Azure instance but what about the WebRoles / WorkerRoles? Thank you, Luc
