Strictly speaking, neural networks are fitting a non-linear function. They can be interpreted as fitting a probability density function if suitable activation functions are chosen and certain conditions are respected (Values must be positive and $\leq$ 1, etc...). But that is a question of how you choose to interpret their output, not of what they are actually doing. Under the hood, they are still non-linear function estimators, which you are choosing to apply to the specific problem of PDF estimation.
