This is a limitation of conditional logistic regression and other fixed effects models for analyzing paired/stratified data: you cannot estimate the effect of between-stratum variables (i.e., variables that do not vary within strata) on the outcome. An alternative is to use generalized linear mixed models, i.e., models with random effects for stratum membership. You can include stratum-level predictors in the model and examine their relationship with the outcome while accounting for stratum membership using a random effect. In R this can be accomplished using lme4::glmer() .
