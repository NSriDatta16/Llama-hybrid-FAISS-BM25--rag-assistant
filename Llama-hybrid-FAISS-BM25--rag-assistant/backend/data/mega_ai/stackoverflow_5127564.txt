Here's a clue to at least one problem. Have a look at what happens when you replace: for (int c=0;c with: for (int c=0;c I get something like: Hmmm: 4294819625 12858 Hmmm: 4294864122 123849 Hmmm: 4294717053 27802 Hmmm: 4294697657 51420 : : : Hmmm: 4293781002 792849 Hmmm: 4294658253 1676602 Hmmm: 4293686116 710941 Hmmm: 4294706293 1737578 Total 2000000: 947402457 Array total: 947402457 I won't go into the detail since this is a puzzle and I'm assuming you want to keep it at least a little challenging :-) And yes, you're right (based on your comment below) so I'll make the answer a little less obtuse so it's more useful for others. The unsigned long type is not big enough to hold the sum of all those primes so it's wrapping around. Whether it can hold the actual primes themselves I haven't checked, but the answer in the next paragraph will solve that as well. You might want to try redefining bignum as a "larger" type like unsigned long long if available.
