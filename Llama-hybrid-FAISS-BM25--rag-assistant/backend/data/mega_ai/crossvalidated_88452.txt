Best method to estimate the mean of a normal distribution?

Let $X = ( x_1, ..., x_n ) $ be $n$ samples from a normal distribution with unknown mean. What is the best estimator for this mean? I can think of at least 2 unbiased estimators: The empirical mean $ \hat \mu_1 = \frac{\sum_i x_i }{n} $ A bayesian approach $ \hat \mu_2 = E[ P( \theta | X ) ] $, where $ P( \theta | X ) $ is the posterior distribution over the mean. The prior distribution over the mean is $ \cal N ( m, s^2) $ for some meta parameters $(m, s^2)$. Are there other biased or unbiased estimators for this problem? Which one is the best?
