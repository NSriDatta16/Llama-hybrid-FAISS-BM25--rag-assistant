I just did a big Magento project and it was a lot of work but well worth it. Magento is very customizable as far as skins and layouts. Prestashop looks nice but a few months ago when I reviewed it I thought the documentation and user community was lacking and most of what I did find was in French. If you want something simple but with a lot of features then take a look at Zencart. The default doesn't look very good but it can be customized.
