Here's a cool excerpt from Jolliffe (1982) that I didn't include in my previous answer to the very similar question, " Low variance components in PCA, are they really just noise? Is there any way to test for it? " I find it pretty intuitive. $\quad$Suppose that it is required to predict the height of the cloud-base, $H$, an important problem at airports. Various climatic variables are measured including surface temperature $T_s$, and surface dewpoint, $T_d$. Here, $T_d$ is the temperature at which the surface air would be saturated with water vapour, and the difference $T_s-T_d$, is a measure of surface humidity. Now $T_s,T_d$ are generally positively correlated, so a principal component analysis of the climatic variables will have a high-variance component which is highly correlated with $T_s+T_d$,and a low-variance component which is similarly correlated with $T_s-T_d$. But $H$ is related to humidity and hence to $T_s-T_d$, i.e. to a low-variance rather than a high-variance component, so a strategy which rejects low-variance components will give poor predictions for $H$. $\quad$The discussion of this example is necessarily vague because of the unknown effects of any other climatic variables which are also measured and included in the analysis. However, it shows a physically plausible case where a dependent variable will be related to a low-variance component, confirming the three empirical examples from the literature. $\quad$Furthermore, the cloud-base example has been tested on data from Cardiff (Wales) Airport for the period 1966–73 with one extra climatic variable, sea-surface temperature, also included. Results were essentially as predicted above. The last principal component was approximately $T_s-T_d$, and it accounted for only 0·4 per cent of the total variation. However, in a principal component regression it was easily the most important predictor for $H$ . [Emphasis added] The three examples from literature referred to in the last sentence of the second paragraph were the three I mentioned in my answer to the linked question . Reference Jolliffe, I. T.
