UpdateSourceTrigger only affects when the source is updated from changes in the control. It has nothing to do with what you do with the object on its own. I greatly discourage you from overwriting the reference to the collection because any event handlers which also need the CollectionChanged event of the collection will need to be reconnected. I am not sure how notifications are handled if you bind to dependency properties, but if you change your source and it is not a DP you need to notify the binding. This can be done by implementing INotifyPropertyChanged . e.g. private ObservableCollection data = new ObservableCollection (); public ObservableCollection Data { get { return data ; } set { data = value; NotifyPropertyChanged("Data"); } } public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged; private void NotifyPropertyChanged(string propertyName) { if (PropertyChanged != null) { PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName)); } } Edit: Tested swapping a collection that is stored in a DP, for me it works as expected and the List gets updated, displaying the new collection.
