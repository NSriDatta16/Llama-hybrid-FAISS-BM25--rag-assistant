When you have two variables that have similar content, give them names that express what is similar and also what is different. I have no idea what you're talking about with "ways" and "calls", but it appears that what you're doing is you have a total and a, what, transaction amount? In that case, I'd call them "ways_total" and "ways_tx" or something like that. What I would definitely encourage you to NOT do is just tack a "1" and a "2" on the end, or deliberately misspell one. Just the other day I was looking at a program that calculates freight costs, and I found three variables named "freight", "freightcost", and "freightt" (the final "t" doubled). This gave me no clue what the difference between the three was. I had to dig through the program to figure it out. I've seen plenty of programs that "solve" the same problem by calling them freight1 and freight2. If you need two variables, there must be SOME difference between them, and when you're writing the code, you must know what that difference is. Give the reader a clue.
