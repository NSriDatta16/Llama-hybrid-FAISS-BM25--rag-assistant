Personally, I wouldn't go down the Box-Jenkins road. Transfer functions are really pretty limited in the number of predictors and a large amount of time series data is required just to initialize the models. Pooled time series approaches (aka event modeling in the social sciences or mix modeling in marketing) are quite flexible and conservative wrt the amount of information required. One reference providing a good, general overview is free and downloadable from Lee Cooper's UCLA website and titled Market Share Analysis . Cooper's framework is marketing but price elasticities are given explicit consideration, the prescriptions are generalizable to any discipline and he provides specific examples of applied data structures based on supermarket scanner data to leverage in answering the questions you've posed. Another, more academically technical reference is Wooldridge's Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data . Wooldridge has much less to say about pricing than Cooper, whose recommendations regarding price elasticities are extensive.
