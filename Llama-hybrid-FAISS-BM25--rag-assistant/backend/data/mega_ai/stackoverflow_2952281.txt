Get your hands dirty and use lots of apps. Experience will teach you the interface cues that other developers use to make a seamless and sensible user session. Take notes on how controls transition from one context to another. Observe how controls are organized to make the optimal use of a small screen. A good review of the iPad noted that the operating system details "fall away" and the user can just use the device through intuition. This is a good ideal to strive for. User controls should be simple but informative, communicating enough to identify their function, but subtle enough to fall into the background when unused. Functionality should be organized in a sensible and repeatable fashion. Use the tab and navigation stack design patterns that Apple provides to organize your app's functions. Edward Tufte is a good source for reading material on how to communicate ideas simply and clearly. Of course, you will also want to read Apple's own iPhone HIG which explains many of the iPhone widgets that users will use and have prior experience with.
