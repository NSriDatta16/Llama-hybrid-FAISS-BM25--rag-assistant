Thanks VonC! It helped me alot further. When it comes to options (configurations) tieTYT, you can find them in the ivy-[revision number].xml file in your Ivy repository under: organization name --> module name. An example configurations element from the JUnit 4.6 revision downloaded from http://www.springsource.com/repository/app/ . In my project's ivy.xml file, I have a configuration compile-test. In the dependencies element I have the following dependency: compile" /> As you can see, my compile-test configuration depends on the compile configuration in the JUnit's ivy.xml file.
