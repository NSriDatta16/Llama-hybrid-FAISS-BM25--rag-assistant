I am unable to answer the question but I provide some related material on Kalman filtering, that are less prone to numerical instabilities. I am not sure yet whether the instability of the signal is due to the package so trying other packages to filter the signal to see what happens may help. Possibly related concepts detectablity stabilizability the rank of the controlability / observability matrices Gramians timeinvariant control Further reading I would have a look at DLM vignette since "naive implementations of the Kalman filter are known to suffer from numerical instability for general DLM" that is designed particularly for Bayesian MCMC applications. Other packages in R for Kalman filtering, R code for time series forecasting using Kalman filter
