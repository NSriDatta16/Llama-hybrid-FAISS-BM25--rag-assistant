Schema matching using machine learning

I'm facing the following problem of integrating data from another company (data base) to an internal one. It's about personal core data, i.e. name address etc. I would like to come up with a mapping of these keys in an automated way. I've read about HMM to use for this. However, I'm still gathering some information of some feasible and standard ways to do it. I'm looking therefore for some reference which describes a possible solution to this.
