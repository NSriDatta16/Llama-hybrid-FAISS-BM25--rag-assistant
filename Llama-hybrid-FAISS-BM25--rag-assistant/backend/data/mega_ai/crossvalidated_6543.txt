I can't speak for the more rigorous schools, but I am doing a B.S. in General Statistics (the most rigorous at my school) at University of California, Davis, and there is a fairly heavy amount of reliance on rigor and derivation. A doctorate in math will be helpful, insomuch as you will have a very strong background in real analysis and linear algebra--useful skills in statistics. My statistics program has about 50% of the coursework going to support the fundamentals (linear algebra, real analysis, calculus, probability, estimation), and the other 50% goes towards specialized topics that rely on the fundamentals (nonparametrics, computation, ANOVA/Regression, time series, Bayesian analysis). Once you get the fundamentals, jumping to the specifics is usually not too difficult. Most of the individuals in my classes struggle with the proofs and real analysis, and easily grasp the statistical concepts, so coming from a math background will most definitely help. That being said, the following two texts have pretty good coverage of many topics covered in statistics. Both were recommended in the link you provided, by the way, so I wouldn't say your question and the one you linked are necessarily uncorrelated. Mathematical Methods of Statistics , by Harald Cramer All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference , by Larry Wasserman
