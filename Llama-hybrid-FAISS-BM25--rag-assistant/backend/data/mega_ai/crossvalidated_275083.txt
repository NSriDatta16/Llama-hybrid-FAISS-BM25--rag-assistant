Suggestions for Statistical Analysis

So I have this special project that had me evaluating for the levels of heavy metals in the surface soil and subsoil at the dumpsite in my local community. I've done all the experimental work already, and I have raw data for the concentrations of the metals in the surface and subsoil (8 sites, 2 samples per site surface and sub, total of 16 soil samples with 3 replicates for each sample). I also have raw data for other soil parameters like pH, percent moisture and percent organic matter, same 3 replicates each. Statistically, I was thinking of looking into whether there are significant differences between the different sites and differences between topsoil and subsoil as a whole. Also going to need to correlate the concentrations to the other parameters mentioned. Anybody have any suggestions into the statistical analysis that I could do?
