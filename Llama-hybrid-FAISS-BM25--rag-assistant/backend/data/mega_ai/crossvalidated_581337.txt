Autoencoders and labels : Autoencoders are usually used with unlabeled data, so I am a little surprised by the result of your literature research. Actually, autoencoders are one of the standard tools for doing unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). Maybe there is some misunderstanding: Labeled data in anomaly detection means that the label indicates whether the data point is anomalous or not. In this case, anomaly detection is called supervised anomaly detection and is the "same" as binary classification. Nevertheless, you can of course search for anomalies with UAD in data that consists of features together with some "labels" as long as you consider both as independent attributes. Your input features (the dates) : I could imagine that a good choice of input features would be the differences between OrderCreationDate and all the other dates. The right model : I don't know much about your situation, however, I would probably not start with autoencoders but rather use one of the simpler models, e.g. those provided by sklearn like isolation forest .
