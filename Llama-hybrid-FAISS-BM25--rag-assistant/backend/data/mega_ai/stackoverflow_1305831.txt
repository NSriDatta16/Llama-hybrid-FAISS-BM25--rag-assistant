Here are a few ideas. Check StackOverflow. Check RSS feeds. Handle and delete three email messages. Write a couple unit tests. Put a few comments in your code. Delete old files and defrag your hard disk. Take a look at your calendar and to do list. Write someone an email thanking them for something. Build a project you haven't touched in a while to make sure you still can. Browse through the documentation for some software you use frequently.
