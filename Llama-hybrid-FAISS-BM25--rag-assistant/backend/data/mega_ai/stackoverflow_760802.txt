I would heartily get behind Wordpress. It is targeted at the blogging community, but a lot of "serious" sites use it with much success: http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/ http://scobleizer.com/ http://www.zeldman.com http://www.techcrunch.com/ It has many great media-handling plugins: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=gallery and also can be customized to produce whatever URLs you want: http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks I've used it to develop 4 sites so far, and it's easy to customize, and has a great user-base. FTW.
