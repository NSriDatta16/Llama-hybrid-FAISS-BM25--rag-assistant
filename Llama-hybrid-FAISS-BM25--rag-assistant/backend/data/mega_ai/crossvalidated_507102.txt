How to calculate the running mean absolute deviation

I wish to calculate the running mean absolute deviation (MAD) without storing the previous n data points. This calculation is for a continuous stream of data, i.e. infinite length. I am trying to calculated the running MAD for a window of samples of size n but without storing the last n points. In other words $MAD_k=MAD_{k-1}+f(u_k)$ where k is the index of the current sample, and $u_k$ is the current data point in a sequence. Is there a way to get an exact or approximate measure of the MAD using this approach? I currently calculate the exponentially-weighted moving average like this.
