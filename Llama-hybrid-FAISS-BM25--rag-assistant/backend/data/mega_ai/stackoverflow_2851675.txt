EDIT: I answered the wrong question. Ignore this. The correct way to do this is: -(void)makeGroup:(Group *)g memberOne:(NSString *)memberOne memberTwo:(NSString *)memberTwo memberThree:(NSString *)memberThree { ... } The call will look like this: [receiver makeGroup:group memberOne:memberOne memberTwo:memberTwo memberThree:memberThree];
