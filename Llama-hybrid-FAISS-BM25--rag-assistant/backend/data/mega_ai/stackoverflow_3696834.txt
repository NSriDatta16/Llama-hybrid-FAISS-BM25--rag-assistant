What are currently the problems with Git on Windows

I wanted to download msysgit here , and it says this: "here are not enough contributors to the msysGit project to offer commercial-grade support; if you do not have the means to fix your problems (possibly with valuable advice from the msysGit mailing list), or to entice people who can fix them, it is unlikely that your problem gets solved. " This sounds discouraging. Why is that? What are the issues? Is everyone using another distributed source control system? Edit: I watched the following video Tech Talk: Linus Torvalds on git . Linus highly recommends git. I don't understand the votes to close the question - git is a programmers tool and as such should belong her, right?
