How to analyse a ranking and rating scale together?

In some market research consumers are asked to rank the features of a product based on priority. For example, Rank the following features for a device based on your priority (1 being the topmost priority) Storage capacity 6 Portability 5 Touch interface 1 Keyboard 4 Long battery life 2 Entertainment on the go 3 On a scale of 1 to 5, rate the features based on importance (1 being very important) 1 2 3 4 5 Storage capacity 1 Portability 3 Touch interface 1 Keyboard 1 Long battery life 2 Entertainment on the go 4 Now based on the ranking and rating, I want to assign weights and in the end find out whether the consumer prefers a laptop or a tablet PC/ Say in this example the consumer has ranked touch as 1 and battery life as 2; these are the attributes of a tablet. But he has rated keyboard and storage capacity as the most important, which are the features of a laptop with a keyboard. How do I combine both these and probably assign some weights and come up with a score? If the score is above a certain level then the consumer prefers a tablet and below a certain level then the consumer prefers a laptop.
