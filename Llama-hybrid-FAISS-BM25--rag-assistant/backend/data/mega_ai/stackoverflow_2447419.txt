With a robots.txt (if installed as root) User-agent: * Disallow: / or (from here ) I would like to block search engines, but allow normal visitors - check this for these results: Causes " " to be generated into the section (if wp_head is used) of your site's source, causing search engine spiders to ignore your site. * Causes hits to robots.txt to send back: User-agent: * Disallow: / Note: The above only works if WordPress is installed in the site root and no robots.txt exists. Stops pings to ping-o-matic and any other RPC ping services specified in the Update Services of Administration > Settings > Writing. This works by having the function privacy_ping_filter() remove the sites to ping from the list. This filter is added by having add_filter('option_ping_sites','privacy_ping_filter'); in the default-filters. When the generic_ping function attempts to get the "ping_sites" option, this filter blocks it from returning anything. Hides the Update Services option entirely on the Administration > Settings > Writing panel with the message "WordPress is not notifying any Update Services because of your blog's privacy settings."
