Firefox Netscape incompatability

have searched previously asked questions but still not getting quite the answers I need. I built wwww.broadstairsfoodfestival.org.uk in DreamWeaver 8. Ran both the page code and CSS through W3C to clean up any errors. Ive looked at Check Target Browser in DW but all looks clean. However Preview in Browser shows problems. On some pages blocks of text flash; on others its the paragraph title that flashes . . and I'm damned if i can see what to chnage. Help! ....................................
