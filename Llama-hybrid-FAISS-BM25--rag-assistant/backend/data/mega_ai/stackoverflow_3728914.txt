Tomcat prevent static resource caching

I have read through several answers to this and none of them have worked. I have put a cachingAllowed in my app's META-INF/context.xml. I have put cachingAllowed = 'false' in the server.xml and context.xml in vain. I have also deleted my work/[app] cache, this is what I'm seeing on resources coming back. JSP - Looks good!
