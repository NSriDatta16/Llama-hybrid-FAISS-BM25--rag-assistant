Spring - binding to an object rather than a String or primitive

Let's say I have the following command object: class BreakfastSelectCommand{ List possibleBreakfasts; Breakfast selectedBreakfast; } How can I have spring populate "selectedBreakfast" with a breakfast from the list? I was figuring I'd do something like this in my jsp: But this doesn't seem to work. Any ideas? thanks, -Morgan
