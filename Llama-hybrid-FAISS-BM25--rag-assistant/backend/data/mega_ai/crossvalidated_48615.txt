How to create a random variables in a simulation using skewness and kurtosis as well as average and standard deviation input?

I am curious to learn whether there are any best practises in creating random variables for a Monte Carlo simulation using input such as skewness and kurtosis information of a particular distribution. Of course those need to be used in addition to the average and standard deviation. My objective is to create a number series that better captures the shape of a distribution than just using the average and standard deviation. A next question would be: what functions in Excel and/or R to use generate the numbers on this basis?
