Multivariate regression or PCA to reduce response variables?

I hope the title is self-explanatory, but essentially I want to know which method is better: does it make sense to use a PCA to reduce a number of response Y variables and then conduct a univariate multiple regression OR conduct a multivariate multiple regression using all response variables as they are? My variables are all continuous. I will be conducted the analysis in R. Thanks in advance!
