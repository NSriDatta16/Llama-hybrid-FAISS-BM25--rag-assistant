Survivability Analysis whereby study drop put/ censoring indicates a positive result

I am trying to conduct a survivability analysis (particularly a Kaplain-Meier curve) on data for estimating the likelihood of university drop-outs over time. The study began in 2015 (accounting for people joining Uni from 2015 onwards) and finished in 2020. So this study uses right censoring. Certain university courses are longer than others. My analysis is in R For demonstration a simplified version of my data is given below. The 'reason for leaving' variable is coded whereby 0 = still at university, 1 = drop-out, and 3 = graduated. pupil id Year Entered Uni Year Left Uni Complete Time taken at Uni (years) Reason for leaving 1 2015 2017 3 2 2 2018 2019 2 1 3 2015 2018 4 2 4 2019 NA 2 0 5 2016 2017 1 1 From my understanding, in a generic survivability analysis model cases 1 and 3 would be treated the same as case 4, given that they were all censored from the study (they would be removed from the pool of eligible data points from the year they left the data). However, cases 1 and 3 successfully graduated from university so they represent 0% odds of dropping out, whereas case 4 still has a possibility of dropping out. Therefore: Should I be accounting for this in my analysis? If so, I was thinking of just setting graduates to remain infinitely at Uni after they graduate, to substitute the fact they never dropped out. Would this be appropriate? If the previous solution is not appropriate, is there another way I could adjust a Kaplain-Meier analysis to do so, or should I be using another model instead?
