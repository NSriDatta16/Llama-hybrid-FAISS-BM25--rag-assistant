For one time run you can click on the 3 dots next to "Run" and define on what agent you want to run. For a long term configuration you should use the Agent Requirements of the build. You can add a system property to the agent by editing the file ...\buildAgent\conf\buildAgent.properties system.special.property=true Then you can define on the Agent Requirements to check the property system.special.property exists . EDIT With the new version of Teamcity (5.0.*) you can now edit the Agent and select the configuration you want to run there. Agents, select an agent, Compatible Configurations, choose "Run selected configurations only".
