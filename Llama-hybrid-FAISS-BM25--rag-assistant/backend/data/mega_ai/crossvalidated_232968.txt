Understanding the meaning of random when working with measures repeated at time=1,2,3,4

This stems from a recent exercise in an undergrad course, where we measured average resting heart rate(fH), and fH while holding breath of durations between 0-20s,20-40s,40-60s, etc. Not only could some participants not hold their breath longer than the 1-20s mark, but the software we were using introduced enough trouble to cause the dropping of some measurements (e.g. if the 20-40s fH was obviously unattainable, it was dropped and the 0-20s measure was kept. Can ANOVA be used to analyze this data? A t-test? I ask because the idea of random has suddenly confused me with repeated subjects- if we will use any statistical test, must we compare, say, the first four time marks, for those subjects who have data for all four, or is it feasible to compare all subjects, for all time marks? I would really love some insight on the matter- and I would happily supply the data (75 participants, five time marks) if anyone should need further insight. They used Excel for most of their work, I use R (because R is where it's at, colloquially speaking). Thanks in advance
