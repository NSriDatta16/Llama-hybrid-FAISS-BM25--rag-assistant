Hibernate Criteria Query Join with Null Value

I have a table called roles. Each role may belong to an organization. Roles that do not belong to an organization have a value of null. I want to find all the roles for a specific organization or where the organization is null within the table. Criteria criteria = this.sessionFactory.getCurrentSession().createCriteria(Role.class) .add(Restrictions.or( Restrictions.eq("organization",organization.getId()), Restrictions.isNull("organization"))); The Mapping file has: When the query runs, I get: IllegalArgumentException occurred calling getter com.myname.models.Organization.id I have found that if I modify the criteria to just query for nulls on organization everything works, however once I query for a value, I get the error. How to I modify the query or mapping file to meet my goals?
