Multivariate and Marginal simulations

I was wondering if someone could explain the following passage from my textbook. In the third paragraph from the bottom it is stated that the simulated values come from the marginal distributions. How is this so? We simulate the value x2 from the condition density f(x2|x1).. Also, there is mention of independence and again because of the dependence of the value of x2 on x1 and so forth, I do not see how this occurs. Would greatly appreciate your help
