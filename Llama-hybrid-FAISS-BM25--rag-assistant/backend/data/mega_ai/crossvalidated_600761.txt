Binary Logistic Regression with both dependent and independent variables

I have a dataset that has a binary dependent variable (choose 1=yes, 2=no) and the reasons given to choose each product. Independent variables include color (1=yes, 2=no), flavor (1=yes, 2=no), etc. Here is a simplified example. I actually have 10 independent variables and n=500. color flavor choose 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 Is it possible to run a binary logistic regression on this dataset? I want to report betas but if possible would like to run Relative Importance of Regressors (R relaimpo package). Any considerations I should have? Is this possible? Should I code the dataset differently? Thanks!
