How to isolate the seasonal pattern from a time series in R

I work in a contact center and want to create an new intra-day arrival pattern with R. So far I've gathered a months worth of data, which is half-hourly. I've designated it as a time-series, decomposed it with STL. We can see a clear seasonal pattern. I've isolated the seasonal component in a variable and then wrote it to a csv file for use elsewhere. data= ts(timeseriesRaw, frequency = 48) decompdata = stl(data, s.window = "periodic") plot (decompdata) seasonaldata = decompdata$time.series ["seasonal"] write.csv(seasonaldata, file = "Seasonaldata.csv", row.names = F) The forecasting process currntly in use deals with multiple seasonalities - yearly, monthly & weekly - to create a daily forecast. This is then spread across the day based on the intra-day arrival pattern. This allows us to model with one less seasonality (intra-day). The current intra-day pattern has been shown to be inaccurate so I set about creating a new one. Now my question is how can I use this daily seasonality to create an intra-day arrival pattern? The pattern I've exported above looks like this: seasonaldata Time Series: Start = c(1, 1) End = c(32, 22) Frequency = 48 1 0.5853415 -0.5630997 -2.4615408 -4.4224819 -4.5396731 -5.1881142 -7.0865553 -5.9537465 -5.8521876 -6.6574613 [11] -7.2127351 -7.7992588 -7.0107825 -5.2848063 -1.8400800 -4.3328537 -0.6381274 -2.5693483 -1.9068191 -0.5567899 [21] -0.2067608 -0.6067315 0.1423945 2.8239975 2.1507618 1.6694128 5.1558057 4.3518760 4.1608495 4.2278876 [31] 6.1336352 4.4909959 4.2999695 4.0457165 4.1785603 3.9888235 4.2506996 2.6416079 4.2583227 2.7137472 [41] 4.4594942 2.6899682 3.0172165 3.1831743 0.5426806 0.3860579 1.7133061 0.4276511 0.5853415 -0.5630997 [51] -2.4615408 -4.4224819 -4.5396731 -5.1881142 -7.0865553 -5.9537465 -5.8521876 -6.6574613 -7.2127351 -7.7992588 [61] -7.0107825 -5.2848063 -1.8400800 -4.3328537 -0.6381274 -2.5693483 -1.9068191 -0.5567899 -0.2067608 -0.6067315 [71] 0.1423945 2.8239975 2.1507618 1.6694128 5.1558057 4.3518760 4.1608495 4.2278876 6.1336352 4.4909959 I now need to transform this to give me a % for each half-hour time-slot which I can spread our daily point forecast over. So I'm looking for advice on the best approach to adopt or feedback on the general process. Thanks in advance.
