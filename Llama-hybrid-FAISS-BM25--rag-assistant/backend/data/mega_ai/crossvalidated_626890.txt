It is helpful to use stepwise regression (which you should avoid at all costs when predicting Y) to provide a concise explanation of what PCs are doing. This is done automatically with the R Hmisc package princmp function which also works for sparse PCs. Sparse PCs can be more interpretable because they combine variable clustering with PCA. Examples of use of princmp are here which also includes a graphic depicting PC loadings to help in the interpretation.
