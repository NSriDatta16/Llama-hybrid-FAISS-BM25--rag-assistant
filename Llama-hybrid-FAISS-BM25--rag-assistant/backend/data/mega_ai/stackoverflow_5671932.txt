Because selectedAVI is a pointer and has no storage of its own, and the thing it's pointing to (which does have the storage) is part of a local variable (the OPENFILENAME structure in OpenDialog ), which has gone out of scope and been overwritten by the time you get to IDC_EDIT2 . To fix this, change it to an array of length MAX_PATH and use strcpy or similar to assign to it. Then it should work the way you want.
