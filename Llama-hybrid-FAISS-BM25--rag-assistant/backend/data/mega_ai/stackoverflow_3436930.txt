The doxygen docs state that If {curly} braces are used the argument extends until the next paragraph. Paragraphs are delimited by a blank line or by a section indicator. The return command is listed as a paragraph-style command. So you can use as many lines as you want, add one extra blank line or just start a new command to end the return .
