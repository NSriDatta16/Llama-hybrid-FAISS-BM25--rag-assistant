One way to see that you won't get a perfectly uniform distribution is by divisibility. In the uniform distribution, the probability of each permutation is $1/n!$. When you generate a sequence of $t$ random transpositions, and then collect sequences by their product, the probabilities you get are of the form $A/n^{2t}$ for some integer $A$. If $1/n! = A/n^{2t}$, then $n^{2t}/n! = A$. By Bertrand's Postulate (a theorem), for $n \ge 3$ there are primes which occur in the denominator and which do not divide $n$, so $n^{2t}/n!$ is not an integer, and there isn't a way to divide the transpositions evenly into $n!$ permutations. For example, if $n=52$, then the denominator of $1/52!$ is divisible by $3, 5, 7, ..., 47$ while the denominator of $1/52^{2t}$ is not, so $A/52^{2t}$ can't reduce to $1/52!$. How many do you need to approximate a random permutation well? Generating a random permutation by random transpositions was analyzed by Diaconis and Shahshahani using representation theory of the symmetric group in Diaconis, P., Shahshahani, M. (1981): "Generating a random permutation with random transpositions." Z. Wahrsch. Verw. Geb. 57, 159â€“179. One conclusion was that it takes $\frac 12 n \log n$ transpositions in the sense that after $(1-\epsilon) \frac12 n \log n$ the permutations are far from random, but after $(1+\epsilon) \frac 12 n \log n$ the result is close to random, both in the sense of total variation and $L^2$ distance. This type of cutoff phenomenon is common in random walks on groups, and is related to the famous result that you need $7$ riffle shuffles before a deck becomes close to random.
