What I would recommend looking at is the actual formulae for calculating these. The mean distance to the centroid of a single cluster is just the mean absolute deviation. If this statistic is the mean absolute deviation than variance is the mean squared deviation or the average squared distance between each data point and the mean. This is why they are different, because in the mean distance case each distance is not squared. This then approaches the deeper question of why variance is used as opposed to something like mean absolute deviation and while there are many reasons for or against each, variance is primarily used for historical reasons. The variances of a series of samples from a population are less spread out than the mean absolute deviation of those samples, and thus variance is more consistent, which seems to be the primary reason it has become the winner over the years. But for any given situation, mean absolute deviation may be a better choice.
