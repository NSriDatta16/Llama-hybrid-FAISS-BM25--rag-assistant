Can not start an desktop application in C#'s Process

I try to pragrammatically run applications such as notepad.exe and Calc.exe with the following codes. I can see the application is activated in Process Exprorer but the application UI does not appear on the screen. I got this info inside the process p - "Process must exit before requested information can be determined" and the exitcode are 1200, 5084, etc. What is wrong? Thanks! Codes - ProcessStartInfo pInfo = new ProcessStartInfo(@"C:\Windows\system32\notepad.exe"); pInfo.UseShellExecute = false; pInfo.CreateNoWindow = false; pInfo.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Normal; Process p = Process.Start(pInfo); p.EnableRaisingEvents = true; int exitCode = p.Id; p.WaitForExit(); p.Close();
