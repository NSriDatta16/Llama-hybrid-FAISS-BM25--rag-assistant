Bayesian inference for continuous prior and discrete likelihood

Iâ€™m trying to wrap my head around an applied engineering problem which can be formulated in the following way. There is a black box which produces exponentially distributed events $E$ with random intervals of time between them. It is known from observational data that the distribution of events by days of the week $D$ is not uniform. I need an intuition how to calculate posterior $P(E|D_i)$ using Bayes formula, where: $P(E)$ determined by an exponential probability distribution with known $\lambda$ . $P(D_i|E)$ supposed to be $\frac{\text{events at } D_i}{\text{total number of events}}$ , if I'm not mistaken. And... calculation of $P(D)$ is totally unclear to me now. Also, I have a gut feeling that using Bayes' theorem here is the wrong idea in general. Intuition tells me that $\lambda$ here is just an mean value over all $D$ and probably I just need to modify $\lambda$ somehow proportionally to get a better posterior estimation. Basically I need a higher posterior probability (than prior) for days where number of events more than average and vice versa.
