If the model is well-calibrated the points will appear along the main diagonal on the diagnostic reliability diagrams(or calibration curves). The closer the more reliable the model. If the points are below the diagonal, that indicates that the model has over-forecast; the probabilities are too large. And if the points are above the diagonal we can get to know that the model has under-forecast; the probabilities are too small. We can see from the above line plot that the blue one, which represents the logistic regression model, is closer to the diagonal than the orange line, which represents the random forest model, then we can say that the former model is more calibrated/reliable than the latter one. And we can also see that for the logistic regression model when the predictions are larger than 0.4 the probabilities are kind of too small, indicating that the model has under-forecast.
