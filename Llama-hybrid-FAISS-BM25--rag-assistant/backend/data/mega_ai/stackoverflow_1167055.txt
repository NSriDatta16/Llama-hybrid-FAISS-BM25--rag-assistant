Just wanted to post my solution for posterity... I have been able to successfully retrieve the set of MBeans matching the specified characteristics through a simpler (yet stranger) approach. I still don't know why the QueryExp approach doesn't work, but here's what does work (replaces the last line of code in my question): Set cacheMBeans = mBeanServer.queryNames(new ObjectName("Coherence:type=Cache,nodeId="+nodeId+",*"), null); It also works when adding a fragment service=SequenceQueue in the ObjectName constructor string to filter by Coherence service (cache) name. As long as it works somehow, it's enough for me to get my job done, but this seems like a glaring flaw in the JMX implementation. And don't get me started on the process for creating a working JMXServiceURL using JMX and RMI...
