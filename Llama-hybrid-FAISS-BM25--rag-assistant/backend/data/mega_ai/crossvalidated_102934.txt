Predicting variance of heteroscedastic data

I am trying to do a regression on heteroscedastic data where I'm trying to predict the error variances as well as the mean values in terms of a linear model. Something like this: $$\begin{align}\\ y\left(x,t\right) &= \bar{y}\left(x,t\right)+\xi\left(x,t\right),\\ \xi\left(x,t\right) &\sim N\left(0,\sigma\left(x,t\right)\right),\\ \bar{y}\left(x,t\right) &= y_{0}+ax+bt,\\ \sigma\left(x,t\right) &= \sigma_{0}+cx+dt. \end{align} $$ In words, the data consists of repeated measurements of $y(x,t)$ at various values of $x$ and $t$. I assume these measurements consist of a "true" mean value $\bar{y}(x,t)$ which is a linear function of $x$ and $t$, with additive Gaussian noise $\xi(x,t)$ whose standard deviation (or variance, I haven't decided) also depends linearly on $x,t$. (I could allow more complicated dependencies on $x$ and $t$ – there isn't a strong theoretical motivation for a linear form – but I'd rather not overcomplicate things at this stage.) I know the search term here is "heteroscedasticity," but all I've been able to find so far are discussions of how to reduce/remove it to better predict $\bar{y}$, but nothing in terms of trying to predict $\sigma$ in terms of the independent variables. I would like to estimate $y_0, a, b, \sigma_0, c$ and $d$ with confidence intervals (or Bayesian equivalents), and if there is an easy way to do it in SPSS so much the better! What should I do? Thanks.
