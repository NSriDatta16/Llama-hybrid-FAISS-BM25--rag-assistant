Worked on that: Trademark matching and retrieval in sports video databases get a PDF of the paper: http://scholar.google.it/scholar?cluster=9926471658203167449&hl=en&as_sdt=2000 We used SIFT as trademark and image descriptors, and a normalized threshold matching to compute the distance between models and images. In our latest work we have been able to greatly reduce computation using meta-models, created evaluating the relevance of the SIFT points that are present in different versions of the same trademark. I'd say that in general working with videos is harder than working on photos due to the very bad visual quality of the TV standards currently used. Marco
