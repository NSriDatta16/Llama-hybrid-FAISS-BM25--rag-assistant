Cannot load 'paperclip/storage/ftp' when using paperclipftp in Rails 3

I've just installed paperclip 2.3.3 and paperclipftp 0.1.0. Paperclip was working fine, the attachments were saving and everything was great. Enter paperclipftp. I've included both gems in my Gemfile, installed it with bundle and made sure all dependencies were satisfied. I've also double checked that all my ftp info is correct and the server is working fine. When I try to attach a file using ftp: has_attached_file :photo, :styles => { :small => "204x159#", :original => "460X370#" }, :storage => :ftp, :path => "/:attachment/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename", :url => "http://kickassserver.com/_myfolder/:attachment/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename" I get the following error: Paperclip::StorageMethodNotFound in SetupsController#create Cannot load 'paperclip/storage/ftp' I'm thinking that paperclipftp isn't actually being loaded by my app. Is there a way I can check to see that it's actually being loaded, or has anyone else experienced this? Thanks, Matt
