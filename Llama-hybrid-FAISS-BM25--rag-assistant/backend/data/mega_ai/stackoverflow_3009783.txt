using ruby-debug with jruby-1.5.0

Release notes say that ruby-debug is installed by default. I'm using rvm. In my rails app I figured something as simple as script/server --debugger would suffice, but it complains that the ruby-debug gem isn't installed, suggests using gem install ruby-debug , which of course doesn't work (building native extensions) and is contrary to the docs anyway. Just wondering if anyone's had any luck using the built in ruby-debug in jruby 1.5 and what one needs to do in order run jruby in debug mode. Here's my output: brad-robertsons-macbook-pro:trunk bradrobertson$ which ruby /Users/bradrobertson/.rvm/rubies/jruby-1.5.1/bin/ruby brad-robertsons-macbook-pro:trunk bradrobertson$ jruby --debug script/server --debugger => Booting WEBrick => Rails 2.3.5 application starting on http://0.0.0.0:3000 You need to install ruby-debug to run the server in debugging mode. With gems, use 'gem install ruby-debug'
