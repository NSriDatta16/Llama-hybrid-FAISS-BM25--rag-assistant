Basic question on proportionality in Bayesian Inference for Normal distribution

I have a nagging question regarding the Normal distribution and maintaining proportionality in Bayesian Inference. Say for example that: $\pi(\theta|Y) \propto L(Y|\theta)\pi(\theta)$ $Y | \theta \sim N(\theta, \sigma^2)$ $\theta \sim N(\mu, \tau^2)$ If we want to calculate the posterior distribution for $\theta$ , we can drop any terms that do not include the parameter of interest (i.e. normalizing constant). This results in the following: $\pi(\theta|Y) \propto \exp(-\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (Y_i - \theta)^2) \exp(-\frac{1}{2 \tau^2}(\theta - \mu)^2)$ My question is why is it that we do not drop the $\frac{1}{2}$ in the exponential terms? Why would this no longer be proportional to the distribution? Or do we avoid dropping it for another reason? Thank you for your help!
