Extract valuable information from a list of dates for Machine Learning

I have to create a model to predict if a patient has a disease or not based on pharmaceutical prescription data. I created a neural network and a random forest using as features the number of prescriptions for each drug available in the dataset. paz id Drug 1 Drug 2 ... Disease 1 3 5 ... 1 2 4 1 ... 0 But, in the dataset date of prescription is available too and I wanted to include this information in the model, to eventually detect important pattern over time. The problem is that patients that used the same drug multiple times will have multiple prescription dates. paz id Drug 1 Drug 2 ... Disease 1 [2018-03-14, 2020-01-07, 2021-09-21] [2012-01-15, 2014-06-13, 2016-05-01, 2018-11-21, 2020-05-27] ... 1 2 [2016-08-24, 2017-04-02, 2020-07-26, 2021-04-21] [2015-01-12] ... 0 Is there any way to encode list of dates in a single useful feature that can be used by classification models using python? Or is there any way to reorganize the dataset to eventually detect important pattern over time taking also into consideration the number of prescriptions for the same drug without adding a feature for each date of each drug? Thanks in advance!
