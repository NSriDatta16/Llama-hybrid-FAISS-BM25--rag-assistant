Should I disable MySQL strict mode?

I have been working on a site that had MySQL strict mode enabled. One person had a long user agent string that was logged in our log table and unfortunately the user agent string exceeded the limit for the column and thus caused a warning. The data was not inserted at all. To avoid such troubles, should I disable the MySQL strict mode or should I come up with something on my own (I'm using PHP)?
