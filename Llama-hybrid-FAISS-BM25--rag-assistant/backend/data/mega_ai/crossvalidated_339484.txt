I think it is at times appropriate to interpret non-statistically significant results in the spirit of "accept the null hypothesis". In fact, I have seen statistically significant studies interpreted in such a fashion; the study was too precise and results were consistent with a narrow range of non-null but clinically insignificant effects. Here's a somewhat blistering critique of a study (or moreover its press) about the relation between chocolate/red wine consumption and its "salubrious" effect on diabetes. The probability curves for insulin resistance distributions by high/low intake is hysterical. Whether one can interpret findings as "confirming H_0" depends on a great number of factors: the validity of the study, the power, the uncertainty of the estimate, and the prior evidence. Reporting the confidence interval (CI) instead of the p-value is perhaps the most useful contribution you can make as a statistician. I remind researchers and fellow statisticians that statistics do not make decisions, people do; omitting p-values actually encourages a more thoughtful discussion of the findings. The width of the CI describes a range of effects which may or may not include the null, and may or may not include very clinically significant values like life-saving potential. However, a narrow CI confirms one type of effect; either the latter type which is "significant" in a true sense, or the former which may be the null or something very close to the null. Perhaps what is needed is a broader sense of what "null results" (and null effects) are. What I find disappointing in research collaboration is when investigators cannot a priori state what range of effects they are targeting: if an intervention is meant to lower blood pressure, how many mmHg? If a drug is meant to cure cancer, how many months of survival will the patient have? Someone who is passionate with research and "plugged-in" to their field and science can rattle off the most amazing facts about prior research and what has been done. In your example, I can't help but notice that the p-value of 0.82 is likely very close to the null. From that, all I can tell is that the CI is centered on a null value. What I do not know is whether it encompasses clinically significant effects. If the CI is very narrow, the interpretation they give is, in my opinion, correct but the data do not support it: that would be a minor edit. In contrast, the second p-value of 0.22 is relatively closer to its significance threshold (whatever it may be). The authors correspondingly interpret it as "not giving any evidence of difference" which is consistent with a "do not reject H_0"-type interpretation. As far as the relevance of the article, I can say very little. I hope that you browse the literature finding more salient discussions of study findings! As far as analyses, just report the CI and be done with it!
