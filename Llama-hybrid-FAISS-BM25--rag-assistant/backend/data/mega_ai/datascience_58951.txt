As far as I can understand from your code, your dictionary X does not contain values for the key count . You can set a value for count by invoking a line similar to X['count']=1 . Now you will need to find out why this is the case (maybe a typo?). If you require more understanding of the problem, you might want to check out this page about KeyErrors . Nevertheless, these types of questions are not solely related to Data Science, thus you may want to ask on a platform with a larger user base like Stack Overflow . This is also stated in the help center .
