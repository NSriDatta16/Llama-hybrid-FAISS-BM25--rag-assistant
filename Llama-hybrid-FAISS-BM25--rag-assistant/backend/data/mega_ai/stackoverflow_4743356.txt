I've since figured out how to accomplish what I want. pseudo-code: bmd1 = new BitmapData(...); bmd2 = new BitmapData(...); bmp1 = new Bitmap(bmd1); bmp2 = new Bitmap(bmd2); addChild(bmp1); addChild(bmp2); onEnter { bmd1.draw(video, ...transformations) bmd2.draw(video, ...transformations) } then organize bmp1 and bmp2 to be where you want the pieces to be, and transform accordingly.
