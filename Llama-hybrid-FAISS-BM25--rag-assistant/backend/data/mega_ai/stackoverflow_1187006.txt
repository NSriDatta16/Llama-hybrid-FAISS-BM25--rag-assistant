Suggestions for Tech to use for Blog/Organiser/Gallery App Ideas

i got some ideas for a blog/folio but i dont want to get a paid web server yet (still studying not really earning yet), and i thought of working on some ideas i thought will ease my blogging workflow. let me know if i can don't re-invent the wheel too much. or ideas on what i shld use overall i think i will use adobe air + flex + db (i think MySQL/SqlLite) + scripting lang (php/zend framework, if needed) will silverlight be better? it has C# which can do more, and since this is more of a desktop app i dont have a web server. free ones dont seem too reliable. so i thought of self hosting. like a desktop app. i am thinking of using Adobe AIR + Flex (i am a web developer but seem to feel some of the Flex stuff looks great, esp Flex 4's Flash Catalyst/Builder's integration with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop). Sometimes i get headaches with CSS bugs ... embarrassing ... i know self hosting. i seem to format alot ... i may forget to backup my MySQL database any database thats portable and reliable (overtime, the data may get big)? MSSQL is able to store db files in App_Data, thats 1 solution? SqlLite is another? i normally use MySQL any such solution? as for file storage, i am thinking i use a SD card, that way when i format it wont affect anything? i dunno abt speed/size tho ... i think i will be storing quite abit of images. at most i allocate a partition for it. Wordpress/Joomla is web based and on a hosted server, going from page to page takes time. i wanted something fast and can integrate into my desktop - like gadgets - so i can post easily. i think adobe air makes the cut here too, tho its not really a gadget. better "image/file" management. like auto generating lightbox gallery from images i think wordpress now has something like that with gallery short tag. with air i am thinking of making a way that i can manipulate (rotate/resize) images easily to create thumbnails, probably attach descriptions and tags. is there any way i can work with the meta info? does meta info only exists for images. so i can create something like a file manager. i am getting inspired by adobe bridge. I also like to manage my images/fonts (source and license) being a web developer and with SIFR, i can use custom fonts. but i want some way i can track font license and source. some fonts dont allow for embedding and commercial use for example. i dont see any font manager that does that. probably i use a db table for this. any other ideas. how can i read & display fonts? ttf, otf i think are the 2 main kinds i am using i think these are all for now
