If you want to automate WPF, you must use the UI Automation, not the "old thing of the past" windows API :-). There is a good introduction on UI automation here: Bugslayer: GUI Control to Major Tom There is also an interesting open source project named "White" that leverages UI automation: White on codeplex . There are some samples in there if you want to dig in.
