Two things: I assume you know this, but just to make sure: You can easily make any of your attributes sortable by editing the attribute in Catalog >> Attributes >> Manage Attributes, editing one and the bottom option is called "Used for Sorting in Product Listing" - which you should set to "Yes". As you have found out, Magento isn't going to want to sort a configurable product by any values in the simple products that have been associated to it. This actually makes plenty of sense. If you are trying to sort by color, and you have a configurable product with 2 simple products, one of which has the color of "Apple Red" and the other with "Zealot Black", then how would it sort that? It simply cannot make logical sense to do what you are hoping. It only sorts based on attributes assigned to the configurable product.
