How do you use selected vertical blocks in Visual Studio 2008 and 2010?

I get that you can select a vertical block in Visual Studio 2008 (alt-drag), but I don't understand how you use it once it's selected. How do you: Move the selection point inside the block and have the text you're typing get inserted on every line simultaneously? Move the block one space to the right/left Or can you just copy/delete the selection? I assumed when I saw the ability to select that it was something like TextMate's vertical blocks, but maybe it's just not as advanced as that. New behavior (as of VS2010 RC - added 13 Feb 2010): You can now type in the selection and have the same thing show up on every line. Tab moves the selected block
