How might I integrate phpunit with Hudson CI?

We are looking at switching from phpundercontrol to Hudson (it looks to have some really cool features!) but I can't figure out how to get phpunit logs to show up. I have phpunit running fine in Hudson with ant, and --log-xml is putting a phpunit.xml in the appropriate builds/ folder for that build. But I can't figure out how to get that to show up for the build, so that we can see the tests the ran and which failed, if any. After I figure that out, getting coverage, metrics, and api will be next :) It seems like it should be trivial for anything which generates its on HTML, to tell Hudson for example "For this project show a link to 'API' for each build and link to builds/$BUILDNUM/api/index.html".
