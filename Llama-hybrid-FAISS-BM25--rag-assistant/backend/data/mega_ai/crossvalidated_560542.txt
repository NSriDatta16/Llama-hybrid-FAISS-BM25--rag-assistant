How to properly select AR, MA, or ARMA structure for time series data?

I am attempting to model seasonal and diel changes in fish depth over time. Previous work has used ARMA correlation structures, which makes sense logically. I have processed my data to weekly means of all tagged fish (11) with a single mean for each diel period (day/night). With just over a year of data, I have a total of 1302 data points. My model looks like M1.lme where PSR denotes diel period, and season denotes season. ACF and PACF plots are included below. How do I interpret these graphs? I cannot find any similar examples in the literature or online
