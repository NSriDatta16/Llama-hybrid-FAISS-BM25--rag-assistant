What are the tools to speed up the running time of machine learning algorithms?

I know Spark as the fastest tools for Data processing, but not sure if it would be useful to speed up the running time of ML algorithms. For example, my ML models to be built needs about 24h when I run on my machine on RStudio. I am thinking another tool to reduce this expensive time-cost. I am talking mainly about the distributed computing tools like spark regardless of the type of algorithm and the size of my data. Any help is appreciated !
