PercentRank algorithm in VBA

I have found an answer to the question "How to assign a rank number to an array when ties exist" in Php and (looked lilke) C++. I also found a couple of answers about Excel's PercentRank in language I do not know. Can someone help me to do this in VBA? I need to calculate the PercentRank from 12 values in Access fopr a report and I cannot use Excel. Here's an example of what I am after: Per Val %Rank 01 80 0.82 02 74 0.45 03 88 1.00 04 60 0.00 05 86 0.91 06 68 0.18 07 64 0.09 08 78 0.64 09 76 0.55 10 72 0.27 11 78 0.64 12 72 0.27 Note that for the period 08 and 11 the value is the same. Also for the period 10 and 12. I read somewhere that when there are ties the function must calculate an average of somesort. Would anyone please help with function written in VBA? Thanks a bunch. D.
