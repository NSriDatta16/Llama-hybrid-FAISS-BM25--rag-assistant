Your weights sum to 6 not 7. In Stata, although any other program should suit, my version of your calculation is . mata : ((0.5 * 4) + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + (0.5 * 8))/6 6.166666667 which tallies with the reported correct answer. Some recipes, including the recipe you are using, imply fractional weights for some values. Regardless of that detail, a trimmed mean is just a weighted mean, in which values are assigned weights between 0 (totally excluded) and 1 (totally included), so that the calculation is $\sum$ (values $\times$ weights) / $\sum$ weights. The simplest recipe boils down to trimming an integer number of values, so weights are either 0 or 1 and never fractional. Also in Stata, I get these results. Here number means number trimmed on each side and # is number of values averaged. Just about any answer between 6 and 6.5 is defensible. . trimmean foo, number(0/7) +----------------------------+ | number # trimmed mean | |----------------------------| | 0 15 6.466667 | | 1 13 6.307693 | | 2 11 6.181818 | | 3 9 6.111111 | | 4 7 6.142857 | | 5 5 6.2 | | 6 3 6.333333 | | 7 1 6 | +----------------------------+ More discussion can be found at this paper (tutorial review, historical notes, Stata details).
