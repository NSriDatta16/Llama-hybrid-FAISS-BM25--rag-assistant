WA site scores in dbRDA

I am working on a project trying to investigate differences in Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity (BCD) between 2 areas. There are 5 replicate samples in each area and 5 years of data. I also have a suite of habitat data. I am looking to use vegan::dbrda() to accomplish this. My idea is to run dbrda(BCD~area*as.factor(year)) ; the resulting constrained axis scores from this analysis should give me the variation in my BCD attributable to differences between areas, and between areas over time. I could then use those constrained axis scores as response variables in down-stream rda() analysis such as looking at which taxa and habitat variables are associated with differences between areas. I am fairly new to distance based statistics, but have some experience with CCA and RDA. My question is, how are WA scores actually calculated in dbrda (considering there are no taxa to weigh the site scores)? And would WA scores be useful in this fashion?
