Quoting the manual page of the FlashMessenger : The FlashMessenger helper allows you to pass messages that the user may need to see on the next request. To accomplish this, FlashMessenger uses Zend_Session_Namespace to store messages for future or next request retrieval . So, the messages are stored in session -- and a session is attached to / corresponds to a user ; the current user, actually. The session is not meant to store data that is shared between different users -- so I would say that this component cannot be used to notify other users of an event ; not natively, at least. A possible solution would be : when you detect there is a message that must go to other users, store it in database (some table with a foreign key pointing to the destination user, if the destination user is a connected-user ; some table storing the message, if it can be seen by anyone) . on each page, you check in that DB table if the is a message that has to be displayed if yes, you put it in the FlashMessenger, which will display it on next page load from the current user. A bit tricky, and not as easy as you'd hope, I admit... Another idea, instead of using a database, would be to use some Caching engine (like APC, memcached, ... see Zend_Cache , to avoid hitting the DB. Have fun !
