partial set coverage sampling rule

Is there a general relationship that gives the total number of drawn samples (d) on average required to have at least percent (p) of distinct samples in a set size N when sampling randomly with replacement? If I have 200 distinct elements (N) in the bag, and I sample with replacement, I can estimate that around 10^2.5 drawn samples (d) yields about 80% (p) of those elements. If I have 2000 samples then about 10^3.5 yields 80%. Here is code that allows the eyeball estimate of 10^3.5 from 2000 and 80%: #total samples N % round() res % log10(), y=res) ggplot(df, aes(x=i, y=y)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(col="Red") + geom_hline(yintercept = 0.8) Is there an algebraic expression that given n and p yields d? References and derivation appreciated. Also, if it is known by a different name, please let me know the proper terminology.
