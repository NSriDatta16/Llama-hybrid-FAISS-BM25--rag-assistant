Subsonic - can anyone provide an example of using Subsonic SimpleRepository to persist a list/array of objects?

I'm looking for possible ways to persist the following classes. Subsonic SimpleRepository looks like it might work, and people have said it should, when I asked a more general question . But I've been unable to find a single example of how to do this - or at least one I could understand. Can anyone point me to an example, or tell me how I could use Subsonic to map the following classes to a database? Note that I haven't designed the database - I'm hoping Subsonic will do that for me , lazy sod that I am... Edit: Just to expand on the previous point - I'm hoping to have Subsonic convert my object model to a relational DB, dealing with all the Parent-Child and One-To-Many relationships that are implied. Currently, I don't think Subsonic can do this. But even a working example (not a code fragment) that explicitly managed foreign keys, etc in the object model would be useful. Some background and notes on the classes I want to persist: they are used by the software that controls some measuring equipment the Data class contains an array of RunData objects called RunFn , which holds the data for up to 10 individual measurement runs note that RunData also contains an array of floats - RawY if necessary, we can change the arrays to some other type of collection (List<>, etc) developing in C#, VS2008, for SQL Server Express Edit: I'm using Subsonic 3.0.0.3. public class RunData { public DateTime StartDateTime { get; set; } public TimeSpan ElapsedTime { get; set; } private float[] _rawY; public float[] RawY { get { return _rawY; } set { _rawY = value; } } } public Data { public string OperatorId { get; set; } public string SampleId { get; set; } // CAN SUBSONIC DEAL WITH THIS ARRAY OF OBJECTS??? private RunData[] _runFn; public RunData[] RunFn { get { return _runFn; } set { _runFn = value; } } }
