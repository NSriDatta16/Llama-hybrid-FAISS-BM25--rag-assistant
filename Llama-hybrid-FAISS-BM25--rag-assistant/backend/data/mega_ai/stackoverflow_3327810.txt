Instead of: a 2 a 4 a 2 a 1 a 2 GROUP BY will show ONE "a" followed by some kind of aggregation of the other column (maybe average). ORDER BY will keep all the a aa a a a, and just order the rows based on one of the columns (so maybe a 1 will be first). So in the end, GROUP BY will result in one row in this case, while ORDER BY will have the same number of rows as the original.
