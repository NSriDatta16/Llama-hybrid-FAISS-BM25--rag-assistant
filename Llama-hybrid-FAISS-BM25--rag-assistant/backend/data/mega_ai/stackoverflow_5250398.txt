Does anyone know how to convert this Perl script into PHP?

Someone just dumped a perl script on me and now it's my problem. I know nothing about Perl. Here's the script. #! /usr/bin/perl use HTTP::Request::Common qw(POST); use LWP::UserAgent; $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $req = POST 'http://www.someurl.com/aff/', [ search => 'www', errors => 0 ]; my $xml = " 2010-06-07T14:50:06Z "; $req->content( $xml ); my $username = "providedUserName"; my $password = "providedPW"; $req->authorization_basic($username, $password); print $ua->request($req)->as_string; As far as I can tell it's creating a HTTP Request object, adding some content and printing the response. Google tells me that I need to install a Perl package to get a HTTPRequest object in PHP, which isn't an option. Is there anyway to do this with cURL or file_get_contents or something? I'll keep tinkering away, but if anyone knows for sure how to do it, then it'll save me wasting my time at the very least.
