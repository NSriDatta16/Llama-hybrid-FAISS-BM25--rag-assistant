Where is the 'New Team Build Type' option in the build menu?

I'm following instructions on how to create a new build type in TFS, and it says to: In team explorer, select the project you want to create a new build type on the build menu, select new team build type My build menu doesn't have that option, it has: Queue new build New build definition Manage build agents, and Manage build qualities. Is this old docs or is my setup wrong?
