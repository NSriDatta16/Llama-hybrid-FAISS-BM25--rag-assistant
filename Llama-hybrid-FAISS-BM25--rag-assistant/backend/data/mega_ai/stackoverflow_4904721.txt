Assign a datetime array to a multivalue date field on the Domino form

I am accessing a document from a view, read a datetime field, figure out number of days between two date/time values which fall into four categories. In each category there is a for loop which add number of datetime values to an array of variant. Array entries are between seven and 35. After the loop I like to assign the array values to a date time field on the form and save the document. I have used Notes item as follow: Dim nitem as Notesitem Set nitem = doc.ReplaceItemValue("Datefield", dtArray) It didn't work. I used doc.ReplaceItemValue "Datefield, dtArray this one didn't work either. The field is blank after the agent runs. I declared a variable and assigned the array to the variable then assigned variable to the field on the form: Dim var1 as variant var1 = dtArray doc.datefield = Var1 Still no luck to see array values assigned to the field in the document Here is main loop Redim dateArray(0) For i=0 to NumberofDays -1 set notesitem = dtitem.DateTimeValue call notesitem.AdjustDay(i) set dateArray(i) = notesitem Redim preserve dateArray(i+1) Next doc.replaceitemvalue "Datefield", dateArray call doc.save(false, true) erase dateArray Why after the agent runs datefield in the documents are blank? What is missing? How should I change this to get result. Is it possible to add a delemiter to the assignment statement as follows: Thank you
