You could do what @brendan said. You can also make up a jQuery-style selector string for each element in the DOM by figuring out the element's "index" in terms of its place in its parent's list of child nodes, and then building that up by walking up the DOM to the body tag. What you'd end up with is something that looks like body > :nth-child(3) > :nth-child(0) > :nth-child(4) Of course if the DOM changes that won't work so good. You could add class names etc, but as you said yourself things like this are inherently fragile if you don't have a good "id" to start with, one that's put there at page creation time by whatever logic knows what's supposed to be in the page in the first place.
