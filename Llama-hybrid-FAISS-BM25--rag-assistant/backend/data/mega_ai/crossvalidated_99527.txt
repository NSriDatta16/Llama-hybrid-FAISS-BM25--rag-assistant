random forest for large number of variables and predictions

I have very large number of variables compared to samples they are measured on. The following is example data in R. set.seed(123) # matrix of X variable xmat Here sample 1 to 100 have y value but 101 to 200 do not. I want use the random forest to predict the y values of the missing samples. Here are my question - Can I use random forest to do so ? How ? Which r package (or any other software) would be best suited to my above needs? Edits: Note: Although I sampled values of X {1,0,-1} randomly, they are not random. They are correlated in different degree to each other or with y.
