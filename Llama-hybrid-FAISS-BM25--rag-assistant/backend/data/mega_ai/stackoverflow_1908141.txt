VS also breaks on the following line of javascript code: $create(Microsoft.Reporting.WebFormsClient.ReportViewer, {"_internalViewerId":"ctl00_MainContent_ReportViewer1_ctl03","id":"ctl00_MainContent_ReportViewer1"}, null, null); Steps to recreate problem: In Visual Studio 2010 beta 2 create a new asp.net project Drag a ScriptManager control on to default.aspx Drag a ReportViewer control on to default.aspx Build and run the project You then get the problem Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?
