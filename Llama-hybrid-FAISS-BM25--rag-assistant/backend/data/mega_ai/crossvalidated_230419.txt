Stats is not Math First, I steal @whuber's words from a comment in Stats is not maths? (applied in a different context, so I'm stealing words, not citing): If you were to replace "statistics" by "chemistry," "economics," "engineering," or any other field that employs mathematics (such as home economics), it appears none of your argument would change. All these fields are allowed to exist and to have questions that are not solved only by checking which theorems are correct. Though some answers at Stats is not maths? disagree, I think it is clear that statistics is not (pure) mathematics. If you want to do probability theory, a branch of (pure) mathematics, you may indeed ignore all debates of the kind you ask about. If you want to apply probability theory into modeling some real-world questions, you need something more to guide you than just the axioms and theorems of the mathematical framework. The remainder of the answer is rambling about this point. The claim "if we want to be mathematically correct, shouldn't we disallow any interpretation of probability" also seems unjustified. Putting an interpretation on top of a mathematical framework does not make the mathematics incorrect (as long as the interpretation is not claimed to be a theorem in the mathematical framework). The debate is not (mainly) about axioms Though there are some alternative axiomatizations*, the(?) debate is not about disputing Kolmogorov axioms. Ignoring some subtleties with zero-measure conditioning events, leading to regular conditional probability etc., about which I don't know enough, the Kolmogorov axioms and conditional probability imply the Bayes rule, which no-one disputes. However, if $X$ is not even a random variable in your model (model in the sense of the mathematical setup consisting of a probability space or a family of them, random variables, etc.), it is of course not possible to compute the conditional distribution $P(X\mid Y)$. No-one also disputes that the frequency properties, if correctly computed, are consequences of the model. For example, the conditional distributions $p(y\mid \theta)$ in a Bayesian model define an indexed family of probability distributions $p(y; \theta)$ by simply letting $p(y \mid \theta) = p(y; \theta)$ and if some results hold for all $\theta$ in the latter, they hold for all $\theta$ in the former, too. The debate is about how to apply the mathematics The debates (as much as any exist**), are instead about how to decide what kind of probability model to set up for a (real-life, non-mathematical) problem and which implications of the model are relevant for drawing (real-life) conclusions. But these questions would exist even if all statisticians agreed. To quote from the blog post you linked to [1], we want to answer questions like How should I design a roulette so my casino makes $? Does this fertilizer increase crop yield? Does streptomycin cure pulmonary tuberculosis? Does smoking cause cancer? What movie would would this user enjoy? Which baseball player should the Red Sox give a contract to? Should this patient receive chemotherapy? The axioms of probability theory do not even contain a definition of baseball, so it is obvious that "Red Sox should give a contract to baseball player X" is not a theorem in probability theory. Note about mathematical justifications of the Bayesian approach There are 'mathematical justifications' for considering all unknowns as probabilistic such as the Cox theorem that Jaynes refers to, (though I hear it has mathematical problems, that may or not have been fixed, I don't know, see [2] and references therein) or the (subjective Bayesian) Savage approach (I've heard this is in [3] but haven't ever read the book) that proves that under certain assumptions, a rational decision-maker will have a probability distribution over states of world and select his action based on maximizing the expected value of a utility function. However, whether or not the manager of Red Sox should accept the assumptions, or whether we should accept the theory that smoking causes cancer, cannot be deduced from any mathematical framework, so the debate cannot be (only) about the correctness of these justifications as theorems. Footnotes *I have not studied it, but I've heard de Finetti has an approach where conditional probabilities are primitives rather than obtained from the (unconditional) measure by conditioning. [4] mentions a debate between (Bayesians) José Bernardo, Dennis Lindley and Bruno de Finetti in a cosy French restaurant about whether $\sigma$-additivity is needed. **as mentioned in the blog post you link to [1], there might be no clear cut debate with every statistician belonging to one team and despising the other team. I have heard it said that we are all pragmatics nowadays and the useless debate is over. However, in my experience these differences exist in, for example, whether someone's first approach is to model all unknowns as random variables or not and how interested someone is in frequency guarantees.
