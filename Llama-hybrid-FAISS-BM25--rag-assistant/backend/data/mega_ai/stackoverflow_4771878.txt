If you had a lot of data, and wanted to do this hardcore, I would suggest a statistical method like PLSA or PSVM , which can extract identifying topics from text and identify documents with similar topic probabilities. A simpler, but less accurate way of doing it is using Soundex , which is available for many languages. You can store the soundex (which will be a short string, not an integer I'm afraid), and look for exact matches to the soundex, which should point to similar rows. I think it's unrealistic to expect a function to turn a series of strings into an integer such that integers near each other map to similar strings. The closest you might come is doing a checksum on each individual tuple, and comparing the checksums for the new row to the checksums of existing rows, but I'm guessing you're trying to come up with a single number you can index on.
