Retrieving the name of the invoked method executed in a Func

I would like to get the name of the method that is being delegated as a Func. Func func = x => x.DoSomeMethod(); string name = ExtractMethodName(func); // should equal "DoSomeMethod" How can I achieve this? -- For bragging rights -- Make ExtractMethodName also work with a property invocation, having it return the property name in that instance. eg. Func func = x => x.Property; string name = ExtractMethodName(func); // should equal "Property"
