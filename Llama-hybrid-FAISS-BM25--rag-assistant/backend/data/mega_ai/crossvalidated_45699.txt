For iid data, the only condition is that $\mathbb E[h(X)]$ exists. If $\mathbb E[h(X)] = +\infty$ or $-\infty$ the SLLN still holds; the only issue comes when $\mathbb E[h(X)]$ is undefined, i.e. the positive and negative parts of $h(X)$ integrate to $\infty$. The integrability condition (which is overly strong for iid data) is essentially saying that $\int |h(X)| \ d\mu This is all assuming iid data; for independent data, or for Markov chains, things are more complicated. With Markov chains, some measure theory is probably inescapable.
