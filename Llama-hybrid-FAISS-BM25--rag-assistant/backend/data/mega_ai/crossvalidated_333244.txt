The resulting coefficients of logistic regression are difficult to interpret in general. The coefficient when not squared is the change in log odds for every 1 unit increase in your IV. So if that IV is squared it is still interpreted the much the same way. The coefficient is equal to the change in log odds for every 1 unit increase in the squared IV (controlling for the other predictors in your model including the linear version of the IV). Because logistic regression follows a logistic curve interpreting the slope as is would be strange. I think your best bet would be to transform to percent likelihood, so that its more interpretable and then use your low, medium, high method. Either that or just graph it, that will provide the most detail.
