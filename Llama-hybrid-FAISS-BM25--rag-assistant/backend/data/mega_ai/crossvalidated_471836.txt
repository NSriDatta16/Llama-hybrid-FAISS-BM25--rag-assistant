Logistic regression interaction only significant when main effects are removed

I'm interested in understanding if the interaction of a categorical variable (group A or B) and a continuous one (X1) can predict reaction time. I started by testing the main effects plus the interaction using fitglm in Matlab. modelspec = 'RT ~ group*X1'; % test interaction and individual factors % Logistic regression model mdl1 = fitglm(data,modelspec,'Distribution','binomial','CategoricalVars',[1]) With this model the interaction term is not significant, although when I plot the data it seem like there is an interaction. Model output: Estimated Coefficients: Estimate SE tStat pValue ________ ________ _______ _________ (Intercept) -0.80295 0.15055 -5.3336 9.631e-08 group 0.31 0.23212 1.3355 0.18171 X1 0.1202 0.056139 2.1412 0.032261 group:X1 0.13312 0.085264 1.5613 0.11846 1369 observations, 1365 error degrees of freedom Dispersion: 1 Chi^2-statistic vs. constant model: 58.7, p-value = 1.12e-12 Next I looked at the interaction only and the interaction is significant: modelspec = 'RT ~ group:X1'; % test interaction only % Logistic regression model mdl2 = fitglm(data,modelspec,'Distribution','binomial','CategoricalVars',[1]) Estimated Coefficients: Estimate SE tStat pValue ________ ________ ______ __________ (Intercept) -0.52461 0.071806 -7.306 2.7524e-13 group:X1 0.26365 0.036835 7.1576 8.2125e-13 1369 observations, 1367 error degrees of freedom Dispersion: 1 Chi^2-statistic vs. constant model: 54.1, p-value = 1.94e-13 I'm a bit lost and don't really know how to interpret these results, particularly from the first model (mdl1 = main effects and interactions). As I said, my main interest is the interaction. Should I report the model with the interaction only? What would be the correct way forward? Any input is welcome!
