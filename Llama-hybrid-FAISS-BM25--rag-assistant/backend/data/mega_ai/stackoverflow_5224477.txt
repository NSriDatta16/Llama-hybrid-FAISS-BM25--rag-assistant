Allow only certain client(s) for AJAX requests

I have an AJAX intensive web application where the requests are unsecured, meaning there is no client identification. I don't check whether its my application that's making the request on the server. Recently i found out that some one has used my ajax request urls to create an iPhone app that mimics my web app. I added in a filter to discard requests from iPhone by looking in the user agent string. This is definitely a temporary solution. Instead of blocking certain user agents, how can i make sure that the request originated from my application? If i add more services like an FB app, Google Gadget etc i want these to make requests as well. The question is how can i make sure that the request originates from my app(s) and discard everything else.
