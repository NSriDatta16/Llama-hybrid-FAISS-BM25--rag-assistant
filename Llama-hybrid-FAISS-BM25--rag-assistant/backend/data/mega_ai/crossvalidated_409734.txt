understanding time-homogeneous markov chain

Could anyone help me understand the definition on page 7 definition 2.25 here ? I do not understand the notation $(P(a))(A)$ - what does this mean? Also, is $P(a, A)$ a probability measure from the set of all Borel sets of $X$ to $[0,1]$ ? I believe that $P$ is a function from $X \times B(X)\to [0,1]$ ? Is this true?
