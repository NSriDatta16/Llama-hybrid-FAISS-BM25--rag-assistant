How to cascade pop up windows (i.e. offset the X and Y position) in a Flex application?

I have a simple Flex (Flash Builder) application which pops up a new window when a user clicks on a map. The user can make subsequent clicks on the map to have additional pop up windows appear, each of which currently pop up on top of the initial/previous pop up window(s) (i.e. at the same X and Y position). I want to modify the application in such a way that each new pop up window will be rendered slightly offset from the previous pop up window. A coworker has suggested I try to find a way to leverage existing window cascading functionality in Flex, but so far I've not found anything which can manage this for you. Is there such a solution cooked into Flex already, or should I roll my own by calculating the new pop up window's X and Y position based on the last pop up window's X and Y position? Thanks in advance for your suggestions. --James
