By default, values are aligned according to their size. So a 2-byte value like a short is aligned on a 2-byte boundary, and a 4-byte value like an int is aligned on a 4-byte boundary In your example, 2 bytes of padding are added before i to ensure that i falls on a 4-byte boundary. (The entire structure is aligned on a boundary at least as big as the biggest value in the structure, so your structure will be aligned to a 4-byte boundary.) The actual rules vary according to the platform - the Wikipedia page on Data structure alignment has more details. Compilers typically let you control the packing via (for example) #pragma pack directives.
