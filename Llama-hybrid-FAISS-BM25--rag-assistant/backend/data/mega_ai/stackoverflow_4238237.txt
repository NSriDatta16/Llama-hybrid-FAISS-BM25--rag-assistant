methodology for a team coursework

I need a methodology to organize my team for a university assignment. I am a university student and already have some programming experience. My experience of working in teams of more then 2 people on a relatively large project is that everything usually gets done very quickly and badly in last week or so because of planning, organization and communication issues. In January I will have to do a (quite challenging for my skill) programming project (Java application on Oracle) in a team of 6. I already know my team members and was elected the project leader. It won't be realistic to expect people to get together for any meaningful-sized amount of time - everyone is free at different time and probably nothing more then weekly 1-hour meetings is realistic. People are hard-working and devoted to success, but everyone has their own circumstances. Mostly distributed work is the likely way to go. I've looked through XP, Scrum, but they all require to sit together (unlikely), aimed at full-time development of a project (people have other assignments and part-time jobs) and customer involvement (we will have written specs and as far as experience goes, emails from tutor will be answered at best in 2-3 days). Any suggestions how to organize people and divide the work? I am serious on researching this topic, because there will be much more of this kind of works later on. Any help appreciated.
