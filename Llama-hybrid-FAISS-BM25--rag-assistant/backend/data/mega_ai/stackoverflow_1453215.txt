Creating Tables in Word Programmatically

I am generating tables and writing them to word on the fly. I do not know how many tables there will be each time i write the data to word and the problem I am having is the second table is written inside the first cell of my first table. If there was a third table it is put inside the first cell of my second table. Is there a way to move the cursor out of the table? I have tried creating a new range with each table also but the same thing happens. I have also tried things like tbl.Range.InsertParagraphAfter() The closest I came was using the Relocate method, but this only worked for two tables.
