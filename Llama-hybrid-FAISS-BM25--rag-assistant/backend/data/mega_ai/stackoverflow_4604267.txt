Is there a way to force Eclipse to open in the default perspective?

Problem: Whenever I start Eclipse (3.5.2 Galileo) it always opens in the previous perspective I was using. I want it to ALWAYS open in the default perspective, but I can't find a way of setting that in the preferences. Background (i.e. why this is important to me - LONG!): I use a laptop for dev work for which I have a docking station at my desk. When I'm docked, I have two monitors giving me 2400 horizontal pixels of real estate and I work in a perspective that has a full-size code editing screen on one monitor and all other views (console, package explorer, JUnit, etc.) open in floating windows on the other monitor. When I undock and use the built in screen on the laptop, I "only" have 1920 pixels horizontally. If I open my "2-screen" perspective in this situation, the floating windows are dragged left so that their right-hand edges align with the screen, and they overlap each other and the main coding window. What's worse is that if I exit Eclipse or switch to my 1-screen perspective (which I've set as the default), the current layout of the 2-screen perspective is saved and so I have to drag all the windows back to where they belong when I get back to my docking station. I try to remember to switch to the 1-screen perspective before I close Eclipse each time, especially if I know I'll be working undocked next time I open Eclipse, but I forget more often than I remember, sadly. Therefore, I'd like to have Eclipse always open in the default, 1-screen Java perspective. If I'm undocked, that's the perspective I'll use. If I'm docked, I can switch to the 2-screen quickly using one icon in the toolbar. Any suggestions?
