How do you tell what object is being touched in touchesBegan?

I know that this is a very commonly asked question, but all of the answers on every website don't work! If you still don't know what I mean, then maybe this line of code will help you understand. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:self.view]; if (touch.view == nextbutton) [self performSelector:@selector(next)]; if (touch.view == prevbutton) [self performSelector:@selector(previous)]; if (touch.view == moreoptionsbutton) [self performSelector:@selector(moresettings)]; } It doesn't do anything when you touch nextbutton, prevbutton, and more optionsbutton , which are UIImageViews by the way. I have also tried using isEqual: instead of == , but that hasn't worked out either. Any suggestions?
