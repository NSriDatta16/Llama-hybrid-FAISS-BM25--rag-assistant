Node that depends on the particular values of it's parents in a Bayesian network?

Consider a Bayesian network containing a binary variable C which denotes whether a certain person has a child or not. There is a second variable B which denotes the birthdate of the person's youngest child. There is an edge from C to B, but not always. Indeed, B is only meaningful where C=1. Or to put in other words, in p(B|C), C should automatically be set to 1. P(B|C=0), if it were meaningful, would have to be 0 everywheren! How can one model this situation in a Bayesian network?
