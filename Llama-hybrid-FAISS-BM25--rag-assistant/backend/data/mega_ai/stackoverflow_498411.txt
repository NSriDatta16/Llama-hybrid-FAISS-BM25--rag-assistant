You might, for example, use EC2 (on-demand, scalable, VPS) to host the actual application and S3 (networked storage) to store the data. You would probably not need Cloudfront (geographically optimized content mirroring). We use SQS (Simple Queue Service) to queue tasks we want performed asynchronously, i.e. without making the user wait for them to complete. As it turns out SQS becomes incredibly expensive if your site has even modest traffic, so we'll be handling queueing on one of our own boxes soon.
