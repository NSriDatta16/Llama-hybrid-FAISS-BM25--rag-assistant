The more 'standard' your requirements, the better buying fits (Or to put it another way, don't reinvent the wheel). Conversely, the more unique your requirements the more you might consider building. You quite rightly point out that even when buying there tends to be some customisation. Bear in mind that any customisation will cost you at each upgrade/patching time. I suggest that if your requirements are close to the business model supported by one of the tools you might buy that you serious consider realigning the business process to the vendors standard. If this is not possible ask if you are buying the correct tool. I would suggest that if someone suggests building it for cost reasons run screaming. In my experience the cost of buying is well known and the cost of build is well hidden. Remember that you will be making a decision to keep coding for the life of the App (average of 7 years for a business app) but may be considering only the initial development cost when deciding between buy and build. I have a strong preference for a single monolithic database but sometimes this is not workable. More important is to have a 'single source of the truth'; if you have multiple databases holding like data, pick one as the authoritative source of a given piece of data and have a process to maintain all others in agreement with that source. Preferable this will be automatic.
