Central limit theorem when the mean is not constant

I've heard that there is a soft version or interpretation of the CLT that says —in summary— that it can be applied also to a sequence of independent real-valued random variables that share the same distribution shape but not the mean (for instance, a sequence of $n$ normal variables $X_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma)$ where $\mu_i$ can be different for each $i$). Is that right? Where can I find it (textbook or article)? And, a last one: In this case (where $X_i$ are independently and equally distributed except for their means), what would the distribution of $Y=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{X_i}$ approximately be, according to CLT? EDIT: I want to stress that $X_i\sim N(\mu_i,\sigma)$ was just an example. What I have is $X_i \sim F_i$, where $F_i$ stands for the CDF of $X_i$, and where all $F_i$'s are equal to the same distribution (with a known constant variance $\sigma^2$) except for the fact that they have different averages $\mu_i$. EDIT: Just to make it clearer, what I would like to know is whether or not it is correct to state this: $Y=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{X_i}$ is approximately distributed as $N(\mu_Y,\sigma_Y)$, where $\mu_Y$ can be estimated as $\bar{x} = \frac{x_1+ \cdots + x_n}{n}$ and $\sigma_Y$ can be estimated as $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$, $s$ being the sample (quasi)standard deviation, using a random sample $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ of $(X_1, \dots, X_n)$.
