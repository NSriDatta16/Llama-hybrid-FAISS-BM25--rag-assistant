How does the length of a filename affect remaining storage space on a disk?

How does the length of a filename affect remaining storage space on a disk? I realize this is filesystem dependent. In particular I am thinking about the EXT series of file systems. I don't fully understand how inodes affect disk space and how the filename itself is stored. It's difficult to get relevant search results for this question too. That's why I'm asking here. On linux, the maximum file name length is usually 255 or 256 characters. When the file system is created, is that amount of space "reserved" for each and every file name? In other words, is disk storage not affected by the actual file name because the maximum is already used? Or is it more complicated than that? Suppose, I have a file named "joe.txt" and rename it to "joe2.txt". Has the amount of available disk space decreased after this? What about longer names like "joe_version.txt" or "joe_original_version_with_bug_that_Jim_solved.txt"? I am worried about thresholds at 8, 16, 32, 64, etc characters. I will be storing millions of images. I have never bothered to worry about such an issue before so I'm not completely sure how this works. Although EXT is the only filesystem I'm using, discussing FAT and others might be useful to somebody else that has a similar question.
