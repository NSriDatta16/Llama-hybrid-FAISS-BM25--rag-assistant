How do I draw an Image with a programmatically set alpha channel in .NET?

This is a .NET application on Windows forms using C++/CLI. I have a JPEG that I want to paint in my client area to represent an object. On some occasions -- like when the user is dragging objects around -- I'd like to draw the object with some transparency. What are the various available ways to do this?
