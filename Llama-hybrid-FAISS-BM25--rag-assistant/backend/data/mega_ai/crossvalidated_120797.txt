I'm going to address a couple different aspects of your question, but the short answer is "No". First, on probability: R0 is a tricky thing to think about in terms of probability, because it isn't a probability. Generally speaking, it's estimated using a deterministic model. Second, you have to keep in mind that R0 is something of a idealized parameter - the number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an entirely susceptible population . For measles, that's essentially describing Fantasyland, whereas for Ebola it is at least a marginally more reasonable scenario to consider. That makes the R0 between diseases difficult to compare. Third, R0 is contextless . Epidemics are not. To use a somewhat extreme example, if a population is 100% vaccinated against measles, the R0 could be 1.8, 18 or 180 and it wouldn't matter. What this all boils down to is a number that, despite the attention it gets, is somewhat limited in what it can actually do. You have to take the context of a disease into account, and consider it from there. For example, while large populations behave the way deterministic models predict they will (though I'll note "large" needs to be quite large), smaller populations are highly subject to stochastic extinction, which does strange things to the behavior of epidemics. Similarly, there is a readily available, easy to use vaccine for measles, and no such vaccine for Ebola, so if you want to talk about true epidemic potential, you don't only have to talk about the "launch" of the disease (which is where R0 is focused) but how well you can bring it under control. There are simulation approaches that use estimates like R0 to predict the probability of an outbreak, and then nature of that outbreak, but it's very difficult to justify just going off R0. What you can predict using R0 however is both the critical above or below 1 threshold, and that measles for example is more transmissible in a hypothetical epidemic than Ebola, though again I'd assert the context for both epidemics would change the nature of things more than their R0 (see how much we freaked out about a single-digit number of Ebola cases vs. MMR vaccine denialism).
