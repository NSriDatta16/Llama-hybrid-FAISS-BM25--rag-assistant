How can you summarize growth in the "production" rate per person?

I have been reading the book, Good to Great by Jim Collins. It says that you should focus on information that "cannot be ignored," and that you should focus on the right "denominator." I thought it would be good to measure "Average Growth Rate per Producing Entity." If we are providing value and support, we would expect to be helping them "produce more." I have production data in an excel spreadsheet that I can summarize. I primarily use "pivot tables" for my data analysis. I know that you can do "percentage change over previous time period" but I end up with distortions for the first year, when people don't have a full period to produce. I also am not sure how to summarize it. Is there a better program that I should use for this? Is there a good way to do this in excel? I was thinking you could take the geometric mean (what growth rate would you need on the initial production number in order to end up with the final number -- or so I believe it is explained) and besides that I'm not sure where to start. I would love to use pivot tables or something similar where I can just hit refresh and get the updated version of the numbers. Any ideas out there?
