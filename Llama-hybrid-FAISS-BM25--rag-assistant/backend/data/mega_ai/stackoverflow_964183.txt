Is it OK to group form elements into "p"?

Let's say I have this code Name: Is it semanticaly fine to group elements with p ? Because my teacher (again.. I know ..:P) told me that p should be used only for paragraph and that I should use div instead, but as I can see, p is used a lot and almost everywhere. The last possibility I can think of is , which I think is the worst way. So which one is the best to use wrap by wrap by at the end
