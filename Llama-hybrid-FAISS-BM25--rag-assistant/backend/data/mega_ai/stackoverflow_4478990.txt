Sorry code block in comments was unreadable, this is how I got it working with JUST javascript: $(document).ready(function() { editImage=new Image(); editImage.src='http://graffpic/uploads/fracture_1292689775.jpg'; console.log(editImage.src); setupCanvas(); }); Only problem is when I output it with PHP it will say $ is UNDEFINED - so this is most likely a loading issue - can anyone give me a bit more detail on this and what to do? I COULD import the jQuery library AGAIN, but that seems clunky; either that or I could import the code fragment that is needed for $(document).ready() which is again quite clunky. Any help?
