Confidence Interval Coverage-error and Type I error

Could somebody explain to me the relationship between coverage error and type one errors in multiple comparisons testing, if there is one in fact? Does a coverage error occur when the true value of the comparison is in fact not within the parameters of the confidence interval? Further, does this have any influence on the probability of a type I/II error for that comparison? Thanks
