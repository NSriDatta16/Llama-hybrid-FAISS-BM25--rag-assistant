Drag and drop issues in TinyMCE

I'm trying to let users visually move around component placeholders inside a TinyMCE editor, however I can only seem to get drag and drop working with divs in Internet Explorer. Even dragging simple text around seems buggy in Firefox and Chrome. Any way of getting this done somehow? I've tried finding a plugin or something but no luck so far.
