What criteria to use for separating variables into explanatory variables and responses for ordination methods in ecology?

I have different variables that interact within a population. Basically I have been doing an inventory of millipedes and measuring some other values of the terrain, like: The species and the amount of specimens collected The different environments where the animals are the pH The percentage of organic material the amount of P, K, Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu Ca + Mg/K relation Basically I would like to use PCA to determine which variables drive the variability of the samples and make the forest (environments) different; which variables should I use for "variables" and which ones for "individuals"?
