You definitely need a project manager. An experienced interactive PM will at least know what the various technologies are and what they should and should not be used for. Prior programming experience is preferred, but not necessarily required. Strong communication and organizational skills, diplomacy, a proactive attitude and a passion for planning and documentation are absolutely required. I would strongly recommend AGAINST having your PM do any actual production work of any kind. After all, this is what got you into the unpleasant place you are--it's very difficult to switch back and forth between manager and maker, and generally results in under-managing projects.
