bzr init-repo creates shared repository which is used to store branches' historical data. So all branches inside one shared repo will actually share the storage. Therefore you will need less space for history data of every branch, and faster branching. If you don't care about space efficiency and speed of new branch creation then don't use shared repositories. So if you want to have several branches for every of your projects (MyProject, MyHomepage, MyDocuments) the right way is: bzr init-repo ./MyProject bzr init ./MyProject/trunk bzr init-repo ./MyHomepage bzr init ./MyHomepage/trunk bzr init-repo ./MyDocuments bzr init ./MyDocuments/trunk If you plan to have only one branch for every of your project then don't use shared repo at all, and do as James Polley suggested. You even can create shared repo later and put your current branch into it with bzr reconfigure --use-shared .
