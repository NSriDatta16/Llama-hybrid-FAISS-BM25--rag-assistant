How should I design an experiment to figure out causal relationship between smoking and drinking?

I am recently learning causal inference, and asked two questions without any answer. So I decide to ask the question differently from high level. We know smoking and drinking are correlated, a person smokes are more likely to have drinking problems. However, we do not known which cause which. Suppose I want to figure out the causal relationship between the two, How should I design an experiment or collect what kind of data? PS. two questions I asked. Intuitively how does Bayesian Network Structure Learning Work? How can I infer causal relationships in this case? Maarten Buis had a great point! In real world we have ethical constraints, But I wants trying to ask, suppose we do not consider ethical constraints what kind of experiments are needed?
