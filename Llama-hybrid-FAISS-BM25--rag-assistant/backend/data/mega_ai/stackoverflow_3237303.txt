Do any of the R GUI assist with power calculations / analysis?

I met with several people who are familiar with SPSS and would be reluctant to wade into R but might be encouraged to do so from the comfort of a GUI. Do any of the GUIs provide support for power calculations? I searched around for about 15 minutes and could not find anything to tell me that they could. Do you happen to know?
