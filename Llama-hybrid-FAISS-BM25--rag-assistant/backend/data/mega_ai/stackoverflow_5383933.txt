Python mechanize SelectControl is empty when it should have values

I'm trying to automate the download of some data from a webform. I'm using python's mechanize module. The url is here: http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/components/sequence/HIV/search/search.html I need to fill out the Sequence Length, Subtype and Genomic Region. I've got the Sequence-Length and Genomic-Region figured out but I'm having trouble with selecting the Subtype. When I load the form is get an empty SelectControl and mechanize won't let me select anything. This code should load the website: import mechanize import cookielib # Browser br = mechanize.Browser() # Cookie Jar cj = cookielib.LWPCookieJar() br.set_cookiejar(cj) # Browser options br.set_handle_equiv(True) br.set_handle_gzip(True) br.set_handle_redirect(True) br.set_handle_referer(True) br.set_handle_robots(False) # Follows refresh 0 but not hangs on refresh > 0 br.set_handle_refresh(mechanize._http.HTTPRefreshProcessor(), max_time=1) br.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008071615 Fedora/3.0.1-1.fc9 Firefox/3.0.1')] br.open('http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/mainpage.html') br.follow_link(text = 'Search Interface') br.select_form(nr = 1) Any help would be greatly appreciated. -Will EDIT: I tried to use BeautifulSoup to re-parse the HTML (as per this SO question ) but no luck there. New Edit: Below is an excerpt of the mechanize form. For some reason the slave control is not populated with the possible choices.
