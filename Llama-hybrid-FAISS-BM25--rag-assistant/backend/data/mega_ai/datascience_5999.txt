Have you tried Random Forest to do feature selection for categorical features. Random Forest uses proximity calculation(information gain) on deciding to split on a particular feature. Random Forest: "After each tree is built, all of the data are run down the tree, and proximities are computed for each pair of cases. If two cases occupy the same terminal node, their proximity is increased by one. At the end of the run, the proximities are normalized by dividing by the number of trees. Proximities are used in replacing missing data, locating outliers, and producing illuminating low-dimensional views of the data" For more check this link out: http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm#varimp
