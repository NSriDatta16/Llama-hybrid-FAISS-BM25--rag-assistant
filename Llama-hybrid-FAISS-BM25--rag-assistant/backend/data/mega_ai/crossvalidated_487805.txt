I think one could construct an example when the logistic regression is asymptotically Bayes-optimal (i.e., it minimises the expected 0/1 loss). One way to do this would be to consider a domain with two balanced (i.e., with equal marginal probabilities) normally distributed classes with the same covariance matrix. In this case, the logistic regression would learn the same classifier as LDA (linear discrimination analysis) which is asymptotically Bayes-optimal in this domain (this follows from Theorem 22.7 in L. Wasserman, All of Statistics).
