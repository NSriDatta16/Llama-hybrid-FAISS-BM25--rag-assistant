If you switch to sequentialguids and reorganize the index once at the same time, you'll eliminate fragmentation. I don't understand why you want to just wait until the fragmented page links rearrange themselves in continuous extents. That being said, have you done any measurement to show that the fragmentation is actually affecting your system? Just looking at an index and seeing 'is fragmented 75%' does not imply that the access time is affected. There are many more factors that come into play (buffer pool page life expectancy, rate of reads vs. writes, locality of sequential operations, concurrency of operations etc etc). While switching from guids to sequential guids is usualy safe, you may introduce problems still. For instance you can see page latch contention for an insert intensive OLTP system because it creates a hot-spot page where the inserts accumulate.
