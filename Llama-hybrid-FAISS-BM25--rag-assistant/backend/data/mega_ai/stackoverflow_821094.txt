Embedded Form in a control or Form as User Control

Okay I have a large CRUD app that uses tabs with Forms embedded in them like so --> public static void ShowFormInContainerControl(Control ctl, Form frm) { frm.TopLevel = false; frm.FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.None; frm.Dock = DockStyle.Fill; frm.Visible = true; ctl.Controls.Add(frm); } I then call the below in the Form Load event of the Parent Form --> // Embedd the child form in the this Parent WinFormCustomHandling.ShowFormInContainerControl(pnlModuleHost, _frmWWCModuleHost); This was given to me HERE in response to my previous question. As I have progressed in this I keep getting the nausiating feeling that multiple layers of embedded Forms are a disaster waiting to happen and User Controls keep popping up. Can anyone offer me some concrete advice on using user controls vs embedding forms? See my previous question for the inspiration to this one. HERE Also a screen shot of what my current embedded form layout looks like in action can be found HERE . Thank You
