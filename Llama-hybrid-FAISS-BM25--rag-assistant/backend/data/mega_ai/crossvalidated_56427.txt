vector fit interpretation NMDS

So a colleague and myself are using principal component analysis (PCA) or non metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to examine how environmental variables influence patterns in benthic community composition. A common method is to fit environmental vectors on to an ordination. The length and direction of the vectors seems somewhat straighforward but I don't understand how an R squared value or a p-value is calculated for these vectors. I have looked at a dozen papers and the most I can gather is that these numbers are calculated using permutations of the data. This does not seem very intuitive. What data is being permuted? How does this permutation create an R squared value and what variance is being explained? My limited understanding of an R squared value comes from linear regressions. I need to explain this to people who have little to no background in statistics so any help understanding these concepts or a link to an available text would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!
