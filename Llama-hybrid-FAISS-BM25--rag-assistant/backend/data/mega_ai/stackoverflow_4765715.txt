You do this with what's called an "outlet". You define them in your controller, mark them clearly as IBOutlet and then connect them in Interface Builder to your file owner (or other delegate object created in IB). For instance, in your FooController.m you might have this: @interface FooController () @property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UILabel* fooLabel; @end Then you would select your label, and either control drag from it to the file owner, or go to its connections tab, and drag from the + under referencing outlet, to the file owner and select the fooLabel . UPDATE : Code sample changed to reflect modern way of handling this case.
