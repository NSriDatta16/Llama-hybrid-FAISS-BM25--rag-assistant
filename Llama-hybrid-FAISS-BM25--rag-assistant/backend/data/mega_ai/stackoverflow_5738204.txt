Can't understand how gitignore ignores the folders

I want to create repository for my Magento project. There are lots of folders and files in root directory and I change time to time only one folder: app/code/local/ Everything else I want to ignore. But.. can't. My .gitignore file: * !app/code/local/ !app/code/local/* Then when I try to add folder to repo I get an error: git add app/code/local/Mds/ The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files: app Use -f if you really want to add them. fatal: no files added Can anyone please help with this?
