A few Suggestions: 1) Run Cluster iterations on both sets of data and compare the mean centers. 2) If there are too many questions and sets of questions belong to the same category, run a PCA to reduce the number of factors. 3) If your questions and responses are scalar - "rate on a scale of 1 to 5" then an attitudinal segmentation of people can be done. It would be helpful if you can post the purpose of your survey, what you are hoping to achieve with it and a few more details about the nature of the data.
