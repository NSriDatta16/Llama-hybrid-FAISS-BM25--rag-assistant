What we can see on your data is Mean is time varying Variance is time varying (I don't understand how you came to the conclusion that the variance is almost constant) Hence, look at the assumptions behind he ARMA models and ask yourself: "are those assumptions satisfied?". I believe one of these is the stationarity assumption . Hence, your got your answer. We expect rubbish forecasts when we fit an inappropriate model to our data. "how to model the trend for future points in a time series if the time series model is not a good fit ?" Obviously further assumptions have to be made and tested as the ARMA ones don't appear to be plausible for your problem. One of these could be the "local stationarity" assumption. Could this assumption possibly be satisfied? If yes, you may choose (or build) a model among the class of models satisfying this assumption. You basically have to identify attributes of the series that seem fairly stable in time and/or models consistent with the features of your series. And to be clear, I just give you some hints that may help you with any future research, as this is not a task for a beginner in time series analysis. Finally, note that quite often we fail miserably in detecting trends (e.g. especially when it comes to financial data), had that been easy, most of us would have been billionaires.
