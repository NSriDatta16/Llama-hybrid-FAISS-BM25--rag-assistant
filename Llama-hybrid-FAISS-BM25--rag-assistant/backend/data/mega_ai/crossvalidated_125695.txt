What type of test should be used?

What kind of test would I use to find the answer to this? Is there evidence that cereals promoted in an in-store circular have a higher average number of units sold per store than cereals not promoted in an in-store circular? I was given data from a cereal company’s promotional statistics and asked to answer this. However, I’m unsure of which test to use.
