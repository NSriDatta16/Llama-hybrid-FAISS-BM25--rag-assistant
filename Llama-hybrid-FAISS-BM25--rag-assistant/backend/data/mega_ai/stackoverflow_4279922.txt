Algorithm for creating fisheye effect from a normal image

I am trying to create an OpenGL fragment shader that converts a normal image to an image that contains fish eye effect. This is what i mean by fish eye affect (http://www.marcofolio.net/photoshop/create_a_fish_eye_lens_effect_in_photoshop.html). By normal image i mean a rendered image taken from a virtual camera in a 3d interactive environment, not an image taken from a real camera, but i guess that doesnt really make much difference in terms of this problem. Does anyone have any idea how Photoshop does it, or where i can find material that explains the algorithm? Thanks
