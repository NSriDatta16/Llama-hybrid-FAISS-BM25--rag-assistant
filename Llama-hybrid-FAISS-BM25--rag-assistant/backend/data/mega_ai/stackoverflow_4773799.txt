If I get you right, you don't want to set the ItemsSource and stuff like that in code behind. Have a look at the MVVM Pattern ( http://jesseliberty.com/2010/05/08/mvvm-its-not-kool-aid-3/ ). This is a really cool approach to seperate you View from your "data". If you want it in own assemblys, you create a View assembly and a ViewModel assembly. To display the data you use bindings.
