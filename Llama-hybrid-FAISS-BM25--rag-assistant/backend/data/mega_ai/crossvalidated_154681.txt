The CRLB Estimator proposed, is just the standard estimator on the MSE conventional sense. There is nothing too strange to worry about. Just follow the cautions here indicated regarding the estimation of MA processes. Answer 1 The proper representation is: $$x(t)=b_0 u(t) + b_1 u(t−1)+b_2 u(t−2)+v(t)$$ that is: $$x(t)=\mathbf{u(t)b} + w(t)$$ or: $$\mathbf{x=H \theta + w}$$ This is an ARMAX model with no autoregressive (AR) order, $n_a$ =0, two moving average (MA) orders, $n_b=2+1$ , and white noise $w=N(0,\sigma^2)$ . $H$ is the matrix of observations from $u(0)...u(n)$ . Answer 2 The expression on the document on p.37 are somehow incorrect, on the sense the matrix $H(t)^TH(t)$ depends on time. For making the estimator MVU (Minimum Variance & Unbiased), in the sense of the slides presented, Ensure the measurement over a large $t$ in order to reduce the impact of the initial conditions on the Parameter Estimation: $$t -> \inf$$ so $$H(t)^TH(t)$$ is not triangular (just as $H(0)^TH(0)$ is), but tends to diagonal. Ensure an i.i.d. random white-noise (RN) input: $$u(t)=N(0,\sigma_u)$$ Thus by definition of i.i.d., the autocorrelation of the input will be: $$r_{uu}(0)=\sigma_u^2$$ $$r_{uu}(\tau)|_{\tau<>0}=0$$ Qualitatively and theoretically there is little difference between a perfect and a pseudo white noise, as the i.i.d. is a stronger abstraction than the perfection of the whiteness for these identically and independency. Build the matrix $H(t)^TH(t)$ and construct the estimators: $$\theta=(H(t)^TH(t))^{-1}H(t)^Tx(t)$$ $$C_{\theta}=\sigma^2(H(t)^TH(t))^{-1}$$ Cheers...
