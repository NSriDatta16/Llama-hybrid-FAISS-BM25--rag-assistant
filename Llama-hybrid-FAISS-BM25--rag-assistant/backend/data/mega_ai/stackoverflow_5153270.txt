Usually, .Net stores it under windows Vista or windows 7 in: C:\Users\_user_\AppData\Local\IsolatedStorage On windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\_user_\Local Settings\Application Data\IsolatedStorage Both with _user_ the username of the user. Under these folders are completely obscure subdirectories which are created and maintained by the isolated storage API. I don't know if there is any difference in this on WP7 or Silverlight, but else it is stored here
