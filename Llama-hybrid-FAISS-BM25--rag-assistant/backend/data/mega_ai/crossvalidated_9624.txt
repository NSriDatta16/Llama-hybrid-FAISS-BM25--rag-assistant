I was just wondering about exactly the same question when analyzing the latest National Hospital Discharge Survey data. Several variables have substantial missing values, such as marital status and type of procedure. This issue came to my attention because these categories showed up with strong (and significant) effects in most logistic regression analyses I was running. One is inclined to wonder why a missing code is given. In the case of marital status, for instance, it is plausible that failure to provide this information could be linked to important factors such as socioeconomic status or type of disease. In your case of high blood pressure, we should ask why would the value not be known or refused? This could be related to practices at the institution (perhaps reflecting lax procedures) or even to the individuals (such as religious beliefs). Those characteristics in turn could be associated with diabetes. Therefore, it seems prudent to continue as you have, rather than to code these values as missing (thereby excluding them from analysis altogether) or attempting to impute the values (which effectively masks the information they provide and could bias the results). It's really not any more difficult to do: you merely have to make sure this variable is treated as categorical and you'll get one more coefficient in the regression output. Furthermore, I suspect the BRFSS datasets are large enough that you don't have to worry about power.
