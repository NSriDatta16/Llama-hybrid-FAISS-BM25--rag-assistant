"is there a test to demonstrate that my variables are not independent?" - Yes, this is the chi-squared test. "If so, should I just stick with chi square and state in my methods section that logistic regression was investigated but the variables were found to lack independence?" - No, you can still build a logistic regression using an interaction term.
