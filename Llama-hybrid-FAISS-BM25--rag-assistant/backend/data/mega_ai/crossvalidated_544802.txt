I suspect they are not weighting by the standard error, which would mean giving higher weight to less certain results, but weighting by the reciprocal of the square of the standard error, i.e. inverse-variance weighting , because this has the least variance among all weighted averages. For example the Cochrane Statistical Methods Group suggests the generic inverse-variance weighted average $$\frac{\sum Y_i (1/SE_i^2)}{\sum (1/SE_i^2)}$$ with a reference to Rice K, Higgins JPT, Lumley T. A re-evaluation of fixed effect(s) meta-analysis. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A (Statistics in Society) 2018; 181: 205-227. Since $SE_i^2$ is an estimator of $\frac1{n_i}\sigma_i^2$ , you might hope that its reciprocal was approximately proportional to $n_i$ if all the $\sigma_i^2$ are the same and so you might get something similar to your suggestion of weighting by $n_i$ . But there are two additional reasons for this particular method: the individual studies may have taken different approaches to estimating the same parameter, some more accurate than others, and this difference in precision can be taken into account most studies may report a standard error for their estimate even when they are more confused about the actual $n$ used (especially if parts of the original sample are dropped for one reason or another)
