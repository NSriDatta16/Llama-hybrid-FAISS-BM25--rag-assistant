Forecasting quarterly seasonal time series

I have to build a forecasting model to predict one very seasonal time series. I want to predict it with external variables. My first approach was to de-seasonalize the data (time series frequency is quarter) and then to perform some kind of regression (mostly linear with some regularization but also tried SVM for regression and GBM without terrific success). The problem is that I have trouble to de-seasonalize correctly since the seasonal factors are increasing over time. Then I tried to build dummies variable that are increasing (some kind of trend dummies (don't know if that exists :) ) Results were not better. Therefore, I am trying to build one model for each quarter. I have then much less data to learn the model (once a year instead of four) but I am much more confident in this approach. The problem is that when I predict a quarter I do not take into account the forecasting error I made in the last quarter or all the information I got from the last three quarters. Do you have any idea of what I can do? I was thinking about Kalman filter but I have never implemented it so I don't know if it could be done in this context ? If yes, can you give me the main idea?
