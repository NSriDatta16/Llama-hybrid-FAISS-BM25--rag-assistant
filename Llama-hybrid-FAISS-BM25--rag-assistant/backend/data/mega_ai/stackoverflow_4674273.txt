Have you taken into account the lower resolution copies of the texture that get created to do mipmapping ? pre-calculated, optimized collections of images that accompany a main texture, intended to increase rendering speed and reduce aliasing artifacts. These reduce in steps of powers of 2 so you'll have a 256x256, a 128x128, a 64x64, ... image accompanying the main texture. This will eat into your texture memory much faster than if you just had the single image. In the example they use on Wikipedia the original texture is 256x256 and they take the mip-map textures all the way down to 1x1. By their calculations The increase in storage space required for all of these mipmaps is a third of the original texture This assumes that you haven't turned it off of course. As to how you increase the amount of memory you can have access to - sorry no idea.
