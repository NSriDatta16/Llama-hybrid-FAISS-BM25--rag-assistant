Which method (enter, Forward LR or Backward LR) of logistic regression to use?

My study is a prospective observational study. My dependent variable (outcome) is development of surgical site infection (SSI) after surgery and my independent variables (predictors) are many factors containing socio-demographics, pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative factors. Outcome is dichotomous : SSI: 0=No , 1=Yes Predictors are dichotomous as well as polychotomous( 3 or more categories) , e.g. ASA score: 0=Class_1, 1=Class_2, 2=Class_3, 3=Class_4 I have already done the cross-tabulation (Chi square test) and i have also done univariate analysis using Enter method of binary logistics for every single variable. Now i want to perform a multivariate analysis using all the predictors who came out to be significant in the univariate analysis (P= Reference 1: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23392976 Reference 2: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11198018 My questions: 1) For polychotomous variables, i transformed them into dichotomous variables for one single category. e.g. I made 4 seperate columns for 4 classes of ASA score. and put them all individually in Univariate? and those who come out to be significant will be put in multivariate with 0=No as the reference category? Is this method acceptable? 2) Which method regarding binary logistics is the best as per my study? i want to find out independent risk factors of SSI with Odds ratio?
