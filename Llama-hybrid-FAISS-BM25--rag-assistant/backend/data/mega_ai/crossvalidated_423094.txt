Yes it is possible. Basically any learner can be bootstrap aggregated (bagged) to produce ensemble models and for any bagged ensemble model, the variable importance can be computed. Since the random forest learner inherently produces bagged ensemble models, you get the variable importance almost with no extra computation time. For linear regression which is not a bagged ensemble, you would need to bag the learner first. That is to re-run the learner e.g. 50 times on bootstrap sampled data. So for large data sets it is computationally expensive (~factor 50) to bag any learner, however for diagnostics purposes it can be very interesting. For a regression example, if a strict interaction (no main effect) between two variables is central to produce accurate predictions. The vanilla linear model would ascribe no importance to these two variables, because it cannot utilize this information. Any general purpose non-linear learner, would be able to capture this interaction effect, and would therefore ascribe importance to the variables. Here's a related answer including a practical coding example:
