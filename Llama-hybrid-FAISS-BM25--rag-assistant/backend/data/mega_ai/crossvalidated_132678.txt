Your intuition is exactly right. This phenomenon is called complete separation . You can find quite a lot (now that you know its name) Googling around ... It is fairly thoroughly discussed here in a general context , and here in the context of GLMMs . The standard solution to this problem is to add a small term that pushes the parameters back toward zero -- in frequentist contexts this is called a penalized or bias-corrected method. The standard algorithm is due to Firth (1993, "Bias reduction of maximum likelihood estimates" Biometrika 80, 27-38), and is implemented in the logistf package on CRAN. In Bayesian contexts this is framed as adding a weak prior to the fixed-effect parameters. To my knowledge Firth's algorithm hasn't been extended to GLMMs, but you can use the Bayesian trick by using the blme package, which puts a thin Bayesian layer over the top of the lme4 package. Here's an example from the above-linked GLMM discussion: cmod_blme_L2 The first two lines in this example are exactly the same as we would use in the standard glmer model; the last specifies that the prior for the fixed effects is a multivariate normal distribution with a diagonal variance-covariance matrix. The matrix is 4x4 (because we have 4 fixed-effect parameters in this example), and the prior variance of each parameter is 9 (corresponding to a standard deviation of 3, which is pretty weak -- that means +/- 2SD is (-6,6), which is a very large range on the logit scale). The very large standard errors of the parameters in your example are an example of a phenomenon closely related to complete separation (it occurs whenever we get extreme parameter values in a logistic model) called the Hauck-Donner effect .
