I think asp.net model has quite a bit dependency for encryption and machine specific storage, so I am not sure if it works to avoid sticky IP for session. I don't know about ASP.NET AJAX (I use MonoRail NJS approach instead), but session state could be an issue for you. You have to make sure session states are serializable, and don't use InMemory session. You probably need to run ASP.NET Session State Server to make sure the whole frontend farm are using the same session storage. In such case session has to be perfectly serializable (thats why no object in session is preferred, you have to always use ID, and I bet MS stick on this limitation when they do AJAX library development)
