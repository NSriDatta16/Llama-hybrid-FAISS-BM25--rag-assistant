Feasibility of running mixed-effects poisson/logistic regression with correlation structure such as AR(1), Toeplitz

I'm not aware of any R package that lets me use specify the covariance pattern model such as in the package nlme and run the mixed effects poisson/logistic regression. Is this because of mathematical limitations or just because I'm not aware of the package? This isn't a package request because I'm requesting why it's not mathematically possible if it is not possible.
