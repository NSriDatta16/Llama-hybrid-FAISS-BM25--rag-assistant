OK well I haven't been able to find an answer for this. I am able to hide the radio button for selecting their own schedule and the "Select Schedule" button using CSS, by changing ReportingServices.css (located in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSRS10.MSSQLSERVER\Reporting Services\ReportManager\Styles on my Win 2008 server) input#ui_rdoOnSchedule { display:none; } input#ui_btn_SpecifyScheduleSubscriptionProp { display:none; } However it's not very elegant - the text for "When the scheduled report run is complete" and "At 8:00 am every Mon of every week" is still visible. -Matt
