SELinux requires user attention and manual permission granting whenever (oh, well) you don't have a permission for something. Many people such find that it gets in the way and turn it off. In recent version, SELinux is more user friendly, and there are even talks about removing the possibility to turn it off, or hide it so only knowledgeable users would know how to do it - and it is assumed just users are precisely those who understand the consequences. With SELinux, there's a chicken and egg problem: in order to have it all the time, you as a user need to report problems to developers, so they can improve it. But users don't like to use it until it's improved, and it won't get improved if not many users are using it. So, it's left ON by default in hope that most people would use it long enough to report at least some problems before they turn it off. In the end, it's your call: do you look for a short-term fix, or a long-term improvement of the software, which will lead to removing the need to ask such question one day.
