i am using named routes to build links in menu new Zend_Navigation_Page_Mvc(array( 'label' => $category->getTitle(), 'route' => 'catalog-category', 'params' => array('id' => $category->getId()), )); exact module/controller/action mapping handled by routes module specific routes defined in module bootstrap. i cant give you more on this as my current routes implementation are too tricky and fragile. must heavily refactor it first.
