You arent running into any glaring issues, and at a certain point it might be wise to accept the business value of your model and not waste 30% of your time on 5% of your error. If you are really worried about the performance, you can always run you model through an AutoML framework like TPOT and see if their Bayesian Optimization finds something that you weren't able to manually.
