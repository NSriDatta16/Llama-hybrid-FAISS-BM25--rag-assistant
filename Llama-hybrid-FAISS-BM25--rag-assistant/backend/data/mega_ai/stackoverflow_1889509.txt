Here's a refined version of Pascal's answer. I upgraded the main plugin version to 1.2, the dependency to Groovy 1.7, and wrapped it all in a pluginManagement tag so that it will nicely leverage the inheritance model. Keep in mind that the 1.3-SNAPSHOT of the GMaven plugin has already begun using the 1.7-rc2 Groovy provider. org.codehaus.gmaven gmaven-plugin 1.2 org.codehaus.gmaven.runtime gmaven-runtime-1.7 1.2
