I would argue that you cannot, for a couple of reasons. But before we do, lets notice that you can get rid of the rolling volatility idea. If we had a time series $\{x_1\dots{x_t}\}$ and we chunked them into 30 day rolling intervals, then we would needlessly lose information in the first thirty days. Interval one would contain $\{x_1\dots{x_{30}}\}$, while interval two would contain $\{x_2\dots{x_{31}}\}$. Notice that the difference in the intervals is only one day. The only unique information in interval one is $x_1$, while the only unique information in interval two is $x_{31}$. Otherwise, they share the same information set. You would lose information in your scheme, 29 days worth. Now lets look at the nature and structure of bitcoin. In the short-run, new coins can be added, but at an exponentially decaying rate. As long as the counter currencies are not in deflation, then whether bitcoin is inflationary or deflationary would depend upon the relative inflation rate, except that the method of creating bitcoins, a form of seigniorage, actually can make the coin more valuable by adding outlets for spending. Because the long run supply of bitcoins is fixed and it exists in a world of inflationary fiat currencies, the value of a coin, in the absence of mass death such as a 21st century black plague, is increasing across time when compared to fiat currencies. This implies that its time series should have the representation $x_{t+1}=Rx_t+\epsilon_{t+1},R>1$. I am a little concerned about the mechanism of trades, but I will ignore the liquidity issues for now and assume $\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_t)$. Notice that $R$ is unknown, it is the reward for holding a bitcoin. The distribution of $R$ is not a unit root as $R>1$. The idea of a unit root implies $R=1$. The likelihood function for $R$ is $$\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{\gamma}{\gamma^2+(x_{t+1}-R)^2}.$$ This likelihood function, or density function if you look at it from a maximum likelihood point of view, has no population mean, so it cannot have a standard deviation. $\gamma$ is a scale parameter and $R$ is a center of location, but the former is not a standard deviation and the later is not a mean. You can know, ex ante, that your system lacks a variance and so has no volatility in the sense you think about it. You can show, with some headaches, that any sample standard deviation is a random number. The asymptotic measure of volatility is $\gamma$ and your only tool is a Bayesian method. You can test for a structural change in either or both parameters using Bayesian methods by assuming two or more series exist and that they change at points $k_1, k_2\dots{k_n},$ using the Bayesian model selection to determine which model is the best.
