If you already own QTP (I'm inferring that from your comment about having to buy the Infragisitcs plugin), then you can make it work with Infragistics. The Infragistics plugin will make record/playback easier, but you should be able to get by without it. You want to use the .Object property on your QTP objects. This will give you access to the native methods and properties of the actual object, as opposed to the QTP proxy for that object. If you know that your grid control has a FocusCell method, then you could perform that like: SwfWindow().SwfObject().Object.FocusCell 0,0 3rd party grids are always problematic, regardless of vendor. Some more common workarounds are using keystrokes for navigation and keystrokes (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C) + the clipboard API to retrieve data from the grid.
