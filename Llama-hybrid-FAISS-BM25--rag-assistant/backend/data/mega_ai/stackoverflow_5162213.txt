List/matrix of coefficients equation (system of equations)

I try to extract coefficient from equations (system of equations) into list (matrix). I have tried CoefficientList[poly, {var1, var2, ...}] but without success. This simple example should explain my problem: Eq1 = a D[U[x1, x2], {x1, 2}] + b D[V[x1, x2], {x2, 2}] Any advice? Edit: Daniel's Lichtblau solution is very clear (thanks you), but what if the equation that looks like this? Eq1 = a D[U[x1, x2], {x1, 2}] + b D[V[x1, x2], {x2, 2}] + c W[x1, x2] A simple example can be resolved as follows: Is there any more elegant solution? (particularly for more complex expressions) Ps I can't understand why, but this solution gives me the correct result.
