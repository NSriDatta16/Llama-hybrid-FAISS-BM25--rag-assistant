you should set the value in the Model that you send to the viewengine, from your GET controller action. something like: ActionResult MyMethod() { var vm = new OrganisationData { NavigationData = new NavigationData{ choice = 1 } }; return View("myview", vm); } Don't put logic in the view as John suggests, this is a massive design antipattern and will only cause you woe in the long run. Edit: passing the default to the view from the controller means the controller has made the decision as to what the default is. This is logic and therefore doesnt belong in the view. Doing it in the controller makes it testable.
