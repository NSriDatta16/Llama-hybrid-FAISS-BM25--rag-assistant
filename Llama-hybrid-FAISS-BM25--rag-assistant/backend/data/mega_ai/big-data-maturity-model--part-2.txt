efore consists of a significant body of knowledge. Maturity stages The different stages of maturity in the TDWI BDMM can be summarized as follows: Stage 1: Nascent The nascent stage as a pre–big data environment. During this stage: The organization has a low awareness of big data or its value There is little to no executive support for the effort and only some people in the organization are interested in potential value of big data The organization understand the benefits of analytics and may have a data warehouse An organization's governance strategy is typically more IT-centric rather than being integrative business-and-IT centric Stage 2: Pre-adoption During the pre-adoption stage: The organization start to investigate big data analytics Stage 3: Early adoption The "chasm" There is then generally a series of hurdles it needs to overcome. These hurdles include: Obtaining the right skill set to support the capability, including Hadoop and advanced analytical skills Political issues, i.e. big data projects are conducted in areas within the organization and trying to expand the effort or enforcing more stringent standards and governance lead to issues regarding ownership and control Stage 4: Corporate adoption The corporate adoption stage is characterized by the involvement of end-users, an organization gains further insight and the way of conducting business is transformed. During this stage: End-users might have started operationalizing big data analytics or changing their decision-making processes Most organizations would already have repeatedly addressed certain gaps in their infrastructure, data management, governance and analytics Stage 5: Mature / visionary Only a few organizations can be considered as visionary in terms of big data and big data analytics. During this stage an organization: is able to execute big data programs as a well-oiled machine with highly mature infrastructure has a well-established big data program and big data governance strategies executes its big data program as a budgeted and planned initiative from an organization-wide perspective whose employees share a level of excitement and energy around big data and big data analytics Research findings TDWI did an assessment on 600 organizations and found that the majority of organizations are either in the pre-adoption (50%) or early adoption (36%) stages. Additionally, only 8% of the sample have managed to move past the chasm towards corporate adoption or being mature/visionary. Prescriptive The majority of prescriptive BDMMs follow a similar modus operandi in that the current situation is first assessed followed by phases plotting the path towards increased big data maturity. Examples are: Info-tech big data maturity assessment tool This maturity model is prescriptive in the sense that the model consists of four distinct phases that each plot a path towards big data maturity. Phases are: Phase 1, undergo big data education Phase 2, assess big data readiness Phase 3, pinpoint a killer big data use case Phase 4, structure a big data proof-of-concept project Radcliffe big data maturity model The Radcliffe big data maturity model, as other models, also consists of distinct maturity levels ranging from: 0 – "In the dark" 1 – "Catching up" 2 – "First pilot" 3 – "Tactical value" 4 – "Strategic leverage" 5 – "Optimize and extend" Booz & Company's model This BDMM provides a framework that not only enables organizations to view the extent of their current maturity, but also to identify goals and opportunities for growth in big data maturity. The model consists of four stages namely, Stage 1: Performance management Stage 2: Functional area excellence Stage 3: Value proposition enhancement Stage 4: Business model transformation Van Veenstra's model The prescriptive model proposed by Van Veenstra aims to firstly explore the existing big data environment of the organization followed by exploitation opportunities and a growth path towards big data maturity.
