Can I make a customer self-service product selection tool for the web/AIR with just Flash/Actionscript 3?

Can I make a customer self-service product selection tool for the web/AIR with just Flash/Actionscript 3 without having to use a separate database like SQLite? Essentially, after selecting a general category, the client drags and drops the tag words relevant to their needs into an adjacent box and a list of products that correspond to those tags, from greatest to least, appears in the box next that. I know that database driven apps are really on the rise but I am not clear if this situation really warrants it as I am just starting to learn (Lynda.com) and am coming from more of a content/design mentality. Thank you and pardon my noobness.
