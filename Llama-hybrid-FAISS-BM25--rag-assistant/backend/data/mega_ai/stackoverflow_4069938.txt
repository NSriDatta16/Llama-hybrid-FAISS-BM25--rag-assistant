NoSql databases are great for storing unstructured data. Think of it as the next generation of Lotus Notes. I wouldn't leverage a NoSql database for storing a list of people and addresses, as those are completely structured and well known. However, if I had a set of dynamic attributes of some type (name/value pairs) or something a similar which required a lot of pivoting to get to, then I'd seriously look into it. I might even go that route even if there is structure, but it isn't known ahead of time. Such as with dynamic tables. That said, when we did some evaluations earlier this year (March 2010) and we didn't think the state of the available open source NoSql databases were ready for serious production. There's a lot more to databases than just putting data in and getting it out. Automated backups, load balancing, solid query tools, consistency checkers, etc are an absolute must. We will reevaluate early next year.
