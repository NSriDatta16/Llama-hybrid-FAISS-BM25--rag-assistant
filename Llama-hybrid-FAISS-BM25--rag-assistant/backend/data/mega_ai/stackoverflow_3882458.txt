DragAndDrop selectedItems of one silverlight Datagrid into another

Currently I am using "DataGridDragDropTarget" to Drag a row from one datagrid to another, but a client want to be able to select multiple rows from one datagrid and drop them into another. I played around a bit but realized "DataGridDragDropTarget" seems to be able to drag and drop single row at a time only. Is there any alternative way to DragDrop multiple selected rows?
