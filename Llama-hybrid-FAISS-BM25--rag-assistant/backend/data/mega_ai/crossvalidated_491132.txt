What is the difference between least squares line and the regression line?

It is common to plot the line of best fit on a scatter plot when there is a linear association between two variables. One method of doing this is with the line of best fit found using the least-squares method. Another method would be to use a regression line that, which can be written as (y-mean(y))/SD(y) = r*(x-mean(x))/SD(x) . What is the difference between these two models? I don't understand when to use one over the other. We also learned that the regression line always passes through the averages of the conditional y distributions of the data is football-shaped when plotted. Is this also the case for the least-squares line?
