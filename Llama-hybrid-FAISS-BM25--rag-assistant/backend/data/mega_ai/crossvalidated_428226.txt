Neural networks, in vast majority of cases, need lots of data. If you have 20 observations, neural network is clearly a bad choice. With that small sample size, network would easily memorize the data and overfit. Even cross-validation with that small sample size is disputable, because you'd be validating the results on just few samples at a time. With that small sample you should aim at simple, robust models like (regularized) linear regression. Check also other questions tagged as small-sample .
