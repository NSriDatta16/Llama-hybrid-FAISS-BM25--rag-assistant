Being passed as an argument it will be copied which is very inefficient way of passing structures, especially big ones. However, basically, structs are passed to functions by pointer. Choosing between double some_big_array[VERY_LARGE_NUMBER]; and double *some_pointer depends only on the program design and how this field/structure will be used. The latter allows using variable size storage, however may need dynamic allocation.
