You use a time series model because it makes fewer assumptions about the data than the alternative. Most other types of statistical models assume independent observations: each case can be treated separately to every other case, and they don't affect one another. This is a very strong assumption, and one that is commonly violated for data that has a time component. If there is positive autocorrelation, then if a data point is high, then subsequent data points are also likely to be high; conversely, if there is negative autocorrelation, then a data point that's high is likely to have subsequent data points that are low. Similarly, you may have seasonality effects: January's figures may be consistently higher than July's figures, all other things being equal. Time series models allow you to take this behaviour into account when making predictions. Different types of models will do it in different ways. Some models can also let you include independent variables, much like a normal regression analysis; these independent variables can be fixed or time-varying.
