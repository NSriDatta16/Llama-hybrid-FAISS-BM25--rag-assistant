Log-log specified regression coefficients don't agree with level-level specification

I've got a bunch of data on charities and I'm doing a study on the effectiveness of fundraising in the sector. I've got two regressions. The first is $$\text{revenue} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{fundraising} + e$$ and the second is $$\log(\text{revenue}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log (\text{fundraising}) + e$$ where $e$ is an error term, revenue is the revenue of a charity in dollars, and fundraising is the fundraising expenditure of a charity in dollars. There are a bunch of other variables too, but the question is just about this, and the problem only gets worse when I add in more variables. The first specification gives me $\beta_1=1.4$. A way to interpret this is that on average, an increase of $1 in fundraising is associated with \$1.40 in increased revenue. This seems to also be like saying that fundraising has a 40% rate of return. The second gives me $\beta_1 = 0.36$. This is like saying that a 1% increase in fundraising dollars leads to a 0.36% increase in revenue. But this points to a negative rate of return for fundraising. Aren't these contradictory results? How is this possible? Any help is appreciated!
