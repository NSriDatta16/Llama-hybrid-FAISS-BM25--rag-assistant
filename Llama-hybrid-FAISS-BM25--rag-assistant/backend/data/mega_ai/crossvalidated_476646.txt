Hypothesis Testing in Logistic Regression

In Linear Regression, the book Introduction to Statistical Learning argued that we should use the $F$ statistic to decide if s $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = ... = 0$ instead of looking at individual p-values for the $t$ statistic. For instance, consider an example in which p = 100 and $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = ... = 0$ is true, so no variable is truly associated with the response. In this situation, about 5 % of the p-values associated with each variable will be below 0.05 by chance. But when discussing Logistic Regression, we settled with looking at individual p-values of the coefficients,as also seen in this tutorial. Is there a $F$ statistic counterpart for Logistic Regression? Thanks
