After 5 seconds of googling I found these plugins: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-rotate/ http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/ You might also be interested in http://www.useragentman.com/blog/csssandpaper-a-css3-javascript-library/ - It adds a lot of functionality to CSS via JavaScript. Rotating was never part of CSS2, so all cross-browser solutions are mostly workarounds. Be careful while using it!
