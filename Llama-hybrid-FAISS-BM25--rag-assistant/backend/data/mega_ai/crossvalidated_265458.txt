Your question can be disentangled in a few distinct ones: " Do prior information/posterior distribution have a frequentist equivalent?" No, the frequentist approach does assume that the parameters of interest are unknown constant, which need to be estimated, but does not assign any prior distribution to them. "Is the incorporation of prior knowledge incompatible with frequentist assumptions?" Strictly speaking, incorporating prior information in a frequentist setting is not impossible, but more difficult. For example, if you knew that your parameter were dependent on the values of other covariates, you could in principle incorporate that information in your likelihood. As far as your examples, they are a bit difficult to follow: in the frequentist setting, the estimation of the parameters of interest may be done by maximum likelihood, i.e. by taking into consideration the data in your likelihood. All the "biases" you mention in your examples would be easily captured by the available data, hence by MLE and I guess that the Bayesian and frequentist answers would be very similar. To clarify, there's no real prior information that you can use in your example, which will not be captured through the data in order to help you with your inference problem. In your case, a prior information may be that white faces are only contiguous (if such scheme fits the die). That is information which you would not be able to capture by the simple rolling of the dice, but can help your estimation (since the number of configurations is limited).
