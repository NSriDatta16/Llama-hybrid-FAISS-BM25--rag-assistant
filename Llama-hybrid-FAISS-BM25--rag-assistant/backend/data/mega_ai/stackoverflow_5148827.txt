First, you'll want to make sure that you're copying this library into your application bundle so that it will be available on the user's machine. To do this, add a new Copy Files build phase for your application to copy bundled frameworks. Within the properties of that build phase, make sure that the destination is Frameworks. Drag your library from your project into that build phase to make sure that it is packaged with your application. You may also need to modify the library itself so that it points to the correct location within the application bundle. In the past, I've done this by making a copy of the library within my project's directory, then using the following command to modify where the library expects to find itself: install_name_tool -id @executable_path/../Frameworks/libftd2xx.0.1.0.dylib libftd2xx.0.1.0.dylib In this case, the library being modified was called libftd2xx.0.1.0.dylib . You can use the command otool -L [library filename] to see the path where the library expects itself to be found and determine if this change needs to be made. Make sure that you change the path on the library within your Xcode project so that you will be linking against this new, modified version of the library residing within your project directory.
