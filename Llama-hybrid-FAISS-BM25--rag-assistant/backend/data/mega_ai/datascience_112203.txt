Newly discovered learning rule

Does anyone know how this algorithm performs the learning process for neural networks? I've stumbled over this solution. It works, but I don't know how and why. It's neuron-local and works without error or backpropagation. void NeuralCluster::applyLearning(float learningRate){ //Correct each neuron random independently vector alreadyDone; for(int i = 0; i = 0)&& (j >= 0) && (i Orginal source training in applyLearning() line 515
