How many attempts to randomly draw all 7 cards out of 7 with replacement?

Possible Duplicate: Probability associated with no of fleet calculation Assuming I have 7 cards (Ace - 7) shuffled, and I draw one card and replace it, reshuffle, and randomly draw another card, on average how many draws would it take to have picked each card at least once? I have been working on this problem and I've come to the conclusion that there are 7 separate events, such that the first is a 7/7 chance that a new card is chosen, the 2nd event would be 6/7, and so on until 1/7. What I am not sure of is how to combine the events such that it yields the number of draws. I should add that this particular answer in this example isn't as important as the "how". I would like to apply the same thinking to a different problem.
