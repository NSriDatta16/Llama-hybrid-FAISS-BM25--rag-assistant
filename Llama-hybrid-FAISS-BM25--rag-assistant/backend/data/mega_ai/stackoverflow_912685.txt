I'd usually just use a string - it's simpler in most cases. Otherwise you're likely to just create a new FileInfo from the string in the first place. If you're creating the method, you could always provide overloads to allow both. Of course, if you know that where you're intending to call it, you usually have a FileInfo rather than a string , that's a different matter. I can see your colleagues' point of view - in some ways a FileInfo is a "cleaner" way of expressing the parameter. I think string is the more pragmatic approach though :)
