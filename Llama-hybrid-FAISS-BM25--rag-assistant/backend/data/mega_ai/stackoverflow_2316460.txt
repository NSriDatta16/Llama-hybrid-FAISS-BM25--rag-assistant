Mismatch in object size returned by sos.dll and in-memory process size

I have used the following sos command to enumerate all instances of a particular type in a running asp application (hosted on windows xp 4 GB machine). .foreach (obj { !dumpheap -type ::my type:: -short ::start of address space:: ::end of address space:: }) { !objsize ${obj} }. This enumerates all objects of the given type in gc gen2. The object size on an average seems to be around 500 KB and there are around 2000 objects. This alone adds up to around 1 GB of memory whereas my asp-process memory in task manager shows only around 700 MB. One more point is that I haven't considered other loaded objects I am using. Also all the above objects are root objects that will not be garbage collected. Not sure if this command is wrong or if there is any other explanation for this mismatch in size that sos returns and what is shown in task manager? Thanks in advance, Bharath K.
