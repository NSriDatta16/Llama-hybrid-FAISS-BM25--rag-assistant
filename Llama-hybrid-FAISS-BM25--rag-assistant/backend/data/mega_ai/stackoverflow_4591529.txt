All that you said doesn't sound so bad. Try to write unit tests for your code, and then you will see how bad it is. If you get close to 100% coverage, your code is in very good shape. I would start worrying if it is bellow 50-60%, and if it is hard to add new things. For this you will need a tool to measure the code covered by unit tests.
