Here average orders per week are known from previous years. Hence one could just predict using those values: > ddf week_num order 1 1 10 2 2 20 3 3 15 4 4 10 5 5 5 6 6 5 7 7 10 8 8 15 9 9 20 10 10 10 myfn = function(cur_week_num,cur_order){ a = ddf$order[ddf$week_num==cur_week_num] next_week_num = ifelse((cur_week_num+1)>10, 1, (cur_week_num+1) ) b = ddf$order[ddf$week_num==next_week_num] return(cur_order * b/a) } If in current 2nd week there are 10 orders, one can predict for next week: > myfn(2,10) [1] 7.5
