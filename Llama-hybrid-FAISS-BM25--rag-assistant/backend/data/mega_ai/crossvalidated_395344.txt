Problem doing Machine Learning in this dataset

I have a problem to obtain good performances with a dataset. I have to predict the flow of visitors in my city given the distance of origin of tourists and the number of inhabitants of their city of origin. I plotted a 3D graph and the distribution is very bad. I first tried with Linear Regression, the simplest regression tool, I computed the MSE and the MAPE, with the MSE i noticed that the model didn't overfit, but in order to have another estimate, i computed also the MAPE with a mean absolute percentage error of 60%. So i decided to try with Random forest, i tried different number of estimators but the score does not increase. At the end, i decided to implement KNN, just to see how it performs, i computed the score for different values of k and i plotted the learning curves: So i'm not able to do better, i think that these data are very badly distributed. Someone could give me a hint?
