Both S3 and EC2 provide slightly different services than the typical web hosting package. S3 - Simple Storage Service, used for scalable file storage EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud, used for scalable compute resources The typical unlimited web hosting you may see advertised is marketed towards users with fairly basic needs. Email, blog hosting, forums, etc. EC2 is typically geared towards the more advanced users who need to scale on demand. Typical cases might be an ecommerce site during the holiday shopping season or even something like the site for The Masters (golf) during the week of the tournament. With EC2, scaling the compute resources to meet these needs during peak times, and then backing off during non-peak can be very cost effective. I typically equate EC2 as a competitor for the Dedicated Server hosting packages. You likely do not see a decrease in price, since many of the costs are fixed. (Rack space, equipment cost, power, cooling, etc.) Amazon allocates virtual machines when you reserve resources, which means they get around a lot of these physical limitations by virtualizing the hardware. Personally, I believe we will start seeing a major shift to the cloud for many hosts because of the advantages virtualization brings. See: Joyent Slicehost Azure Mosso etc, etc.
