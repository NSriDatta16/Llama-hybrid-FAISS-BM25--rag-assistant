Firmware Engineering is quite broad. From PIC to DSP they all have varying degree of physical resources. These days DSPs are quite powerful (comparable with the CPUs ~5years old), can support large amount of memory etc. But then again you have PICS which operate with several kilobytes. More meagre the resources, the programmer has to use ingenious hacks to get the most out of the device. And the focus is on 'get it to work' rather than 'write elegant code'. What I would like to see is good project management tools that incorporate code as well as documents as you have to refer to lots of datasheets, design docs which are scattered around the network and on email blobs etc.. I would also like to see better dev tools for DSPs (TI: please hand over CCS to some one good at making IDEs) , and more library makers using C++ (I'm looking at you ATEME) to build better libraries. And also hardware engineers to have a better appreciation of Object Orientation rather than blurt out, 'if it's C++ it's going to be slow'.
