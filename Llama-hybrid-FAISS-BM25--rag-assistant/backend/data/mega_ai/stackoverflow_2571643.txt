Google Maps API : V2 : marker icons are not square

I have generated a bunch of png files to use as markers on my site. However when I applied them using GIcon(). I see that they are squeezed such that the height is more than the width. This even though my png files are exactly 22x22 pixels. I don't think I have the resources to generate the whole set to fit the odd 20x34 or some such size. Is there any way this can be fixed ? I tried specifying a GSize() to unsqueeze them, but that didn't work. EDIT : Here is how I tried it and it didn't help - var icon = new GIcon(); icon.iconSize = new GSize(22, 22); icon.shadow = null; icon.iconAnchor = new GPoint(11, 11); icon.infoWindowAnchor = new GPoint(12, 1); icon.infoShadowAnchor = new GPoint(12, 1); icon.image = PATH_TO_MARKER + (imgCounter) + ".png"; addIconAttr(icon); // Create new marker with this icon, and various attributes **var nm = new GMarker(point, {icon:icon, draggable:true, title:'You can drag this point !', bouncy:true, dragCrossMove:true});
