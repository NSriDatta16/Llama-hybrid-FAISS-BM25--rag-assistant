recommendations for test data set(s) known to have well separated clusters

I am working on visualizing clusters in high dimensional space. I have had good luck with "real" data sets contributed to the UCI Machine Learning repository. Unfortunately, none of these data sets have really well separated clusters. I've used "artificial", machine generated, data sets which have well separated clusters, as constructed, but I am looking for a data set that is freely available and is known to well separated clusters. By well separated clusters I am thinking of ones which would lend themselves to a high Dunn Index. Any recommendations?
