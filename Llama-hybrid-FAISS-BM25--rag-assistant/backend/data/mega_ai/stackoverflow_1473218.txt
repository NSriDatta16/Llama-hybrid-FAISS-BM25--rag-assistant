Try adding white-space:nowrap; to the .draggable class. If that fails, and you want a line break at a certain point, add clear:left; to the first instance of .draggable on each line. BTW you could use inheritance, lose the .draggable class and div (BTW wraper = wrapper ?) and just style the p tag: #wrapper p { rules here }
