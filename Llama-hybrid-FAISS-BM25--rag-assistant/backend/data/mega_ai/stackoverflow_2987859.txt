The ordnance survey have open sourced their list of postcodes including geographic coordinates (you may have to do some converting though). I haven't used the data myself yet, but I think this fits the bill. Code-Point Open is a dataset that contains postcode units, each of which have a precise geographical location. There are approximately 1.7 million postcode units in England, Scotland and Wales. Each postcode unit, such as KY12 8UP or PO14 2RS, contains an average of fifteen adjoining addresses. Northern Ireland postcodes are not available with Code-Point Open. Note that due to the nature of the british postcode system, updates happen quite frequently during a year. Make sure you download new versions as they are released.
