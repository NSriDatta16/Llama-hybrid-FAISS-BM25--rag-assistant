calculating adjusted means from lmer

How can I calculate adjusted means for a regression model with fixed and random effects? I'd like to calculate the adjusted means for a lme regression with this formula mymodel where myDV is the dependent variable, experiment_condition is an independent fixed effect and subject_aptitude (participants past class average) and subjects_teacher/subjects_class (classroom nested within teacher) are random effects The ultimate goal here is to visualize this data with adjusted means because the raw means (before the random effects variance is removed) do not accurately depict the results of the LMER
