closing connections within a using block

On reading lots of code, I find that a given Connection object, which implements IDisposable , is is manually closed within a using statement. I see this when I see code related to MySQL. It's not needed to be explicitly closed. Why would the developer close it manually? using(cnn) { //code is here cnn.close(); } Is this a good/helpful measure?
