Code coverage percentage not good

I have installed on my computer C++Test only with UnitTest license (only Unit Test license) as a Visual Studio 2005 plugin ( cpptest_7.2.11.35_win32_vs2005_plugin.exe ). I have a sample similar to the following: bool MyFunction(... parameters... ) { bool bRet = true; // do something if( some_condition ) { // do something bRet = CallToAFunctionThatCanReturnBothTrueAndFalse.... } else { bRet = false; // do something } if(bRet == false) { // do something } return bRet; } In my case after running the coverage tool I have the following results (for a function similar to the previously mentioned): [LC=100 BC=100 PC=75 DC=100 SCC=100 MCDC=50 (%)] I really don't understand why I don't have 100% coverage when it comes to PathCoverage (PC). Also if someone who has experience with C++Test Parasoft could explain the low MCDC coverage for me that would be great. What should I do to increase coverage? as I'm out of ideas in this case. Directions to (some parts of) the documentation are welcome. Thank you, Iulian
