How to quickly check if a zip file is corrupted?

Does anyone have any ideas for how to pragmatically quickly check if a zip file is corrupted based on file size? Ideally the best way to check if a zip is corrupted is to do a CRC check but this can take a long time especially if there is a lot of large zip files. I would be happy just to be able to do a quick file size or header check. Thanks in advance.
