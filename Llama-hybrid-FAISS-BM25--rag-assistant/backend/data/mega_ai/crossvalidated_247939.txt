How to prepare my image data as a training data for Deep Learning?

I am a beginner to Deep Learning and have read some tutorials. Now I want to try something like LeNet on my own data, but I do not know how I should prepare it as a suitable training input for LeNet. Currently, all of the images in my dataset have been stored in a folder and I have an excel file that contains the information about the label of each image. I am confused in what format/data type I should store all the N images and the output (label) vector? I know that the output should be a [Nx1] vector of the labels of images, but not sure if I should have a similar [NxP] matrix for the input images where each row of the vector represents an image ( width: w, height:h; P=wxh ). Furthermore, do images have to have the same size? Thank you in advance.
