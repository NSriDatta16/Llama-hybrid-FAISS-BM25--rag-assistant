Maybe you are using the wrong tool for the Job. This is more manual than what you are doing but it's in a way more elegant if not a bit "old school" StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer(); Iterator iter = s.iterator(); while (iter.hasNext()) { buffer.append(iter.next()); if (iter.hasNext()) { buffer.append(delimiter); } }
