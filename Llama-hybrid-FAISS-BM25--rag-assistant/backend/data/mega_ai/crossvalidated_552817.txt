Forming a consistent estimator for the area under the regression line

I am trying to solve the following problem: Take the following simple linear regression model, where $x_i \in \mathbb R$ : $y_i=\beta_0 + x_i \beta_1 + \epsilon_i$ Given that: $\mathbb E[\epsilon_i]=0$ $\mathbb E[\epsilon_i|x_i]=0$ $\beta_0 >0$ $\beta_1 Let $\theta_0$ represent the area under the regression line. Propose a consistent estimator of $\theta_0$ . I have began by finding the integral of $y_i$ with respect to $x_i$ . That is, $\theta_0= \int \beta_0 + x_i \beta_1 + \epsilon_i$ $dx_i=\beta_0x_i + {x_i^2\over{2}}{\beta_1} + \epsilon_ix_i$ I am considering proposing an MLE and proceeding to find the derivative of the log-likelihood of this expression. However, since this expression is rather complicated and I foresee the MLE computation turning incredibly thorny, I suspect I may be approaching this incorrectly. Any thoughts?
