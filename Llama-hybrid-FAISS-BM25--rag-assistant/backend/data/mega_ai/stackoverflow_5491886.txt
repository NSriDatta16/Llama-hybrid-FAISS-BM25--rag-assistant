From CLR Via C# Just before invoking a method, you could check for ample stack space by calling the RuntimeHelper classâ€™s EnsureSufficientExecutionStack method This method checks if the calling thread has enough stack space available to execute the average method (which is not well defned) If there is insuffcient stack space, the method throws an InsufficientExecutionStackException which you can catch The EnsureSufficientExecutionStack method takes no arguments and returns void This method is typically used by recursive methods
