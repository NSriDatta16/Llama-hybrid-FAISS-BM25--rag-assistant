The most important phrase that pops into my head a lot was from my operating systems professor -- and I didn't do very well in operating systems. Nevertheless... "There is no magic." He meant that if a computer can do it, a computer programmer can figure out how it is done. When someone waves the magic "high technology" wand, look closer, and you'll see a heuristic. When I have to accomplish something hard, it gives me the courage to find a way to do it. When I am presented with some "magical"-seeming piece of technology in the media or in marketing material, it makes me skeptical and dig for the truth.
