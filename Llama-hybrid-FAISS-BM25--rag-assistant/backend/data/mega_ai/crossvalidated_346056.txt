your question addresses a common problem in computer vision. In the first place, having so few data points would never work good enough in deep learning. You are going to overfit even if you use transfer learning. Secondly, data augmentation is a good way to balance your dataset. But consider that those examples might not represent the real distribution so it is unlikely you generalize. In the case you decide to apply data augmentation think about the augmentations that would be real such as rotations or flips. Here I reference a library that would help you achieve that https://github.com/lozuwa/impy
