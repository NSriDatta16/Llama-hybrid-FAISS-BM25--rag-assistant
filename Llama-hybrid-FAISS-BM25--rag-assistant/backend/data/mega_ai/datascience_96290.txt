It is possible that your highest and lowest weighted attributes are highly correlated and that is why the difference in RMSE scores is low. Both features are good predictors of the target, but one is better and that is reflected by the higher weight. Try running a full rank PCA to transform your d-dimension (correlated features) into d-dimension uncorrelated features. Running your regression on these uncorrelated features. Doing this will not improve your regression model, but you may begin noticing a stark difference between the RMSE for the highest and lowest weighted features.
