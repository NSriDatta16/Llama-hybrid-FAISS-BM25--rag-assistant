Deleting and repairing a Convolution Neural Network

Let's say that I have a convolutional neural network with multiple blocks, each consisting of multiple filters. If we have something along the lines of Input -> Block1 -> Block2 -> Block3 -> Max Pooling -> Softmax. Now, I deleted Block2. How would I connect Block1 architecturally to Block3? If I were to delete Block3, what can I do? Please let me know if it would be best if I gave these blocks numbers, each with a number of filters.
