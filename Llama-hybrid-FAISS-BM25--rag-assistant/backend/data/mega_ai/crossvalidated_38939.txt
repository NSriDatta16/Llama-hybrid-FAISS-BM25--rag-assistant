I recommend You articles from free Journal of Statistical Software. You can find there different applications of data mining/machine learning together with analysis of real data examples. Most articles are about R packages so you can also simultaneously perform their analyses in R. Articles in journal also include R code and packages in R include data. All data are analyzed in depth there so it is very worthy source for me.
