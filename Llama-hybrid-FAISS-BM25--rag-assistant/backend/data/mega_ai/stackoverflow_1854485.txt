Performance of one huge unix directory VS a directory tree?

My PHP project will use thousands of pictures and each needs only a single number for it's storage name. My initial idea was to put all of the pictures in a single directory and name the files "0.jpg", "1.jpg", "2.jpg", and all the way to "4294967295.jpg" . Would it be better performance-wise to create a directory tree structure and name the files something like "429 / 496 / 7295.jpg"? If the answer is yes, then the follow up question would be: what is the optimal amount of subdirs or files per level of depth? And what effect does the chosen filesystem have on this? Each file will have a corresponding MySQL entry with an UNSIGNED LONGINT id-number. Thank you.
