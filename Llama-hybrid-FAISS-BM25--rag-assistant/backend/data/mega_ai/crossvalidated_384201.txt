if you read the R-CNN paper it references it clarifies it a bit. First, one predicted box is assigned to the ground truth based on which predicted box has the IoU. Then you have all the other predicted boxes that may not have had the highest IoU but do have an IoU over 0.5 with the object. These predicted boxes are not assigned to a ground truth but from what I understand, they are not included in the loss function (i.e. the last section for no object). Only predicted boxes which have an IoU of less than 0.5 with any object are considered in the no object loss. This is somewhat confusing as the approach to this has changed over the different iterations of YOLO. In the first YOLO there was no such threshold and these predicted boxes were included in the loss function, this was justified by the idea that each box specialises in detecting one object, but that approach doesn't seem to be used in YOLOv3. Perhaps because of the large increase in the number of boxes predicted compared to YOLOv1 and YOLOv2, this specialisation is no longer needed. I can't say exactly as the loss function was never explicitly given in YOLOv3 but I think it is almost correct. The one thing to add is that as there are 3 scales of detection for YOLOv3, the loss function you have will only sum over one of these scales. In YOLOv3 $S=13,26,52$ for all the scales. P.S. I don't think bounding box prior is exactly synonymous with anchor box here but means the final prediction after calculating $b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w$ , whereas anchor box is the predefined box which is determined by K-means testing on the training set ground truth boxes. But I may be wrong on that.
