This may not be the elegant solution you are looking for, but if just want results for most cases, you can "clip" large and small values of your plotted data to +∞ and -∞ respectively. Matplotlib does not plot these. Of course you have to be careful not to make your resolution too low or your clipping threshold too high. utol = 100. ltol = -100. yy = 1/(xx-2) yy[yy>utol] = np.inf yy[yy
