Matrix Formulation of Equations

I am trying to learn statistical learning and machine learning independently. One of the main challenges I am facing is that many resources/books use matrix formulation when expressing equations. I am having trouble understanding equations when they are in the matrix formulation. My background is in chemistry and medicine, but I took an introductory linear algebra class during my undergrad years. Could you please recommend a resource to help me learn/understand matrix formulation. I would really appreciate any advice. Thank you
