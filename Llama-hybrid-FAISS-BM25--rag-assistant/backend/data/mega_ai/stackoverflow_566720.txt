c# Threads and display update

I have a Windows Form with a label and a picture box. To retreive an image from a web service I use a thread. The user click on a button and first the label must be displayed and then new thread is started to retrieve the image. This is the code: private void menuItem1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { etiquetaCargando.Visible = true; this.Invoke(new System.Threading.ThreadStart(RequestImage)); } The problem is this: label etiquetaCargando doesn't appear. I'm programming on Compact Framework. What it's happening? Thanks!
