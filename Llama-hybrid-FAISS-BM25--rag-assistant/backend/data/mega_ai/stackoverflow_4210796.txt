Using objects to correctly replace global variables

I've been trying to figure out how to initialize an object using a prototype in order to escape using global variables, which I first learned about here . I began implementing my own version of the code found in the accepted answer. function XML_Data() { this.data = null; } XML_Data.prototype = { GetXML: function() { $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: "questions.xml", dataType: "xml", success: function(xml) { this.data=xml; } //close success });//close AJAX }, UseXML: function() { alert(this.data) } }; (My implementation of the script) However, I've run into a problem. When I run the functions shown here by using this bit of code: var data = new XML_Data(); data.GetXML(); data.UseXML(); I get an alert that says "null". I've been through the code about a dozen times, but as this is my first time working with Javascript, there's quite obviously something I've missed. Could you point that out? Thanks, Elliot Bonneville.
