Back of the envelope estimation combined with basic knowledge of data type storage requirements . For example, CSV file contains: 300k customers; Each customer has first name, last name, address and telephone; Generally you'll need one byte per character (plus one) for a string; Estimate that about 200 characters will be enough to store the above info; 300k * 200 bytes = 60M of data; Add overhead of about 10-20% for indexes, etc; If you anticipate growth, factor that in now . Let's say it'll be 600k within a year; 2 * 60M (doubling) * 1.2 = 144M. And there you have an estimate.
