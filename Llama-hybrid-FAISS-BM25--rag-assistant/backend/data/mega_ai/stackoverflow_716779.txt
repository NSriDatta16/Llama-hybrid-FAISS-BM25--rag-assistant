I would normally say that you should leverage your experience in programming for machines that are under-powered and low on memory. However, web development is a very different beast. Web servers will usually have a lot more computational power and memory. Going either the LAMP or other way, requires a different paradigm of computing. You will often spend more time on integrating multiple processes (database, scripting language, web-server) than actually pushing out more speed and efficiency. The transition is not so easy. So, like the previous answer said, you may want to consider going the mobile-web development route. You could get the openmoko/iphone/gphone development kit and begin experimenting. Whatever you can get your hands on (and within your budget).
