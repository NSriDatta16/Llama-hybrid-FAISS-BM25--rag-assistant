Does the box take up the entire UIImageView? If so you can use CGRectContainsPoint using the UIImageView's frame for the rect and the center of the dragged image as the point. If the box is only part of the background image, you could get messy and start asking the background for the pixel color at a given location, but I think the way you're doing it now is probably best if that's the case.
