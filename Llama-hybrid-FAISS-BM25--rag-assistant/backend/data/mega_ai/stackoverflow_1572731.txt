I know you don't want to hear this but if your view is running up against the actual limits of SQL server, then you need to redesign. This is a problem that won't go away with a some sort of hack. Every time someone wants to do queries that hit the rows that are too big, you are going to encounter the same problem. Now it is possible that you have bad data in the rows that are too big. But I'm betting on just plain bad design. Yes it's a lot of work to refactor a bad database design, but this is only going to get worse through time not better. Do you get the same error if you directly query the tables instead of using a view? I suspect that you are trying to pivot information from similar tables (based on the table names). Can you do a union all instead and have the application do the pivoting? That way the query at least would have fewer columns. I know I'm, preaching to the choir here, but it really is time to get your organization to upgrade to a newer version of SQl server. Even now you can't directly upgrade to 2008, so you are in real danger of losing any upgrade path at all if you can't get SQL server 2005. If this is business critical data, you cannot afford to wait on upgrading any longer.
