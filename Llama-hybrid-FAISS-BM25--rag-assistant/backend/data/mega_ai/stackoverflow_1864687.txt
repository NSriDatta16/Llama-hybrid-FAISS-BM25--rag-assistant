SubViews not properly initialized using IB

I'm having trouble getting my SubViews properly initialized using Interface Builder. I have the following View hierarchy (UIWindow -> BlankCanvasView -> StalkerView). BlankCanvasView is a subclass of UIView and StalkerView is a IBOutlet of BlankCanvasView @interface BlankCanvasView : UIView { IBOutlet UIView *stalker; } @end I've established a connection between the stalker outlet of BlankCanvasView and the subview. However, in my touchesBegin method of BlankCanvasView the stalker outlet is nil. See below for touchesBegin. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"Touch Begin detected!!!"); NSLog(@"Stalker instance %@", stalker); [UIView beginAnimations:@"StalkerAnimation" context:nil]; UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; //stalker is nil here!!! [stalker setCenter:[touch previousLocationInView:self]]; [UIView commitAnimations]; } What am I missing? It looks like none of my demo apps are properly loading any subviews when I try and follow examples on iTunesU.
