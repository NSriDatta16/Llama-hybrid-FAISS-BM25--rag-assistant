Collaborative Social Network Visualization

I do movement building work for Effective Altruism ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism ), and would like to level up our growth strategy. It occurred to me that a social network visualization tool which allowed us to strategically find and recruit new influencers/donors would be mega useful. I'd love to find something (preferably free), similar to InMaps, which would allow us to: Combine all of our social media connections into a single map Easily see who the superconnectors are Weight each person by their degree of social influence (perhaps some function of things like Klout score * amount of social media connections * number of Google mentions, etc) Does such a thing exist? If not, is anyone interested in pro bono work for an amazing cause? =) Disclaimer: I am a data science noob, so preferably the solution would be one with a nice GUI and minimal involvement of R or Python.
