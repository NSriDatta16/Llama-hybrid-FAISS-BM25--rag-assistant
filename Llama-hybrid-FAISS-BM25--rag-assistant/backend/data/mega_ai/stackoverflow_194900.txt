It's not overkill. Sure, there are better ways of limiting access to your code. But what you are doing is separating retrieval of data (an array of records) from modifying data (single record, instance). Perhaps you could give your classes different, more meaningful, names. Instead of MovieDAO you could use MovieQuery and instead of MovieExtendedDAO you could use Movie. You keep the funct. separated as you have now, but make the classes more self-explanatory.
