Comparing two users' average number of events per day with a statistical approach

I've recently had a test which included a question that was phrased like this: Compare user A and B; would you conclude their average number of events per day to be different The dataset was over a period of a month. It was a relational database where every event a was associated with a user and sent at a datetime. I'll give an example of what the dataset looked like user_id,time_of_event,event_name,event_parameters A,2018-03-01 17:21:44, sign_up, '{"source": "mobile_app"}' A,2018-03-01 17:21:54, start_tutorial, '{"experiment_group": "control"}' B,2018-03-02 05:33:17, session_start, '{"session_medium": "webapp"}' B,2018-03-02 05:36:35, add_to_cart, '{"item_id": 132156, "price": 12.99}' ... I thought it was a pretty simple question, and my approach was pretty simple. Get the average number of events that user A over the month, adding in 0's for days on which they sent no events. Repeat 1 but for B. Compare the averages. When I was given feedback on this test, I was told that this response was unsatisfactory because it lacked a "statistical approach" to coming to the answer. What statistical approach could I have used to come to a higher quality answer?
