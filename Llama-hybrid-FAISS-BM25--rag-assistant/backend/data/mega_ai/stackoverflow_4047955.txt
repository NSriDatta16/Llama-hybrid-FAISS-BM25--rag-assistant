If the web server/gateway layer were truncating incoming form submissions I'd expect an error from FieldStorage , since the truncation would not just interrupt the file upload but also the whole multipart/form-data structure. Even if cgi.py tolerated this, it would be very unlikely to have truncated the multipart at just the right place to leave exactly 2**16-1 bytes of file upload. So I would suspect MySQL. LONGBLOB should be fine up to 2**32-1, but 65535 would be the maximum length of a normal BLOB . Are you sure the types are what you think? Check with SHOW CREATE TABLE x . Which database layer are you using to get the data in?
