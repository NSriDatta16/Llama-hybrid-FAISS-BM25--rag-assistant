What techniques can I use to detect wrongly tagged fraud transactions?

Context: we have a fairly well performing XGBoost model that gives out a prob score denoting the probability of a transaction being a Fraud transaction. The model is trained on past data, with independent variables ranging from characteristics of the transacting customer, variables related to the transaction itself (location, amount etc), to characteristics of the merchant etc. The dependent variable itself comes from customer reported incidents. That is - if a customer calls in telling us a transaction was a fraud transaction - this transaction is labelled as a fraud incident. Problems: customer might be mistaken. Perhaps they actually did that transaction but forgot about it, or they're trying to make a quick buck? How would you go about identifying such "wrong labels"?
