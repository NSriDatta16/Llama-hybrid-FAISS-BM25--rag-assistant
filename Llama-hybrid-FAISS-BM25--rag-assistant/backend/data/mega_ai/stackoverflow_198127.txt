I am speculating again. Do you have multiple datareaders open by any chance? Add MARS_Connection=yes; OR MultipleActiveResultSets=true to the connection string, if that helps. Also, your usage of connection & datareader is not a recommended way of doing things a simpler way to write it could be using (connection cnn = new Connection(...) { using (SqlDataReader rdr = .... { //some code which deals with datareader } } This will close the connection and datareader once the operation is complete.
