Since you have mentioned text field I assume the problem is in binding some numeric value to the NSTextField. The proper way here is to use NSValueFormatter, there is a customizable formatter for numerics in the IB palette. Just drop it onto the text filed and set up the rules. Even if the task have nothing to do with UI, you can still use [NSValueTransformer valueTransformerForName:aName] to create a transformed and convert the value with it.
