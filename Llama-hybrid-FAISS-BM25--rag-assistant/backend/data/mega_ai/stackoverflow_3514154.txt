What is wrong with this Python game code?

import random secret = random.randint (1,99) guess = 0 tries = 0 print ("AHOY! I'm the Dread Pirate Roberts, and I have a secret!") print ("It is a number from 1 to 99. I'll give you 6 tries. ") while guess != secret and tries secret: print ("Too high, landrubber!") tries = tries + 1 if guess == secret: print ("Avast! Ye got it! Found my secret, ye did!") else: print ("No more guesses! Better luck next time, matey!") print ("The secret number was", secret) I keep getting this error: if guess
