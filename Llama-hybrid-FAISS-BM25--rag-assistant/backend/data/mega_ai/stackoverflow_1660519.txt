Shamelessly ... there are server libraries : wrote a while back an atompub-pubsub bridge for ejabberd . In use here , it validates Tim Bray's APE. and an atom entry validation code (still for ejabberd's XML format) As for client libraries, unless I need full coverage, an adhoc ibrowse/xmerl_xpath combo should do the trick.
