HTML entities do not render correctly in browser after XSLT transform

I have the following XML: 12319221 Jerry P Test 800.555.1010 Test User testuser@email.com &amp;#8220;Jerry just gets it!&amp;#8221; I am encoding special characters as html entities when I save this xml document, hence how the smart quotes are encoded as &#8220; and &#8221. And I use an XSL, via Java/Xalan, to transform the xml document to html: Example Contact Info: Candidate Name: &#160; Candidate ID: &#160; Market Name: &#160; Market Phone: &#160; Agent Name: &#160; Agent Email: &#160; Summary: &#160; The html that results from the transform is then written to the browser. Here is where I'm noticing a character encoding issue. The (nbsp numeric value) show up as either black diamond question marks (firefox) or a box character (ie) and so do the entities that were previously encoded (“ / ”). Also, maybe the biggest hint of all is that when transforming this xml file on a linux platform (then writing html to firefox) everything appears correctly. It's only when the transform is done from windows do the character encoding issues occur (in both firefox and ie). Am I encoding the entities incorrectly or maybe not specify a character set somewhere?
