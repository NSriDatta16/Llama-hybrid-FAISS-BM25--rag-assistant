I do not understand the whole time slot-average prediction explanation you provided, but from my knowledge of how the DM test works I can tell you that: If you are making 1-step ahead forecasts (which is the same, from my POV as validating your model on a point-by-point basis), then you must use h=1 However, if you are doing h-step ahead forecasts with your model (that is, predicting the next h values), the DM statistic must take into account (through its modified variance estimator), that the farther a prediction is in time, the less precise it is likely to be, for there is more uncertainty about the future ; and so, the 2 models' predictions are likely to differ by a greater amount (there is more dispersion on the far ends of a prediction) For instance, if I were to predict a time series that has a trend-cycle component with a simple and Holt exponential smoothing method, the first predictions would be less uncertain on both methods (this does not imply that both methods are as precise when compared to each other, just that closer-in-time predictions are less uncertain), and become less certain and precisse as the series evolves: Here is an image of 2-step ahead forecasts for 4 different prediction methods The resulting two-sided p-value of a DM test on the first and fourth predictions are around 0.20, even though one can clearly see that the 4th method performs better on the whole forecast horizon than for instance the first. What happenes is, that the DM test as h increases is taking into account that the farther in time the prediction value is, the more imprecise it will be (just like the confidence intervals in a prediction); and so, the the two methods yield simmilar results for small h, but when we increase it the test makes those differences "less important" because the are naturally less precise.
