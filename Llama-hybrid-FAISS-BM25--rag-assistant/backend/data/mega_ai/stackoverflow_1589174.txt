Two or more action buttons on an MVC form - Best practice

I have an ASP.NET MVC app with a form. Say this form has an arbitrary number of buttons, each with their own action. ... and so forth We want the user to click on one and have a jQuery action fire to submit the form and then repost the form with new information. There are several ways to implement this. What is the best practice on how to design this elegantly? Please provide code snippets if you can.
