I doubt any of the clustering algorithms will work well. Instead, you should look into: segmentation (yes, this is something different), specifically time series segmentation change detection (as you said, there is a rather constant distribution first, then a change, then a rather constant distribution again segment-wise regression may also work: try to find the best fit that is constant, linearly changing, and constant again. It's essentially four parameters to optimize in this restricted model: average before and after + beginning and end of transition.
