Feature scaling of categorical and ordinal variables in Cox regression

I have a dataset with nominal (unorderable categories), ordinal (orderable categories), and continuous/numerical variables. I am performing Cox Proportional Hazard Regression using the scikit-survival package in Python. I have one-hot encoded the nominal variables (values are 0's and 1's). I have ordinal encoded the ordinal variables (values range from 0 to 9). I have standard scaled my numerical variables (values with mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). Do I need to standard scale my nominal and ordinal variables after I have encoded them? I have found responses to related issues: What could be the reasons for why re-scaling variables used in regression helps model performance? https://www.dataschool.io/comparing-supervised-learning-algorithms/ In ref 1, it seems that feature scaling is required. However, ref 2 says that the linear and logistic regression models do not require feature scaling unless there is regularization, so I expect similar is true for CoxPH regression.
