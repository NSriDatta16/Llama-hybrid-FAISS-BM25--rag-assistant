Is MLlib compulsory to work with distributed data?

I am new to the field of machine learning and recently learned the basics and working out various algorithms in python using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikitlearn , etc. I started learning about working Bigdata by distributing it and using Apache Spark's library MLlib to load and apply algorithms on it. So is working with MLlib the only way on Spark or is there any other way to use pandas and other libraries on distributed data?
