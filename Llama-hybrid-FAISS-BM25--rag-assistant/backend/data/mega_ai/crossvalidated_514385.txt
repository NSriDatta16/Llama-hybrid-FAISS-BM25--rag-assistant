HMM continuous x, discrete y

I'm curious about whether an HMM variant is appropriate when I have a continuous x (time series) and a discrete y (emission class.) In context, I have multiple ships, which could be located in one of many discrete geographical regions. For now, let's assume that I have a single ship and want to predict the sequence of geographical regions it might be in. I'm not necessarily against an RNN/LSTM, however, I do need not only most likely class but the probabilities of each class assignment. Would an HMM be an appropriate sequence-to-sequence model here? In the multiship context, how might I include them? An other models you would recommend?
