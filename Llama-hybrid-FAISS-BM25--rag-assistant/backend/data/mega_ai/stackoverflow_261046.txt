What are the optimal settings for Tomcat web server?

I am maintaining a website with currently about 800 concurrent users. The business plan says that this number will be 10x higher in one year. This is my current configuration: The average used thread count is about 400 (for each http/https). But peaks really use 500 threads. I think I will get into trouble when I get 10x users :-) How can I tune this? Should I disable http keep alive? How can I configure keep-alive timeout? What values are good for acceptCount / maxThreads?
