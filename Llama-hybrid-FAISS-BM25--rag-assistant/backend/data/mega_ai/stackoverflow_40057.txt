There is a tool in Ant called a classfileset. You specify the list of root classes that you know you need, and then the classfileset recursively analyzes their code to find all dependencies. Alternatively, you could develop a good test suite that exercises all of the functions that you need, then run your tests under a test coverage tool. The tool will tell you which classes (and statement in them) were actually utilized. This could give you an even smaller set of code than what you'd find with static analysis.
