Optimizing MySQL Queries: Is it always possible to optimize a query so that it doesn't use "ALL"

According to the MySQL documentation regarding Optimizing Queries With Explain : * ALL: A full table scan is done for each combination of rows from the previous tables. This is normally not good if the table is the first table not marked const, and usually very bad in all other cases. Normally, you can avoid ALL by adding indexes that allow row retrieval from the table based on constant values or column values from earlier tables. Does this mean that any query that uses ALL can be optimized so that it is no longer is doing a full table scan? In other words, by adding the correct indexes to the table, is it possible to always avoid using ALL? Or are there some cases where ALL is unavoidable, no matter what indexes you add?
