Of course you can use variograms also for time series data. The variogram has one advantage as compared to the autocorrelation function, it only needs the hypothesis of intrinsic stationarity , not stationarity (definitions can be found here: Intrinsic spatial stationarity: doesn't it only apply for small lags? ). So it only assumes that the expectation of differences are zero, but the global mean, for instance, do not need to exist. So the variogram is defined even in cases where the variance do not exist, while the autocovariance function do need that the variance exists. So, potentially the variogram could be of interest for time series with long-range dependence. But I have never used it this way myself, nor seen it used. But here is a relevant paper: https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9884.00101
