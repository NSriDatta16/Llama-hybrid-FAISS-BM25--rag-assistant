How Does the Network Time Protocol Work?

The Wikipedia entry doesn't give details and the RFC is way too dense. Does anyone around here know, in a very general way, how NTP works? I'm looking for an overview that explains how Marzullo's algorithm (or a modification of it) is employed to translate a timestamp on a server into a timestamp on a client. Specifically what mechanism is used to produce accuracy which is, on average, within 10ms when that communication takes place over a network with highly variable latency which is frequently several times that.
