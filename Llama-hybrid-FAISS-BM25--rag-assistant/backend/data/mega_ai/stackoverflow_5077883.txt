In my opinion, what you're describing is natural behaviour for a browser. Are there any buttons below the last text area that you are showing on the screencast? If yes, then something's wrong, as the container's (of the form that is) bottom should be completely in view. For an inelegant, quick fix, add padding to your form container's bottom that is as heigh as the fixed footer is, i.e. padding-bottom = footer height.
