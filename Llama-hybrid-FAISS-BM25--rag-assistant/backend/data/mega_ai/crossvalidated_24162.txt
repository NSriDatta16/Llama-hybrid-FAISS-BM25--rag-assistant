By p-value I presume you mean "the probability of seeing a value of my test statistic as large as this, if it really comes from a $\chi^2$ distribution with one degree of freedom". So if you get a low p-value it means it is an improbable value to have seen. In R: 1-pchisq(0.1185, 1) or pchisq(0.1185, 1, lower=FALSE) In Excel =1-CHISQ.DIST(0.1185,1, TRUE) or =CHISQ.DIST.RT(A2,1) The p-value is very large because your value of the test statistic is actually considerably less than the average value of such a $\chi^2$ random variable. If anything, it is unusually small . So basically, you do not have a large value and hence there is not evidence to dismiss the hypothesis that it genuinely comes from a $\chi^2$ distribution.
