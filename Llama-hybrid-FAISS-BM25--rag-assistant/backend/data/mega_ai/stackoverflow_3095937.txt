The first works because both your definitions of a are tentative, which can be duplicated as often as you see fit. At the end of the translation unit, no non-tentative definition has been seen, so what you've specified for attributes is combined with defaults to give a final definition of a , so it'll have external linkage, static storage duration, and be initialized to 0. The problem with the second has nothing to do with tentative definitions. Your printf("Hi"); needs to be inside a function to work -- it's not a declaration or a definition (tentative or otherwise); it's just not allowed there.
