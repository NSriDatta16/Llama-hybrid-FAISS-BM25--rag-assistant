Since it seems that you have a time series here, I would recommend you to check my relevant answer for some ideas ( time series clustering , entropy measures , anomaly detection ) as well as links to further information. In addition, I would also consider the Fourier transformation approach . UPDATE (based on discussion with the OP in comments below): In regard to seeking analytical solutions to the problem, it seems to me that there exist several approaches: 1) apply CUSUM (or other) transformation to original data and then perform further analysis (detection); 2) use CUSUM to detect the abrupt changes; 3) use alternative algorithms. Speaking about CUSUM transformations , it seems to be a topic of some debate - some researchers advise against it , warning about potential loss of inferential validity, while others disagree and still consider that approach useful. You may also find this paper relevant and useful. Speaking about the selection of appropriate algorithms as well as theory behind the topic and corresponding methods , I highly recommend excellent comprehensive and freely available online book "Detection of Abrupt Changes: Theory and Application" by Basseville and Nikiforov. In regard to the selection of software for implementing the abrupt change (anomaly) detection, I would recommend to explore several R packages that seem to offer required analytic functionality (in addition to visual) and support CUSUM and similar algorithms. In particular, take a look at the following packages: strucchange (see vignette / JSS paper ), changepoint (see vignette ), surveillance . The last one asks for special mentioning (considering insights of yours and of RegressForward's) as this package presents a framework and implements statistical methods for analysis of epidemic-like process phenomena (in various fields far beyond epidemiology). The project's home page and development are hosted at R-Forge, but the R package is available on CRAN . A vignette and related presentation slides are available. I hope that this update significantly improves my answer and is helpful.
