Magento consistent product URLs

Magento seems to have a number of different formats that work for product URLs, including: /catalog/product/view/id/123/s/my-product-slug/ /my-product-slug/ /top-category/sub-category/my-product-slug/ etc... I want to just use one of these, always, which is the 3rd one, concatenating all parent category slugs together before the product slug. Is there a way to configure Magento to only use one of these formats? Using methods like getProductUrl() seems to return different results depending on what page/context you're on, can anyone tell me why this is? And in general does anyone know of any documentation or blog posts, etc., that might help me understand routing in Magento a little better? Thanks!
