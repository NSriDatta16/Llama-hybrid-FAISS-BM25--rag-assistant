ISO 8601 defines a set of standard date and time representations that share the following property: Date and time values are organized from the most to the least significant : year, month (or week), day, hour, minute, second, and fraction of second. The lexicographical order of the representation thus corresponds to chronological order, except for date representations involving negative years. This means that any ISO 8601 format would be OK for you -- sorting ISO 8601 formatted dates alphabetically is equivalent to sorting them chronologically. It should not be difficult to format dates in ISO 8601 format, either using DateFormat directly, or the powerful Joda Time library.
