At my last organisation, we had a similar window for when uncaught/unexpected exceptions occurred. It had a "send to support team" button which submitted an error report (including full exception details) to a web-service (our clients were spread over 200 locations with no access to the SQL database directly.) That web-service then wrote the exception details to a database, as well as e-mailed the support team with the details and the report ID. It also linked the report to the part of the application that caused the exception - such as the customer account if the exception was thrown from a customer information screen. If it was a problem that would have prevented either the transmission to the web-service, or the write to the database, the user received a message on-screen informing them to leave the message on-screen and contact the Support Desk. If they did do (which did happen occasionally but not as much as we'd have liked) the support team could dial on to the PC (providing their network was up and running) using a VNC-like client, and press F12 on the dialog box to reveal the full exception details. They could then copy/paste that and e-mail it directly to us developers. Of course if the network at the remote site had failed, they'd have much worse problems than the exception report not sending - they wouldn't be able to trade...!
