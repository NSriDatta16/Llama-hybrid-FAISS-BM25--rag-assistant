Estimation of main econometric techniques using matrices manually (in R)

Is there any source when I can run through examples of the main econometric techniques worked out in a matrix form? (preferably in R). I tried to read the source code of functions like lm and lm.fit but it is not clear at all (source: stats::lm and stats::lm.fit ). I am looking for something similar to the OLS explained below ( source ) but for more complicated techniques (e.g. random effects or Tobit models). Is it available anywhere? Maybe in other programming language? Create X and Y matrices for this specific regression X = as.matrix(cbind(1,women$height)) Y = as.matrix(women$weight) Choose beta-hat to minimize the sum of squared residuals resulting in matrix of estimated coefficients: bh = round(solve(t(X)%*%X)%*%t(X)%*%Y, digits=2) Label and organize results into a data frame beta.hat = as.data.frame(cbind(c("Intercept","Height"),bh)) names(beta.hat) = c("Coeff.","Est") beta.hat Calculate vector of residuals res = as.matrix(women$weight-bh[1]-bh[2]*women$height) Define n and k parameters n = nrow(women) k = ncol(X) Calculate Variance-Covariance Matrix VCV = 1/(n-k) * as.numeric(t(res)%*%res) * solve(t(X)%*%X) Standard errors of the estimated coefficients StdErr = sqrt(diag(VCV)) Calculate p-value for a t-test of coefficient significance P.Value = rbind(2*pt(abs(bh[1]/StdErr[1]), df=n-k,lower.tail= FALSE), 2*pt(abs(bh[2]/StdErr[2]), df=n-k,lower.tail= FALSE)) Concatenate into a single data.frame beta.hat = cbind(beta.hat,StdErr,P.Value) beta.hat
