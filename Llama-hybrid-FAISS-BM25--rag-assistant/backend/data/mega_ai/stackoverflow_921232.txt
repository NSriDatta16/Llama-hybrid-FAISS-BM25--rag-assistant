Aren't your unit tests too black-box oriented ? I mean ... let me take an example : suppose you are unit testing some sort of container, do you use the get() method of the container to verify a new item was actually stored, or do you manage to get an handle to the actual storage to retrieve the item directly where it is stored ? The later makes brittle tests : when you change the implementation, you're breaking the tests. You should test against the interfaces, not the internal implementation. And when you change the framework you'd better off trying to change the tests first, and then the framework.
