A few thoughts beyond those from @Bj√∂rn and @StudentT that wouldn't fit into a comment on either of their answers. It seems that the distinction you are trying to draw is between testing hypotheses on data (traditional statistical inference, the topic of your book) and gleaning relationships from data (machine learning, not covered in your book). But that distinction can be hard to make. For example, your book does seem to cover genome-wide association studies (GWAS). I would generally think of GWAS more in the latter category, gleaning relationships from data rather than testing pre-specified hypotheses. The issues of multiple comparisons that you cover so thoroughly in your book are essentially the same for GWAS as for many data-mining/machine-learning situations. There's also a slight danger that the reader will interpret this as a distinction between traditional inference as causal inference versus machine learning as pattern recognition, even though traditional inference often has no more true information on causal relations than does machine learning. You certainly discuss the fallacy of such interpretation of traditional inference in the book, but it might be safer not even to raise this possibility in the reader's mind at this point. Furthermore, there's the interesting take on hypothesis testing and prediction in Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies . In the introduction to this book with its emphasis on prediction, he argues (page 1, second edition): Prediction could be considered a superset of hypothesis testing and estimation. As an example (page 2): It is often useful to think of effect estimates as differences between two predicted values from a model. Or more generally (page 3): Thus when one develops a reasonable multivariable predictive model, hypothesis testing and estimation of effects are byproducts of the fitted model. So predictive modeling is often desirable even when prediction is not the main goal. So for your purpose it might be better to downplay this distinction as all-or-none, as hypothesis testing and prediction do not necessarily "have entirely different goal[s]." What you cover in your book will also be of great value to anyone trying to make sense of many machine learning approaches. You can point out instead how readers of your book will be able to apply what they have learned from you when they set out to explore the other end of the spectrum of data analysis methods.
