How to model time series and to find corelation between times of events

I have data set that track daily activity of user. User repeat action one or more times during a day. This actions are independent and I want to determine if there is relation between times of events. day one First event: 08.14 Second event: 09:00 Third event: 11.45 Fourth event: 12:00 day two First event: 08.05 Second event: 09:50 Third event: 11.05 and so on... as you can see number of actions during a day is determine by distribution that is known. Since I know distribution how I can model this times of events. ******************* adding plots of data ********************
