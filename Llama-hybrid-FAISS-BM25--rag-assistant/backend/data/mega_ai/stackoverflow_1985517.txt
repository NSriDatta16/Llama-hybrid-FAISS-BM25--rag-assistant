If the UIViewController is loaded at the very start of the application, I've seen an odd glitch in OS 3.0 where it would not become the first responder unless you delayed the appropriate message a bit. Try placing [self performSelector:@selector(becomeFirstResponder) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.3]; within -loadView or something else that is called when the controller is first set up. There may be a more elegant way to work around this, but this approach has worked for me.
