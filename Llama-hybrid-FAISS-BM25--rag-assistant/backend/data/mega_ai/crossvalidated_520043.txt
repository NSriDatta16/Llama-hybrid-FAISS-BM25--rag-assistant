Confusion about coefficients of logistic regression model produced by glm(family = binomial) in R

I have a response variable that is binary ( 1 - recovered, 0 - dead) and I will use two predictor variables as an example. One is continuous (age) and one is binary ( condition x: ( 1 - patient has it, 0 - patient doesn't have it)). I use glm() function in R, specifying the family = "binomial". It gives out some parameters and then I use odds.ratio function to get the exponentiate values ( as the function summary(model) gives out the log values). The coefficient for age is equal to 1.26. Previously, I'd interpret it as for every y aged patient that dies there are 1.26 (y+1) aged patients that die. Now, I understand that this is incorrect, as this is not linear model, so how do I interpret the coefficient in this instance? Then I have binary predictor (1 - has a condition x, 0 - doesn't have a condition). For this variable I get a coefficient of 0.13. This is absurd, because it can be interpreted as for every one patient, that doesn't have condition x and dies, there are 0.13x patients that has the condition x and dies. But from the sample, which I used to make the model it is obvious that the condition x has a negative influence on death rates. From the 143 that recovered, there are 83 patients, that had the condition, i.e., roughly 58% of recovered patients had the condition. From the 92 patients that died, 54 had the condition, i.e., 59 %.. So, the coefficient should be close to zero. I don't understand how can I interpret the coefficient 0.13 in this case. Please advice! Here is a data frame where you can see the outcome and the number of cases that have this outcome and number of cases that have this outcome and has a condition x: # A tibble: 13 x 4 # Groups: outcome, age group [13] outcome `age group` n `condition x` 1 recovered 21-30 3 0 2 recovered 31-40 8 0 3 dead 31-40 2 1 4 recovered 41-50 21 10 5 dead 41-50 2 1 6 recovered 51-60 36 17 7 dead 51-60 17 10 8 recovered 61-70 47 31 9 dead 61-70 23 9 10 recovered 71-80 18 17 11 dead 71-80 21 16 12 recovered 81+ 10 8 13 dead 81+ 27 17 Here is the summary of the model, the variables that I referred to before are age and AH: Call: glm(formula = Izn ~ ., family = "binomial", data = myData14) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.00942 -0.20697 -0.01299 0.00155 2.62596 Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std.

What's the reason the age when cut in groups is no longer significant? The question about the coefficient for AH ( condition x, that I spoke of before) still remains. It doesn't make sense that the coefficient equals exp(-2.323e+00) = 0.09. From there it could be concluded that patients that have AH are much less likely die, which as I pointed out above, is not true. Here is the table, where you can see the count of cases of all possible combinations of outcomes and AH ( outcome = 0 => recovered, 1 => dead; AH = 0 => doesn't have the condition AH, 1 => has the condition AH). So all the cases where outcome = 0 equals 143, from those 83 had the condition AH, so the recovery proportion is 83/143 = 58%. From all the cases where outcome = 1, 54 patients had AH. So, the rate equals 54/92 = 58%. outcome AH count 1 0 0 60 2 1 0 38 3 0 1 83 4 1 1 54
