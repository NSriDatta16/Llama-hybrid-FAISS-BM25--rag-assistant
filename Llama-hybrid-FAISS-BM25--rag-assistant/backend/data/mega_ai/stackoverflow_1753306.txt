The Clojure one is more convoluted at first glance; though it maybe more elegant. OO is the result to make language more "relatable" at higher-level. Functional languages seems to have a more "algorithimc"(primitive/elementary) feel to it. That's just what I felt at the moment. Maybe that will change when I have more experience working with clojure. I'm afraid that we are decending into the game of which language can be the most concise or solve a problem in the least line of code. The issue are 2 folds for me: How easy at first glance to get a feel of what the code is doing?. This is important for code maintainers. How easy is it to guess at the logic behind the code?. Too verbose/long-winded?. Too terse? "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler." Albert Einstein
