Serialize all id's in a div using jquery

I am trying to create a re-ordering of the page drag and drop feature on my CMS. As some of the pages have sub pages, we have a lot of lists nested within lists. An example of the code: $(document).ready(function(){ $(function() { $('#contentLeft ul').sortable({ update: function() { var order = $('#contentLeft ul').sortable('serialize'); alert(order); } }); }); }); Test Nested one nested 2 Nested 6 Test Test In the above example, when I move things around and serialize the ul, i get the list of top level lists elements returned (page[]=1, page[]=4, page[]=5). What I need is for it to serialize ALL of the li tags, including the children li tags and get something like (page[]=1, page[]=20, page[]=30, page[]=40, page[]=4, page[]=5). I have tried applying serialize quite simply to or like: var order = $('li').sortable('serialize'); and var order = $('ul').sortable('serialize'); but had no luck. Could anyone point me in the right direcition? Many Thanks
