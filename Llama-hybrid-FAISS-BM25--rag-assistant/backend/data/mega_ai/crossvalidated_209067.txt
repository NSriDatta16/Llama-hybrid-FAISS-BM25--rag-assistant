Non-direct measurement and degrees of freedom

Background and current intuition In statistics, degrees of freedom are used to characterise the number of independent observations after some statistic has been calculated. The most common example is that for $n$ observations the degrees of freedom are $${\nu} = n-1$$ if one has used the data to calculate the mean $\bar x$. The way I look at it is as follows. Since the mean is defined as $$\bar x = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{1}^nx_i,$$ knowing its value and the value of $n-1$ datapoints would allow one to figure out the missing observation. Okay, this seems straightforward. Moving ahead Assume we are trying to estimate the height $b$ of a building. For this, we find a level plane, measure the distance to the building ( cathetus $a$) and to its roof ( hypothenuse $c$). Using the Pythagorean theorem, $$b=\sqrt{c^2-a^2}.$$ Since in the real world no measurement is absolutely accurate, we must take into account the relevant uncertainties. Again, we actually use the means of $n$ measurements ($2n$ combined), i.e., $$b=\sqrt{(\bar c)^2- (\bar a)^2}.$$ This is where things start to get hairy, so please bear with me. Type C uncertainty $u_C$ for sides $a$ and $c$ is obtained via $$u_C(a)=\sqrt{[u_A(a)]^2+[u_B(a)]^2} \text{, and }u_C(c)=\sqrt{[u_A(c)]^2+[u_B(c)]^2}.$$ $$u_A = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}, u_B = \frac{\text{standard error}}{\sqrt3}$$ Corresponding degrees of freedom $\nu_C(a)$ and $\nu_C(c)$ are $$\nu_C(a)=\frac{[u_C(a)]^4}{\frac{[u_A(a)]^4}{\nu_A(a)}+\frac{[u_B(a)]^4}{\nu_B(a)}}=\nu_A(a) \cdot \left[\frac{u_C(a)}{u_A(a)}\right]^4, $$ $$\nu_C(c)=\nu_A(c) \cdot \left[\frac{u_C(c)}{u_A(c)}\right]^4.$$ $$\nu_A(a)=\nu_A(c)=n-1$$$$ \nu_B \to \infty$$ As if this was not difficult enough, notice we are yet to calculate the uncertainty of the height of the building. Type C uncertainty of $b$, or $u_C(b)$, is $$u_C(b)=\sqrt{\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial a}b(a;c) \cdot u_C(a) \right]^2 + \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial c}b(a;c) \cdot u_C(c) \right]^2}$$ where $b(a;c)$ emphasises that $b$ is a function of $a$ and $c$. $$\frac{\partial}{\partial a}b(a;c)=\frac{\partial}{\partial a}\left(\sqrt{c^2-a^2}\right)=-\frac{2a}{2\sqrt{c^2-a^2}}=-\frac{a}{\sqrt{c^2-a^2}}$$ $$\frac{\partial}{\partial c}\left(\sqrt{c^2-a^2}\right)=\frac{c}{\sqrt{c^2-a^2}}$$ Finally, we have met the necessary prerequisites to calculate the degrees of freedom of $b$ itself. Thus, $$\nu_C(b)=\frac{\left[u_C(b)\right]^4}{\frac{\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial a}b(a;\text{ }c)\text{ } \cdot\text{ } u_C(a)\right]^4 }{\nu_C(a)}+\frac{\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial c}b(a;\text{ }c) \text{ }\cdot\text{ } u_C(c)\right]^4 }{\nu_C(c)}}.$$ Sure, this needs a lot of effort. Though, still not impossible. Even further If you have stuck with me until now, you deserve a prize. And probably a little break, or a cold beverage. Or both. Assuming you are refreshened, we are not done. But we are closer than before. Pretend we also directly measured the width $w$ of the building in question. Of course, $n$ times. We use the same formulae as before for $u_C(w)$ and $\nu_C(w)$. $$u_C(w)=\sqrt{[u_A(w)]^2+[u_B(w)]^2}$$$$\nu_C(w)=\nu_A(w) \cdot \left[\frac{u_C(w)}{u_A(w)}\right]^4 $$ Say we wish to know the angle $\alpha$ which is given by $$\alpha = \arctan{\frac{w}{b}}.$$ The procedure is analogous to the height. $$u_C(\alpha)=\sqrt{\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\alpha(w;b) \cdot u_C(w) \right]^2 + \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial b}\alpha(w;b) \cdot u_C(b) \right]^2}$$ $$\nu_C(\alpha)=\frac{\left[u_C(\alpha)\right]^4}{\frac{\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\alpha(w;\text{ }b) \text{ }\cdot\text{ } u_C(w)\right]^4 }{\nu_C(w)}+\frac{\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial b}\alpha(w;\text{ }b)\text{ } \cdot\text{ } u_C(b)\right]^4 }{\nu_C(b)}}$$ Here I am taking derivatives as if $b$ is not a function of $a$ and $c$. Therefore, $$\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\alpha(w;b)=\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\left(\arctan{\frac{w}{b}}\right)=\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{w}{b}\right)^2 \cdot b} \text {,}$$ $$\frac{\partial}{\partial b}\left(\arctan{\frac{w}{b}}\right)=-\frac{w}{1+\left(\frac{w}{b}\right)^2 \cdot b^2}.$$ Sanity check Be aware that I am not confident in the final two equations. This is because, theoretically, $\alpha(w,b)$ is a compound function. In other words, $$\alpha(w;b) = \alpha[w;b(a;c)] = \alpha(w;a;c).$$ It is tempting to then believe the equations should instead have the form $$u_C(\alpha)=$$$$=\sqrt{\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\alpha(w;a;c) \cdot u_C(w) \right]^2 + \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial a}\alpha(w;a;c) \cdot u_C(a) \right]^2 + \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial c}\alpha(w;a;c) \cdot u_C(c) \right]^2},$$ $$\nu_C(\alpha)=\frac{\left[u_C(\alpha)\right]^4}{\frac{\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\alpha(w;\text{ }a;\text{ }c) \text{ }\cdot\text{ } u_C(w)\right]^4 }{\nu_C(w)}+\frac{\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial a}\alpha(w;\text{ }a;\text{ }c)\text{ } \cdot\text{ } u_C(a)\right]^4 }{\nu_C(a)}+\frac{\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial c}\alpha(w;\text{ }a;\text{ }c) \text{ }\cdot\text{ } u_C(c)\right]^4 }{\nu_C(c)}}.$$ Questions I am cognisant of the fact that check-my-work -type questions are frowned upon. I hope this request is not too much in violation of that rule. Are these approaches equivalent? Are they different? If so, which one is correct and why? Have I made a conceptual mistake somewhere else, especially with regard to degrees of freedom? What about with respect to the Background and current intuition section? Extra Be sure to comment to ask for more details if necessary. I was not sure whether this better belonged to Mathematics or to Cross Validated . Feel free to migrate the thread if it is the former.
