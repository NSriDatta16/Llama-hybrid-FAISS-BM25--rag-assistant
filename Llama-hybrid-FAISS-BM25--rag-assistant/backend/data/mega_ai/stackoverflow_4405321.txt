Here's the Apple PageControl code with images. To use, just drag your images to the project. The default images are image1.jpg, image2.jpg, etc. If you need png, just change the extension to .png. Then replace the MyViewController.m code with this code, and you've got pagecontrol with Images. Cheers, Jordan http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=c3hS29sC
