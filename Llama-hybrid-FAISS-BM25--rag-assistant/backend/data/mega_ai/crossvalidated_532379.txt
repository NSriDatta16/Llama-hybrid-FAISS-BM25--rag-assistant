Skewness and Kurtosis not normal-like but Anderson Darling test results in normal distribution

I am analyzing a time series with R version 4.0.4. I have created the ARIMA model for the series and I want to find the distribution of the residuals. Here are the residuals: residuals I created the histogram and calcultated the skewness and kurtosis hist(residuals) library(moments) skewness(residuals) #1.891993 kurtosis(residuals) #8.716795 The histograms, along with the skewness and kurtosis do not suggest that the residuals are normally distributed. However, the results from the Anderson-Darling test suggest that they are in fact normally distributed. library(goftest) set.seed(1001) ad.test(residuals, "pnorm", mean=mean(residuals), sd=sd(residuals), estimated=T)$p.value The resulting p-value is 0.6197467. Which means that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are normally distributed. I am now confused by these conflicting results. What do you think is the distribution? Is the test trustworthy considering that the data consists of only 27 data points?
