If lat/long are features in a simple regression model, is the model going to account for the distance between data items?

That is closer items (geographically, according to lat/long) have correlated target variables. Example: prices of houses in a neighborhood are correlated. One way to handle this (continuing with the example) is to explicitly include as a feature the average price of nearby houses, but let's not do that and just use lat/long as two features. I am guessing the answer is yes: the learner should notice the correlation when the lat/long values are both similar. For purposes of this question let's assume linear regression with several dependent variables including lat/long. For learning, we minimize the RSS.
