For the question in your second paragraph, yes, PCA is one way to deal with collinearity issues and one way to reduce a large number of variables to a smaller number. There are others, including factor analysis (often giving similar results to PCA) and partial least squares (sort of like PCA but also involves the dependent variable). Regarding the interpretability of PCA - you can't really tell, before you do the analysis, how interpretable the components will be. Sometimes, the interpretation is very clear, sometimes it is not clear at all. As to using all 500 variables, well, one problem will be overfitting (unless your data set is quite large) and another will be colinearity, which affects the parameter estimates and their variances and therefore makes interpretation very hard (but it doesn't affect prediction). And, of course, you will have 500 parameters to interpret.
