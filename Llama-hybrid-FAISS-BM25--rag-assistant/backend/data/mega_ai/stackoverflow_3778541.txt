You could try reading blogs of "the great and the good", people like Martin Fowler on hi 'Bliki' and Robert Martin on Uncle Bob's Blatherings ... and Joel Spolsky's now defunct Joel On Software. All good for opinions on what quality is about. Currently using java and tools such as Macker and Findbugs to check for code correctness and adherence to guidelines. For repeatability and to please management, unit tests run automatically by a build server such as Hudson or Cruise Control on code extracted from a source control system is a good idea. It will also give the 'powers that be' some metrics so you can show how your code building, testing, etc. Ultimately though it just comes down to good people who care about what they're doing.
