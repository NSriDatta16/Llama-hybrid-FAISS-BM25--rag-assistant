I have used gruff and it is really slow and consumes a lor of memmory, If you don't change the chrats so much it is a good idea to use gruff with some caching, you can do page caching or fragment caching http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.htm , but I would recomend you to use google API, there is a gem to simplify the job, http://rubygems.org/gems/googlecharts . If you need that users download the chart I don't think it is a good idea to use graphael or others to make charts.
