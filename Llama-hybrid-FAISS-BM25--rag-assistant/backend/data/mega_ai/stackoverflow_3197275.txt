First of all, I love the first two paragraphs :) Unfortunately, the closest you can get is go to the edit menu, and select "Options Window". From there you can see what is available in categories, but unfortunately, you are still going to have to add this stuff to your vimrc by hand. The thing with vim is an insane learning curve before you start reaping any real benefits. If that isn't really your cup of tea, I would suggest using another editor. Personally, I didn't start really tackling it until it became the primary tool that I use all day. At that point, the learning curve is worth it, where earlier it really wasn't, and I used nano for command line editing, and gedit for gui editing. I actually like your idea of a webapp vimrc generator (I may actually do it myself after I wrap up my current side project), but to my knowledge, there isn't any existing ones. The really funny thing is I hate pretty much all anime EXCEPT for cowboy bebop :)
