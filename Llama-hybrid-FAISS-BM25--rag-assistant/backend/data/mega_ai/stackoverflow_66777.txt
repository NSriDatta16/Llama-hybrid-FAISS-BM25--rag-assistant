Trying to understand web services performance

I bought an ASP.NET script about a year ago to retrieve FedEx shipping values. It builds an XML string that passes to the FedEx server using an HttpWebRequest, then parses the raw XML. The average response time for the script is about 900 milliseconds. So the other day I was poking around in the FedEx developer center and discovered that they provide some C# code samples for using their web service. I built a little project using their code and WSDL file, and was surprised to find that the average response time is about 2.5 seconds. Can someone help me understand the difference in speed? And is there a way to make it faster? I have zero experience using web services. Thanks.
