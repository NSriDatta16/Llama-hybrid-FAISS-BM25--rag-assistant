Should I adjust a Time Series dataset using X-13ARIMA-SEATS before running forecasts algorithms?

This question is sort of a follow up of this great thread. I have a Time Series Analysis project in which I have to create a model to predict new values given historical univariate data using R. My plan is to run several models, assess their accuracies and choose the best one to use in production. I must admit that I'm a beginner in TS analysis, so I'm not sure about the procedure that I must take. The main question is: Should I do a seasonal adjust in the data before fitting it into models? I've done some simulation myself and the results are quite interesting: Raw data (without adjusting) library(seasonal) library(forecast) data("AirPassengers") training Adjusted data adj Now, a comparison table to highlight the differences: abs(acc_adj) The only model that has better accuracy in raw data is mod_neural , created with neural networks. So, what should I learn from this experiment? Does it make sense to use X13ARIMA-SEATS to adjust a series before fitting models?
