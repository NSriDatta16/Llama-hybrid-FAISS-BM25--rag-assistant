How to best visualize differences in many proportions across three groups?

I'm trying to visually compare how three different news publications cover different topics (determined through an LDA topic model). I have two related methods for doing so, but have received lots of feedback from colleagues that this isn't very intuitive. I'm hoping someone out there has a better idea for visualizing this. In the first graph, I show the proportions of each topic in each publication, like so: This is pretty straightforward and intuitive to almost everyone I've talked to. However, it's difficult to see the differences between the publications. Which newspaper covers which topic more? To get at this, I graphed the difference between the publication with the highest and second highest proportion of topics, colored by the publication with the highest. Like this: So, the huge bar for football, for example, is really the distance between al-Ahram English and Daily News Egypt (#2 in football coverage), and it is colored red because Al-Ahram is #1. Similarly, trials is green because Egypt Independent has the highest proportion, and the bar size is the distance between Egypt Independent and Daily News Egypt (#2 again). The fact that I have to explain that all in two paragraphs is a pretty sure sign that the graph fails the self-sufficiency test. It's hard to tell what's really going on by just looking at it. Any general suggestions about how to visually highlight the dominant publication for each topic in a more intuitive way? Edit: Data to play with: Here's dput output from R , as well as a CSV file . Edit 2: Here's a preliminary dot plot version, with the diameters of the dots proportional to the proportion of the topic in the corpus (which is how the topics were originally sorted). Though I still need to tweak it a little more, it feels a lot more intuitive than what I was doing before. Thanks everyone!
