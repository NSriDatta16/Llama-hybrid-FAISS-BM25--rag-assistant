Easy framework for OpenGL Shaders in C/C++

I just wanted to try out some shaders on a flat image. Turns out that writing a C program, which just takes a picture as a texture and applies, let's say a gaussian blur, as a fragment shader on it is not that easy: You have to initialize OpenGL which are like 100 lines of code, then understanding the GLBuffers, etc.. Also to communicate with the windowing system one has to use GLUT which is another framework.. Turns out that Nvidia's Fx composer is nice to play with shaders.. But I still would like to have a simple C or C++ program which just applies a given fragment shader to an image and displays the result. Does anybody have an example or is there a framework?
