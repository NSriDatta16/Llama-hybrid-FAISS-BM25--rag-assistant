For mixed effects model with multiple random intercepts, are bayesian approaches (with MCMC) more robust than frequentist?

I stumbled upon this particular webpage from UCLA containing the following text: [...] Inference from GLMMs is complicated. Except for cases where there are many observations at each level (particularly the highest), assuming that (frac{Estimate}{SE}) is normally distributed may not be accurate. A variety of alternatives have been suggested including Monte Carlo simulation, Bayesian estimation, and bootstrapping. Without bootstrapping then, are frequentist methods (e.g., via glmer) less robust than bayesian MCMC?
