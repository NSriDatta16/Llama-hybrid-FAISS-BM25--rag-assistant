CanÂ´t you use media queries to determine what stylesheet the browser must use? Checking for individual user agents seems the wrong way to go about it. Edit: I just noticed the media queries code you are using and I noticed you are using a different path: css/style_mob.css when using the javascript and ../css/style_mob.css . Is that a typo or could it be the reason it's not working?
