Allocate n bytes for x bits

First, this can be a general algorithm for any language, but I'm learning C and if there is some C specific features, I'd like to know! I'm writing a function that will allocate enough memory for a given number of bits; into a long long * variable. The number of bits cannot be . I tested the algorithm : int bits; // the function argument, checked for value > 0 size_t dataSize; // the value passed to the malloc function for (bits = 1; bits It looks ok... but ugly :) Any way to have a more elegant way to achieve this? Thank you!
