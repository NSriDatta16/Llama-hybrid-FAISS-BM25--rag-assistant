Is Ruby on Rails supported by most hosts?

I'm considering shifting from PHP to Rails. Does an average web host support the Ruby language and everything that Rails needs? Does a normal Rails app using MySQL or does it handle data differently? And is it as "easy" to get an app up and running, as PHP?
