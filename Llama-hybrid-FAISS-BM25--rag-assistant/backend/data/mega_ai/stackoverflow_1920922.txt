Multiple complexFilter in Magento's api v2

Currently Iâ€™m having some difficulties with using new Magento's soap v2 from c# interface. With php i was able to do something like this: $params["created_at"]["from"] = date("Y-m-d H:i:s",Functions::convert_time($dataDa)); $params["created_at"]["to"] = date("Y-m-d H:i:s",Functions::convert_time($dataA)); MageInterface::getSingleton()->shipmentList($params); In this mode i was able to find list of orders which were created from $dataDa to $dataA without problems. With c# however it seems that only the last one of the selectors work. My code: var cpf = new complexFilter[2]; cpf[0] = new complexFilter { key = "created_at", value = new associativeEntity { key = "to", value = uxDataA.DateTime.ToString("yy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss") } }); cpf[1] = new complexFilter { key = "created_at", value = new associativeEntity { key = "from", value = uxDataDa.DateTime.ToString("yy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss") } }); var filters = new filters(); filters.complex_filter = cpf; var risultato = mage.salesOrderList(sessionKey, filters); In this mode only created_at->from criteria is taken in consideration (it's like second complex filter override previous one with the same key). Ideas? Thanks in advance.
