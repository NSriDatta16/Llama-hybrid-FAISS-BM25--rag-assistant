Interpretation of variance in multilevel logistic regression

Please help me to interpret the findings of my model. The specifications of the model are: Dependent variable : treatment (1) or no-treatment (0). Independent variables : age, number of drugs used, comorbidity, others... Multilevel structure : patients clustered within hospitals. Treatment rate varies across different hospitals. Multilevel logistic regression was used. Findings : First , I ran the empty model with random intercept only and estimated the variance component (between hospital variance in treatment rate). Second , I added independent variables to the model one by one. Adding these variables either decreased or increased the variance component when comparing to empty model. Third , I added all the independent variables together into the model and variance component increased when comparing to empty model. Conclusion : If I add variable to the model and variance decreases - this variable explains part of between-hospital variance in treatment rate. If I add variable to the model and it does not change variance component - this variable does not explain between-hospital variance. Question : Please, give me an advice how can I interpret the fact that adding some variables to the model increase variance component. Thank you in advance for any suggestions!
