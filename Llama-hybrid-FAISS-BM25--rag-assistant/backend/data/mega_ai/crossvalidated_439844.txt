Since your output variable is binary, you should investigate logistic regression. This lets you include multiple input variables and have the effects of one controlled for the others. If you are only interested in one input variable at a time, then you could do a chi-square test on each input variable. Whether any of these tests will allow you to conclude that the input variables are influencing the output variable depends on your design. Was it experimental or observational? Were people randomly assigned to groups?
