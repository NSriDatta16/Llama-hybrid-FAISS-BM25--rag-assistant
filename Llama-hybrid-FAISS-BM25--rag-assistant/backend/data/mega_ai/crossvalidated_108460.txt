should weights be scaled too?

I am using supervised learning algorithms (specificly SVM) on my data. I know that scaling was needed for my input data. however as I am also adding weights (using pairwise comparison), I am not sure if my weights need to be scaled as well. I don't mean normalizing the weights.
