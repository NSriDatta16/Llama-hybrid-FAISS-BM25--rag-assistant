How does one open a documentFragment in a new tab

What options are there for opening a document fragment in a new tab or window. Which are most browser compatible and which are most user friendly? var frag = document.createDocumentFragment(); var div = $(" ").addClass("Printable"); div[0].innerHTML = doc.body.innerHTML; frag.appendChild(div[0]); openIt(frag); // How to implement openIt The fragment contains a reformatted subset of the page that is ready to be printed. Preferably I would like it to open naturally through some kind or and look like any other user friendly html link, rather then quietly opening up an annoying pop-up through window.open .
