Convert plain text input to HTML

For our company intranet, built in PHP and MySQL, I want to add an area where employees can post a short profile of themselves - a couple of paragraphs of text and an image. What's the best way to convert this kind of plain text input to HTML paragraphs, bulleted lists, links, etc? Clarification : This content will be displayed in a modal that comes up when you click on the employee's desk on an office map, so a separate wiki or something like that will not work.
