File drag&drop, detect when dropped outside?

I'd like to modify the default behavior of my browser when drag&drop-ing a file in my webapp (html5). By default, if you drop a file outside a dropable box the browser tries to open it and quit the current page. On gmail, this is desactivated! Have you got an idea how this is done ? I was thinking about the onbeforeunload event but it creates an alert so it's not the solution. (I'm using plupload )
