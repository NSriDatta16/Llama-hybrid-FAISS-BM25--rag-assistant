The process GLMnet is following when it calculates coefficients for linear regression seem to be as follows: Standardise each $x$ by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (in calculating the standard deviation, divide by $N$, not $N-1$). Standardise $y$ by dividing by its standard deviation (again with the 'divide by $N$' formula). Alter the target lambda by dividing it by the standard deviation calculated for $y$. Calculate the $\beta $s using the formula in http://www.jstatsoft.org/v33/i01/paper . Unstandardise the $\beta$s using a variant of the formula in Matthew's answer. Note that since you did not subtract the mean of $y$ you do not need to add it at the end. To calculate the intercept, use the unstandardised $\beta$s and the unstandardised $x$s and $y$s. Take the average of $y$ and each $x$. The formula is: $$intercept = \bar y - \beta \bar x$$
