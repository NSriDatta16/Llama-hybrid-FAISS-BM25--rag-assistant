Is a decision stump a linear model?

Decision stump is a decision tree with only one split. It can also be written as a piecewise function. For example, assume $x$ is a vector, and $x_1$ is the first component of $x$, in regression setting, some decision stump can be $f(x)= \begin{cases} 3& x_1\leq 2 \\ 5 & x_1 > 2 \\ \end{cases} $ But is it a linear model? where can be written as $f(x)=\beta^T x$? This Question may sound strange, because as mentioned in the answers and comments, if we plot the piecewise function it is not a line. Please see next section for why I am asking this question. EDIT: The reason I ask this question is logistic regression is a (generalized) linear model and the decision boundary is a line, also for decision stump. Note, we also have this question: Why is logistic regression a linear model? . On the other hand, it seems not true that decision stump is a linear model. Another reason I asked this is because of this question: In boosting, if the base learner is a linear model, does the final model is just a simple linear model? where, if we use a linear model as a base learner, we get nothing more than linear regression. But if we select base learner as a decision stump, we are getting very interesting model. Here is one example of decision stump boosting on regression with 2 features and 1 continuous response.
