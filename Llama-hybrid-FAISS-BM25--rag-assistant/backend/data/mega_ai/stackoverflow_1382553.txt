Dragging objects out of an IFrame

I have an IFrame on my page pointing to a page containing list of elements. The elements are Draggables created using Scriptaculous library . The question is how do I drag the elements OUT of the IFrame, and drop them on the page containing the IFrame? Is there any library available which supports cross frame dragging & dropping? I don't know about jQuery, but Scriptaculous definitely doesn't support this.
