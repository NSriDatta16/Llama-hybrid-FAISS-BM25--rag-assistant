If you are trying to use an Ordinary Least Squares regression to determine the impact of crude petroleum prices on the Colombian exchange rate - the first thing you need to do is analyze your data to see if it is stationary. To do this, plot the autocorrelation function and run a Dickey-Fuller test adf.test in R to confirm/deny the same. Once you have confirmed that your model is stationary, i.e. you have a significant p-value for the Dickey-Fuller test at your specified significance level, then your OLS results are valid by regressing on first differences. However, a more effective way to investigate the correlations between two time series is through cointegration analysis. A cointegrated pair is one that is non-stationary, but a linear combination of that pair is stationary. y t - Î²x t = u t where x t and y t are a non-stationary and cointegrated pair. When running the Engle-Granger two step method , the purpose of this is to estimate the value of u t through OLS and then regress the estimate of u t on the first differenced regression. The reason that cointegration is preferred is that a normal correlation analysis or OLS in standard form will detect a trend from the time series, but this trend does not necessarily have theoretical meaning. This means that you would be quite likely to make a Type I error of rejecting the null hypothesis, or concluding a significant relationship exists when it doesn't. A cointegration analysis accounts for the fact that a time trend could have been obtained due to chance, and therefore looks to see if the relationship between the two time series is statistically significant. While a stationary, first-differenced OLS is a valid procedure, your analysis would be well served with cointegration testing as well.
