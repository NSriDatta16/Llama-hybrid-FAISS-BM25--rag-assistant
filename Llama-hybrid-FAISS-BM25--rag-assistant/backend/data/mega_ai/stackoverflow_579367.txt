I actually think the iphone / itouch does this really well when moving application icons. If you haven't seen it look here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnXoGnUU6uI The 'shaking' icons are a very good visual cue that something is moveable/draggable. So I would suggest this approach with drag an drop. Clicking and holding on an item could put it in 'moveable-mode' and this would be indicated by it shaking (or some easier to code visual cue). Then drag and drop would work in the normal way. Implementing this in javascript is of course the challenge... Also another thing to think about - most people make the mistake of conflating usability with learnability. Think who the users of this app are (will they use it regularly and be taught how to use it, or are they public web users who may use it infrequently and not be taught how to use it) - it might give you a different answer to what the solution should be.
