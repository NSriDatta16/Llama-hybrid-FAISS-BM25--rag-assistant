I've worked on some very large C# projects and have rarely seen Debug build times exceed 2 minutes. What generally sucks time are things like static analysis (e.g. fxcop), unit tests, code signing (if using a code sign service), etc. The easiest way to keep these under control is to either limit them to Release builds or to have a separate build definition for 'Full Build' and exclude these steps from your Debug and Release builds. If these aren't your problems, look to your computer performance as others have said. Fragmentation, slow build disks, anti-virus, etc.
