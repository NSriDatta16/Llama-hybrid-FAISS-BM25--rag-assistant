How does the RMS package's nomogram calculate points for continuous variables?

I have been reading a number of papers where researchers have created risk scores based on logistic regression models. Often they refer to " Sullivan's method " but I have no access to this paper and the explanations provided are far from clear. I noticed that Dr. Harrell's excellent RMS package provides a nomogram function which is in a way similar to creating a risk score (albeit with a very pretty graphical output). It seems after tinkering around with it that the way it works is by dividing the beta coefficients by the smallest beta coefficient and then multiplying a constant to create points for categorical variables. However I cannot for the life of me figure out what is going on with continuous variables. I've spent hours searching google without much luck, and I would appreciate if someone could shed some light on this for me. Thanks!
