I'm not sure what the correct warning is, but once you've found it, you can change its disposition with the following (using 'format' as the example): #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wformat" Or as strager points out : gcc -Werror=format ... I've checked the gcc source for this and this specific warning cannot be disabled via command line flags.
