How to get rid of the values of infinity in the answer

I solve the problem, and in logarithms I get 2 'infinity'. Therefore, I can not make a picture in the function after 'plot'. R had trouble computing the model to the plot, since 2 out of 10 logit values (for CT of 9 and 10) were infinite. This is the same reason I was unable to compute the abline to the plot. However, even without the actual line, the relationship between the X variable and the logit looks fairly linear. Thus, the linearity condition is met, since the relationship between CT and the Logit function as depicted on the plot is close to linear. Question: One of the key conditions for the validity of the simple logistic regression model is the assumption that the logit [loge(p/(1 â€“ p)] is linearly related to X. Provide a graphical check of this condition for these data. What does the plot suggest? So I decide: In logistic regression, we assume a relationship between P(Y =1) and X of the form p=P(Y=1)=e0+1X1+e0+1X . This is equivalent to the model L=loge(p1-p)=0+1CT In logistic regression we assume a linear relationship between X and the logit. Because our dataset is large enough, we can check this condition. Follow the next steps to check for this key condition: a. To divide the CT into 10 intervals, named C, use the R codes: > C C[biopsy$CT C[biopsy$CT>1&biopsy$CT C[biopsy$CT>2&biopsy$CT C[biopsy$CT>3&biopsy$CT C[biopsy$CT>4&biopsy$CT C[biopsy$CT>5&biopsy$CT C[biopsy$CT>6&biopsy$CT C[biopsy$CT>7&biopsy$CT C[biopsy$CT>8&biopsy$CT C[biopsy$CT>9&biopsy$CT tally(~C) C 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10` 145 50 108 80 130 34 23 46 14 69 There are 130 tumors with clump thickness values in the interval 5-6. > tally(biopsy$Class~C) C biopsy$Class 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 142 46 96 68 85 16 1 4 0 0 1 3 4 12 12 45 18 22 42 14 69 b.
