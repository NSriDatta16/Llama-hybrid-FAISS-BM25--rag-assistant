It depends on what you need to do with the Magento install. If you want to use the Magento Connect Manager built into the administrator interface then you will need 777 permissions. If you don't want this (such as if you're happy to use the command line PEAR installer) then only the var/, media/ and app/etc/ directories need to be 777.
