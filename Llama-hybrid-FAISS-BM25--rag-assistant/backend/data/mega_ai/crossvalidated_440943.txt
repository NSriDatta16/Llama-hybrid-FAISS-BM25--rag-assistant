The crude analysis is appropriately named and doesn't really answer the question of an overall trend very well. Linear regression of temperature on time is slightly better, but you really want to use time series methods that account for seasonality at the very least - more sophisticated models are certainly possible. I'd also be careful to check that what is measured is the same thing over time. Another, simpler choice is, in the link, to use the annual time rather than what you used. You can then look at each month, separately. For each month, the plot shows clearly that temperatures were more-or-less steady until 1975 or 1980 and have been rising since. However, that doesn't seem to be able to give you equations.
