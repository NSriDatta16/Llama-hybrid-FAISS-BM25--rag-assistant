It's remarkably easy to write a GUI with Tcl/Tk. Some say the GUIs are ugly, but that's subjective and somewhat dependent on how much you pay attention to details and whether or not you use themed (ttk) widgets. And frankly, for personal use, looks don't matter all that much. As an example, to display "hello world" in a window is just three lines: package require Tk ttk::label .l -text "Hello, world" pack .l The tk toolkit is available for many languages. For a little more on how it can be used with tcl, ruby, python and perl see http://www.tkdocs.com
