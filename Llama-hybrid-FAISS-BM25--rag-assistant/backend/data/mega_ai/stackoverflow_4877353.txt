For graphical stuff, I organize my code into a setup() function, and a draw() function that gets called repeatedly, something like this: function setup(){ // set up variables you in draw, here // examples include initial document width and height, and things // like that (although those in particular would go in draw if you // want to handle the resize event. context = document.getElementById("canvas").getContext('2d'); } function draw(){ // clear the canvas context.clearRect(0, 0, docWidth, docHeight); // now redraw your bar graph // ... } setup(); setInterval("draw();", 60); Do you see where I'm going with this?
