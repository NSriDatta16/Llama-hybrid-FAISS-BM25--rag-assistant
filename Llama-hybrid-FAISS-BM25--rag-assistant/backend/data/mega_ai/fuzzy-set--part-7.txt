, valuations ( μ : V o → W {\displaystyle \mu :{\mathit {V}}_{o}\to {\mathit {W}}} ) of propositional variables ( V o {\displaystyle {\mathit {V}}_{o}} ) into a set of membership degrees ( W {\displaystyle {\mathit {W}}} ) can be thought of as membership functions mapping predicates into fuzzy sets (or more formally, into an ordered set of fuzzy pairs, called a fuzzy relation). With these valuations, many-valued logic can be extended to allow for fuzzy premises from which graded conclusions may be drawn. This extension is sometimes called "fuzzy logic in the narrow sense" as opposed to "fuzzy logic in the wider sense," which originated in the engineering fields of automated control and knowledge engineering, and which encompasses many topics involving fuzzy sets and "approximated reasoning." Industrial applications of fuzzy sets in the context of "fuzzy logic in the wider sense" can be found at fuzzy logic. Fuzzy number A fuzzy number is a fuzzy set that satisfies all the following conditions: A is normalised; A is a convex set; The membership function μ A ( x ) {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(x)} achieves the value 1 at least once; The membership function μ A ( x ) {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(x)} is at least segmentally continuous. If these conditions are not satisfied, then A is not a fuzzy number. The core of this fuzzy number is a singleton; its location is: C ( A ) = x ∗ : μ A ( x ∗ ) = 1 {\displaystyle \,C(A)=x^{*}:\mu _{A}(x^{*})=1} Fuzzy numbers can be likened to the funfair game "guess your weight," where someone guesses the contestant's weight, with closer guesses being more correct, and where the guesser "wins" if he or she guesses near enough to the contestant's weight, with the actual weight being completely correct (mapping to 1 by the membership function). The kernel K ( A ) = Kern ⁡ ( A ) {\displaystyle K(A)=\operatorname {Kern} (A)} of a fuzzy interval A {\displaystyle A} is defined as the 'inner' part, without the 'outbound' parts where the membership value is constant ad infinitum. In other words, the smallest subset of R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } where μ A ( x ) {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(x)} is constant outside of it, is defined as the kernel. However, there are other concepts of fuzzy numbers and intervals as some authors do not insist on convexity. Fuzzy categories The use of set membership as a key component of category theory can be generalized to fuzzy sets. This approach, which began in 1968 shortly after the introduction of fuzzy set theory, led to the development of Goguen categories in the 21st century. In these categories, rather than using two valued set membership, more general intervals are used, and may be lattices as in L-fuzzy sets. There are numerous mathematical extensions similar to or more general than fuzzy sets. Since fuzzy sets were introduced in 1965 by Zadeh, many new mathematical constructions and theories treating imprecision, inaccuracy, vagueness, uncertainty and vulnerability have been developed. Some of these constructions and theories are extensions of fuzzy set theory, while others attempt to mathematically model inaccuracy/vagueness and uncertainty in a different way. The diversity of such constructions and corresponding theories includes: Fuzzy Sets (Zadeh, 1965) interval sets (Moore, 1966), L-fuzzy sets (Goguen, 1967), flou sets (Gentilhomme, 1968), type-2 fuzzy sets and type-n fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1975), interval-valued fuzzy sets (Grattan-Guinness, 1975; Jahn, 1975; Sambuc, 1975; Zadeh, 1975), level fuzzy sets (Radecki, 1977) rough sets (Pawlak, 1982), intuitionistic fuzzy sets (Atanassov, 1983), fuzzy multisets (Yager, 1986), intuitionistic L-fuzzy sets (Atanassov, 1986), rough multisets (Grzymala-Busse, 1987), fuzzy rough sets (Nakamura, 1988), real-valued fuzzy sets (Blizard, 1989), vague sets (Wen-Lung Gau and Buehrer, 1993), α-level sets (Yao, 1997), shadowed sets (Pedrycz, 1998), neutrosophic sets (NSs) (Smarandache, 1998), bipolar fuzzy sets (Wen-Ran Zhang, 1998), genuine set
