Yup. This is basically the point of ConcurrentHashMap . From the documentation : Retrieval operations (including get) generally do not block, so may overlap with update operations (including put and remove). Retrievals reflect the results of the most recently completed update operations holding upon their onset. and from the package documentation : A concurrent collection is thread-safe, but not governed by a single exclusion lock. In the particular case of ConcurrentHashMap , it safely permits any number of concurrent reads as well as a tunable number of concurrent writes. (Both of those documentation pages have much more detail, of course. They're worth reading carefully.)
