Selection of sites for wind power generation using time series from 600 candidate sites

I have 3 hourly power generation data for around 600 locations for a year. (i.e. 8 data per day for 365 days for each location.) I want to find out a way where out of this 600 locations, I can say suppose choose suppose 10 locations which are producing power at different time periods. suppose: Location: Hour 0, Hour 3, Hour 6, Hour 9, Hour 12, Hour 15 A 30 00 50 70 00 20 B 50 20 70 100 00 40 C 00 100 20 00 40 30 D 20 15 10 00 40 30 Here, A and B are highly correlated where A and C are inversely correlated. So, is there a way where I can distinguish the locations which are producing powers at different time periods so that, by accommodating these few location, the overall power generation can be sort of stable? By sort of stable, I mean something like this which I mentioned in the comment later on to clarify my question. Since A and C are inversely co-related, so if I choose power from A and C out of four locations, I would get some power all the time (always above 30 in this scenario). But if I take A and B, I would get very high amount of power when I have power (like 70+100=170 in hour 9), and I wont get any power at Hour 12 (since A and B produces 00 power in Hour 12). I want to avoid choosing A and B, and I want to choose A and C. My objective is to choose 10 locations out of 600 where by adding powers of each hour of 10 locations, total power for each hour should be above a certain threshold, like 30.
