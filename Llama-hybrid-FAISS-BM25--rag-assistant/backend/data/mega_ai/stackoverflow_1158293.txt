Why are we getting “The path is not of a legal form” for a FileInfo constructor?

We're creating a FileInfo object in C# using the following code: if (planConfig->OrganisationsFilePath != nullptr) { FileInfo^ file = gcnew FileInfo(planConfig->OrganisationsFilePath); //Do some stuff here } and our customers are reporting that they see an ArgumentException with “The path is not of a legal form” as the message being thrown. We cannot reproduce this and we're wondering what string you'd need to pass to the FileInfo constructor to see this error?
