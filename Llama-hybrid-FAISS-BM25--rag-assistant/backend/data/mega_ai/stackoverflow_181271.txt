you can achieve the same functionality by allowing elements to inherit multiple styles. ex. stuff and then your css would include, for example: .style1 {width:140px;} .style2 {height:140px;} edit: actually robert's answer might better approximate the method you are trying to achieve .style1, .style2 {width: 140px;} .style2 {height: 140px;} i will have both width and height applied
