Why does nobody visualise the between and within estimator?

Why can't I find nowhere, neither in books or help files on the internet, graphs of the "in between" estimators and the "within" estimator? Imagine you have the logwages of 10 persons and also their work experience. Why does nobody show these ten lines of this panel data in a meaningful graph? Is it correct that the within estimator would produce, in combination with the calculated 10 fixed effects, 10 lines that go as good as possible through each of the ten salary versus experience lines? And is it correct that the in between estimator would produce a regression line going through the averages of experience and salaries? But what would happen then if all averages x's are equal? In the graph below you can find 8 observed "experiences" versus "log wages", can you tell me my thoughts are correct?
