Is the linear probability model (LPM) less inappropriate when the independent variable of interest is binary? (and controls are continuous)

I need to use an LPM for a paper I'm doing (for reasons orthogonal to this question). I have about 6000 observations in a time series cross-sectional structure (countries and years) and my dependent variable is binary. Now, I know all the standard arguments against the LPM, but I am wondering whether the case for using it is better when the independent variable of interest is binary? As far as I can tell, if all independent variables are binary the LPM is completely general, but I have some controls that are continuous. So, is the LPM equally bad if the independent variable of interest is binary?
