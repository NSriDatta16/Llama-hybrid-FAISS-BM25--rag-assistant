Cannot get theme to work on catalog view

I have theme i am trying to get work on a remote server that works fine on my local copy. This is for magento 1.4.1.1. On the working local copy I have 'theme144' within the 'base' package, there are 3 store views; . In the admin there are 3 design change(System>Design), one for each store view. These are the only changes i see in the admin pertaining to design. When testing the site on the remote server, the correct templates are being used for everything except the catalog view. Magento reverts to the 'default' theme inside the 'base' package. All the images, and it seems like the templates, are all using the other theme. I've tried specifying the theme explicitly in System>Configuration>Design for the Skin, Layout, and Templates, even though on the working local copy these are not set. This got magento to find the images and style sheets, but it was still using 'default' for the templates. At this point i don't where else to look to give me hints as to why this is happening. I eliminated all the differences between the local and remote site, both in the admin and the template file structure. edit : This issue also extends to the product detail view
