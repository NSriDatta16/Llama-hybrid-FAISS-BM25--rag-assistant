How to create a NSMatrix of NSImageCell in Interface Builder in 10.6

How can I create a matrix (NSMatrix object) of NSImageCell cells (usually located in an NSImageView) in Interface Builder 3.2.1 (i.e. the one made for Snow Leopard?) In the "old days", you would drag an NSImageView, and then option-drag the corner of the control. It seemed to have stopped working in 3.2.1... Is there another way? Am I doing something wrong?
