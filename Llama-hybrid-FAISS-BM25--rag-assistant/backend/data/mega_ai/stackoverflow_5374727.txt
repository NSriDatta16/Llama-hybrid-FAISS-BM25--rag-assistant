I suspect the reason is because you are calling this in the $(document).ready() , which runs after the DOM is loaded (i.e. your elements are already displayed). If you absolutely have to resize elements after they've loaded, the only thing I can think of that might help is having an overlay that covers the entire window, maybe something like: #overlay{ position: fixed; width: 100%; height: 100%; background: #fff; z-index: 9001; } And then hiding the overlay via $("#overlay").hide() after the resizing in your $(document).ready() function. I haven't tested this so I don't know if it works. You might have to add a short setTimeOut as well. To be honest, though, this solution feels very dirty. Hopefully someone else can think of something more elegant.
