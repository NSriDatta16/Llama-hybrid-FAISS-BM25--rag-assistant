Actually the results look pretty consistent. But based on the plots I do not believe the result for CAD vs CNY. The Pearson correlation looks like it should be practically 0 not 0.57. Also since these are time series these analyses are ignoring any time dependence if there were any. There is no apparent time dependence based on the plots.
