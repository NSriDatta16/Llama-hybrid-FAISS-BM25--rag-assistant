Correct Machine Learning approach for prediction using multiple timelines

I am wondering what would be the correct ML approach in order to predict the upcoming value of a time serie based on the previous behaviours of various time series for the same period. I have a dataset in the form of: TS name Day1 Day2 ... Day50 Target-Day51 TS 1 5 13 ... 16 12 TS 2 8 18 ... 9 16 ... 12 2 ... 13 4 TS 4000 3 7 ... 4 10 Imagine that a new row will be in the following form and I want to predict the target day: TS name Day1 Day2 ... Day50 Target-Day51 TS 4001 3 22 ... 48 XX Is this a time-series approach? A regression one? A Multivariate Time series one? Can you suggest some algorithms which could work here?
