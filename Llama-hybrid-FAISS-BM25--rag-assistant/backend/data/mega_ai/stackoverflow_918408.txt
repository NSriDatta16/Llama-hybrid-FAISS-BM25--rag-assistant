File.Encrypt throwing "Parameter is incorrect"

When I try to call System.IO.File.Encrypt() on an existing file, it throws a generic IOException, and the message is "Parameter is incorrect". System.IO.File.Encrypt("C:\Project\StorageDirectory\file.txt") The current user the process is running under has full control to the "StorageDirectory" folder. Is there something I'm missing permissions-wise?
