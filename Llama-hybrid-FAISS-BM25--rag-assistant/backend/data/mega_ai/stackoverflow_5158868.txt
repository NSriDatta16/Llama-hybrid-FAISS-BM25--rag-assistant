In each of the buttons, you could set the Touch Drag Outside event AND the Touch Drag Enter button event from the Connections Inspector to call the appropriate IBAction, so that the method is called when any one of them is touched and while the finger is still dragging toward the others. It may require two events for every button, depending on what exact behaviour you're looking for. Remember that although it may deviate from the Model-View-Controller (MVC) way of doing things, one can set an IB element to call multiple IBActions and multiple events can be used to call the same IBAction. The events will be listed in the connection inspector after you select each button. Press CMD+2 to jump to the connection inspector tab.
