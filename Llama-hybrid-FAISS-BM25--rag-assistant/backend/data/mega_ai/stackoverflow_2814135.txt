The first code works because it's binding the event to a live selector. The second code is applying a live to a specific element (the .eq(x) returns a jQuery object with a collection of just that element) - it's not applying it to a selector to listen to in the future. With the way you have it set up (each calling a different function), I can't really think of an elegant way to approach the issue. Also, why are you using live for such a specific selection? Are those 's removed/added as the page lives on? Unless you truly need live , I would do it like so.. var tab_node = $("#myDIV li"); tab_node.eq(0).click(funcA); tab_node.eq(1).click(funcB); tab_node.eq(2).click(funcC); tab_node.eq(3).click(funcD);
