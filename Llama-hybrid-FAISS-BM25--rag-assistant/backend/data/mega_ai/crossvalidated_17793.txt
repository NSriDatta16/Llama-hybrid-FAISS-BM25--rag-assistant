I believe I have found the answer for this one: it was shown in 2001 by A. Ng: "However, it was not too long ago that many people preferred logistic regression(a discriminative model) to naive Bayes(a generative model). In fact, many people preferred discriminative to generative models in general, since discriminative models achieve lower asymptotic errors. These preferences were tested by Ng and Jordan , and it was shown that a decision between which classifier is better is not always a simple answer; it was shown that naive Bayes reaches its asmyptotic error very quickly with regards to the number of training examples."
