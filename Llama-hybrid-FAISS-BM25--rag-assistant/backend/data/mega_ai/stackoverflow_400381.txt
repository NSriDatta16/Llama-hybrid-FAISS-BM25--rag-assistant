This is almost embarrassing, but thanks to Dominick Baier on the forum I no now realise I've missed a huge point (I knew it didn't make sense! honestly! :-) ) - A token gets retrieved once per service proxy, assuming it hadn't expired, and so all I needed to do is to reuse the same proxy, which I planned to do anyway, but, rather stupidly, didn't on my prototype. In addition - I found a very interesting sample on the MSDN WCF samples - Durable Issued Token Provider , which, if I understand it correctly, uses a custom endpoint behaviour on the client side to implement token caching, which is very elegant. I will still look at this approach as we have several services and so we could achieve even more efficiency by re-using the same token between their proxies. So - two solutions, pretty much infornt of my eyes; hope my stupidity helps someone at some point!
