John, I might suggest taking a step back and doing some more research before you decide to write your own SAML IDP/SP Implementation. You appear to be mixing Bindings with Profiles, Unsolicited vs Solicited Web SSO as well as the fact that SAML requires that the User Agent (aka Browser) is the bearer of almost all the messages between the IDP and SP. There is also a ton of info in the spec that will will have to implement to ensure your solution is actually secure . I would suggest starting with our SAML Knowledge Base and then moving on to the OASIS SAML 2.0 Technical Overview for information on these flows. Alternatively, if you decide to go best-of-breed you can check out our PingFederate product which can enable ALL the SAML IDP/SP use cases for you in Hope this helps - Ian
