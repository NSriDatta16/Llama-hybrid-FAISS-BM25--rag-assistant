I may be a bit strange, but I actually prefer using a straight, rectangular, desk. The simple reason for this is that I like to have as little space as possible between the edge og my keyboard (or laptop) and the edge of the desk. I shift things around a bit from time to time—for variation;—but my keyboard is rarely more than 5-10cm away from the edge of the desk. Because of this, cornered desks or desks without stragiht edges just annoy me. My ideal work desk is a 160x80cm wooden "sheet" with four simple, adjustable, legs and no "fancies"—as they just tend to get in the way (if you have ever crashed your legs into one of those metal bars crossing under your desk for "stabilization", you know what I am talking about). If you need more space, you can always combine two desks to make a nice large surface you can easily "slide" along without fear of crashing into any corners or edges "sticking out". Also, as others have mentioned, straight desks are much better for pair programming or any other form of group activity involving more than one person sitting in front of the desk/monitor.
