How do you turn on Code Coverage in Builds within TFS?

I need to know how to turn on Code Coverage when running TFS builds on a solution with a .testrunconfig file. There is an option in the testrunconfig file that is for code coverage, but when running a TFS build there is no code coverage results. I am running my tests using the *Tests.dll mask and NOT using Test Lists (.vsmdi).
