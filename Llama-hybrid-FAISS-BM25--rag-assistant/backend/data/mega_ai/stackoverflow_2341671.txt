I just came across this very simple and elegant solution, available in MVC 2: Link Basically if you are using MVC 2.0, use the following in your view. m.due) %> m.due)%> then create a partial view in /Views/Shared/EditorTemplates, called DateTime.ascx " %> When the EditorFor<> is called it will find a matching Editor Template.
