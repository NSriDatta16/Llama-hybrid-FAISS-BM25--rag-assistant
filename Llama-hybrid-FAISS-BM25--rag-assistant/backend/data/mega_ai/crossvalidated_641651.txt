Finding parameters which reveal clustering in t-SNE

These data are from SAMHSA, Mental Health Client-Level Data . I am trying to find the right parameters to obtain clustering as in this paper . Code here . For now, I'm dropping columns which aren't disorders. I expect life factors (employment, insurance, housing status, etc.) to be correlated. I'm using this tool to understand t-SNE better. I'm playing the perplexity. num_data_points=500,000 (6.5mil total), num_cols = 50, num_iters = 500, perplexity = 50 EDIT 1 The first six eigenvalues of $X_c^T X_c / n$ where $X_c = X - \mu$ and $n$ is the number of samples are: 0.674496730896796 0.6745034759314714 0.4741462086560067 0.47415095016150915 0.4124591388160532 0.4124632633990249 Is there any trick to reveal more clustering? Would k-means be better? * EDIT 2 The k-means cluster labeling is very revealing. num_clusters=13 for now: pred_cols = ['AGE','EDUC','GENDER','SPHSERVICE','CMPSERVICE','OPISERVICE','RTCSERVICE','IJSSERVICE','SAP','VETERAN','ETHNIC --> one-hot,'RACE --> one-hot,'MARSTAT --> one-hot,'EMPLOY --> one-hot,'LIVARAG --> one-hot] disorder_cols = ['no_disorder','DELIRDEMFLG','CONDUCTFLG','ADHDFLG','DEPRESSFLG','BIPOLARFLG','PERSONFLG','ALCSUBFLG','TRAUSTREFLG','ANXIETYFLG','SCHIZOFLG',,'OTHERDISFLG','ODDFLG','PDDFLG','multi-disorder']
