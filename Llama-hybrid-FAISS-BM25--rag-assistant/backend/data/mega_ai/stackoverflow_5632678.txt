Lotus notes email in multiple folders

Is it possible to place an email into multiple lotus notes folders without creating a copy of the email? Essitiantly, I am looking for a way to create a shortcut to the same email in a different folder. For example, I have many emails relating to expenses. I would like to place the email in a folder I created called 'Airport Expenses', as well as in a folder I created called 'Business Travel DD/MM/YYYY', without duplicating the physical storage of the file.
