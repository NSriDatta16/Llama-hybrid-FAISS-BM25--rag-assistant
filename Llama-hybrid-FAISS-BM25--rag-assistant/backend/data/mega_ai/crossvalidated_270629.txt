If I interpreted the question right, it sounds like you are looking for an algorithm that generates sentences from training data. This would be a supervised learning algorithm that uses the training data to learn the necessary relationships. There are a variety of algorithms you could use for this. Here are a few suggestions. You could try an n-gram sentence generator. This is a method used in natural language processing (nlp). Neural networks are another machine learning algorithm that have been used to generate sentences. I would code this in python, because python handles json format data, and has many useful nlp libraries such as nltk or spacy. These libraries probably have algorithms built in for just this task. Hope this helps.
