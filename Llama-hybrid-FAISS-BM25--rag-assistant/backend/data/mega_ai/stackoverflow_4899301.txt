QMainWindow set frameSize

How do you set the frameSize of a QMainWindow? To explain what I'm trying to do, the requirement I need to meet is that the height of my program's main window be equal to the screen height minus taskbar; but the width should be considerably less than the screen width on a modern wide screen monitor, so I can't just maximize the window. I can find the screen height minus taskbar no problem with QApplication::desktop()->availableGeometry() . Calling resize on the window with this value doesn't work, however; as far as I can tell, resize makes the interior take up a certain space, as opposed to making the exterior fit within a certain space. The documentation seems to suggest the relevant window property is frameSize , but doesn't provide a direct way of setting it. I can probably do some trial and error feedback between resize and frameSize , but is there a more elegant/idiomatic way to do it?
