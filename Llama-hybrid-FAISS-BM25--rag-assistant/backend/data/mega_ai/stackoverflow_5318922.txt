When Authorize.Net is in test mode the trans_id is always 0. So you cannot do "Prior Authorize and Capture" transactions (nor void and credit transactions). In other words, if you have Magento configured for "Authorize Only" then you will be able to place an order but you will not be able to invoice that order since the trans_id is 0. However, if you have Magento configured for "Authorize and Capture" then it will work okay. The way I tested since I'm suing "Authorize Only" was I started in test mode to make sure things were communicating and then switch to live mode and just voided or credited those orders after testing. I created a $0.01 product so that I didn't go over my limit on my personal credit card :)
