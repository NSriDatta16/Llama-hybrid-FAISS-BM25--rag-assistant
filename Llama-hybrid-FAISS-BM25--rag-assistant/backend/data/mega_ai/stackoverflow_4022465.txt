Average the duplicated values from two paired lists in Python

in my code I obtain two different lists from different sources, but I know they are in the same order. The first list ("names") contains a list of keys strings, while the second ("result_values") is a series of floats. I need to make the pair unique, but I can't use a dictionary as only the last value inserted would be kept: instead, I need to make an average (arithmetic mean) of the values that have a duplicate key. Example of the wanted results: names = ["pears", "apples", "pears", "bananas", "pears"] result_values = [2, 1, 4, 8, 6] # ints here but it's the same conceptually combined_result = average_duplicates(names, result_values) print combined_result {"pears": 4, "apples": 1, "bananas": 8} My only ideas involve multiple iterations and so far have been ugly... is there an elegant solution to this problem?
