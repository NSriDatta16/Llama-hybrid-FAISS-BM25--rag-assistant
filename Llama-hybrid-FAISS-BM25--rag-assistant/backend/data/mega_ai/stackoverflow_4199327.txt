Yes, you do have to go through each browser incompatibility bug and fix it for that browser. A bug can be fixed in 3 ways (listed in my order of preference): Start with a very compliant browser, then look at the page in other browsers (I focus on Chrome/Safari/Firefox/IE6-7-8-9) Use different CSS technique, that ends up rendering the same in all browsers Use IE Conditional Comments to bring in another CSS for that browser leveraging the CSS "Cascade" Use CSS Hacks as a last resort (usually only for Firefox or something) But "go through each browser" can be the tricky part! There are some tools to help. @Brian mentioned SuperPreview for Expression Web (+1), but there's also a free version of SuperPreview for Internet Explorer for those who don't have Expression Web. You can compare different versions of IE on the same machine (hard before this product). Microsoft claims this sub-set of the Expression Web product will always be free (since they feel bad about IE6!). IE6-7-8-9 tool is good enough for me, because I tend to focus on all versions of IE, but only the latest versions of Chrome/Safari/Firefox. But if you must test against multiple versions of other browsers: Expression Web SuperPreview How to Use Multiple Browsers on a Single Machine 10 Helpful Resources for Cross Browser Testing (Although Litmus seems to have dropped general web page support, and instead focuses on email client compatibility and campaign analytics.)
