Looking for JQuery drag and drop features

Here's what I want to achieve. I want to be able to have a list of words, which I can drag over an input field and drop into the value. I want to be able to do this multiple times possibly with the same word, to go in more that one input field. Basically I'm sorting words into groups. If anyone could point me at a JQuery library that can do this sort of thing, that would be great. Cheers, Thomas.
