The spec provides a reason: TFOOT must appear before TBODY within a TABLE definition so that user agents can render the foot before receiving all of the (potentially numerous) rows of data. http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.3 I don't know if any browsers actually follow this behavior, and it was changed in HTML5 to handle both the HTML 4 order and the more logical order: In this order: optionally a caption element, followed by zero or more colgroup elements, followed optionally by a thead element, followed optionally by a tfoot element, followed by either zero or more tbody elements or one or more tr elements, followed optionally by a tfoot element (but there can only be one tfoot element child in total). http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/tabular-data.html
