The question is a bit broad and opinion-based for StackExchange, but I'll have a quick go anyway: I don't see good topics in this area. For academic machine learning, how you store your data is largely irrelevant, either because the research is on small data anyway and will be read into memory, or because the research is pretty theoretical to begin with. There are certainly interesting issues to explore here for distributed ML. However NoSQL stores would not in general be helpful. They specialize in random access and random updates to keyed data. ML generally needs high-throughput sequential access to data without updating it. BI + ML is too broad. Yes there are topics in there somewhere but hard to discuss at that level.
