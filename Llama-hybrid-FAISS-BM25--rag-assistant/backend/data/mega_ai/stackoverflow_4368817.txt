You could put the logic into a seperate module / into seperate classes/functions. In my 2D-Game I have a GameLogic class which simplifies registering it's methods for certain events or scheduling them (and unregistering+unscheduling them), and I created a @state_wrapper decorator which injects a simple new-style object as state-storage for that method. If you do it like that you don't have to pass the pointer to all your world objects, only the event-methods have to get access to your objects. But I wouldn't claim that this is the best solution ;)
