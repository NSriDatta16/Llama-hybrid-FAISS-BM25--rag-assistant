How to estimate confidence intervals for LC50

This is my first question, so I hope the question is properly done (my apologies if it's not...) I am using a binomial GLM model (logit) for some toxicology data investigating the effects of a pesticide to some organisms. The same amount of organisms were exposed to different concentrations of the pesticide and survival was assessed at the end of the experiment. The data and model go as follows: ## data: Concentration $Dead Total-Data $Survival Data$ Proport_Surv $Total - Data$ Dead) / Data$Total mod This is the summary output: Call: glm(formula = cbind(Survival, Dead) ~ Concentration, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = Data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.0156 -0.4775 0.1917 0.4356 0.8721 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 6.992127 1.121066 6.237 4.46e-10 *** Concentration -0.015196 0.002366 -6.423 1.34e-10 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 163.5934 on 8 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 3.2464 on 7 degrees of freedom AIC: 19.401 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 5 An important output in toxicology to infer about the toxicity of any chemical, is to estimate the LC50 value, which is the concentration estimated by the model that elicits 50% mortality. I used the dose.p() function from MASS. For this dataset: library(MASS) dose.p(mod, p=0.5) Dose SE p = 0.5: 460.1353 18.16643 The LC50 for this pesticide would be 460.1353 but this value should be accompanied by confidence intervals. My doubt is: How to estimate confidence intervals for an X value? Plotting the model helps to understand what should be my output: Calculating confidence intervals for the model: NewData1 $P_logit fit) / (1 + exp(P_logit $fit)) NewData1$ SeUp $fit + 1.96*P_logit$ se.fit) / (1 + exp(P_logit $fit + 1.96*P_logit$ se.fit)) NewData1 $SeLo fit - 1.96*P_logit $se.fit) / (1 + exp(P_logit$ fit - 1.96*P_logit$se.fit)) Plot: library(ggplot2) plot The blue point annotation is the LC50 estimated by the model. How can I estimate the values where the dashed line intercepts the lower and upper confidence intervals of the model?
