In the IMAP world, each message has flags. You can set the individual flags on each message. When you Fetch a message, it's actually possible to read the message, without applying the \Seen flag. Most mail clients will apply the \Seen flag when the message is read. So, if the message has already been read, outside of your app, then you will need to remove the \Seen flag. Just as fyi...here is the relevant part about flags from the RFCs: A system flag is a flag name that is pre-defined in this specification. All system flags begin with "\". Certain system flags (\Deleted and \Seen) have special semantics described elsewhere. The currently-defined system flags are: \Seen Message has been read \Answered Message has been answered \Flagged Message is "flagged" for urgent/special attention \Deleted Message is "deleted" for removal by later EXPUNGE \Draft Message has not completed composition (marked as a draft). \Recent Message is "recently" arrived in this mailbox. This session is the first session to have been notified about this message; if the session is read-write, subsequent sessions will not see \Recent set for this message. This flag can not be altered by the client. If it is not possible to determine whether or not this session is the first session to be notified about a message, then that message SHOULD be considered recent. If multiple connections have the same mailbox selected simultaneously, it is undefined which of these connections will see newly-arrived messages with \Recent set and which will see it without \Recent set.
