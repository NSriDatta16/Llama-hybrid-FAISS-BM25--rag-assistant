Setting Average posterior probability value in Stata traj plugin

In complement to Aikake Information Criterion, I want to use posterior probability to select the best model for group-based trajectory modeling. In this paper: https://drc.bmj.com/content/bmjdrc/4/1/e000243/DC1/embed/inline-supplementary-material-1.pdf?download=true Which is a supplement to the methods section. The paragraph to which I'm referring is: "We used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as the criterion for model selection. However, this was moderated by /../ (c) an average posterior probability (AvePP) value >0.7 for each group; /../ and (f) the odds of correct classification based on the posterior probabilities of group membership >5 for each group". the average posterior probability value is set at >0.7 - how is this value selected? I understand that probability is a value which ranges between 0-1 and that a model of 0.5 is a very good model predictor. Therefore, should the selected value not be in the range of >0.3 and
