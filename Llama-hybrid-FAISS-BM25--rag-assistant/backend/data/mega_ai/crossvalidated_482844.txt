The standard GAN loss isn't useful in assessing whether training has converged or finished. There are some GANs, such as WGAN, which minimize the Wasserstein distance between the distribution of real and generated images (in which case the loss is interpretable, and can be used to judge convergence). Finally, you can measure the Frechet Inception Distance (a standard metric for evaluating GANs) periodically to judge when training has converged.
