R : Getting p-value for a mixed effects logistic regression

I am trying for the first time to do a mixed effects logistic regression with R and I have some difficulties. Using 120 samples, I want to see if the group of age and the sex of the patient have an impact on the protein (=1 if protein level>threshold value) and I consider the run as a random effect. library(lme4) log.lm = lme4::glmer(protein~sexe.f+groupe.f+sexe.f*groupe.f+(1|run_fusion_R1R3), data=data, family=binomial(link="logit")) anova(log.lm, test="Chisq") But the function anova() does not give any p-value : Analysis of Variance Table Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value sexe.f 1 0.3934 0.3934 0.3934 groupe.f 1 15.6975 15.6975 15.6975 sexe.f:groupe.f 1 5.5219 5.5219 5.5219 Why doesn't "anova()" return p-value ? Is there any problem with my model ? Should I use an other function ? Thanks for your help.
