How do I interpret the results of lasso and ridge regression?

I have created a ridge and lasso regression model in R. From my understanding, the coefficients are interpreted differently from logistic regression. For instance, in logistic regression you may say males have a 4 times greater odds of developing a certain condition than females (assuming the coefficient was 4 and the predictor variable was males, with females as the reference). A significance value is also provided. How do you interpret the coefficients in ridge and lasso regression, especially considering there is no p value?
