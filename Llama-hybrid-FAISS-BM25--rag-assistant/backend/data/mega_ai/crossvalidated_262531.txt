Non-parametric non-linear regression with deep learning

I have a situation where I have an increasing list of real numbers $\vec a$ of variable length (generally about 50 numbers but sometimes more). It turns out that these numbers uniquely correspond to two smooth, continuous functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, with $x$ spanning from 0 to 1. Given a list of numbers $\vec a$, I want to determine what functions $f$ and $g$ gave rise to them. I can simulate $f$ and $g$ and generate as many lists of numbers $a$ as I need. So the amount of training data is unlimited. A potential complication, however, is that when I simulate $a$, I will get maybe 300 numbers, whereas in real life, most of those numbers will be missing. I am wondering what tool is best for this task. I was thinking I could use recurrent neural networks. Are they appropriate for this problem?
