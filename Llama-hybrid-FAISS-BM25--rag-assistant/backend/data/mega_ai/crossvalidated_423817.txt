Would binary logistic regression or multinomial logistic regression be more appropriate for this study?

I am doing a study on the financing behaviour of firms and my dependent variables (financing behaviour) will be binary. Eg. firms that sought debt financing = 1 and firms that did not seek debt financing = 0. If I am wanting to test three dependent variables (firms that sought debt, firms that sought equity, firms that sought debt and equity), what would be the best regression model to use? Would a multinomial regression work or will doing 3 binary regression models function?
