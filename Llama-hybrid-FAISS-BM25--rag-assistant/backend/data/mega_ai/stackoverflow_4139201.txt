How to determine if an HTTP request is asynchronous in Python or Pylons

I can't help but think that this is a duplicate, but if it is, I can't seem to find the doppelganger. I'm just starting to learn Python (focusing on Pylons) and I'd like to know if there is a way to determine if a call to a controller is done asynchronously or not. In PHP it would look something like this: function isAjax() { return isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH'] == 'XMLHttpRequest'; } Is there one that works well for all of Python, or is there perhaps one that works very well only in Pylons? Thanks in advance!
