Java Swing or Windows Forms for desktop application?

I am writing a fat client application that I would ideally like to be cross-platform, but may settle for Windows-only based on the following: I am much stronger in C# than Java (though I have a few years Enterprise Java experience) I haven't done much with either Windows Forms or Java Swing, just toy apps for each, though I'm more comfortable in Windows Forms than Swing I am concerned about the performance of Swing applications (vs. Windows Forms), but I'm wondering if things have improved in the last couple years I am completely open to developing in either platform...no MS or Java snobbery here. In fact, if you want to tell me to do it in Qt, wxWidgets, or something else, I'll listen! If any of you switched from Windows Forms to Swing, what were the biggest hurdles? Was the initial appeal of being cross-platform worth it in the end, or would a faster, less flexible Windows-only app have been better? If you use Java Swing, which IDE do you prefer for drag/drop form layout?
