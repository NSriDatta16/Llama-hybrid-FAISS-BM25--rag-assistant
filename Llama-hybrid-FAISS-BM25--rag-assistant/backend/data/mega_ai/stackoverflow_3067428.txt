At the risk of being a raging finger-wagger: I claim that natural-language-like is a bad goal for programming languages. Specifically, the goal of a natural language utterance is to influence the world so that other human beings want to kiss you rather than punch you; this is very different from the goal of a programming language utterance, which is intended as an unambiguous statement in a well-defined domain that a computer or another person can evaluate. A better question might be: which programming language makes it most difficult to accidentally shoot yourself in the foot? ... which is not at all what you asked, of course.
