Validation Accuracy Increases But Training Accuracy Doesn't

The training accuracy of my model is not improving though validation accuracy improves steadily. This is weird abnormal behaviour and I just can't figure out what's wrong. Here are some graphs to help you give an idea. Training Cost Training Accuracy Evaluation Accuracy Training And Evaluation Accuracy Both Note -- I have not used any deep learning framework. I am running this on a from scratch neural net which is taken from Michael Nielsen's book. Its working fine, I have tested it on other datasets. And the problem which I am working on is a binary Image classification task. Details are below -- Architecture - [3072, 60, 60, 2] -- two hidden layers of 60, 60 neurons Training Data - 9000 images of dimensions (32,32,3) of two classes Validation Data - 500 images of two classes Activation - Sigmoid Learning Rate - 0.005 Mini Batch Size - 10 Epochs - 35 Lambda - 0.0 (No regularization)
