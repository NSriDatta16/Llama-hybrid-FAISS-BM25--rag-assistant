I think there are two things that mark modern web development: Web development frameworks JS libraries, mainly jQuery Although most of the concepts behind today's Web development is not new (MVC structure, AJAX...), re-discovering these led to a shift in how we do things, and brought back the trust of veteran developers in it as an effective and serious medium. I definitely recommend that you dive into Ruby on Rails . Learn the main principals and concepts underlying the framework: reusable modules, elegant MVC structure, templating, RJS... (Alternatively, you might like to check cakephp , the PHP cousin of Rails, which inherits most of the family traits) Eventually, when you play enough time with it, come to like it and understand it well, you'll stumble upon other frameworks that might suit you more (for one reason or another). My experience moving from Rails to Django (Python), then to Google AppEngine (Python or Java) was nice and rewarding (in personal satisfaction, that is). That's for the back-end. Then you come to the vast world of ninja-style-ultra-useful-and-still-fun jQuery (and its numerous plugins) where the joys of web development continues. Enjoy the ride!
