You say you represented the category levels by integers . That is not the same as using dummy encoding! and should not be done . This error probably explains why a decision tree gave much better results. Try again, but now using dummy encoding. You hint in comments about 75+ categories (better to say levels ), why is that a problem? If you represent the design matrix using sparse matrices, storage should not be a problem. If too many parameters compared to $n$ is the problem, use some form of regularization . You could mine Principled way of collapsing categorical variables with many levels? for ideas.
