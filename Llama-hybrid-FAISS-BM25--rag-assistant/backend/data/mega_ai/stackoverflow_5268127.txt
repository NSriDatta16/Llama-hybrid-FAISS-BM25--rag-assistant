The precedence isn't what you expect -- + is being evaluated first. Your code should be in the form: string + (true|false ? "somestring" : "anotherstring") + string For your specific example: MailMessage msg = new MailMessage("DoNotReply@optoma.com", myTbl.Rows[i]["Requester"].ToString().Trim(), subject, "Dear " + myTbl.Rows[i]["Ship_Attention"].ToString() + ", " + body + " Your ISO ID is " + myTbl.Rows[i]["ISO_ID"].ToString() + (Convert.ToInt32(myTbl.Rows[i]["EmailType"]) == 1 ? (" Tracking Number: " + myTbl.Rows[i]["Tracking_No"].ToString()) : ("")) + " Please examine the loaned items for this transaction: " + sw.ToString()); Note that this is a very long expression and should probably be broken down into several statements to make it more readable and maintainable.
