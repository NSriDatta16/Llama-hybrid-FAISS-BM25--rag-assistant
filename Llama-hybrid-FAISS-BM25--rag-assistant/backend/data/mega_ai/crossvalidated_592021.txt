Estimating probability of an event at multiple points in time

I have Machine learning Model which estimates the churn probability in the next 6 months , for a given customer . Is there any mathematical way to estimate the following - 1)Estimate the probability of the event(churn) happening in the next 1 month. 2)Estimate the probability of the event(churn) happening in the next 12 months. The model currently is a decision tree model. Kindly let me know if any clarifications is required. Any guidance would be appreciated. Thanks
