How to relate two averages to find a probability?

I would like to "relate" two arithmetic averages and then use them in Poisson. I currently already use a method, but i'm sure we can do better and that there is a better way. I currently sum the two averages, then divide by two, then use the result in Poisson In the championship matches played so far, Team_A and Team_B have never clashed against each other, but so far the average number of goals scored by Team_A is 1.40 ; Instead the average number of goals conceded by Team_B is 1.80 . I would like to calculate how many probabilit√† there are that Team_A scores 2 goals against Team_B in the next match when the two teams will clash against each other. The two averages are independent, because there is no correlation between the two datasets. An important observation is that the goals scored by Team_A against Team_B will be the same as those that Team_B will concede from Team_A. Is there any better way that can replace addition and division by 2? (my Union) and find a value to use in Poisson? Thank you
