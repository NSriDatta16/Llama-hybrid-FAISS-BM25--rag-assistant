You can ask consumers a question along the following lines: Out of every 100 visits to a coffee house how many times do you visit each one of the following coffee house? Please ensure that the total adds up to 100. A. Option 1 B. Option 2.. etc You can then normalize to get percentage of times each consumer goes to each one of the coffee houses. A simplistic analysis would then assume that each consumer visits a coffee house the same number of times during a year and simply compute the average of the percentages across all consumers to get an estimate of market shares. A more sophisticated analysis would compute the weighted averages with the weights being the the number of times that a consumer goes to coffee shops. You can get the weights as well via a survey question by asking them how many times they visit coffee shops in a year etc. There are other ways to estimate market shares but the above seems to be a simple yet reasonable approach.
