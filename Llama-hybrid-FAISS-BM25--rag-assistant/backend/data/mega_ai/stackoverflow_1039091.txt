Show items by category xml

I have an xml output like this: Frozen Breakfast 1115 Marion Berries, IQF Groceries - Frozen 1117 Peach Cups Groceries - Frozen 1570 Sausage Patty Groceries - Breakfast 1575 French Toast Stix, WG Groceries - Breakfast The items-types are the categories of the items below. item-types/entry/@id relates directly to items/entry/area/item/@id and I'm trying to organize the items in to the categories for my output. So far I am using the following XSL transformation. The problem is it's not working. I believe the problem is the predicate on line 4 of the transformation: [area/item/@id = @id] When I remove this, it shows all the items in every category. Is there a way to show the "Frozen" items in the "Frozen" category and the "Breakfast" items in the "Breakfast" category? Thanks!
