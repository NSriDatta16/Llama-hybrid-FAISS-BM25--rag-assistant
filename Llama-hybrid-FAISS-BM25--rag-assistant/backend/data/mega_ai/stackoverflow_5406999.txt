For basic page-turning animations, the ViewFlipper and ViewAnimator classes -- they can apply any inAnimation and outAnimation you can define in a resource file. However, for full effect you'll want the curved page bulging toward you as it passes by, which I think is beyond the ability of those simple animations (somebody correct me if that's wrong), and you'll want a touch event handler so it happens through the whole dragging motion.
