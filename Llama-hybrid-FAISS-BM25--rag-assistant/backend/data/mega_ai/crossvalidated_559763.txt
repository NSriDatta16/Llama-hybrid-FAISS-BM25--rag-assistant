Binary logistic regresion bonferoni correction

In our study, we applied a bacward stepwise elimination logistic regression analysis between the two groups over a wide variety of variables. There was such a criticism of the referee. Your results, although statistically are approximating an odds ratio of 1. Especially considering the amount of variables you are reporting, it would be good practice with a Bonferoni correction instead of assuming the usual p-value of .05 for rejection of the null- hypothesis. What do you think the referee meant and what kind of solution should be applied?
