Can we use self organizing maps to build a reconstruction model such as autoencoder or generative adversarial network?

MLP and its variants can be used to build a reconstruction model such as conventional autoencoders including many variants and GAN, for example. I wonder if SOM can be a candidate to replace the role of multi-layer perceptrons in this manner. The wiki page says 'The goal of learning in the self-organizing map is to cause different parts of the network to respond similarly to certain input patterns.' Thus I thought the above attempt would be conceptually possible. But how in the details?
