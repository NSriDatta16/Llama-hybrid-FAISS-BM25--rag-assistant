Your second example looks to me like you did a pretty good job (so I wouldn't expect to improve upon it much). Your constraint 1 is pretty typically, but I've never seen constraint 2 before, so you may need a novel solution. See the references for some examples of ordering tables, it may be possible to estimate the hierarchical clustering solutions for the rows and columns and then cut the dendrogram in an arbitrary way to suit your needs. (Or there may be other heuristic solutions based on PCA that will work for your example.) Although those don't focus specifically on the diagonal. A simple technique is to order by row and/or column sums, so just see for your example if there are any rows/columns that stick out. That is easy enough to do in excel ;) Also I would avoid the red-green color scale. Stephen Few has some applicable suggestions here . With only 5 values you may ditch the numbers all together and use a sequential color ramp.
