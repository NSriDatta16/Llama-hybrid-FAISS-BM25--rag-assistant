This is usually symptomatic of an ACL issue. You need to: make sure what user are actually running the Hudson Jobs (and with what CLEARCASE_PRIMARY_GROUP environment value) check the view protection cd m:\advcm3_LAC_FN38_Test cleartool lsview -l -full -pro -cview If the user differ, you need to reprotect the view fix_prot -force -r -chown rightUser -chgrp rightGroup -chmod 775 \\Hostname\CC_Views\MyTestView.vws. fix_prot -force -root -chown rightUser -chgrp rightGroup \\Hostname\CC_Views\MyTestView.vws. fix_prot is in c:/Program Files/rational/clearcase/etc/utils for CC7.0 or less, or c:/Program Files/IBM/RationalSDLC/clearcase/etc/utils for CC7.1 or more. Note: it is strange that a view called advcm3_LAC_FN38_Test has an associated view storage called MyTestView.vws . I would have rather expected a \\Hostname\CC_Views\advcm3_LAC_FN38_Test.vws .
