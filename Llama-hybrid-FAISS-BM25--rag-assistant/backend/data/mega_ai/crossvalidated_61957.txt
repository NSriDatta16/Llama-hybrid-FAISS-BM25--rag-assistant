Understanding the multilevel / random-effects beta-binomial regression model

Suppose we have an outcome variable $y_{ji}$ which is a count of behaviors performed by group $j$ in round $i$, for $j = 1,...,n$ and $i = 1,...,8$. The outcome $y_{ji}$ counts are non-independent within each group $j$. Possible values for $y$ are bounded between 0 and 12, and because the behaviors appear to follow an almost "all or nothing" kind of pattern, the outcome is a u-shaped distribution: My question is: how should we set up the beta-binomial model when the data has a multilevel / random-effects component? I was planning on modelling the outcome data $y_{ji}$ with a Beta-binomial($m$, $\alpha$, $\beta$) distribution, where $y_{ji}$ are binomial observations with a number of trials $m = 12$, and where the probabilities $\pi_1,...,\pi_n$ follow a Beta($\alpha$, $\beta$) distribution. This way the U-shaped outcome distribution could be modeled with $0 In a linear random-effects model I would model a random intercept (or more) varying by group, and this would account for the non-independent error terms within each group's 8 rounds of behavior. Is it possible to do that with a beta-binomial model? Here is what I've tried so far: hglm A hierarchical / random-effects GLMM package in R which says it can model beta-binomial by modelling the fixed-effects portion with binomial(link=logit), and the "random-effects" portion with Beta(link=logit). question : If I understand correctly, the random-effects portion is modelling the dispersion parameter (they call it $\alpha$...). Is this "random-effect" the same as the random effect in a HLM / MLM / linear random-effects model, in that it would account for the within-group non-independence? aod Another package that has an explicit betabin function that models the beta-binomial mean parameter $\mu$ as a function of any number of explanatory variables. The dispersion parameter $\phi$ can only be modeled with one explanatory variable. question : is $\phi$ being treated as the "random effect"? If so, I have the same question as above. glmmADMB Dr. Bolker is still working on implementing the beta-binomial, so I can't use this. bayesian Perhaps I should just model it myself? Thank you all for any help (pointers to papers or books would be appreciated).
