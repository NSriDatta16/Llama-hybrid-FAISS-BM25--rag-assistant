Performance of FileResultPath (Image path) in Asp.Net MVC?

I have a Mvc Action which sends the 'FilePathResult' for a 'jpeg' image as shown below. public ActionResult GetImage() { string outputImagePath = Server.MapPath(@"Images/OutputImage.jpeg"); return File(outputImagePath , "image/jpeg"); } Now this takes significantly higher time compared to referencing the Image path using the direct Url . The time taken is as shown below. http://WebSite/Controller/GetImage takes 500ms http://WebSite/Images/OutputImage.jpeg takes 10ms Is this normal or I am missing something here? Update: This is average time taken. I am using the following environment. .Net 4, Asp.Net 2.0, IIS 7.5, Ninject
