Eclipse with PyDev has been a great combination for me. Great editing experience and more importantly a good debugger. Pylint is supported as well, this will save you lots of headaches. This is all open source too. If you want to do IronPython development though I would add SharpDevelop 3.1.1. It has a drag & drop GUI form designer and overall is very much like Visual Studio, except it's free of course.
