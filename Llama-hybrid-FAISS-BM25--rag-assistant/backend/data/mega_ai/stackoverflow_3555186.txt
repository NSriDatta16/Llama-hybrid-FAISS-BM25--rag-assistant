Get character with most occurences in a string

I've been trying to wrap my head around this for some time now, but haven't been able to come up with an elegant solution. The problem: I have a string with different characters ("ABDDEEDDC") and I need to know which character occurs the most. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Cheers, Niko
