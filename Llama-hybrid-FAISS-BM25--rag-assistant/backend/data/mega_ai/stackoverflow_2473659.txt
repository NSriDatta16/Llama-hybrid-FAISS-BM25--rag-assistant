R: What are the best functions to deal with concatenating and averaging values in a data.frame?

I have a data.frame from this code: my_df = data.frame("read_time" = c("2010-02-15", "2010-02-15", "2010-02-16", "2010-02-16", "2010-02-16", "2010-02-17"), "OD" = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5) ) which produces this: > my_df read_time OD 1 2010-02-15 0.1 2 2010-02-15 0.2 3 2010-02-16 0.1 4 2010-02-16 0.2 5 2010-02-16 0.4 6 2010-02-17 0.5 I want to average the OD column over each distinct read_time (notice some are replicated others are not) and I also would like to calculate the standard deviation, producing a table like this: > my_df read_time OD stdev 1 2010-02-15 0.15 0.05 5 2010-02-16 0.3 0.1 6 2010-02-17 0.5 0 Which are the best functions to deal with concatenating such values in a data.frame?
