The only simple description of this method I found is given by "Statistically Comparing Phenotypic Change with a Permutation Procedure" Collyer, M. L., & Adams, D. C. (2007). Analysis of Two-State Multivariate Phenotypic Change in Ecological Studies. Ecology, 88(3), 683â€“692. Paragraph "Statistically Comparing Phenotypic Change with a Permutation Procedure Vectors" From my understanding the method works as follow: If two models M0 and M1 differs only for the effect to be tested, (M0 does not contain the effect) then the residuals of M0 contain the variability that would be explained by the considered effect. Thus we can use M0 to build the null distribution of the coefficient(s) of the effect in the M1 model: The fitted values of M0 + The residuals of M0 = the original data. The fitted values of M0 + The permuted residuals of M0 = the data from which the variability that would be explained by the considered effect have been randomized. Refitting M1 on this partly randomized dataset allows to build the null distribution of the considered effect that is present in M1 but not in M0. This is my understanding of the "residual permutation procedure".
