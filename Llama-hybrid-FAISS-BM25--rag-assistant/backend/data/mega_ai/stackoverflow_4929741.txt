geolocation is bad, mmkay? the internet is location-agnostic, and i have never seen geolocation used for something non-trivial-non-evil. that is, the only good applications i've seen (language selection) were trivial (could just as easily be a dropdown). many evil applications exist (this video not available in your country, targeting my physical location for ads and tracking) we can't discourage something like this from existing, but we should push to make it illegal or at least socially unacceptable to use.
