A good tool that I've used for LALR is the GOLD Parsing System . It's free, the grammer is Backus-Naur Form, and there are multiple examples, including engines written in C#, VB.NET, Java and others. This lets you write a grammer, compile the grammer to a file, and then use an engine to parse the grammer. As recommended above, I would recommend targeting a byte code of some kind, like IL. This will allow you to leverage the enormous amounts of existing frameworks. Good Luck
