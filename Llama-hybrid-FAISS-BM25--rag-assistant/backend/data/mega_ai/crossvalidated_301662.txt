There is a recently developed approach to such problems: Generalized Low Rank Models . One of papers that use this technique is even called PCA on a Data Frame . PCA can be posed like this: For $n$ x $m$ matrix $M$ find $n$ x $k$ matrix $\hat{X}$ and $k$ x $m$ matrix $\hat{Y}$ (this encodes rank $k$ e constraint implicitly) such that $\hat{X}, \hat{Y}$ = $\underset{X, Y}{argmin} \| M - XY \|_F^2$. The 'generalized' from GLRM stands for changing $\| \cdot \|_F^2$ to something else and adding a regularization term.
