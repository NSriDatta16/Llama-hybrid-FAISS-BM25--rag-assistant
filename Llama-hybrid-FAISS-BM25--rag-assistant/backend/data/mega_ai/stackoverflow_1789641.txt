Complex forms in Django - what apps and Django/Python features should I look at?

There are a lot of complex forms in my project and I keep getting the feeling that I could be coding them much more elegantly and simply. So my question is what are some good apps and practices that might help me? Specifically, I'm thinking about situations when I need to do stuff like: edit/add more than one object via one form (example: Lets say I have a Partnership model and a Person model - every partnership object is related to two people. Now lets say I want to edit the partnership and the two people in the partnership simultaneously.) deal with many to many relationships - particularly those that have extra data associated "wizard-like" forms (as in there's a couple of pages/steps and the user has to get through all of them before anything gets saved to the database) giving suggestions for what to write into a form field based on what's in the database (I guess this is an AJAX question really, but I'm interested in whether there are some django apps that simplify this somehow) Solutions to any other more complex form scenarios also welcome. The above are problems I've already come across, but I'd like to generally find out about what are some best practices with forms.
