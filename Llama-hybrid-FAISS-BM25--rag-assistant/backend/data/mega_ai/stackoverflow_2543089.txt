I had some similar case, and I triggered a refresh of the parent page with javascript. Child When the user clicked "save" in the popup, the action is submitted to the child with POST, which updates the parent bean, and then redisplay the child page with some javascript: window.opener.doRefresh(); window.close(); This gave the illusion that when the user click on "save", the popup is closed directly. You can maybe use a similar trick in your case. Parent function doRefresh() { if(document.forms[0].onsubmit) { document.forms[0].submit(); } } function openChild() { window.open("path_to_child.jsf","_blank",""); return false; } If I remember well, I couldn't use location.reload to refresh the page. Either because reload may resubmit an old form, or because it issues a GET request which JSF doesn't like that much. So I was submitting the form programmaticaly. This essentially achieves the same. This solution was not a masterpiece of elegance, but well, it worked for me :)
