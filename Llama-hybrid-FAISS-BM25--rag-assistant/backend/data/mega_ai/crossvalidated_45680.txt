Yes, you can generate random samples from $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ where the associated probabilities $f(x_i)$ are known up to a multiplicative constant (the constant of integration (COI) using MCMC. However, you do have to be able to calculate $f(x_i)$ (without the COI) for all $i$ should $x_i$ be proposed. If your sample is large enough relative to $n$, you won't be saving yourself anything by not just calculating the COI by summing $f$ over all $i$. Here's an example in R that does this for $n = 10$, using an independence sampler for the proposal (which simplifies the calculation of the acceptance probability $\alpha$). The proposal is for an index $j \in \{1, \dots, n\}$, although what is stored as the sampled value is the value of $x$ associated with the current index $i$ (if the proposal is rejected) or the accepted proposal $j$. # Example x, fx x df Value Sample.Freq True.Prob 1 a 0.0009 0.0009775 2 b 0.0022 0.0019550 3 c 0.0040 0.0039101 4 d 0.0093 0.0078201 5 e 0.0166 0.0156403 6 f 0.0345 0.0312805 7 g 0.0678 0.0625611 8 h 0.1282 0.1251222 9 i 0.2443 0.2502444 10 j 0.4922 0.5004888
