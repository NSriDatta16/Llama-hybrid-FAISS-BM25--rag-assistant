Existing Drag-and-Drop Application/Framework in Javascript

Does anyone here know of a Javascript application (something similar to Lightbox, only not for images) for drag-and-drop, preferably running on the Prototype Javascript Framework? Alternatively, I'm open to using jQuery or something else that's supported by the major browsers.
