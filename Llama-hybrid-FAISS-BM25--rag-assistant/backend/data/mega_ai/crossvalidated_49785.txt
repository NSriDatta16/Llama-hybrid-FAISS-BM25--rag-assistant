When would a neural network outperform an OLS estimate?

The optimization task is to find the operator $F(x_1, x_2, ...,x_n) \rightarrow y$. Question: Under which conditions should NN provide better results than LS (in terms of mean square fit error)? Specifically, I mean the two approaches in MATLAB (assuming column vectors): NN net = fitnet(num_hidden_layers); net = train(net, in_train', out_train'); out_test = net(in_test')'; Least Squares: $y = w_0 + \sum_i{x_i*w_i}$ w = in_train \ out_train; out_test = in_test * w; Taking into account that NN approach has thresholds as non-linear operators, I tried to add non-Gaussian noise, and non-linear input - out artificial dependencies. But couldn't find conditions in which NN would be better than LS.
