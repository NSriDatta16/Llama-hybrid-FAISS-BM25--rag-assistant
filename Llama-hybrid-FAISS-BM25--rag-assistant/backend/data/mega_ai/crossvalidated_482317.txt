You can use multilevel modelling . I assume you the matrix you showed in your example is data for one particular participant and you have the data like that for individuals in your study (not only average values). If that is the case, you can treat rounds (or repeated measures), days, and participants as different levels of variation of the response time. Different participants have different response time, but if there is some indication of either habituation or fatigue, you should also see additional significant effect of either day or round, respectively.
