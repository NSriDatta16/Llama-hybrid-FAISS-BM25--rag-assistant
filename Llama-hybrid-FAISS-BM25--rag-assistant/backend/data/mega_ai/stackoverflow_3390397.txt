I've not heard of this - sounds like a BUG. May be best to choose the more pragmatic approach, by splitting the move operation into FO_COPY, followed by FO_DELETE (assuming the FO_COPY operation succeeded). Additionally, you might gain some efficiency if your implementation could detect when the source and destination volumes are the same. In this case, you should be able to revert to FO_MOVE. A move operation on the same volume generally distills down to a rename + metadata move.
