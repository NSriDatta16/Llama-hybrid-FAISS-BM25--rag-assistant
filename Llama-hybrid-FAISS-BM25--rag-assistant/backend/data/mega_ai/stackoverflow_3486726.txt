You can use localStorage on HTML5-supporting browsers (IE8, FF3+, Chrome, Safari 4+, Opera 9+). You can fall back to userData for IE6 and IE7. That gives you a guaranteed minimum of 64 KB of data on all platforms (minimum userData size). There's a library that encapsulates the various strategies for storing data locally: PersistJS I use this to store client-side state that doesn't need to be sent to the server with every request (e.g. resizable panel dimensions). I don't think it could offer any additional security though, because any attacker that can decrypt the SSL stream can get at your data, because they can observe all your javascript code.
