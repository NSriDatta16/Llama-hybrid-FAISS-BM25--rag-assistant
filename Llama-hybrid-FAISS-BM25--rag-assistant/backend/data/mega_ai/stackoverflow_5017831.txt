There might be physical disk fragmentation issues. On one server, the database files are stored in consecutive blocks/sectors, while on the other the file is scattered all ove the platter. (Likely to happen if you have a db grow by 10% chunks to ginormous sizes over weeks or months, and then back it up and restore it on a mostly empty disk.)
