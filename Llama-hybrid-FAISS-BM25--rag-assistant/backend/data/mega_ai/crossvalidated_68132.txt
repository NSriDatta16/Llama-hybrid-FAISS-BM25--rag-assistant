Descriptive statistics for dates

I have a series of timestamps (expressed as Unix time) representing certain dates when an event happened. I want to analyze these timestamps to find information such as: average time between events find out if the timestamps are evenly distributed or tend to group in periodic clumps if the timestamps do indeed group around periodic clumps, find the center of these clumps. Can you please tell me how I can compute these? Is there an R package for descriptive statistics for dates (or other statistical software out there)? For issue 1. I can just write a for loop to compute the average time between events, but issue 2. and 3. are more tricky.
