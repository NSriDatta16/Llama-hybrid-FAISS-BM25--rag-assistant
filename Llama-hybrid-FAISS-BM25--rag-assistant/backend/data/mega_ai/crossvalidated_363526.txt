How can I find the expected value of these dependent values?

Okay so there's a game, where you have 1 percent chance of winning an alpha pack and if you fail you your chance goes up by 3 percent. How would you calculate the expected value? I've only taken an AP stats class so the first thought would be do find the expected value from each percentage and average them Define: $N$ as the number of plays until you win. Let the probability of winning on the $n$th play be $p_n$. Then $p_1 = 0.01$ and $p_n = p_{n-1} + 0.03,\; n \ge 2$. Notice $p_{34} = 1$. Objective: Find $E[N]$
