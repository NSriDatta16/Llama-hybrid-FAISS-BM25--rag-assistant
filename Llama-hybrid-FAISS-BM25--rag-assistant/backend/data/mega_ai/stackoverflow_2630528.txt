How to get the volume of MP3 file?

I need to get the average volume of the mp3 file in dB. This must be that when listening to multiple files automatically adjust the volume. In this case, the files themselves do not need to normalize. Ideally, I need to get a result in the command line, but fit and just an algorithm.
