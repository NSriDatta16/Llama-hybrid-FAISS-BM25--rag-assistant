Ridge regression â€“ Bayesian interpretation

I have heard that ridge regression can be derived as the mean of a posterior distribution, if the prior is adequately chosen. Is the intuition that the constraints as set on the regression coefficients by the prior (e.g. standard normal distributions around 0) are identical / replace the penalty set on the squared size of the coefficients? Does the prior have to be Gaussian for this equivalence to hold?
