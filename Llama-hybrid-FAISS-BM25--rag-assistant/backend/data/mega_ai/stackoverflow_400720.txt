Have you tried simply playing the sound? I suspect this is automatic functionality on the part of the SDK. edit: according to this question , you can fade the ipod sound out but not back in. (I'm surprised this functionality isn't automatic and default behaviour. But then I've always found the elegance of the apple APIs to be inversely proportional to the elegance of the interface :-)
