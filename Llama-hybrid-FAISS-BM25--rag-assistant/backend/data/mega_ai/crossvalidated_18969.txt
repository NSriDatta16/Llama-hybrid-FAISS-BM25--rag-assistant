Are real and imaginary components of frequency element of fft correlated?

I want to use model-based clustering to classify 1,225 time series (24 periods each). I have decomposed these time series using the fast Fourier transform and selected the harmonics that explain at least a threshold percentage of time series variance for all time series in the sample. I want to do model-based clustering on the real and imaginary parts for each transform element of a give time series because it would potentially save me from having to account for temporal autocorrelation in model based clustering across periods of a time series. I know that each complex element of the fast Fourier transform is independent from other elements, but I do not know if the imaginary and real parts of the output for a given output element are independent. I would like to know because if they were, it would allow me to maintain the default assumption of the Mclust package in R for model-based clustering that the variables analyzed have a multivariate Gaussian distribution. NOTE: The input is real-valued, and I have converted from a two-sided to a one-sided spectrum by removing redundant frequency elements and multiplying the positive frequencies (other than the mean component) by two per the advice I got from another StackOverflow answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8264530/how-do-i-calculate-amplitude-and-phase-angle-of-fft-output-from-real-valued-in
