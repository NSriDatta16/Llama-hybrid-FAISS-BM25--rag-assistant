While I try to run my Flex Profiler I got this error message: In the flash application I got the following exception: Error #2044: Unhandled securityError:. text=Error #2048: Security sandbox violation: file:///C|%2Fwork%2Flabsense%2Fbranches%2Frel%5F1%5F2%5F5%5FEA%2Fsources%2Fui%2F.metadata%2F.plugins%2Fcom.adobe.flash.profiler%2FProfilerAgent.swf?host=localhost&port=9999 cannot load data from localhost:9999. at ProfilerAgent()[C:\SVN\branches\3.2.0\modules\profiler3\as\ProfilerAgent.as:127] And in the flex Profiler console (at the eclipse) I got : Socket timeout. I am run on windows vista, Flex builder: 3.2 Flash debugger: 10,0,22,87 Things that I have done to resolve this issue: Switch the connection port of the profiler to 9998 (and back) Remove and reinstall the flash debugger player. Install flex builder 3.2 (instead of 3.0) Delete all the enters in the mm.cfg file Add enter to the mm.cfg: PreloadSwf=C:\work\labsense\Sources\ui\.metadata\.plugins\com.adobe.flash.profiler\ProfilerAgent.swf?host=localhost&port=9999 or PreloadSwf=C:\work\labsense\Sources\ui\.metadata\.plugins\com.adobe.flash.profiler\ProfilerAgent.swf?host=localhost&port=9998 or PreloadSwf=C:/work/labsense/Sources/ui/.metadata/.plugins/com.adobe.flash.profiler/ProfilerAgent.swf?host=localhost&port=9999 or with spaces: PreloadSwf=C: \ work \ labsense \ Sources \ ui \ .metadata \ .plugins \ com.adobe.flash.profiler \ ProfilerAgent.swf?host=localhost&port=9999 or C:\work\labsense\Sources\ui\.metadata\.plugins\com.adobe.flash.profiler\ProfilerAgent.swf? or add all or some of the enters: TraceOutputFileName=C:\Users\zivo\AppData\Roaming\Macromedia\Flash Player\Logs\flashlog.txt ErrorReportingEnable=1 MaxWarnings=0 TraceOutputFileEnable=1 ProfilingFileOutputEnable=1 Turn on and off the vista firewall Add exception for port 9999 in the vista firewall Try to run the profiler SWF separately Same result. Try one last thing: Because I have expreins problem little bit similar before with the flash debugger, the resolution then was: Right click on flash player (debugger), choose “Debugger”, choose “other machine” add “127.0.0.1” click ok then, it solve the issue (but apparently he connect to the debugger with host 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost (which is a same) I now add to the mm.cfg file, the follow entry: PreloadSwf=C:/work/labsense/branches/rel_1_2_5_EA/sources/ui/.metadata/.plugins/com.adobe.flash.profiler/ProfilerAgent.swf?host=127.0.0.1&port=9999 Then, after saving, I run the profiler, and its work!! And the reasons for all this was: Some program change the file C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts to: # Copyright (c) 1993-2006 Microsoft Corp. # # This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows. # # This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each # entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should # be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name. # The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one # space. # # Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual # lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol. # # For example: # # 102.54.94.97 rhino.acme.com # source server # 38.25.63.10 x.acme.com # x client host ::1 localhost 127.0.0.1 iDBO # LMS GENERATED LINE This means that localhost is not lead to 127.0.0.1!!! Fixing is easy: # ::1 localhost # 127.0.0.1 iDBO # LMS GENERATED LINE 127.0.0.1 localhost Instead (remark the problem and fix the problem
