WIX property value substitution and CAQuietExec

So far, I'm NOT finding WIX to be my favorite most intuitive, easy-to-use, language/system. I created a custom dialog, entered data, and see the values in the install log. MSI (c) (C8:A4) [14:42:37:137]: PROPERTY CHANGE: Modifying VARRADIOBUTTONENVIRONMENT property. Its current value is 'Dev'. Its new value: 'QA'. MSI (c) (C8:A4) [14:42:41:448]: PROPERTY CHANGE: Modifying VARTEXTSETTINGSFILENAME property. Its current value is 'C:\Path\SettingsFileGenerator.xml'. Its new value: 'Test1234.txt'. Later, when it comes time to use the value I see this: Action ended 14:42:43: InstallFinalize. Return value 1. MSI (s) (BC:F8) [14:42:43:676]: Doing action: QtExec1 Action 14:42:43: QtExec1. Action start 14:42:43: QtExec1. MSI (s) (BC:F4) [14:42:43:682]: Invoking remote custom action. DLL: C:\Windows\Installer\MSIC4A7.tmp, Entrypoint: CAQuietExec MSI (s) (BC!BC) [14:42:43:690]: PROPERTY CHANGE: Deleting QtExecCmdLine property. Its current value is '"[INSTALLLOCATION]XmlPreprocess.exe /i:web.config /e:[VARRADIOBUTTONENVIRONMENT] "'. CAQuietExec: Error 0x8007007b: Command failed to execute. CAQuietExec: Error 0x8007007b: CAQuietExec Failed Action ended 14:42:43: QtExec1. Return value 3. Action ended 14:42:43: INSTALL. Return value 3. Property(S): StartIIS7ConfigTransaction = ScaConfigureIIs And at the end when it dumps all the properties it shows this: Property(S): VARRADIOBUTTONENVIRONMENT = QA Property(S): VARTEXTSETTINGSFILENAME = Test1234.txt Property(S): VerifyCurrentPropValueOfEnv = [VARRADIOBUTTONENVIRONMENT] Here are fragments of my code. I just changed property ids to all-caps and added the secure="yes" based on another post I saw. I've tried with and without the Secure="yes". Dev C:\Path\SettingsFileGenerator.xml ...then later... At the end of the install, I see that XmlPreProcess.exe is installed in the installation directory. Questions: Is there something I'm doing wrong to get the values to substitute? I'm using CAQuietExec because I was told it would log better errors and echo the output of the command window to the install log. I don't really care about not seeing the command window. I'm not sure how to find out what this means: "CAQuietExec: Error 0x8007007b: Command failed to execute.". I can't tell if this is a WIX error trying to call XmlPreprocess.exe or if it got into XmlPreprocess and then threw the error. Thanks, Neal Walters
