LARS vs coordinate descent for the lasso

What are the pros and cons of using LARS [1] versus using coordinate descent for fitting L1-regularized linear regression? I am mainly interested in performance aspects (my problems tend to have N in the hundreds of thousands and p edit: Since I've posted the question, chl has kindly pointed out a paper [2] by Friedman et al where coordinate descent is shown to be considerably faster than other methods. If that's the case, should I as a practitioner simply forget about LARS in favour of coordinate descent? [1] Efron, Bradley; Hastie, Trevor; Johnstone, Iain and Tibshirani, Robert (2004).
