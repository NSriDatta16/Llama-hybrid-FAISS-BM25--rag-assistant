The idea that p-values overstate the evidence against the null hypothesis is partly due to a misunderstanding about the nature of p-values (as others have mentioned). A p-value can be regarded as a measure to address the hypothesis testing question: Is the data consistent with the null hypothesis? Bayesian posterior probabilities are Bayesian answers to a different question: Given the data, what is the relative plausibility of each hypothesis? The key word here is relative. It should hardly be surprising then that answers to such different questions can differ, even within the one school. In short, P-values are about consistency with one hypothesis, and not about the relative plausibility of two hypotheses.
