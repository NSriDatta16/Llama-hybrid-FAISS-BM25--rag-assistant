Human activity recognition using smartphone data set problem

I'm new to this community and hopefully my question will well fit in here. As part of my undergraduate data analytics course I have choose to do the project on human activity recognition using smartphone data sets. As far as I'm concern this topic relates to Machine Learning and Support Vector Machines. I'm not well familiar with this technologies yet so I will need some help. I have decided to follow this project idea (first project on the top) The project goal is determine what activity a person is engaging in (e.g., WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) from data recorded by a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the subject's waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the data includes 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. All the data set is given in one folder with some description and feature labels. The data is divided for 'test' and 'train' files in which data is represented in this format: 2.5717778e-001 -2.3285230e-002 -1.4653762e-002 -9.3840400e-001 -9.2009078e-001 -6.6768331e-001 -9.5250112e-001 -9.2524867e-001 -6.7430222e-001 -8.9408755e-001 -5.5457721e-001 -4.6622295e-001 7.1720847e-001 6.3550240e-001 7.8949666e-001 -8.7776423e-001 -9.9776606e-001 -9.9841381e-001 -9.3434525e-001 -9.7566897e-001 -9.4982365e-001 -8.3047780e-001 -1.6808416e-001 -3.7899553e-001 2.4621698e-001 5.2120364e-001 -4.8779311e-001 4.8228047e-001 -4.5462113e-002 2.1195505e-001 -1.3489443e-001 1.3085848e-001 -1.4176313e-002 -1.0597085e-001 7.3544013e-002 -1.7151642e-001 4.0062978e-002 7.6988933e-002 -4.9054573e-001 -7.0900265e-001 And that's only a very small sample of what the file contain. I don't really know what this data represents and how can be interpreted. Also for analyzing, classification and clustering of the data, what tools will I need to use? Is there any way I can put this data into excel with labels included and for example use R or python to extract sample data and work on this? Any hints/tips would be much appreciated.
