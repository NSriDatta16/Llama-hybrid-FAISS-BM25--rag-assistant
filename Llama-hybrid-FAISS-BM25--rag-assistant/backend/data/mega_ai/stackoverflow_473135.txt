In a plugin fragment for linux, I use: Bundle-NativeCode: librptlc.so; osname = linux; processor=x86 And in the main plugin I use: if (OS.equals(Platform.OS_LINUX)) { System.loadLibrary("rptlc"); } This should work within one plugin too. I seem to remember having some problems with libraries in a sub folder in the jar, but I'm not sure why this would be the case. I just stuck to having the libraries in the root of a plugin fragment instead, which works for me. You could also try getting the file system path of the library (not sure if that's easy) and loading it using: libraryPath = "C:\eclipse\bundles\123\librptlc.so"; System.load(libraryPath);
