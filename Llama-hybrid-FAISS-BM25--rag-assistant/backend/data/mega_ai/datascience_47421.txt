One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network

Can someone explain how 'One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network' works. I do understand the 2-D for image but for 1-D how is the filer created. is it fixed 1-D filter within a specific time interval or the operation is the same as we convolve a signal with a filter in signal processing y = f*x
