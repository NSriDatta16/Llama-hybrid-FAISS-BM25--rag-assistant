Filtering MySQL query result according to a interval of timestamp

Let's say I have a very large MySQL table with a timestamp field. So I want to filter out some of the results not to have too many rows because I am going to print them. Let's say the timestamps are increasing as the number of rows increase and they are like every one minute on average . (Does not necessarily to be exactly once every minute, ex: 2010-06-07 03: 55 :14, 2010-06-07 03: 56 :23, 2010-06-07 03: 57 :01, 2010-06-07 03: 57 :51, 2010-06-07 03: 59 :21 ...) As I mentioned earlier I want to filter out some of the records, I do not have specific rule to do that, but I was thinking to filter out the rows according to the timestamp interval. After I achieve filtering I want to have a result set which has a certain amount of minutes between timestamps on average (ex: 2010-06-07 03: 20 :14, 2010-06-07 03: 29 :23, 2010-06-07 03: 38 :01, 2010-06-07 03: 49 :51, 2010-06-07 03: 59 :21 ...) Last but not least, the operation should not take incredible amount of time, I need this functionality to be almost fast as a normal select operation. Do you have any suggestions?
