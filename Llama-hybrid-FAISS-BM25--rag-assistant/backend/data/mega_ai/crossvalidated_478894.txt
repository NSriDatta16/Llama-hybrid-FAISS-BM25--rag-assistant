Making predictions manually from a mixed effects model

I have a mixed effects logistic regression model that is a bit more complicated than I've done in the past and just want to know if I'm thinking things correctly. I am crossing B_A (a within-subject continuous predictor) with its quadratic term (B_A2) and two between-subject categorical variables effects coded (sex e[-0.5, 0.5] and mag e[-0.5, 0.5]). I am trying to identify the predicted values of B_A by computing the equation by hand, but am unsure if I'm interpreting the interactions correctly. Below is a post of my attempt What I'm most unsure about is, for example, the sex:b_a condition: do I multiply all values of B_A*-2.06 and -0.5 (since that is the condition I'm looking for)? Thank you for helping me understand.
