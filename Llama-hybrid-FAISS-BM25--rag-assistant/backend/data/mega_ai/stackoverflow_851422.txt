How would you add a Group Feature like iChat's to your Core Data App?

I am Developing A Core Data App, and would like to add a feature like the Groups feature in iChat to my App. The Feature would be displayed in the table with normal table rows and more groups could be created. Other rows of the table could be dragged into the Group and the Group could be collapsed and opened. What code would I need to do this and Is it possible?
