In my opinion, any policy that achieves the optimal value is an optimal policy. Since the optimal value function for a given MDP is unique, this optimal value function actually defines a equivalent class over the policy space, i.e., those whose value is optimal are actually equivalent. In other words, although optimal policies may be different to each other (for a given state they may take different action sequences to achieve the same optimal value), their value function is the same. In this sense, no matter which state you are at, as the optimal value for this state is the same, the policies achieving this optimal value are essentially the same and they are all optimal policy at this state.
