ARIMA(X) Validation

I'm in the process of developing a new spark-based ARIMA(X) tool, and have reached the point where I need to know whether my coefficient estimates and forecasts are sensible. I can compare my results to R on the same data set, but, as my implementation is distributed while R's is in-memory, I think it's reasonable to assume that there will be some slight differences in our estimates. What I don't know is how different is too different for the coefficient estimates and forecasts? Is there a standard approach to evaluating to reasonableness of a new implementation of time series analytics?
