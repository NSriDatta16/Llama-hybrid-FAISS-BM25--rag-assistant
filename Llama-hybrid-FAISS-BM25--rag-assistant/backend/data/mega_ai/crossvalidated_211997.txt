Have you thought about using Logistic Regression? It is very useful when dealing with binary class variables. It has also been known to work well on large datasets and can be easily implemented in R. Aside from that, how are you handling your data? Do you split it into training and testing datasets? Have you performed cross-validation? If you are able to determine if your models perform well on training data, but not so well on testing data (or the other way around), then you may have a case of overfitting/underfitting in your models.
