Interpretation of odds ratios individually and in the interaction?

I have run a logistic regression model fit The odds ratio for x1, x2 are significant (1.04, 1.18) and the odds ratio of the interaction is significant and 0.99. How is it possible that x1, x2 to increase the probability for y = 1 and their interaction to decrease it? I have made the plot how the slope of x1 on y changes with the values of x2 and I see: and when I plot how the slope of x2 on y changes with the values of x1 and I see: Can you help me to explain this?
