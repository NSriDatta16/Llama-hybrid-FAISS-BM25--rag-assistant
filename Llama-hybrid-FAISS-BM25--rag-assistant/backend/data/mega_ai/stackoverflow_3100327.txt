Trigger your drag from the on the "Preview" mouse events rather than the regular ones, and set the Handled flag in PreviewMouseMove when doing a drag so the RichTextBox never sees the MouseMove. For example, you might record the mouse down location in PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown, then if you receive a PreviewMouseMove with the left button still down you can set e.Handled=true and then call DoDragDrop in a dispatcher callback. The reason this works is that RichTextBox uses the regular (non-preview) mouse events.
