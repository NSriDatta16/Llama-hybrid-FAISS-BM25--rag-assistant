How to phrase the results of a t-test?

At work, a team I'm on is researching the differences between majority-African American census tracts and all other census tracts in my county. Here is an example of one of the T-tests that I ran in Excel: The mean of the median year-built for African American census tracts is 1976, as opposed to other census tract structures having a build date of around 1970. Obviously p In [name] county, statistically, majority-African American census tracts have newer structures. Or am I only able to use the phrasing below? Statistically, majority-African American census tracts have a different age of structures from non-majority-African American tracts, and on average they are newer. I have about 12 attributes that the t-tests found statistically different, but I just need to know how to represent my findings clearly without being disingenuous with my conclusions.
