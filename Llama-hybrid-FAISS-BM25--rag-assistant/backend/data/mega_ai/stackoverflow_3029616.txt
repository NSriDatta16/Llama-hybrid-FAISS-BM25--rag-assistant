I would strongly encourage using the normal pattern for thread-local storage, described in this MSDN article . When you use [ThreadStatic], what matters is whether or not a threadpool thread cleans up the TLS variables when it terminates. There isn't any suggestion in the MSDN docs that it doesn't. It wouldn't be hard to implement, it only has to call the TlsFree() API function. I wrote a little test app, no evidence of any leak.
