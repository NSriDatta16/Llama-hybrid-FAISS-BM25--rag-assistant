From a android UI-guideline point of view, it is weird to offer the user an another mean than the one in the device's settings to change the locale. If your application invoke an another application, which locale will use this application? Also I am not sure, there is a mean to browse the resources after the build process, the way resources are processed, organized and packed is a black-box, no application should try to rely on a given organization/format because this could change in the future.
