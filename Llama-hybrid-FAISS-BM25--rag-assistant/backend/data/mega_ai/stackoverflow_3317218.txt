Create a view for the model

I am reading "Pragmatic Agile Web Development with Rails (2th ed)" and trying examples from this book. But when I am trying one of examples I have got error. So: I have created a model for a product ruby script/generate model product Filled the fields: class CreateProducts Generated the DB: rake db:migrate Next I have creaded the view: ruby script/generate controller admin Added line to the view: class AdminController Have runned the server and have got error: http://localhost:3000/admin undefined method `scaffold' for AdminController:Class I have googled and found this solution: ruby script/generate scaffold product title:string description:text image_url:string But I am not sure that it is a right way. What is the 'true way' to create a view for the product table ?
