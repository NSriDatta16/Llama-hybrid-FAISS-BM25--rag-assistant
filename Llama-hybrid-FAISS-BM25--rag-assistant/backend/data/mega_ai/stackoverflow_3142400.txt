Split a paragraph into lines in ZSH

How can I take a multi-line string in zsh, and split it into an array of strings that are a single line each? Specifically I want to take the output of cal June 2010 Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 and turn it into (" June 2010 " "Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa" " 1 2 3 4 5" " 6 7 8 9 10 11 12" "13 14 15 16 17 18 19" "20 21 22 23 24 25 26" "27 28 29 30") Which is a zsh array. My ultimate goal is then to take the output of another command and put them side by side, so if i had a b c and d e f I would end up with a d b e c f
