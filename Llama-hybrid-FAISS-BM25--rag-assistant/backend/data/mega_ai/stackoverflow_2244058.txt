Empirically. Record the actual arrival times vs scheduled arrival times, and compute the mean and standard deviation for each. When considering possible routes, calculate the probability that a given leg will arrive late enough to make you miss the next leg, and make the average wait time P(on time)*T(first bus) + (1-P(on time))*T(second bus) . This gets more complicated if you have to consider multiple legs, each of which could be late independently, and multiple possible next legs you could miss, but the general principle holds.
