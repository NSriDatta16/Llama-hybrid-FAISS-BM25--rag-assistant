Can you compare loss values of Neural Networks that use different loss functions?

I've been training neural networks for a text classification task. Since I'm new to this, I switched Loss functions when moving onto a different model at some point. Can I measure these models' Test loss against each other. Can I compute Test loss on these models using the same loss function 'retroactively'?. Edit: Say I had models A and B, I used a different loss function for both of them. I wanted to know if I could use a loss function C, perhaps different to either used by the 2 models, to evaluate them both after training
