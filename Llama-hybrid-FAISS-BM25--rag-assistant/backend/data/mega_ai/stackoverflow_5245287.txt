Is there a way to previously determine if a file is a good candidate for compression?

I'm planning a .NET project that involves automated upload of files from the most diverse types, from various distributed clients to a constellation of servers, and sometimes the file extension may not match the real file type (long story). Using HTTP compression will not always be an option, and in this project case, is preferrable to spend more client processing than bandwidth or server storage. But it would be really better if we could skip the compression process if we could determine if the compression would give feasible results. I know that there is no "right answer", but we would appreciate any ideas.
