iPhone dev: UIWebview shifts vertical location when rotating device

I have a UIWebView in which the user can browse a bunch of locally stored and interlinked HTML files. All works nice and well, except in this particular case: User navigates to a page with a fragment pointing to chapter 3, causing (correctly) the browser to render the HTML from the fragment anchor and onward. User scrolls a bit further down, say to chapter 4. User rotates the device to landscape. The UIWebView now jumps back up and shows chapter 3. So my question is: Is there a way to make UIWebView display the users last location in the document, even though the user scrolls and/or rotates the device during browsing?
