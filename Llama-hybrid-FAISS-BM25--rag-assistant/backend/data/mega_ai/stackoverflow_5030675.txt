Literal is the correct approach in my opinion too, to prevent messiness you can wrap it nicely with some functions. First, have one literal control that will be the messages placeholder: Second, use CSS for the colors it's more elegant and flexible.. for example: .msg_information { color: blue; } .msg_error { color: red; } .msg_warning { color: purple; } Now have this function: void AddMessage(string message, string type) { string strHTML = string.Format(" {1} ", type, message); litMessages.Text += strHTML; } And finally to add message have such code anywhere in your code: AddMessage("method started successfully", "information"); AddMessage("Failed to do this: " + someErrorMessage, "error"); AddMessage("Value is empty", "warning"); You can make it even more elegant by using enum for message type and more, but the above is enough for basic needs. :) By having each message in its own you make it be in its own line automatically and you can control each message easier with CSS. Edit: my code is C# but can be converted easily to VB.NET as well.
