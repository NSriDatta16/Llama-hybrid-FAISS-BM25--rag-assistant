What are the predicted probabilities from an SVM?

I am using "train" in the Caret package for binary classification with SVM (for the algorithm svmLinear2). I have set 'type = "prob" '. I understand that the probability values farther from 0.5 mean the classification decision was 'easier' , but what exactly do these scores mean? Is it derived from the distance from the hyperplane?
