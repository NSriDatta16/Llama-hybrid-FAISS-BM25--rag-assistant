When Gibbs Sampling is fast/slow to converge?

Are there any heuristic/theories showing that on what kind of Bayesian models the convergence of Gibbs sampling is fast/slow? For example, from my limited experience, I feel (may be wrong) when a model has many "triangle relations" (A->B, A->C, B->C), the convergence is likely to be slow. The practical value for this question is that we might chose to modify the model structure when we meet such models considering the convergence speed. Any reference or personal experience are warmly welcomed!
