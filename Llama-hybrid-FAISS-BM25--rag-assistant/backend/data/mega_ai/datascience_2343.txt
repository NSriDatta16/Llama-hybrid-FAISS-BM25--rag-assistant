Small project ideas for Machine Learning

I need some serious help. I am supposed to implement a project (Non-Existing as of now) for my Machine Learning course. I have no basics in AI or Data mining or Machine learning. I have been searching for a while and unable to find something that i can finish implementing in 3-4 weeks time. It carries a huge chunk of my final marks and no matter how much i try i am unable to understand how it works! Can the machine learning masters please help me out with this. I need a project suggestion to start with. And i want to know how to proceed after gathering the data set. I am totally blank and running out of time for my graduation :( Appreciate your suggestions! Thanks in advance.
