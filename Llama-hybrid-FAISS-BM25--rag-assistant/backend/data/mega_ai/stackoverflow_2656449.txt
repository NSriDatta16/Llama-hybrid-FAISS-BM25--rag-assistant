Creating objects and inserting them is fine. But to avoid a gigantic commit at the end, you might want to perform a SubmitChanges() every 100 rows or so. Alternately you could get a copy of Red Gate's "SQL Data Compare" utility if you have the cash. Then you never have to write one of these things again. :-) Edit 2010-04-19 : If you want to use a transaction, I think you should still use my approach instead of a single SubmitChanges() . In this case you'll want to explicitly manage your own transaction in L2S (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386995.aspx ). Run your queries in a try/catch and roll back the transaction if you get any failures. Two last bits of advice: Make sure your ASP.NET timeout is set high enough. Consider printing out some kind of progress indicator. It makes running these kind of long-running things much more palatable.
