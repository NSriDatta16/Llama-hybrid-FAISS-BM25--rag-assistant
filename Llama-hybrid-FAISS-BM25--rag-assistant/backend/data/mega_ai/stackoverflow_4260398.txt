JMX-Spring - When is a 'JMXNotification' broadcasted?

I was going through the Spring documentation on JMX and came across the following paragraph: By configuring NotificationListeners in place, every time a JMX Notification is broadcast from the target MBean (bean:name=testBean1),the ConsoleLoggingNotificationListener bean that was registered as a listener via the notificationListenerMappings property will be notified. And this is how the ConsoleLoggingNotificationListener is implemented: public class ConsoleLoggingNotificationListener implements NotificationListener, NotificationFilter { public void handleNotification(Notification notification, Object handback) { System.out.println(notification); System.out.println(handback); } public boolean isNotificationEnabled(Notification notification) { return AttributeChangeNotification.class.isAssignableFrom(notification.getClass()); } } But, since I am a newbie, I want to know when is a JMX Notification broadcasted? Is it when the a JMX-exposed attribute's value is changed ? Please help me know this. Thanks!
