On many terminals (but not Windows), you can use an a sequence like this: "\e[#{code}m" , where the codes are based on these tables . The codes must be separated by a semicolon if using more than one. The major codes are: Intensity: 1 Bold Intensity 4 Underline 5 Slow blink 6 Fast blink 22 Normal Intensity Color: Foreground 3X Background 4X Where X is: ----------- 0 Black 1 Red 2 Green 3 Yellow 4 Blue 5 Magenta 6 Cyan 7 White So, for example, for slowly blinking, bold green text on a blue background, you would use "\e[5;1;32;44mWOW!\e[0m" . The \e[0m resets everything to the terminal default.
