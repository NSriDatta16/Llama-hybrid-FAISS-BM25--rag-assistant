XSLT split output files - muenchian grouping

I have an XSLT file so as to transform large amount of data. I would like to add a "split" functionality, either as a chained XSLT or within the current XSLT that can create multiple output files so as to limit the size of the files under a certain threshold. Let's assume that the input XML is as below: John June12 34 12 John June13 21 11 Jack June19 20 30 The XSLT file is as below using muenchian grouping. However, I'd like ,as an output, several files as below instead of a large one. For this example, I have set only one name per file..but this should be a parameter. Output file for first person: John 1 June12 34 June13 21 John 2 June12 12 June13 11 Output file for second person: Jack 1 June19 20 Jack 2 June19 30 What would be the preferred and most elegant approach using XSLT 1.0? Is there a way to call a chained XSLT within the XSLT so as to split the output files? Cheers.
