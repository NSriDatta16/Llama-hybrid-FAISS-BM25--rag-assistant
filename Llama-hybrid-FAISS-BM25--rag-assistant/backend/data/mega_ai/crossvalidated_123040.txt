What's wrong with t-SNE vs PCA for dimensional reduction using R?

I have a matrix of 336x256 floating point numbers (336 bacterial genomes (columns) x 256 normalized tetranucleotide frequencies (rows), e.g. every column adds up to 1). I get nice results when I run my analysis using principle component analysis. First I calculate the kmeans clusters on the data, then run a PCA and colorize the data points based on the initial kmeans clustering in 2D and 3D: library(tsne) library(rgl) library(FactoMineR) library(vegan) # read input data mydata # plot the third dimension pc3d But when I try to swap the PCA with the t-SNE method, the results look very unexpected: tsne_data plot3d(tsne_data, main="T-SNE", col = km$cluster,type="s",size=1,scale=0.2) My question here is why the kmeans clustering is so different from what t-SNE calculates. I would have expected an even better separation between the clusters than what the PCA does but it looks almost random to me. Do you know why this is? Am I missing a scaling step or some sort of normalization?
