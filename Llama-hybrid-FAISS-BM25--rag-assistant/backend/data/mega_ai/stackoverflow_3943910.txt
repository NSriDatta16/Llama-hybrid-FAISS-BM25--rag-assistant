Will XML file I/O cause synchronization problems in php?

Now I am facing a situation that I'm building a website without mysql or any other databases. After consideration, I choose to use Xml file for configurations and data storage (And actually I have really no choice). My problem is that if different users read and modify the same xml file at one time, will there be any synchronization problem or other problems? If there are, is there a solution? For a simple bullet-board system, how is the performance of xml (compared with the same system using mysql)? Any tips for improving the performance?
