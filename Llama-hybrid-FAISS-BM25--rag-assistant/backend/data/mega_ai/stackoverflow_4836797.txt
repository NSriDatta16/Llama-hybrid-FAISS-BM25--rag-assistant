Change from IPv4 to IPv6: What are its effects on web development?

Do web developers need to be concerned by the end of IPv4? Or is this strictly a hosting level concern? What can the average PHP/JavaScript/Ajax etc. developer do to mitigate the impact of the changeover? Discuss! (if this has come up before I apologies, but my search revealed nothing)
