How can I load images as icons dynamically into a TileList using flex?

Ok, so I have a custom render that I have created: That I want to use for a photo gallery with images that are dragged and dropped onto a TileList. I have that part down, but I can't seem to get the icon thing to work. Given: value is sort of wrapper for a File class. I want to set the mx:Image source to something that needs to be of type Class. Using nativePath or url gives me a cast error. I see tons of examples online using XML and something like "Embed(/url/to/img.jpg)". I promise you that if you give me one of those examples (using a static image) I will give you a negative vote. THAT IS NOT WHAT IM LOOKING FOR HERE!
