Mmm, it can be done, because Process Viewer has a Show Applications button which does that (even if the main view shows the Java's icon). Alas this freeware isn't open source, so it won't tell its secret... :-( Sysinternals' ProcMon doesn't do that, alas. I will dig a bit more... :-) [EDIT] Both a MS KB article and a Code Project article recommend using WM_QUERYDRAGICON if GCL_HICON fails...
