As with any chart, you'll have to iterate through X values and draw appropriate Y value taken from the sample array that you have. If you will want to pan left and right through the audio, you'll have to offset getting the data from the array. If you will ad zoom out capability - so one pixel on the screen corresponds to some samples (try with integer numbers for start), you'll have to average some values and then draw appropriate value. If word PIXEL and SAMPLE isn't yet in your vocabulary, before drawing the waveform you should get familiar with them, because no amount of others' people code will teach you how to do it.
