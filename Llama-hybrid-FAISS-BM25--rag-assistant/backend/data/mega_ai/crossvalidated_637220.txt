You did not give the motivation for fitting separate models. In the context of one model a solution that is better than arbitrary multiplicity adjustments is to use simultaneous confidence intervals. In the R rms package the contrast.rms function has an option to do this and provides simultaneous coverage over the whole set of requested contrasts. It also automatically accounts for linearly redundant contrasts.
