The idea behind the messaging pattern doesn't specifically have anything to do with showing dialogs. The idea is simply to provide a decoupled way to communicate between ViewModels. You can leverage this infrastructure to solve your problem but you will have to implement the showing of the dialog yourself. As Phillip showed above you can send messages between ViewModels. When your ViewModel receives the message it can set it's own internal property, say "ShowDialog", to true. You can then have a binding that reacts to this property change operation and opens a dialog. I have also built a simple messaging framework for the MVVM pattern that borrows from Josh's idea (and several other existing frameworks) you can read about it here
