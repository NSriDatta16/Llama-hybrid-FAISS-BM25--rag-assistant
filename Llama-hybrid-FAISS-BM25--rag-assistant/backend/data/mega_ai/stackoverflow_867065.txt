I highly recommend building with the setting to treat warnings as errors. This will cause the project to stop building, of course, but it's the only way to enforce a reasonable error policy. Once you've done that, you can examine the warnings you have and make some reasonable decisions. There are probably some warnings that are benign and which you don't care about, so add these to the list of warnings to ignore. Fix the rest of them. If you don't have time to fix them all now, add a #pragma (or the C# equiv) to ignore the specific warnings that occur in every file, and file a bug for each of these to make sure they are addressed later.
