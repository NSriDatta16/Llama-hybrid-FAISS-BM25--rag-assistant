If the number of points is constant in your array you can flatten your array and use each element as a feature in your RF. I worked on a similar problem (If I understood your problem correctly) where I predict the return of a stock based on his return on a given window of a fixed number of days and I have used the RF this way and it performs pretty well. If your number of points isn't fixed then I suggest that that you use LSTM Neural Network where you can introduce a sequence of data (could be arrays) and it can predict the output that you are looking for.
