Is it possible to simulate logistic regression without randomness?

We can simulate linear regression without randomness, which means we make $y=X\beta$ instead of $y=X\beta+\epsilon$. Then if we fit a linear model the coefficients will be identical to the "ground truth". Here is an example. set.seed(0) n My question is can we do the similar simulation with logistic regression? From this question I get the point of remove randomness can be done by using deterministic statement instead of sample from binomial distribution. y 0.5,1,0) instead of y But if we do that, complete separation will happen, and we cannot get the coefficients. On the other hand, if we add regularization, then the coefficients will not be the ones generated data. So, what can I do to "remove the randomness in logistic regression" and solve for the exact "ground truth" coefficients like the linear regression case? I feel I have some fundamental misunderstanding of the concept, what am I missing?
