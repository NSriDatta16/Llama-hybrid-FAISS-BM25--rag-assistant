Yes indeed you can and probably should. Oftentimes the storage for this is in the Session ; you store data that you want for the user. If it's a global thing, you may load it in the Application_Start event and place it somewhere, possibly the HttpCache . And just a note, some people use "Premature Optimisation" to avoid optimising at all; this is nonsense. It is reasonable to cache in this case.
