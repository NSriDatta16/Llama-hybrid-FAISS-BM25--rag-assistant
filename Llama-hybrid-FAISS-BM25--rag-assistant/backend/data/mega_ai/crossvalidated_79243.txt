the situation is as follows: Say, I am going to answer a multiple choice question based on suggestion of my two friends. One gives correct answer 60% percent of the times, the other gives correct answer 40% of the times. Is there any way I can answer a question correctly more than 60% of the time? (in a long run average leaving aside natural variability)
