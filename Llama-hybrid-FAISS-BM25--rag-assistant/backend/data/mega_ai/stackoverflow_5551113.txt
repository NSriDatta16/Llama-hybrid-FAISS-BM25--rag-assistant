Don't know about the first problem (captcha), but you can send headers easily with curl, for example: $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Accept-Charset: utf-8')); And to set the user agent: curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110324 Firefox/4.2a1pre');
