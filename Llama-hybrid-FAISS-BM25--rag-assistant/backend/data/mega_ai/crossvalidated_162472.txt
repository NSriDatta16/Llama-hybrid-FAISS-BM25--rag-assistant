RF is one of the most robust techniques for handling a combination of data types, yet it can mishandle data in cases when there are data with very few categories (particuarly if they are unbalanced) and many categories. Several options to explore: what is the total amount of variation explained (if very small, the discrepancy is not surprising; and will also tell whether it is indeed 'very good'); are any of the categories unbalanced? are the numerical predictors strongly correlated? have RF setting been optimized? PS What do you mean by "in logistic regression, age is not a very good variable with p value of 0.026"?
