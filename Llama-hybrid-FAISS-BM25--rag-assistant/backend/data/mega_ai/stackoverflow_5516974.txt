If by time you mean times that the code is being executed , so that you want something, inside a code block, that is executed 10% of the times the whole block is executed you can just do something like: Random r = new Random(); ... void yourFunction() { float chance = r.nextFloat(); if (chance Of course 0.10f stands for 10% but you can adjust it. Like every PRNG algorithm this works by average usage. You won't get near to 10% unless yourFunction() is called a reasonable amount of times.
