IE6 Not caching my images

I uploaded my web application already in my Production Tomcat Web Server. I am trying to test it already and it works fine on FF/IE7/IE8 but I am having a problem on display on IE6. I notice in the status bar that IE6 seems to be downloading the images every now and then. Even though I did not click anything, it still downloads the images. I am using a menu that uses images and it does not display well on IE6. Problem is that 60% of my targeted user runs on this browser. I am beginning to think that this is a browser cache problem. In all my JSP, I place below meta tag in all the head section. I did this because my apps relies heavily on Ajax and I need the latest copy of my web resource. Could this be the culprit and is there any workaround for this? How can I force IE6 to cache those images? Thanks. I am not exactly sure if this is what you are looking for but kindly advise if I miss anything. This is an example of an Image being downloaded. I forgot to mention that this apps runs only on our local intranet web site. @Pekka, Is this what you are looking for?
