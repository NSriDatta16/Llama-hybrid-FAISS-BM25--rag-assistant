This must be something automagically done by Office apps as the path: abc.xls#C12 taken as a whole is a potentially valid filename itself - if you try to run it from the shell you'll get a "path not found" error. If you click that link in onenote and look at the command line the resulting instance of excel was opened with there is only the "-embedding" switch which probably means onenote is parsing out abc.xls , launching excel via its automation features then activating C12 . I think if you want that functionality you would need to do the same thing using a helper app and use paths like " C:\your_XL_loader.exe D:\abc.xls#C12 ". (If the 3rd party application honors windows protocol handers its trivial to make your_XL_loader.exe associate its self with something like XXX://abc.xls#C12 )
