How do I find text features and print them?

I have just started using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) as a part of my Engineering college project. Can anybody please tell me how do I read an input paragraph text and 1) break it down into textual components i.e into number of sentences, number of words, number of characters and number of polysyllabic or complex words in the given paragraph and 2) Also print the above determined values
