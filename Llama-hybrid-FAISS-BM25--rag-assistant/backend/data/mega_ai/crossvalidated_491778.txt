It would help if you posted a reproducible example to look at what your data looks like. I'm no expert either but will try to help. For what I can see without looking at an example, you have two problems. One with your prior and another in your model set-up. In the prior, the dimension of V within each structure depends on the number of response variables you have. So if you have only one response variable, your R structure should be V=1 (or V=diag(1)). As for your random structure, your G structure should have V=1 for each random effect, which is only the nested effect (which counts as one). Your nested random effect is backwards I think, since the notation for nested effects in MCMCglmm works as (Larger hierarchy/Smaller hierarchy) so I would set it as: DaynestLoc $Location,HRnaomit$ Day.of.the.Year) And your prior prior In the prior, you want to have a flat non-informative prior, unless your data is insufficient for the model to converge, in that case you may want to look at an informative prior. The other problem you have is in the rcov determination in the model configuration. You have a single response variable, hence you can't calculate a covariance structure with other responses, because they don't exist! Try this in the rcov: rcov:~units Again, I'm no expert either but I think that should help.
