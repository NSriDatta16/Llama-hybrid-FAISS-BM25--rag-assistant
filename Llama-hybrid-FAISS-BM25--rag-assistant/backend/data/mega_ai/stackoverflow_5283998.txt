Does the second function really not occur when dragging? Do you remove it, or is it running at the same time? I think your enter_frame function and your mouse_move function are fighting each other. in your drag function add this: stage.removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, fl_frameEvent); and in your drop function add this: stage.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, fl_frameEvent); Another workaround, I noticed if you zoom way way in on the slider, if you come 99.9% of the way left, but don't quite line it up, it works as expected, so you could just adjust your draggable rectangle to leave just a tiny space on the left side.
