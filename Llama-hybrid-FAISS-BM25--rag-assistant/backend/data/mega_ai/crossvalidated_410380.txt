If you consider an AB test like an ANOVA but for logistic regression, you can use sample size equations for logistic regression to determine the sample size for your AB test. The number of samples to detect an effect of size $\beta$ with $\gamma$ power is $$ n = \dfrac{(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_\gamma)^2}{(\beta\sigma_x)^2p(1-p)(1-\rho^2)} $$ $\sigma_x = \sqrt{f(1-f)}$ where $f$ is the fraction of people in your baseline variant. $p$ is the marginal probability of a click (you can use historic click data here unless you think the variant will be much much different than baseline. This isn't usually the case). $1-\rho^2$ is the variance inflation factor, but if you randomly assign the groups, this should not be important). The $z$ are appropriate quantiles of a standard normal distribution. $\beta$ is on the log odds scale and is the effect of the variant. If you think the difference in probaility between baseline and variant is $\delta$ , then $\beta = \log(\delta/(1-\delta))$ . More information can be found in this book.
