Cross validation plus oversampling?

I am quite new to machine learning and python as well. I faced an imbalanced dataset and wanna use cross validation and oversamopling like the figure shown. I realised the Python function below cannot be directly used for this purpose and please advice some codes for this task. cross_val_score(model, X_train,np.ravel(y_train), cv=n_folds, n_jobs=1, scoring='roc_auc')
