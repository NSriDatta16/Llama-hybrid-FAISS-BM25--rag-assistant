classifying of naïve Bayes classifiers is to choose a $y_k$ to maximize the multiplying (joint probability), is my understanding correct?

this CMU Machine Learning Course says (naïve Bayes classifiers) classifying is just a matter of multiplying together those selected parameter estimates that happen to match the values of my new example that I'm trying to classify. it seems that this expression is kind of misleading. classifying is argmax rather than just multiplying. classifying is to choose a $y_k$ to maximize the multiplying. in other words, only $y_k$ is variable, others are fixed in the phase of classifying, is my understanding correct?
