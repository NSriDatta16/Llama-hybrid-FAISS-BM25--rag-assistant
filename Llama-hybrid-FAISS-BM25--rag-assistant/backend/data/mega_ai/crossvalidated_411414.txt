How to apply the diffusion maps when the matrix is PSD but not positivity preserving?

In order to apply the diffusion maps in a matrix $C\in\mathbb R^{n\times n}$ , that matrix must obey some restrictions, C is symmetric: $C_{ij} = C_{ji}$ , C is positivity preserving (PP): $\forall i, j$ , $C_{ij}\ge0$ , C is positive semi-definite (PSD) However, I'm stuck on a problem with a PSD correlation matrix with negative entries. So I want to know how can I transform a generic PSD matrix into a PSD / PP matrix? If that transformation is not so trivial, how can I make an embedding of a set of points into an Euclidean space using only the correlation matrix as input?
