Yes, this can be done -- you just need to query the automatic reverse OneToOneField relations. E.g.: a = Animal.objects.select_related('person', 'dog')[0] a = a.person or a.dog or a # whichever is not None print a print isinstance(a, Person) The use of select_related here allows this to be done in a single query, rather than having to test for DoesNotExist exceptions when you access the subclass attributes/relations. See also my answer here and the InheritanceManager in django-model-utils for a more elegant/long-term solution. We're looking at ways of making this easier in Django's core.
