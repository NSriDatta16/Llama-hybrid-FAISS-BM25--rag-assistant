If you navigate to the SWF directly, it works, which tells me that the problem is how you're embedding it. Have you updated your flash player in the mean time? 10.2 was released recently (If you're on Chrome, this will probably happen automatically) I took a quick look at your JavaScript embed code, and that's a lot of code :D Can you try SWFObject and tell me if it works: http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/
