Encoding apostrophe

i am building up a string on the server that is getting put into a javascript variable on the client. what is the best of encoding this to avoid any issues right now on the server i am doing something like this: html = html.Replace("'", "&#39;"); but i assume there is a more elegant fool proof way of doing stuff like this.
