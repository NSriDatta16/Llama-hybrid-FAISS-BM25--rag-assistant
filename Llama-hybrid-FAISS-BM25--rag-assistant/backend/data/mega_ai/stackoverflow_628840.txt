What is the best way to cater for users reporting bugs?

ok, Bugzilla would scare the willies out of the average end-user. Even things like Mantis are a little spooky for the uninitiated. What method, web package (preferred), interface, whatever can I implement to make it easy, intuitive and not-at-all-intimidating for my end users & customers to report bugs in an intelligible manner? I like the idea of something forms-based, or point-and-clicky, rather than the prior knowledge needed by something as comprehensive and intimidating as Bugzilla. Email, while approachable for the average punter, seems less than ideal since it doesn't prompt the user for the kinds of information I need to try & figure out what is broken. So far Bugs - The Bug Genie seems like the least scary option to confront the average user with. I searched but didn't find any questions like mine. Suggestions, ideas, insights please !
