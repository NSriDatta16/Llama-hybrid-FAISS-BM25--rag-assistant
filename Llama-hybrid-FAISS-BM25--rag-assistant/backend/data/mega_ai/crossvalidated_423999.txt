A model with no lags or differences and no arima structure is often a NO-NO when you have time series data due to untreated auto-correlation . Time series analysis model identification enables more powerful model structure to be used. See https://autobox.com/pdfs/regvsbox-old.pdf for a good introduction. Perhaps you could explicitly present not only your model BUT the actual data in a csv format to facilitate further discussion . EDITED AFTER RECEIPT OF YOUR DATA 246 MONTHLY VALUES (US10yr) starting 2005/1 WITH 3 POSSIBLE PREDICTORS: What does the trending constant in the recursive estimation suggest? My ans to question 1 1 in a univariate setting a shifting of the mean 2) in a causal setting ..not much can be said I took your 246 values and found that a useful model required Weighted Estimation as the error variance was markedly lower in the most recent data. The model is here with a supporting scatter plot of Y and your 3rd candidate predictor. The Actual/Fit and Forecast is here If you can predict X3 that will aid your prediction of Y
