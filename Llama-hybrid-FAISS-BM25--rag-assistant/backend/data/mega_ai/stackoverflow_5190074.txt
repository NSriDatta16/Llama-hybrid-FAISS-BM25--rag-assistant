C# MVVM - Is a model required here?

So I am delving into MVVM using C# with WPF (using Expression Blend) and have run into a question of how to properly implement the gathering of data from a database and displaying it in a window. My view is just a grid with a few TextBlocks that I can update with data from a SQL query (I am reporting the number of calls that were made to our company and by our phone agents, so All Calls, Incoming Calls, etc.) My question is, do I need a model here to get/hold the data or is it good (or at acceptable) MVVM practice to do this in the ViewModel? If I do it in the VM I can easily implement the INotifyPropertyChanged event and everything works. If I create a model to hold the data do I then have to create an INotifyPropertyChanged in the Model and the VM or is there something else that should be used to do the notifications? This seems like a straight forward task but I just can't seem to find a good example of just displaying pieces of data, every example I find is of a collection and being my first MVVM program I want to make sure I do it right :) I read on another post someone saying "every Model requires a VM but not every VM requires a Model". This goes along with my question above and would just like to hear the thoughts of some experienced users. Thanks, Brian
