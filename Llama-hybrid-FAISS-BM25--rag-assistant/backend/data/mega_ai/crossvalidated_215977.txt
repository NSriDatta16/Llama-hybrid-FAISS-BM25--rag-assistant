Try to define the probability that you want to obtain in mathematical terms. If you do so the following becomes just calculus. The probability you want to obtain can be seen as an expectation of $I\left[x > x_0\right]$ over joint distribution of $x$ and $h$ where $I$ is an indicator function that is equal to $1$ when $x > x_0$ and to $0$ otherwise: $$P(x > x_0) = \mathop{\mathbb E} _{x, h} I\left[x > x_0\right] = \int dP(x, h)\ I\left[x > x_0\right] = \iint dx\ dh\ p(x, h)\ \theta(x - x_0).$$ In this expression $p(x,h)$ is a probability density of joint distribution of $x$ and $h$, and $\theta(x)$ is a Heaviside Step function . Your probability $P(X > x)$ is actually a conditional probability for given value of $h$ and its derivative is a probability density of conditional probability of $x$ for given $h$ $p(x \mid h).$ So using definition of conditional probability you can get that $p(x, h)\ dx\ dh = p(x \mid h)\ dx \cdot p(h)\ dh.$ So now you can obtain the probability density functions $$p(x \mid h) = \frac{d}{dx} P(X \leq x \mid h) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(1 - P(X > x \mid h) \right) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}P(X > x \mid h),$$ $$p(h) = \frac{d}{dh} P(H \leq h) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial h} P(H > h)$$ and substitute them to the integral: $$P(x > x_0) = \iint dx\ dh\ p(x\mid h)\ p(h)\ \theta(x - x_0)= \int\limits_0^{\infty} dh\ p(h) \int\limits_{x_0}^{\infty} dx\ p(x\mid h) = \\-\int\limits_0^{\infty} dh\ P(X > x_0 \mid h) \frac{\partial}{\partial h} P(H > h).$$ Actually in this particular case there is a more simple way to use conditional probabilities directly: $$P(X > x) = \mathop{\mathbb E}_h P(X > x \mid h) = \int P(X > x\mid h) \ dP(h),$$ but I find the joint distribution/indicator function approach to be more powerful because it allows to infer probability distribution of more complicated relations (e.g. if probability of wave energy $x^2$ is larger than given function of $h$) or introduce new probabilistic variables to the model (e.g. instead of single value of $\sigma$ use random variable sigma from distribution obtained in result of bayesian estimation of $\sigma$ from experimental data) using a single generic framework.
