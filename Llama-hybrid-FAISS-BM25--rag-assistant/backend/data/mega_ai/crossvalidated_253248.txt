As understood in our book , ergodicity means convergence to the stationary distribution of the Markov chain irrespective of the initial condition or distribution. Therefore, if a Markov chain is periodic, it cannot be ergodic because it does not converge in distribution to a limit. That is, there is no limit to the sequence $$\vert\vert K^n(x,\cdot)-\pi\vert\vert_{\text{TV}}$$ where $K$ denotes the Markov kernel, $\pi$ the stationary distribution, and $||\cdot||_{\text{TV}}$ the total variation norm. I suggest you read the easily accessible Markov Chains and Stochastic Stability by Seyn Meyn and Richard Tweedie. There exist however ergodic theorems in Markov chain theory that do not require periodicity, like Birkhoff-Kinchin's theorem, the Markov equivalent of the Law of Large Numbers.
