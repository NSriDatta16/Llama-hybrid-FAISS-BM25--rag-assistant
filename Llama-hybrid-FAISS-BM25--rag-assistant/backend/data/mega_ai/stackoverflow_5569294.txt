Just a note on organisation: I'd suggest to write a subroutine/function for every task, like int digit_sum(int year) { /* ... */ return sum; } int reverse_difference(int year) { /* ... */ return diff; } and so on. This way you'll also prevent errors like modifying the year variable during the first calculation without saving the original value (which you did, as David Winant already pointed out).
