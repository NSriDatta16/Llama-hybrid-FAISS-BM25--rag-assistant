While I've never used LSTM RNN or TensorFlow, from my experience using FFNN for forecasting, the weights for initialization are random each time you run it. This leads to different results for each time you run the model and forecast. You could build the models many times (like 30+ depending on runtime) and average them to get a mean of how the different initialization results produce different models. In R, the way this is avoided is using set.seed()
