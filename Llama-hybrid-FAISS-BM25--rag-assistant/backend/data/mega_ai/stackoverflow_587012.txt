LINQ to Objects auto increment number

This feels like a completely basic question, but, for the life of me, I can't seem to work out an elegant solution. Basically, I am doing a LINQ query creating a new object from the query. In the new object, I want to generate a auto-incremented number to allow me to keep a selection order for later use (named Iter in my example). Here is my current solution that does what I need: Dim query2 = From x As DictionaryEntry In MasterCalendarInstance _ Order By x.Key _ Select New With {.CalendarId = x.Key, .Iter = 0} For i = 0 To query2.Count - 1 query2(i).Iter = i Next Is there a way to do this within the context of the LINQ query (so that I don't have to loop the collection after the query)?
