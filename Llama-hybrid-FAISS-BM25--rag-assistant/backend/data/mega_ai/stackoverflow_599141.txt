Is there a function in MySQL that will compress the results returned from a query?

I would like to compress the results if it reached a certain number of rows. The client program would then uncompress the result and process. This a desktop with a client/server architecture, some clients connects through vpn. When a client connects, it will send data to the server. After the server has done processing, the client will then download updated data from the server. The clients are located in several towns, with average of 50-100 kms. away. They will connect through internet using vpn. But that is the initial plan, not implemented yet, using vpn or other means.
