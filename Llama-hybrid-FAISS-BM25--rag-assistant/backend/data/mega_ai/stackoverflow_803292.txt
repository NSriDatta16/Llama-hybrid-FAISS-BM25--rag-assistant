The best option seems to be to use WMI. In particular, you'll want to look into the Format method of the Win32_Volume class. You could instead use the SHFormatDrive function of the Win32 API. This may be the simpler option (especially in C++), though I'm not sure how the functionality compares with the WMI method. Edit: As M. Jahedbozorgan points out, this seems to open the Explorer shell dialog to format the drive. A third option is to run the command-line format.exe from code (and then read from the stdout stream), but this clearly isn't a very nice solution. Other suggestions are given in this thread on MSDN forums.
