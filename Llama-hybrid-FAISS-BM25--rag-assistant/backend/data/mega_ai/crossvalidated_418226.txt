I assume by sigmas you mean the variances of the components of the kernel functions. If you want to choose them in the light of your CS, then that sounds Bayesian to me. How are you setting the length scales? There is a literature on priors for Gaussian process parameters, eg Trangucci, Betancourt, Vehtari (2016).
