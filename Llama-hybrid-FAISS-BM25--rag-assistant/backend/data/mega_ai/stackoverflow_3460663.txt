Image gallery in UNITY3D

Is it possible to create an Image gallery similar to this using Unity3d. I know it is possible to click, drag images and save them using jQuery. But is there a way to create images dynamically in Unity3d and then load, move, drag and save them? If that sounded confusing, this is what I want to do. Create a blank board. Add 'n' number of images to the board to display them on the screen. As a new image is added the other images automatically move and adjust to accommodate the new image (auto align feature). The images may not be of fixed size. Finally once all this is done, save the page so that next time they are all loaded the same way. All this needs to be done using the Web Player.(should have mentioned this first). What I have thought so far- Create a plane for the board. (this will hold the images). Create/load prefabs of planes and then add the images as texture to them. So this will create 'n' different planes for n images. Save the rect() property of the planes once the user is done arranging them. Is this possible using Unity3d or is there a better solution? I need to create a photo gallery where the user can basically enter the studio and see different photos of each side of the studio. Any suggestions and help is much appreciated.
