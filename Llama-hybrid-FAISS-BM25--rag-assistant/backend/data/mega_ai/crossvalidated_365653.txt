Time series or panel data models that can deal with irregular time intervals and multiple observations in some but not all time periods

I want to run a time series regression over data is not spaced out in regular time intervals and where in some time periods there are multiple observations. Such in the picture below. Is this possible and are there any models that are appropriate for this with out having to alter the data?
