I'm not sure if it'll work in all browsers but you should try setting autocomplete="off" on the form. The easiest and simplest way to disable Form and Password storage prompts and prevent form data from being cached in session history is to use the autocomplete form element attribute with value "off". From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Securing_your_site/Turning_off_form_autocompletion Some minor research shows that this works in IE to but I'll leave no guarantees ;) @Joseph : If it's a strict requirement to pass XHTML validation with the actual markup (don't know why it would be though) you could theoretically add this attribute with javascript afterwards but then users with js disabled (probably a neglectable amount of your userbase or zero if your site requires js) will still have their passwords saved. Example with jQuery: $('#loginForm').attr('autocomplete', 'off');
