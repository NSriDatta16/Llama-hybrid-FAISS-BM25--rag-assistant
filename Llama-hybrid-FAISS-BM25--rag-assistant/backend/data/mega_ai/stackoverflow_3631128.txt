How about the Singleton/Module pattern, as discussed in this article about YUI: http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/ I believe jQuery uses this pattern in its core, as well as encouraging plug-in developers to use the pattern. Using this pattern is a handy and efficient way of keeping the global namespace clear of clutter, which is further useful by assisting developers in writing clean, encapsulated code.
