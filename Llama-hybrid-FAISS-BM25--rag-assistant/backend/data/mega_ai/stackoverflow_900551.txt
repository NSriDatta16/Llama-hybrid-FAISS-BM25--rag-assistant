You should look at the Microsoft Sync Framework . Building an occasionally offline solution yourself from scratch is a complex undertaking. In my career I have seen many good development teams mess it up. I'm not saying that you would have problems building it yourself, but why not use something that already exists? And if you find it doesn't meet your needs, you will probably have a better understanding of how to code your own solution. The tradeoff is that you would have to learn the Synch Framework, but there are samples that you could probably leverage immediately.
