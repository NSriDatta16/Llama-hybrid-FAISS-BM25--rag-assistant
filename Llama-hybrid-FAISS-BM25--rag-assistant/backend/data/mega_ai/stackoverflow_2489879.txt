It's a simple oversight. The value of type in the function loadCalender(type) is set to pickupCalendar from the call closeStep1OpenSetp2("pickupCalendar"); . But you do $('#' + type + 'Calendar') which evaluates to $('#pickupCalendarCalendar') and there is no element with this id. Correct would be $('#pickupCalendar') so either remove Calendar in the parameter or ditch the + 'Calendar' . Then it should work just fine
