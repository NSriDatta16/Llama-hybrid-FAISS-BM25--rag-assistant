Percent reduction between two groups

We'd like to express how much better A performs when combined with B. Is it as simple as comparing the averages of the two groups? When tested, widget A has a range of results from 36 to 43 with an AVG of 40(x). When widget B is tested together with product A, the results have a range of 27 to 34 and an average of 30(y). If tested a lot, the tails might rarely overlap. 0 good 44 bad. very bad. A) 0 .................|..|.||||||...|. 44 AB) 0 ....|.|||||||.|.................. 44 What's the best way to calculate and represent the data? Simple would be nice (i.e. "B makes A 10% Better!") Current thinking is: Percent Reduction =(x-y)/x
