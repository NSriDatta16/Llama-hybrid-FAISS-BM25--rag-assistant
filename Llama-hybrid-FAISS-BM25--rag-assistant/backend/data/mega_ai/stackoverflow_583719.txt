Is the distance metric and is the graph undirected? (in this case the matrix is symmetric). In that case you could just operate on lower or upper triangular matrices throughout the program. In this way you just have to 0 out one row (or column if you are dealing with upper triangular). and even then it wont be a whole row, on average half.
