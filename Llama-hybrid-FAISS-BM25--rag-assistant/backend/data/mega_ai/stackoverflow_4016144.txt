R: Plot multiple lines on the same axis with the average in bold?

I have some data that looks like this: df df time a b c mean 1 1 100.0 99.9 100.3 100.06667 2 2 90.0 90.3 88.5 89.60000 3 3 91.0 90.9 90.5 90.80000 4 4 92.0 91.8 91.5 91.76667 5 5 91.0 92.0 91.0 91.33333 6 6 91.5 91.5 91.3 91.43333 I want to plot the lines on the same canvas with time on the x-axis. I want the lines a , b , and c to be slightly transparent (or lightly colored) and the mean to be bold and very clear.
