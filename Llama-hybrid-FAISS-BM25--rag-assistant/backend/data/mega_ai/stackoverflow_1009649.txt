Take a look at these articles describing how LinkedIn and Digg are built: http://hurvitz.org/blog/2008/06/linkedin-architecture http://highscalability.com/scaling-digg-and-other-web-applications There's also "Big Data: Viewpoints from the Facebook Data Team" that might be helpful: http://developer.yahoo.net/blogs/theater/archives/2008/01/nextyahoonet_big_data_viewpoints_from_the_fac.html Also, there's this article that talks about non-relational databases and how they're used by some companies: http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/is_the_relational_database_doomed.php You'll see that these companies are dealing with data warehouses, partitioned databases, data caching and other higher level concepts than most of us never deal with on a daily basis. Or at least, maybe we don't know that we do. There are a lot of links on the first two articles that should give you some more insight.
