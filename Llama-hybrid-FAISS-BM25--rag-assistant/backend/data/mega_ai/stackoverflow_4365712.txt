Generic objects in PHP are instances of stdClass . However it is not a base class, meaning classes don't inherit from it unless you specify extends stdClass in the class declaration. Typecasting something to (object) in PHP yields a stdClass . For example: $a = array('foo' => 'bar'); $o = (object) $a; var_dump($o instanceof stdClass); // bool(true) var_dump($o->foo); // string(3) "bar" In PHP there is no concept of upcasting and downcasting. You can type hint for superclasses or interfaces but that's about it. An object is always recognized as an instance of whatever class you construct it as, e.g. with new .
