I would suggest your option 1 also. Specifically, you want to leave the display resolution in the native monitor resolution if at all possible. Most people are using LCD displays these days, and if the output resolution doesn't match the native display resolution (or isn't a very convenient multiple) then you can get some horrible artefacts and blurring. So definitely start with the native resolution, figure out the lesser dimension (likely height, as widescreen is all the rage) and pillbox the sides. You definitely want to keep square pixels. You might even find (depending on the size ratio between your game assets and the output) that you get better results if you round the scaling down.
