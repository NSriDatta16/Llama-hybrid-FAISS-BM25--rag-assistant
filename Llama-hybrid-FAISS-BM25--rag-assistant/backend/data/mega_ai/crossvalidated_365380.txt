Switching attention - is there a statistical tool to mimic perceptive response?

I was driving this morning to work. Another car made sudden lane change. I noticed an interesting thing: for a brief moment my attention focused in this car. It almost physically felt that everything else sort of disappeared for a moment, and my eyes and brain and entire body were determined to figure out what's going with this object. Once, it merged with a flow, the focus dispersed and I went back to monitoring everything around me. So, I thought about a statistical forecasting model that could have this property whereas it would notice something unusual, then focus on the feature evaluate it and undial once the feature disappeared. Maybe you have a bunch of predictors, then for some reason the weight is increased on one of them for some time, then get the weight back to equal. For instance, in the last crisis it could have been something related to real estate, maybe underwriting fraud indicators or deterioration of retail borrower's credit that had to be picked up my forecasting models. Most forecasters missed the last crisis because their weights are static in regression models, in my opinion.
