Differences between methods of reporting variance

I am a neuroscience researcher without too much background in statistical theory. I have multi recordings from different samples and I want to precisely report the variation across the samples, and I wanted to understand the differences between methods of doing this: (arithmetic) Average of variances of the different samples (arithmetic) Average of standard deviation of the different samples (arithmetic) Average of SEM of the different samples The variance of the average histograms of the different samples The standard deviation of the average histograms of the different samples The SEM of the average histograms of the different samples The average histogram would be found by summing the percentage histograms of each samples in each histogram bin and then dividing the sample size. I have a rough idea of the differences in each method, but not sure how to frame them in terms of statistical/probability theory. Thank you for your help as always!
