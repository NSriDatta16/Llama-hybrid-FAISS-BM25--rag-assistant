Accuracy Classification Result of Multiclass SVM

We recently trained our dataset which consists of 18 classes (basic and compound facial emotions). Each class has a minimum of 100 and a maximum of 300 images. The images are also grayscale and the size is 100x100. The kernel that we used is RBF and the value for C and Gamma are 10 and 0.001 respectively. The model achieved an accuracy of 31%. How are we going to increase the accuracy of our model? As of now, we cannot change our classifier and we cannot decrease the number of classes, because it is already stated in our documentation.
