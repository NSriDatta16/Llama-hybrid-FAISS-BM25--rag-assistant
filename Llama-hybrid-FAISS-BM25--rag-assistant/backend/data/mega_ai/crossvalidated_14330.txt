Are you familiar with Johansen's procedure? Usualy after testing that the vectors are cointegrated, vector error correction model (VECM) should be estimated. Then you get all the coefficients. In general the coefficients of cointegration are tricky to work with, since they are not unique. For example if two time series $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated then by definition there exist coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that time series $\alpha x_t+\beta y_t$ is stationary. But since stationarity is invariant to linear transformations, $-\alpha$ and $-\beta$ are also cointegration coefficients. How precisely coefficients should be interpreted then depends heavily on the model you are estimating. Coefficients for models based on different economic theory can be interpreted differently.
