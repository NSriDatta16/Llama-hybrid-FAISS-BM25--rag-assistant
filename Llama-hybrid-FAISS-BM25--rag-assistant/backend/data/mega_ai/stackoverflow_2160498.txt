I don't believe it's possible to set attributes using reflection - and even if it is, I'd encourage you not to do so. Attributes should be used for metadata which is known at compile-time. If you want a more dynamic form of metadata, load it from a file or use app.config instead... or at least have some special "placeholder" values (like |DataDirectory| in a connection string) which can be resolved at execution time.
