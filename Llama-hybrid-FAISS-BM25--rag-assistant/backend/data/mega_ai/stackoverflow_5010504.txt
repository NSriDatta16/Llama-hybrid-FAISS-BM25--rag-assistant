The general approach is to use function approximation to reduce the state space when it gets too large. The key here is that you are generalizing rewards between states that are similar. Of course this requires that you come up with meaningful features to use by exploiting domain knowledge. There are, unfortunately, no algorithms that both solve the feature selection problem and the control problem together with any guarantees about optimality (in polynomial time), nor do we expect any to be invented. To answer your questions, 1) even beginner level performance in 8 player limit texas holdem' is far beyond the current state of the art research. Check out the current "worlds best computer poker player" research at http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/ . That said, you could try and divide up the space into arbitrary features like: (player[1].cash > 1000) 0:1 , (player[1].cash > 2500) 0:1, etc. 2) It's hard to know how good your representation is, usually people just run it until it starts to converge and see how well it performs...
