Is Perceptron a data-structure or an algorithm or both?

I found Perceptron in the discussions of ( overlapping of disciplines is acknowledged ): Neural Network Machine Learning Data Mining, Pattern Recognition Genetic Algorithm In the discussion of Neural Network , it is defined as: Perceptron is a single layer neural network. In the discussion of Machine Learning , it is defined as: In machine learning, the Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. In the discussion of Data Mining , it is defined as: One of the older approaches to this problem in the machine learning literature is called the perceptron algorithm, and was invented by Frank Rosenblatt in 1956. In the discussion of Evolutionary ALgorithm, it is defined as: ??? So, my questions are, Is Perceptron a data structure or an algorithm or both? Can you prescribe a book where I can learn about Perceptrons from Data Mining point of view? Can you prescribe a book where I can learn about Perceptrons from Evolutionary Algorithm point of view?
