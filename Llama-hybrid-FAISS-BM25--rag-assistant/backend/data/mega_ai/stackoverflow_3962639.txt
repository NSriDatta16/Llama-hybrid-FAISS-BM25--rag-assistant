How to get average tax rates with SQL from a one-to-many relationship

I have a database containing two tables - one, states, contains info about each state's income taxes, and the second, brackets, contains the tax brackets for each state connected to States by a numeric key. I would like to use SQL to retrieve each state and the AVERAGE tax bracket amount for each state to output in a recordset. For example: STATES id name 1 Alabama BRACKETS id bracket amount 1 5% 1000 1 7% 2000 1 8% 10000 How can I do this with the least amount of SQL calls?
