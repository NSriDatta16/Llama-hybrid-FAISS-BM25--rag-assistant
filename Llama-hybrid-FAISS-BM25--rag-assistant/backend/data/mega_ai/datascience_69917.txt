what is learning rate in neural network?

When I am creating a model using Keras we should define the learning rate(lr) in that optimizer method Please refer to the below code. from keras import optimizers sgd = optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01, clipnorm=1.) Please give a simple example with a definition. How to define the values in lr parameter? Is that random value?
