As you say, Japanese characters can easily be sorted into group using Unicode. This is trivial. Conversion of katakana to hiragana is also trivial as there is a one to one mapping. You can convert kanji to hiragana via Kakasi Sorting can be done by converting to hiragana first. However, this is a poor man's sort as many kanji are homophones (same sound, different kanji). So you should sort the Kanji before converting and sorting by hiragana. You don't say why you need to do sorting in this way. Maybe there is a better sort we can suggest if you tell us more about your application.
