Average Precision i -1

I am new to this. I tried to train an SSD mobilenetv2 model using tensorflow object detection API. I followed this colab notebook https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wTMIrJhYsQdq_u7ROOkf0Lu_fsX5Mu8a#scrollTo=CjDHjhKQofT5 but during evaluation my average precision remains -1 at num steps=25000. What should I try next?
