You show four models, one of them is strange (the one marked OLS ) so I will first discuss the three others. What is common is that a response variable (amount of pay for the Gamma , a count of days for the others) is modeled as a function of covariates, but what is modeled is value pr year, that is: $$ \DeclareMathOperator{\E}{\mathbb{E}} \frac{\E Y}{\text{years}} = \exp(\beta^T x) = \exp(\eta), \qquad \text{say} $$ (as you are using a log link function). Taking logarithms (natural) on both sides give: $$ \log \E Y - \log\text{years} = \eta $$ and moving one term above over on the right hand side: $$ \log \E Y = \log\text{years} + \eta $$ and that answers your question: the combination of a log link function, a non-negative response and offset of log of exposure means that you are modeling the ratio of total amount divided into exposure, that is, payment per year or number of days per year. The interpretation of the other variables (linear parameters in the linear predictor $\eta$ should then be clear, it is interpreted as usual in regression models. Please note that the exact choice of distribution family in the explanation above do not play any role! Your fourth model do not make much sense to me, you can of course use a gaussian model for a non-negative response, that in itself is not a problem. But, the use of identity link function together with offset of log exposure is meaningless, as far as I can see. Let us try to mimic the logic above: $$ \frac{\E Y}{\text{years}} = \beta^T x = \eta, \qquad \text{say} $$ Note we changed to identity link function. But now taking logs doesn't work as above, that worked above only because we had a log link function. So I would not try to interpret the parameters in your OLS model, they are meaningless. But you could try a gaussian family, but with log link! For a more extensive discussion of the arguments above, see Goodness of fit and which model to choose linear regression or Poisson EDIT To the additional question in comments: So does that mean offset only works for log links? No, but log link and rate modeling is the major use case. Most posts on this site mentioning offset is this case. A few posts discussing other uses: Binary Models (Probit and Logit) with a Logarithmic Offset , Using offset in binomial model to account for increased numbers of patients , Offset in Logistic regression: what are the typical use cases?
