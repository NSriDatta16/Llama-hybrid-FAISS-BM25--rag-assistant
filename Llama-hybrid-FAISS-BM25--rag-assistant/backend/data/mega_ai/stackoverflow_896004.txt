You can view Clover's coverage data generated by a web application, in Eclipse, without the need to start the web server from Eclipse. The trick is to configure the initString in the Eclipse Clover Config screen to point to the same clover.db that your webapp is using: And - you need to ensure you are using a threaded flushpolicy . The clover-maven2-plugin uses one by default. If you are using Ant, you will need to set it explicitly on . You must also ensure you are using the same version of Clover in both Eclipse and your build tool. I have tested this locally - and it works quite well! Please let me know how you go.
