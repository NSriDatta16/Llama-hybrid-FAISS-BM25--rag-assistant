Beta is a conjugate prior for binomial, not the other way around. In beta-binomial model, you assume beta prior for the probability of success $p$ . The distribution of $p$ a posteriori follows beta distribution. The posterior predictive distribution of the data follows beta-binomial distribution . If you wanted to compare the Bayesian estimate to the frequentist estimate, you should rather compare it to the confidence interval around the parameter (so, something roughly $\sqrt{N}$ times smaller). Moreover, in your example you are using varying binomial sample sizes, while in binomial distribution this is a fixed parameter, so beta-binomial model in the simplest form is not appropriate in here.
