Whether or not you wish to forecast or not has nothing whatsoever to do with correct time series analysis. Time series methods can develop a robust model which can be used simply to characterize the relationship between a dependent series and a set of user-suggested inputs (a.k.a. user-specified predictor series) and empirically identified omitted variables be they deterministic or stochastic.Users at their option can then extend the "signal" into the future i.e. forecast with uncertainties based upon the uncertainty in the coefficients and the uncertainty in the future values of the predictor . Now these two kinds of empirically identified "omitted series" can be classified as 1) deterministic and 2) stochastic. The first type are simply Pulses, Level Shifts , Seasonal Pulses and Local Time Trends whereas the second type is represented by the ARIMA portion of your final model. When one omits one or more stochastic series from the list of possible predictors, the omission is characterized by the ARIMA component in your final model. Time series modelers refer to ARIMA models as a "Poor Man's Regression Model" because the past of the series is being used as a proxy for omitted stochastic input series.
