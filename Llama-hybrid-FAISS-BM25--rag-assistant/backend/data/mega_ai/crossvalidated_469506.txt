We can see from these two lines that it's cross entropy loss and it's a score. loss_fct = CrossEntropyLoss() loss = loss_fct(logits.view(-1, self.num_labels), labels.view(-1)) The NSP is a binarized next sentence prediction task, and you may need to refer to this question: Is binary logistic regression a special case of multinomial logistic regression when the outcome has 2 levels? . When the size of the label for sequence prediction is 1, it is doing regression using mean square error.
