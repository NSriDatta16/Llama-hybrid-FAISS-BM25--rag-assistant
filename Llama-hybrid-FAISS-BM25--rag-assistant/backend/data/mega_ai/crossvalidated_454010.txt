Causal networks with correlated variables

I've been reading about Bayesian networks and one of the central assumptions these networks require is conditional independence. However, the problems I'm working on involve variables that are often correlated with each other and conditional independence assumptions do not hold. I looked into Weighted Correlation Network Analysis, also known as Weighted Gene Co-Expression Analysis, however these tools seem more akin to clustering and do not actually strive to model causal relationships. I also found this paper https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25156 Bae, H., Monti, S., Montano, M. et al. Learning Bayesian Networks from Correlated Data. Sci Rep 6, 25156 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/srep25156 . These authors I think attempt to use the concept of linear mixed models to regain some of the conditional independence assumptions while allowing correlation to be present in the model. I think this is possibly similar to what I'm looking for, however I've not found anyone else doing work like this. What statistical tools exist for trying to do probabilistic graphical models without conditional independence assumptions and also work for relatively low sample sizes (50-200 observations)?
