Are there neural networks packages that use complex numbers?

Can you build complex (in terms of complex numbers) neural networks in Keras or Tensorflow or something similar? This would mean the inputs, weights, activation functions, and outputs would all potentially use complex numbers. I know this can be done in theory, but all the software packages I have come across seem to assume only real numbers are used for the weights and inputs.
