Programming user interface advice?

In my project I going to generate a user interface through programming. Scalability of this UI is very important requirement. So far I am using two dimensional graphics for generating the UI. I think there may be different solutions but for the moment I know only two. First one is supplying X,Y coordinates of each two dimensional graphic on my UI.(I do not prefer this solution because I do not want to calculate X,Y coordinates of each graphic. For the moment I don't have a logic for doing this easily) Second one (which is currently I am using now) is using layouts which organizes its contents according to size of item. In this solution I don't have to calculate X,Y coordinates of each item. (Layout is doing this for me.) But this approach may have its own pitfalls. I am very new to user interface programming. Can you give me advice about this issue?
