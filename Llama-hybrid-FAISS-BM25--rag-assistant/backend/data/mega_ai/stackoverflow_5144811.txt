Cut a line out of a string with Regex

I'm looking for a solution for removing line 2 out of a string in C#. Of course, I could just read line by line, but with a regex, it would be much better and more elegant. As an example: Before: this is line 1 this is line 2 this is line 3 this is line 4 After: this is line 1 this is line 3 this is line 4 Does someone have a good hint about how to do this with Regex? Thanks.
