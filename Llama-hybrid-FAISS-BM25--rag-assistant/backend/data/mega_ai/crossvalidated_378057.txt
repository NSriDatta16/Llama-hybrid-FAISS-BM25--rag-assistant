Have you thought about using a PCA, clustering or random forest for determining independent variable significance? For forecasting, you could use an ARIMAX model with exogenous inputs. Just fill in the appropriate parameters, (p,d,q). AR models are commonly used for econometric forecasts. You could also use random forest to do this forecast, but with the lack of data it might be an issue. One last thought, you might want to transform the data to percent change before performing the independent variable tests. Although, leave the data as is for the ARIMAX forecast. Update The answer to your most recent comment is a bit lengthy so I am making it an update. Also I think I have a better picture of what you are try to accomplish. You should not be using a simple linear model with non-stationary series to explain the variance of the dependent variable. You should be using % change / differences. Using a non-stationary series you will get a great r-squared, but it is incorrect because the model is not picking up the variance, it is only seeing the trend. Below is a quick example to illustrate using the SPY ETF. As you can see the price series regression looks great, .99 r-squared , but it is a lie! When you do the return series, you get the real answer that it is a bad model with no predictive or explanatory power.
