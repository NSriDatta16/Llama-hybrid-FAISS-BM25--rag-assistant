Most floating point units can generate exceptions divide by zero etc. If your code triggered one of these exceptions from inside an interrupt context the result would be very messy. Also on x86 some memory/string operations have MMX versions that use the floating point register space as temporary storage so they can do 64bit read/write operations so depending on processor/kernel configuration you might be in for some nasty surprises. You could end up spending a lot of time debugging this so my advice would be to try and avoid using floating point in kernel code if you possibly can.
