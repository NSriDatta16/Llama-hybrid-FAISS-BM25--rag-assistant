When and how to avoid inappropriate use of Fisher's exact test

Could someone explain why Richard McElreath says Fisher's exact test is rarely used appropriately in his excellent Bayesian introduction book ( Statistical Rethinking )? For reference, the context is below: Why aren’t the tests enough for innovative research? The classical procedures of introductory statistics tend to be inflexible and fragile. By inflexible, I mean that they have very limited ways to adapt to unique research contexts. By fragile, I mean that they fail in unpredictable ways when applied to new contexts. This matters, because at the boundaries of most sciences, it is hardly ever clear which procedure is appropriate. None of the traditional golems has been evaluated in novel research settings, and so it can be hard to choose one and then to understand how it behaves. A good example is Fisher’s exact test, which applies (exactly) to an extremely narrow empirical context, but is regularly used whenever cell counts are small. I have personally read hundreds of uses of Fisher’s exact test in scientific journals, but aside from Fisher’s original use of it, I have never seen it used appropriately. Even a procedure like ordinary linear regression, which is quite flexible in many ways, being able to encode a large diversity of interesting hypotheses, is sometimes fragile. For example, if there is substantial measurement error on prediction variables, then the procedure can fail in spectacular ways. But more importantly, it is nearly always possible to do better than ordinary linear regression, largely because of a phenomenon known as overfitting.
