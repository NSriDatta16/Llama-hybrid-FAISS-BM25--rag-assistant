I may be breaking some MVC rule, but I've always just placed my "fragments" in individual views and load them, CodeIgniter style, from within the other views that need them. Pretty much all of my views load a header and footer view at the top and bottom, respectively: load->view( "header" ); ?> //Page content... load->view( "footer" ); ?> The header could then include a NavBar in the same fashion, etc.
