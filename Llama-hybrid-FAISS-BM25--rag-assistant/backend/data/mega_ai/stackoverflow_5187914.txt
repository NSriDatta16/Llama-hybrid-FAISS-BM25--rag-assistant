MPI is only a spec. MPI spec is implemented by various groups and organizations. You will want to pick one implementation, say, MPICH, and you can find their design documentation. That will tell you how the MPI spec is implemented by that group. If you just want to describe what happens when an application written in MPI is started, you can read about MPI and MPI programming. I highly recommend http://www.citutor.org
