Looking at the documentation on Drag handlers, it states that it's supposed to be used with a Control object. Are you using it that way? Maybe the code snippet doesn't show it? "If a handler is being used without a control, the handlers setMap method must be overridden to deal properly with the map." I haven't tried it, but it seems as you should go for something like this: var myControl = new OpenLayers.Control(); var dragger = new OpenLayers.Handler.Drag{ control: myControl, callbacks: { 'done': function() { // do something }}, options: {} } myMap.addControl(myControl); myControl.activate();
