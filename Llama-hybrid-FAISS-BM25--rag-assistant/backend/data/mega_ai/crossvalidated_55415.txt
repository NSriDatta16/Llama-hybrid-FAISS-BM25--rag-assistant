check out the EDMA (euclidean distance matrix analysis), it's used for biological shape comparison and uses a nonparametric bootstrap of the differences in the coordinates between shapes, here is a link to the author's site about the text on the subject http://getahead.psu.edu/purplebook_new.html and the actual software package http://www.getahead.psu.edu/EDMA_new.asp alternatively, there are methods of procrustes fitting of shapes to see differences in them, googleing procrustes in R, I see http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/softhelp/vegan/html/procrustes.html
