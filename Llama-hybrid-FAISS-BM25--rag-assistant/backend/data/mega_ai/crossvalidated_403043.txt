multicollinearity between confounders logistic regression

Im going to investigate if a disease have an negative impact on a binary response variable. The disease is the independent variable with additionally confounders. I want to do a manual stepwise regression where I subtraction the confounder with highest p-value, and I wonder if i first have to check for multicollinearity between the confounders and response variable? Can I use the glm in r with the response variable against confounders, then use the vif() function? Do I also have to check the confounder against each other and the disease variable? I would really appreciate an answer!
