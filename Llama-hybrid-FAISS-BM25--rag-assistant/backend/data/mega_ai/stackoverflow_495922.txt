What is the best way to implement a heartbeat in C++ to check for socket connectivity?

Hey gang. I have just written a client and server in C++ using sys/socket. I need to handle a situation where the client is still active but the server is down. One suggested way to do this is to use a heartbeat to periodically assert connectivity. And if there is none to try to reconnect every X seconds for Y period of time, and then to time out. Is this "heartbeat" the best way to check for connectivity? The socket I am using might have information on it, is there a way to check that there is a connection without messing with the buffer?
