You don't need to store the actual files in the Subversion repository to keep track of them with a reasonable degree of confidence. What you can do is create the output file(s), compute a hash (eg. SHA1) of the file contents, and then store the filename and hash value in the repository. As long as your output file storage is backed up to at least the same level as your Subversion repository so you don't lose them, you can be certain (within a reasonable degree) that the given file(s) were the output generated by the build at the time you recorded the hash.
