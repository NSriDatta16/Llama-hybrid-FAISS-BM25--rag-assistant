The core idea with the $\propto$ short-cut is that in Bayesian posterior calculations, you can drop any multiplicative *constant* because you know you will recover the right constant in imposing that your function integrates to one. Hence, $f(\theta,x,\mu) \propto \tilde f(\theta,x,\mu)$ means that $$ f(\theta,x,\mu) = \tilde f(\theta,x,\mu)\bigg/ \int \tilde f(\theta,x,\mu) \text{d}\theta $$ Now in this example I use three entries, $\theta$, $x$, and $\mu$, to make you aware that there are terms in the function that both vary and are considered as constant for the proportionality sign. E.g., $x$ is the data, which "vary" until observed, and $\mu$ is the hyperparameter, which may vary depending on the experiment(er). (This is not a question of "parameter of interest" but rather of "parameter of the sampling distribution". Your remark about the scalar transform of $\theta$ in the EDIT part is just plain wrong.) For instance, in your Poisson example, $\theta=\lambda$, $x=y$, and $\mu=(a,b)$. In the normal example, $\theta=\theta$, $x=x$, and $\mu=(\theta_0,\phi,\phi_0)$. This $\propto$ short-cut means that, when $f(\theta,x,\mu) = \tilde f(\theta,x,\mu)\times g(x,\mu)$ you can drop $g$ from the calculation, i.e. $f(\theta,x,\mu) \propto f(\theta,x,\mu)$. As to answer why in the normal example the posterior mean and the posterior variances are such expressions, this is straightforward calculus, turning the second degree expression in the exponential into a perfect square.
