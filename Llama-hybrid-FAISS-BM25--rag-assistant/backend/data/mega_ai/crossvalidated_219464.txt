How to translate orthogonal polynomial parameters back to the original metric

I am trying to work out how the parameters from a lmer model using orthogonal polynomials can be translated back to their original metric. Chapter 5.3.3 in Hedeker, Donald, and Robert D. Gibbons. Longitudinal data analysis. Vol. 451. John Wiley & Sons, 2006. provides an example of this can be done, (see here https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B85dnVgjSYw3RTA3MGthN1VXZms/view?usp=sharing ) for mixed effects models but I am unsure how to implement this in R. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks Some example data. library(nlme) library(lme4) df
