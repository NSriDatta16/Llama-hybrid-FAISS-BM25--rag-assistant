For the sake of intuitive simplicity, pretend this isn't a statistical problem, but just a mathematical problem. Say that the "data" include every single point exactly on those lines in your example, so that the task is to describe those lines entirely as functions of A and B . Arguably, this is in fact the case, and there's no pretending necessary, because your example provides no info about standard error or residuals. Then, assuming B 1 bisects B 2 perfectly, and that ( B 1 , A 2 ) is exactly as far above ( B 2 , A 2 ) as ( B 1 , A 1 ) is below ( B 2 , A 1 ), and ignoring the dashes (i.e., filling them in, basically)... Half the points on B 1 are above B 2 , and half are below, and their differences effectively cancel out. This means that DV ( B 1 ) = DV ( B 2 ) when averaging across all values of A . Yes, if you hold A constant at A 1 or A 2 , B 1 and B 2 will differ, but since the differences are equal and opposite at opposite values of A , there is no main effect of B . Differences in DV ( B ) that depend on values of A are described entirely by the interaction effect. Similar logic can be applied to plots 6â€“8 to arrive at the intended conclusions.
