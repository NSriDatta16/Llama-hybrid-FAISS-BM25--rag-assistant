I've been battling with the opposite of your problem - too many dlls and dependencies. I don't know the answers, but here are some questions which might give you some useful pointers. Structuring projects & dependencies of large winforms applications in C# What do you do about references when unloading a project in Visual Studio? Note that you can have different namespaces in the same dll, (and conversely, you can spread a namespace over several dlls). For my solution-with-lots-of-projects I currently have a set up where I have a custom build configuration (click in the Debug/Release combo and select Configuration Manager) called 'WorkingSetOnly', where I can choose to compile or not each project on Run - this makes running quicker, but conserves intellisense, goto definition etc. I also use Solution Folders to organise projects into two 'buckets' - WorkingSet and Others, though I haven't yet found a way to link the two (config and folders) automatically.
