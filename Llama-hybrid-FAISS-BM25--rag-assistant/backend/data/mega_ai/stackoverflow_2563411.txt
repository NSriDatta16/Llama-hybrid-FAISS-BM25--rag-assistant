SWIG and Javascript: does embedding the JVM/Rhino into my C++ app is still the only solution?

I really like the idea of automatic binding generation like SWIG does. But it is still lacking Javascript binding. I read that it could not be done with Spidermonkey because of the JS Context that must be passed as parameter to each function. The only solution I found is to embed a JVM into my C++ application, generating bindings to Java using SWIG, and then using Rhino engine as the JS interpreter. It works fine, but it is really heavyweight! Any other ideas? Note: yes I know, I could use Python or Lua instead. But my question is really about JS.
