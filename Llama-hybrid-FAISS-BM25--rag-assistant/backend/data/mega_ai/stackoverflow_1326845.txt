Dropdown height bug in CComboBox (common controls 6.0)?

I've made a simple MFC application (Visual Studio 2008, dialog based) and added a CComboBox using the resource editor. I used the resource editor to specify the dropdown height. Then I added some code to add 100 texts to the combobox. If I run this simple application the dropdown height is ignored. If I disable the Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls 6.0.0.0 style (disable the pragma that adds it to the manifest file) then everything works fine. Has anyone noticed this behaviour (and knows a solution)? I've searched the web and msdn, but no luck so far.
