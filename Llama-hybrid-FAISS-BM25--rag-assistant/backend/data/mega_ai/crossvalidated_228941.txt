What is a good place to start working on using machine learning for credit risk modelling?

For my masters thesis,I need to work on credit risk modelling using machine learning. What are some of the resources to find some literature on the work that has currently been done in this area? Also any suggestions on what to do and what to implement as a starting point are welcome.
