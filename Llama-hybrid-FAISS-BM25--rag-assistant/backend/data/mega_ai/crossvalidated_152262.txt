What is the value of $\mu_0$ and $\kappa_0 $in $N(\mu_0,\sigma / \kappa_0)$?

In a Bayesian analysis I want to sample $\sigma \sim \text{inverse-Wishart}(\nu_0,M)$ where $\nu_0$ is the degrees of freedom, equal to dimension+1 and $M$ is a scalar matrix Then I will sample the $\mu$ from $\mu|\sigma \sim N(\mu_0,\sigma/\kappa_0)$. My question is, what is the value of $\mu_0$ and $\kappa_0$ and how can I determine my dimensions in the inverse-Wishart?
