Comment: If you were willing to make the (seemingly altogether unwarranted) assumption that the $35$ searches after modifications are from a normal population with $\sigma=16$ (unchanged by modifications), then you could do a z test of $H_0: \mu = 55$ vs. $H_a: \mu You would get test statistic $Z = -4.44$ and very small P-value ( 0.000 means $ rejecting $H_0$ in favor of $H_a,$ and concluding the modifications successfully reduced average search time. Output from the z-test procedure in Minitab (which accepts summarized data) is shown below: One-Sample Z Test of Î¼ = 55 vs (I am not calling this an "answer" because I don't believe it---and neither should you.) One way to do a realistic test would require you to use the sample SD of the 35 post-modification searches. (Another would require you to know the post-modification population standard deviation.)
