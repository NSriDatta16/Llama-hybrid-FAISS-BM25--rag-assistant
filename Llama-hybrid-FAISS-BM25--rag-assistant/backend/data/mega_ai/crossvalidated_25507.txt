This is a fairly standard problem in NLP, and the magic Google words you're looking for are "topic modeling". Although your strings are quite short, you may have some success with Latent Dirichlet Allocation , or a similar method. There's a nice blog post by Edwin Chen here , which lays out the general idea behind the algorithm. The details of implementation are covered in this note by Yi Wang. If you're looking for an off-the-shelf solution, I recommend trying out the topicmodels package for R, as this provides a reasonably nice interface to both LDA and a more sophisticated Correlated Topic Model. There's also a good list of implementations maintained by David Mimno here .
