Wasserstein (or EMD), once you multiply it by your bandwith, measures the "work" necessary to transform one distribution into another (by solving the optimal transport problem). Roughly that is the integral difference between the two distributions, multiplied by the distance between their centers (NOTE: this is an approximation only for the purpose of giving a simple explanation here, but Wassertein makes NO USE of centers/average of the distributions and IT DOES USE a distance matrix that is user-provided and can be asymmetric or use non-linear steps -- The figure attached makes use of a symmetric distance matrix built with linear steps equal to the bin size of the distributions). The wikipedia page explains everything with adequate math definitions: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric Below you can see the metrics with respect the reference BOLD BLUE.
