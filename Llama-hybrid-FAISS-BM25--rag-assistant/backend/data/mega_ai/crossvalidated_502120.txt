There's a lot of confusion of terms in moving between statistics and machine learning. These two terms are essentially synonyms. Covariate implies a separate, related, focal variable (e.g., the dependent variable in regression). You can talk about features without a focal variable in mind. But sometimes people talk about covariates without a specified dependent variable, and there's nothing wrong with calling your independent regression variables "features". a covariate has to be continuous ...that is not true.
