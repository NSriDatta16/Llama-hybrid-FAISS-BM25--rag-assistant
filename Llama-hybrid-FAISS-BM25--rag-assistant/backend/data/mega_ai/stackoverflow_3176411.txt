Chaining a function in JavaScript?

I want to make a function that add an item to my localStorage object. E.g.: alert(localStorage.getItem('names').addItem('Bill').getItem('names')); The first method is getItem which gets the item for localStorage objects... but addItem would be a custom function. This chain of functions would finally alert Bill. So, how would I make this function chain to localStorage?
