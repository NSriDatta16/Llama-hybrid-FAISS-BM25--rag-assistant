Why log-transforming the data before performing principal component analysis?

Im following a tutorial here: http://www.r-bloggers.com/computing-and-visualizing-pca-in-r/ to gain a better understanding of PCA. The tutorial uses the Iris dataset and applies a log transform prior to PCA: Notice that in the following code we apply a log transformation to the continuous variables as suggested by [1] and set center and scale equal to TRUE in the call to prcomp to standardize the variables prior to the application of PCA. Could somebody explain to me in plain English why you first use the log function on the the first four columns of the Iris dataset. I understand it has something to do with making data relative but am confused what's exactly the function of log, center and scale. The reference [1] above is to Venables and Ripley, Modern applied statistics with S-PLUS , Section 11.1 that briefly says: The data are physical measurements, so a sound initial strategy is to work on log scale. This has been done throughout.
