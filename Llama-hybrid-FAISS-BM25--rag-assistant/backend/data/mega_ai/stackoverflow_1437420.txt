It is a very subjective question and no right answer can be given. Right now, at this morning hour, with rainy weather outside, I'm inclined to propose that a state machine is being not much of an architectural pattern. State machine rather defines the dynamics of application operation, the prerequisites and conditions for the application being in one state and going to another. A structural organization mainly deals with static components, what are they, how they are interconnected and what their roles are. State machine may be regarded as simply one of the components. Or it can be considered the one and only component of the system that is worth considering. In that case it might be regarded as an architectural pattern. As I said, there is no right answer and no wrong answers.
