I'm not a java expert at all, but I know in .NET when doing a lot of large object memory allocation you can get heap fragmentation to the point where only small pieces of contiguous memory are available for allocation even though much more memory appears as "free". A quick google search on " java heap fragmentation " brings up some seemingly relevant result although I haven't taken a good look at them.
