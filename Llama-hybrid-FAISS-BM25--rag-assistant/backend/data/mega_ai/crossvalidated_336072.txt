This type of hypothesis test attempts to answer the question: What is the population average, $\mu$? In this case, we're asking: "Is the population average, $\mu = \mu_0$?" The population follows some distribution, however we never get to see it, which is why we're always trying to estimate $\mu$. If we knew the distribution, we wouldn't have to estimate anything :) We can however make assumptions on what we think the distribution is (Normal for Z test or Student T for T-test) and then run a hypothesis test to see if our observed data is reflective of a distribution with mean $\mu_0$. In other words: If the true population distribution follows a T-distribution, say, with mean $\mu_0$, how unlikely is it that we observe this sample data? This involves calculating a T-statistic, $T$, and running either a one-tail or two-tailed test. Then look at your p-value and make a call. See here for more details on this procedure. In your case, we are given sample data and summary statistics such as $\bar{x}$, $s$ and $n$. And I suspect that $\mu_0 = 1 - 4\% = 96\%$ given the wording of the question and observed sample values. This is all you need to calculate the T-statistic. I'll it leave you to determine if it's a one or two tail test.
