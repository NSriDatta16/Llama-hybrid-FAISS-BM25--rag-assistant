Algorithm for a planning tool

I'm writing a small software application that needs to serve as a simple planning tool for a local school. The 'problem' it needs to solve is fairly basic. Namely, the teachers need to talk with the parents of all children. However, some children have, of course, brothers and sisters in different groups, so these talks need to be scheduled next to eachother, to avoid the situations were parents have a talk at 6 pm and another one at 10 pm. Thus in short, given a collection of n children, where some children have 1 or more brothers or sisters, generate a schedule where all the talks of these children are planned next to each other. Now, maybe the problem can be solved extremely easy, but on the other I have a feeling this can be a pretty complicated problem, that needs and can be solved with some sort of algorithm. Elegantly. But am I right? Is there? I've looked at the Hungarian alorithm but it doesn't quite apply to this particular problem. Edit: I forgot to mention, that all talks take the same amount of time. Thanks!
