Prepend table name to each column in a result set in SQL? (Postgres specifically)

How can I get the label of each column in a result set to prepend the name if its table? I want this to happen for queries on single tables as well as joins. Example: SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person; I want the results to be: | person.first_name | person.last_name | |-------------------|------------------| | Wendy | Melvoin | | Lisa | Coleman | I could use "AS" to define an alias for each column, but that would be tedious. I want this to happen automatically. SELECT first_name AS person.first_name, last_name AS person.last_name FROM person; The reason for my question is that I am using a database driver that does not provide the meta-data informing me the database column from where the result set got its data. I am trying to write generic code to handle the result set. I would like to know how to do this in SQL generally, or at least in Postgres specifically. SQLite had such a feature, though I see it is now inexplicably deprecated. SQLite has two pragma settings: full_column_names & short_column_names .
