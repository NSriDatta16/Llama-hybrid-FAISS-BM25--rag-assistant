How do I draw the following Keras model?

I am new to deep learning models, and I am trying to figure out the best way to draw a visual representation of the following model. I found a few tools that allow you to draw a model, but I am confused about what the 'best' way to draw this particular model would be. Any suggestions or recommendations would be great. Thanks!
