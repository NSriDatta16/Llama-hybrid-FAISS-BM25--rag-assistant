Youtube embedded video keeps hiding my JavaScript popup dialogs

I tried playing with z-index, and also tried setting the wmode to "opaque". Nonthing worked.. It keeps hiding my popup dialogs.. Here is the current iframe code EDIT : As pointed out below, using "embed" and opaque wmode solves the problem. But I cannot find any solution for YouTube's new style of embedding using iframe
