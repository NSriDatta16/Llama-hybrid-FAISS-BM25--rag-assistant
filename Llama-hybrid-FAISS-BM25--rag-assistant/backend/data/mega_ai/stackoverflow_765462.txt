Portfiles must be organized in the following fashion: $LOCAL_PORT_DIR/{category}/{portname}/ All files, including Portfile , go under that directory. In your case, your local port dir is /Users/Masi/bin/MacPorts/ports , and your port, git-svn , is in the category git , so your directory structure should look like this: /Users/Masi/bin/MacPorts/ports/git/git-svn/Portfile (In the special case of git-svn , though, you can always install the port git-core with the variant +svn , like so: $ sudo port install git-core +svn .) (Also, as another side note, Git-related ports are typically organized under the category "devel", not "git".)
