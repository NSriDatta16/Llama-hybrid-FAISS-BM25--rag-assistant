Does It make sense to interprete variables with low accuracy but high R squared in Random Forest?

I did random forest analysis and I obtained two graphs. In the first one (left hand side) we can see the measure of importance of each predictor and on the second one (right hand side) is the proportion of variance explained by each predictor in random forest. I am not sure about the interpretation of some predictors. For instance, the predictor forest cover has negative value for accuracy importance (indicating the predictor explains little or nothing), but the proportion of variance explained ($R^2$) is the highest for that predictor. Does it make sense to interpret variables with high $R^2$ values even if the accuracy of those predictors are zero (or negative)?
