tl;dr If you run the simulation longer things work as expected. UCB definition First off, let's be explicit about what we mean by a UCB algorithm. Since we have a small number of arms, we first select each arm once. Define $n_j(t)$ as the number of times arm $j$ has been selected over the first $t$ actions, $\hat{\mu}_j^t$ as the sample average for arm $j$ . At iteration $t > N$ , we select an action which maximizes the upper confidence bound, $$\hat{\mu}_j^t + \sqrt{\frac{c \log(t) }{n_j(t-1)}}.$$ The parameter $c$ controls how much the algorithm prioritizes exploration. A standard choice is $c=6$ (e.g. in these notes ). In your experiments, you set $c = 1, \sqrt{2}, 2$ . Lower bound: Gaussian case The lower bound is derived by using a bound on the expected number of times a suboptimal arm is selected. Specifically Lai and Robbins showed that for suboptimal $j$ , $\mathbb{E}[n_j(t)] \ge \frac{\log(t)}{KL(p_j \| p_{j^*})} = \frac{\log(t)}{\Delta_j^2}$ , where the last inequality holds for the standard Gaussian case. From this it's easy to get the gap dependent lower bound as $$\sum_{j \neq j^*} \mathbb{E}[n_j(t)] \Delta_j = \sum_{j \neq j^*} \frac{2}{\Delta_j} \log(t)$$ Simulations and Hypothesis I've run simulations for the setting you describe (means from the standard normal, and standard normal measurement noise). Since $c=6$ shows up in the literature, I used somewhat different values ( $c=2,3,6$ ) than you did. The cumulative regret over 1 million iterations averaged over 100 runs is plotted below: Two take-aways: Over a long time horizon, the lower bound is accurate. Note that even though $c=2$ is still below the lower bound, the gap is shrinking over time. Choosing overly small $c$ may lead to bad upper bounds on the regret, especially if the algorithm fails to distinguish between the best and second best arm. This still leaves the question of why the bound is violated for small $t$ , since the Lai & Robbins bound should hold not just at the limit as $t\to \infty$ . I'll update my answer if I figure out what's going on there.
