I think the confusion arises from the term "iterations". Here's the process in the terminology I'm familiar with: 3-fold CV: shuffle data split into k = 3 segments (aka folds) for each fold: calculate surrogate model without the fold in question and test the cases of the left-out fold. after all k = 3 folds are done, calculate MSE as average squared error over all cases (= of all 3 folds). Iterated k-fold CV (aka repeated k-fold CV) repeats/iterates that whole process 1. - 4. e.g. 100 times. You then have 100 MSEs, each of them calculated on all cases. (Only difference is that the surrogate models were trained with slightly different training sets). Unfortunately, there's a whole lot of confusion about terminology for various flavors of cross validation. For the moment, I recommend to always describe in detail what you did. I've met your procedures that shuffle freshly for each surrogate model under the name of set validation. In your case with 1/3 of all cases set aside for testing, and yes, also that procedure can be iterated or repeated - whether you do 3 or 100 repetitions is up to you, but there's no connection (unlike in k-fold CV) between the fraction of cases reserved for testing and the number of repetitions (aka iterations).
