You could use a logistic regression on the years of experience and see whether the resulting coefficient is significantly different from zero. I agree with @NickAdams that you should definitely not discretize your continuous years-of-experience variable. This is very bad practice. See, e.g., here ("Much is lost and nothing gained by a median split.") or here or here . Everything that is bad about dichotomizing continuous variables also applies to splitting continuous variables into more than two bins.
