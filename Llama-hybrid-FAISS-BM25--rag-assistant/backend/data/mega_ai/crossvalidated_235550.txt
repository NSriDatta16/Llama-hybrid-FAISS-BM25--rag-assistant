An unbiased estimator of the ratio of two regression coefficients?

Suppose you fit a linear/logistic regression $g(y) = a_0 + a_1\cdot x_1 + a_2\cdot x_2$, with the aim of an unbiased estimate of $\frac{a_1}{a_2}$. You are very confident that both $a_1$ and $a_2$ are very positive relative to the noise in their estimations. If you have the joint covariance of $a_1, a_2$, you could calculate, or at least simulate the answer. Are there any better ways, and in real-life problems with a lot of data, how much trouble do you get in for taking the ratio of estimates, or for taking a half-step and assuming the coefficients are independent?
