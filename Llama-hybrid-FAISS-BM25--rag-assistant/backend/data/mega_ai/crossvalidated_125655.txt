Result of K-Means Algorithm Not Desired

I am learning about K-means algorithm, and I have generated a dataset with 150000 data points, with 10000 points per cluster. (Scatter plot at the bottom) When I run K-means on the dataset, I first randomly pick 15 data points as initial centers, and then use the traditional iterative approach to update the centers until convergence. However, this gives undesired results, a sample as follows: Cluster 0: 14.136004, 48.625093 Cluster 1: 82.353156, 43.582929 Cluster 2: 45.823547, 61.650882 Cluster 3: 58.467780, 90.994505 Cluster 4: 79.734026, 78.028310 Cluster 5: 58.467912, 91.018907 Cluster 6: 89.781302, 26.638219 Cluster 7: 75.079899, 97.764001 Cluster 8: 63.669296, 73.583218 Cluster 9: 41.334973, 19.812627 Cluster 10: 75.589260, 97.997850 Cluster 11: 73.342196, 63.601545 Cluster 12: 81.802223, 43.727663 Cluster 13: 93.317351, 91.788683 Cluster 14: 82.203258, 44.138953 I have two questions: Note that Cluster 1, 12, and 14 correspond to the same cluster, yet the algorithm converges there. Is this normal for the outcome of K-means algorithm? Is it possible that when we re-calculate the location of a new center, the set of points we average over is empty? i.e. for all data points, they are nearer to some other center than the particular center we try to calculate?
