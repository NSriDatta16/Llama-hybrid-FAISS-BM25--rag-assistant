Intelligent agents "tutorial"

I've recently come across Intelligent Agents by reading this book : link text I'm interested in finding a good book for beginners, so I can start to implement such a system. I've also tried reading "Multiagent Systems : A modern approach to distributed artificial intelligence" (can't find it on amazon) but it's not what I'm looking for. Thanks for the help :).
