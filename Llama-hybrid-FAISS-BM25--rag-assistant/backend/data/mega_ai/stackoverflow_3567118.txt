The VB.NET and C# IDEs merely look the same. They are actually very different chunks of code that don't have much in common beyond the text editor engine. They did a pretty good job making them look similar, it certainly wasn't that way in earlier releases of VS. But there are subtle differences here and there, like the ones you are fretting over. You'll need to get over this. Pick, say, global warming or the economy to direct your rage. Or a hapless contributor to SO :)
