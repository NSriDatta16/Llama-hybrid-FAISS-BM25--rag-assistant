Performance of recursive stored procedures in MYSQL to get hierarchical data

I have table employee like, employee ( emp_id int primary key, emp_name varchar(50), mngr_id int) and here mngr_id would either null or contain valid emp_id. This way it form the hierarchy of employees in the organization. In order to traverse the entire hierarchy I had to write the recursive stored procedure. (in Oracle it's easy by using CONNECT BY .. START WITH) So the question is that what is the performance impact of such stored procedure given that the level of hierarchy would not go beyond 10 levels ! Is there any other way to achieve the same ?
