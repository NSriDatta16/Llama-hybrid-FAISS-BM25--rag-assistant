comparison of proportion to a population CI

I am comparing the % of minorities from my organization to a population % of minorities, to see if it is high or low. I have data for my whole organization (not a sample) so I do not show CIs. The “population” data is a sample and thus has CIs. For example, see the below (hypothetical) data. Question #1: if my organization value is within the CI population range, can say it is “consistent” with the population data? Question #2: If my organization value is outside the CI population range interval, is it correct to stay there is a statistically significant difference, or should I just say it is “higher” or “lower” compared to the population?
