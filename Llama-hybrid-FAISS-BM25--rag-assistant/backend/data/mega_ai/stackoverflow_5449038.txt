What interpreted language can i leverage for debugging?

I spoke about developing a programming language. Instead of making it compiled i am considering making it interpreted. So what i like to do is parse the syntax myself, build the AST and output source in an existing scripting language. The thing i'd like to know is what interpreted language can i leverage for debugging? I'd like a call stack, file/source name and line #, to modify variables on the fly, etc. What IDE must i use? i like visual studios but i presume it has no support for any interpreted languages
