Partially answered in comments: To my understanding, there is no requirement of independence per se in the incoming signals themselves (otherwise what would be the point of the ICA?). Its the results that are independent. What is important for the ICA is that the data are "full rank". That is, none of the input signals can be completely defined by some combination of the other signals. For example if the average reference was also an input signal. Note that the AR would not have to correlate particular well with any other channel. Matlab has the function "rank" for this. Which EEGLAB uses to check prior to ICA. â€“ Mensen
