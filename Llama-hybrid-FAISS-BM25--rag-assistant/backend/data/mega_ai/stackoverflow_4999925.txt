urlencode() has nothing to do with SQL, so it does as much to prevent SQL injection as kerosene does to make your burgers more delicious. Besides, everything that enters your database will end up URL encoded, which you then have to decode if you want to do anything useful with them after retrieving the database. Escaping your queries, on the other hand, helps your application to guard against SQL injection, and nothing more. It does not modify the data you enter into your queries; it only protects your queries from being tampered with. That's the idea of SQL injection, and it's also why URL encoding your data doesn't do anything to protect against it. Granted, it does turn your apostrophes ' into %27 , rendering them harmless, but as mentioned in the above paragraph, you'll have to URL decode them back into apostrophes in order to use them. Use the right tool for the right purpose. Especially in the year 2011, you should be using prepared statements instead of manually escaping your query variables and concatenating strings to form queries.
