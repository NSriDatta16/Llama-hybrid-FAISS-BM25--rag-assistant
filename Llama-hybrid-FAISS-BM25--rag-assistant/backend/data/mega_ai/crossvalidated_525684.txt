Classification - Modelling Irreversible Process

I am interested in classification problems on time series (or any set of inputs where order must be preserved) where you have additional information about the target variable that once it changes class, it cannot change back i.e. modelling some irreversible process . Let me give an example below to illustrate: Suppose you are classifying the presence of an irreversible condition in humans (e.g. arthritis present, arthritis not present - assuming that once arthritis has developed it is unfortunately permanent). You are using a classification model on time series data (where you have data from across multiple people), and a number of input features e.g. Features/Inputs: X1 = Age, X2 = Cumulative Miles Ran, X3 = Family History Quantified Target Variable to be Modelled: Y = 1 if Arthritis Present and 0 If not As the process of Arthritis is unfortunately irreversible, when the target variable changes from 0 to 1 (for a given person) it does not change back e.g. an example of your dataset for a given person might look like: Time Person X1. X2 X3. | Y 2010 1 50 1000 0.7 0 2011 1 51 2000 0.7 0 2012 1 52 3000 0.7 0 ... 2018 1 58 20000 0.7 1 2019 1 59 22000 0.7 1 2020 1 60 24000 0.7 1 My question is: Do any techniques or methods exist for incorporating this additional information in your model? i.e. occurrence of the negative class cannot occur after the positive class My ideas would be: A) using a sequence model B) or feeding previous predictions in c) custom loss function to additionally penalise class changes - is there any literature on this?
