I would say you have a couple issues here. First, yes, your sample is too small for so many covariates. You have a lot of danger of overfitting. There are various rules of thumb - I've often seen 10 per covariate - but it partly depend on how the different IVs relate to each other. Second, since the DV is likert scaled, you probably don't want OLS (linear) regression. I'd look at ordinal logistic regression. However, this makes for even stricter limits on sample size per covariate. Third, you don't have a simple random sample; you got 33 people from 8 agencies. So, it's not a simple random sample from a population. It's not completely clear what it actually is (cluster sampling, probably).
