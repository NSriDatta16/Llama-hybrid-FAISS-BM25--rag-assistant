No! The code doesn't mean it only check IE. There are two example in the zip, first one is --> --> second one is: --> It's night-time, a UFO flies over the pasture, cows grazing The UFO tries to abduct two cows using a tractorbeam, however the cows appear to be too heavy to be lifted off the ground It's daytime again, cows are still grazing, one cow looks very relieved --> --> and works as a pair. They are just like if (!isIE){ //... } . And what it means is IE will ignore the code inside the pair (pay attention to the ! which means "not"). They are actually not related to Flash detection. Flash detection(in fact it's graceful degradation) is done by using the characteristic that when the plug-in is not present, its object/embed tag will be ignored and the HTML inside those tags will be displayed. If Flash is not present, for the first one, will be displayed. For the second, it's It's night-time, a UFO flies over the pasture, cows grazing The UFO tries to abduct two cows using a tractorbeam, however the cows appear to be too heavy to be lifted off the ground It's daytime again, cows are still grazing, one cow looks very relieved
