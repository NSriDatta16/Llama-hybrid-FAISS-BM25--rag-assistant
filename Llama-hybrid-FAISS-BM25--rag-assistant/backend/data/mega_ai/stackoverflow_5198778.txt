AvalonEdit doesn't have any redundant text storage - setting the Text property directly writes to the underlying document. I would suspect that you aren't setting the Text correctly; or that it's your app that is somehow restoring the old value. Are you using some kind of data-binding on the Document property; or on the Text property? (the latter doesn't support data-binding)
