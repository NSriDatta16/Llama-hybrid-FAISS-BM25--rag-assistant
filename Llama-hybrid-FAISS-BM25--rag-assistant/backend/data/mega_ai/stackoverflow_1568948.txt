Eclipse packages and folders and such

I am creating a project with eclipse, but am unfamiliar with their folder structure. I want to create a folder to keep a bunch of game objects in of a particular type (an attempt at organization), but they extend a class from a different folder... When I try to do this I get errors saying that the class cannot be resolved to a type... If i create the same game object in the folder of the superclass, it works fine... How do I extend classes from another folder? How do I create a folder in the workspace view that does not affect the references between folders?
