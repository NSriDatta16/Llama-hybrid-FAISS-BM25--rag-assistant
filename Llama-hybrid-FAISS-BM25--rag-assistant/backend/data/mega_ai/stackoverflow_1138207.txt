Some of the books I have in my library that you might find useful are: Tcl and the Tk Toolkit (Ousterhout) - The book on Tcl/Tk, and probably the one you're referring to. It's old and some of the information is a bit out-dated, but it is fantastic (and, I believe, I say that without exaggerating) at showing how to program in Tcl. It was written by the originator of the language. Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk (Welch) - The other book on Tcl/Tk that nearly everyone that programs in it seriously has in their library. Brent did an amazing job on this book. Effective Tcl/Tk Programming: Writing Better Programs with Tcl and Tk (Harrison, McLennon) - Once you get to larger, more complex, programs, this book can be very handy to have read. It goes into organization and the like. This book is likely beyond what you need at the moment, but I mention it because it's a very good read as you get deeper into Tcl. It's also worth bookmarking the Tcler's Wiki . It can feel a bit unorganized at times, but there's more information there than... well, anywhere. It's an amazing resource. The ActiveTcl distribution is, indeed the way to go. The folks over at ActiveState are a smart bunch.
