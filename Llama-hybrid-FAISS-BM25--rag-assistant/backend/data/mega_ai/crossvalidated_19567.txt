Quantifying effect of a categorical variable in time series analysis

I have a dependent variable ($y$ axis in the pictured graph) trending over time ($x$ axis). I also have a categorical variable, which was constant until one point in time, then changed to another value, with which value it has remained constant since; that point in time is indicated in the picture by a break in the pictured graph. What test can I use to find the effect size of the categorical variable?
