When using GridSearchCV with XGBoost, be sure that you have the latest versions of XGBoost and SKLearn and take particular care with njobs!=1 explanation . import xgboost as xgb from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV xgb_model = xgb.XGBClassifier() optimization_dict = {'max_depth': [2,4,6], 'n_estimators': [50,100,200]} model = GridSearchCV(xgb_model, optimization_dict, scoring='accuracy', verbose=1) model.fit(X,y) print(model.best_score_) print(model.best_params_) Word of advice with XGBoost, careful with overfitting. In your particular situation, I suggest Catboost since it is optimized for categoricals.
