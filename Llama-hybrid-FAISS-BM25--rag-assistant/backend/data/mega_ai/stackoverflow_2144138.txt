Choice of DB I think that the choice of type of database you make depends less on how many computers the system is hosted on. I think this should be more a function of the quality of data that you want/need to preserve. For example, if you need to store the shipping addresses for a customer, you will need to account for that in your storage structure. A name value pair may seem an easy enough structure to begin with, but if you foresee any of the following, you should consider moving to a standard database system keeping track of changes reporting activity / reports concurrent users Performance This is dependent on your code, images, content, caching, etc just as much as it is on your database.
