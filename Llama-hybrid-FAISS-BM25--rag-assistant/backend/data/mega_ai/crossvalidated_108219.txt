As stated in this paper , Eq. (12), the $(i, j)$ element of the variance-covariance matrix for logistic regression is $\frac{\partial^2l(\hat\beta)}{\partial\hat\beta_i\partial\hat\beta_j}$, where $l(\hat\beta)$ is the log-conditional likelihood of coefficients $\hat\beta$ given the observed data. As stated in this paper , Eq. 2.1, the log-conditional likelihood for ridge-regularized logistic regression with parameter $\lambda$ is defined as $l^\lambda(\hat\beta) := l(\hat\beta) - \lambda\hat\beta'\hat\beta$. Hence, if we define $V(\hat\beta)$ to be the variance-covariance matrix of non-regularized logistic regression, then the variance-covariance matrix of ridge-regularized logistic regression is $V^\lambda(\hat\beta) = V(\hat\beta) - 2\lambda I$.
