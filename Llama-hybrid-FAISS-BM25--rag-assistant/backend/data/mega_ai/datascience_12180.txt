Using Neural Networks to extract multiple parameters from images

I want to extract parameters from an image using a neural network. Example: Given an image of a brick wall the NN should extract the width and height of the bricks, the color and the roughness. I can generate images for given parameters to train the NN and want to use it to extract the parameters from an actual image. I've looked into CNNs. Can I perform this task with them? Do I need special learning algorithms to extract multiple parameters instead of classification? Are there any NNs that are designed for such tasks?
