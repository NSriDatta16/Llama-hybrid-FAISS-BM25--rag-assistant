I have a pre-defined project in Eclipse which is blank except for a utility that parses a JNLP file and downloads all the jars specified in the jnlp codebase. Optionally, you can replace any jars with updated code you want to test here. It uses reflection to add all the jars to the classpath (which is a hack) and then reflectivly invokes the main method of the class specified as the main-class in the JNLP with any arguments. Unfortunately I can't share the source for this but it only took me a day to get it running. The class path hack is available here: How should I load Jars dynamically at runtime? Should work well with any debugging.
