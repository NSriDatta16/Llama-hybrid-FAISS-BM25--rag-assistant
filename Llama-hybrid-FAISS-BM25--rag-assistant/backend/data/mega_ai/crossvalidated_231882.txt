Does the range of a variable make a difference to its weight in principle component analysis?

I have a set of 6 statistics which I have measured on many simulations, and I have combined them using PCA to use just the two first principle components. But looking at the relative importance of each of the statistics in my PCs, some of them seem to have surprisingly low weights given that I know they separate my simulations very well. To give an example, statistic A varies very nicely across my simulated parameter space with small standard deviations, but has weights of less than 0.1 in most of the principle components! I have noticed that statistic A has a small dynamic range (varies between 0.01 and 0.2) while others have much bigger ranges (varying form 2 to 8, for example). Would this cause it to have a lower weighing in my analysis?
