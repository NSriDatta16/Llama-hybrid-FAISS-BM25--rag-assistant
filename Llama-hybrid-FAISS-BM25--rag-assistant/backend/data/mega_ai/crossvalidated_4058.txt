Testing nonlinearity in logistic regression (or other forms of regression)

One of the assumption of logistic regression is the linearity in the logit. So once I got my model up and running I test for nonlinearity using Box-Tidwell test. One of my continuous predictors (X) has tested positive for nonlinearity. What am I suppose to do next? As this is a violation of the assumptions shall I get rid of the predictor (X) or include the nonlinear transformation (X*X). Or transform the variable into a categorical? If you have a reference could you please point me to that too?
