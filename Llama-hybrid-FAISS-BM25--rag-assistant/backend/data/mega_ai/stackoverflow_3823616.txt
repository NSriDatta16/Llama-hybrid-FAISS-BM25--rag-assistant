Subscribing to touch events from UILabel or UIImage

I have a controller managing a complex view which contains, among other objects, some labels and images. How can I subscribe to touch events to some of the labels and images from my controller? The problem is that UIView does not have a TouchDown event (unlike UIButton for example). Two workarounds came to mind, which are both clumsy: Put some invisible buttons about the labels and images I want to handle Derive my own label and button components and override TouchesBegan Is there any better way? In case it matters: I created the using interface builder. Thanks, Adrian
