By Default libSVM find the optimal hyper-parameters, for the SVM model using cross validation methods and by using Accuracy (for classification), or Mean Square Error (for regression) as a measure for evaluation. Weka has several other evaluation metric to find the optimal parameters (using the gridSearch) If the metric you are interested is not there, the simplest solution that comes to mind is to write a little program that would perform cross validation, and optimize the parameters of the model based on your measure of choice.
