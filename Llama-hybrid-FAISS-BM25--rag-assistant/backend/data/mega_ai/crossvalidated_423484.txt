How can we apply the rule of stationary distribution to the continuous case of Markov chain?

If the Markov chain converged then $$\pi = Q* \pi$$ where $ \pi$ is the posterior distribution and $Q$ is the transition distribution(it's a matrix in the discrete case). I tried to apply that on the continuous case of Markov chain in this example where the transition distribution is: $$p(X_{t+1} | X_t=x_t) = \text{N}(\phi x_t, 1)$$ and the posterior(stationary) distribution is $$X_t \sim \text{N} \Bigg( 0, \frac{1}{1-\phi^2} \Bigg)$$ The product of them both doesn't equal the posterior.
