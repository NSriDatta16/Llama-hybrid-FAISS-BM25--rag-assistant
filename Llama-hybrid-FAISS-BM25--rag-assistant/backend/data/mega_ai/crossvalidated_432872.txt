why a variable is significant but not coefficients in logistic regression?

My question is, in logistic regression ,why a variable is significant with a p-value less than 0.05 but no level is significant. In R glm(response~var1+var2+var3, family=binomial(link='logit'),data=data) drop1(model, test = 'Chisq') all variable with less than ***, except var2 with * but in summary(model) the coefficients associated with var2 are not significant. Thanks for any help!!!
