Get percentage average

I'm unsure how to go about this either because it late, or I'm a MySQL noob (probably both to be honest). I have a table called 'poll_votes' which comprises of: ID, poll_id, answer_id, ip, time_posted What I need to do, is for each unique answer_id in a specific poll_id, calculate the percentage out of the total number of answers that the answer_id counts for. I'm not really good at wording what I need to do, so here is what the query should return (single row): total -> total number of answers for this poll_id [0] -> the percentage of 'total' that this makes up eg. 32 (%) [1] -> the percentage of 'total' that this makes up eg. 16 (%) [2] -> the percentage of 'total' that this makes up eg. 52 (%) Obviously, all the percentages added together should equal one hundred. Also to note, that the field names for each percentage returned are not necessarily in any order. I mean even if the query just returned the total and the number of votes for each answer_id, I'd be able to calculate it easily in PHP. Could anyone give me any pointers? Edit: This is what I have so far, but it doesn't work: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM poll_votes) AS total, answer_id, COUNT(answer_id) / total * 100 AS percentage GROUP BY answer_id
