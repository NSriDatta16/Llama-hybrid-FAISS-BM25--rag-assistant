Magento: Building a store URL in CMS-syntax, using a variable

I am building an e-mail template. I want to build a URL like this: http://store.com/path/to/page?shipmentid=123 This code builds the correct URL: {{store url='path/to/page' _query_shipmentid=123}} But the 123 part should be dynamic. I need it to pull from this variable: {{var shipment.id}} Is this even possible? I'm looking for something like this: {{store url='path/to/page' _query_shipmentid=shipment.id}}
