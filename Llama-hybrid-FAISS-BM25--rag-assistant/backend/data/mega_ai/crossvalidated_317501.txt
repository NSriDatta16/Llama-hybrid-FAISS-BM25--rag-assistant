I have implemented a parent/child approach to problems like this. The "children" ... subsets can be modeled along with the composite. The composite series is used as a predictor for each of the child models. To make a forecast for the child we incorporate the future expectations for the parent. Reconciling the forecasts is then straightforward. The advantage of this approach is the input or causal series can be different for each child and for the parent. http://autobox.com/dave/regvsbox.pdf (which I authored) discusses issues/differences/opportunities/pitfalls when dealing with time series that your possible regression solutions may be ignoring. You will want to stay very clear of regression approaches which assume independent (i.e. non-time series ) data and other things such as no pulses .. no step/level shifts .. no trends etc.
