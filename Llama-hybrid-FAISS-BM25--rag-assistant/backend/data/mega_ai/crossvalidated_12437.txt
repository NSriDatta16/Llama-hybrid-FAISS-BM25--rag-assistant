There are so many narrow aspects calculating prediction intervals : data generating process and the model used to described this process (time series model, regression model), is your data stationary (for this type your conclusion is wrong as stationary data is not tending to run far from its mean value) or explosive (for an integrated process you will see something that you described). I think that an excellent review by Chris Chatfield regarding Prediction Intervals will answer most of your questions. Regarding unit sales: since you have a short forecasting interval you may try to forecast by exponential smoothing (in R it is the ets() function from forecast ) another option would be to model it like ARIMA process (the same library has auto.arima() ) in micro-econometrics, however, regression models are preferable to a-theoretic ones, but in the short run they not necessarily beat the first two Both cases has formulas to calculate the prediction intervals and are discussed in above-mentioned review (commonly the normality of the residuals is assumed, but this is not a crucial assumption).
