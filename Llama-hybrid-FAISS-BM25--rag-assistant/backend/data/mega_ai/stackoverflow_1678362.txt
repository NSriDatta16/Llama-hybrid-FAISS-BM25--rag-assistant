If by "binary file" you mean a data file ripped from the mysql data directory, I doubt very much you could use a data file created by one storage engine to populate a table in another storage engine. If by "binary file" you mean a mysqldump, then yes, that should be no trouble. Mysqldump should have included a create table statement for you - in case it hasn't, you can do it yourself (do a SHOW CREATE TABLE t and copy the result). You can also move tables between storage engines without dumping/reloading them, using ALTER TABLE t ENGINE = e;
