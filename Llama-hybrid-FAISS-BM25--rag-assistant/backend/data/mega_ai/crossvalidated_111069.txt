Is there some theory of SVMs with infinitely many data?

I am trying to understand what does it means to have a (linear) SVM classifier (with soft margins) given the generative model of the data. And I realize I have not seen any paper on it, nor can I extend the theory by myself. At least two problems: the penalty term $C \sum \xi_i$ will become unbounded. There will be infinitely many finite $\xi_i$. there will be infinitely many restrictions $y(w.x_i - b) \ge 1-\xi_i$ Any suggestions or references? thanks
