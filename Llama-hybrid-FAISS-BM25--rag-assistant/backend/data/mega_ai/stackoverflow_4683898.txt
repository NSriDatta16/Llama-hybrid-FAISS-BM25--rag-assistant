Start with PHP. Javascript is occasionally used for working with PHP on the page (ie., get database info without having to click a "submit" button or navigate to another page.) It is used, for example, to make people's Facebook statuses appear on your homepage in real time. I programmed PHP for years and haven't learned any JS until just recently, so don't worry about it for now. The posted tutorials (especially on w3) are excellent. There is an excellent tutorial that describes exactly what you are trying to do at devarticles , but it requires a VERY basic understanding of SQL. The example in the tutorial is also fairly unsecure, but it'll teach you the basics of working with MySQL and PHP sessions. You'll need to run the scripts on a sever that has PHP and MySQL on it, so pay attention to these things when you're looking for hosting.
