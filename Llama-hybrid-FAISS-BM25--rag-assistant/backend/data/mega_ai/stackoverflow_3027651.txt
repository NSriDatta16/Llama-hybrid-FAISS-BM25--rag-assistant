Vertical crosshair reposition on Google Map after map resize Issue

I use the following function to add a crosshair to my Google Map. It works great for horizontal resizing. I can not figure out how to make it work for vertical. After resizing the map it requires the user to either zoom in or out 1 layer, upon which the crosshair snaps to center. var crosshairsSize=17; GMap2.prototype.addCrosshairs=function(){ var container=this.getContainer(); if(this.crosshairs){$(this.crosshairs).remove();} var crosshairs=document.createElement("img"); crosshairs.src='../images/crosshair2.gif'; crosshairs.style.width=crosshairsSize+'px'; crosshairs.style.height=crosshairsSize+'px'; crosshairs.style.border='0'; crosshairs.style.position='relative'; crosshairs.style.top=((parseInt(container.clientHeight)-crosshairsSize)/2)+'px'; crosshairs.style.left="0px"; // The map is centered so 0 will do crosshairs.style.zIndex='500'; container.appendChild(crosshairs); this.crosshairs=crosshairs; return crosshairs;}; I use map.checkResize(); and the map is correct, it's just the crosshair that is off. I've tried firing a javascript zoom in one level but it doesn't work like zooming in with the mouse. It's only zooming in/out with the mouse scroll wheel too... clicking and dragging the zoom slider doesn't work so somehow it's liking the mouse scroll wheel. Firing addCrosshairs(); after resize makes no difference. It places the new crosshair in old spot and still requires a mouse scroll zoom.
