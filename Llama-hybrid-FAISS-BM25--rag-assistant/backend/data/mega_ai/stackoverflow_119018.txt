How do I prevent SoapExtensions being added to my web service app?

It seems that anyone can snoop on incoming/outgoing .NET web service SOAP messages just by dropping in a simple SoapExtension into the bin folder and then plumbing it in using: Is there a way to prevent SOAP extensions from loading or to be asked in my app (through an event or some such mechanism) whether it's ok to load ? @Hurst: thanks for the answer. I know about message level encryption/WS-Security and was hoping not to have to go that road. We have classic ASP clients using the service and that opens a small world of pain. There are SSL certs on the site running the web service but I was kinda hoping that I could discourage the client from tinkering with soap extensions as they have developers who have some ability to 'play'.
