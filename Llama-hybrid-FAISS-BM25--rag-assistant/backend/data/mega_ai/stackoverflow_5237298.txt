What is the best practice to create a scheduled notification at some point in the future? AlarmManager . This seems a bit like abusing the service to do something it is not supposed to be doing. Ummm...why? Is there another less cumbersome / more elegant method of achieving the same end? Setting an alarm requires a total of 3 to 4 Java statements, plus one for any extra you package into the Intent . Processing the alarm in a BroadcastReceiver to go raise a Notification regarding the "daily reminder" should be another ~20 lines of code, plus one entry in the manifest.
