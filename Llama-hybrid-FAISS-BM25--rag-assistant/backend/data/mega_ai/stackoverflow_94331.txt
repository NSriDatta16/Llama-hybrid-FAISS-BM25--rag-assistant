How can I reduce Eclipse Ganymede's memory use?

I use the recent Ganymede release of Eclipse, specifically the distro for Java EE and web developers. I have installed a few additional plugins (e.g. Subclipse, Spring, FindBugs) and removed all the Mylyn plugins. I don't do anything particularly heavy-duty within Eclipse such as starting an app server or connecting to databases, yet for some reason, after several hours use I see that Eclipse is using close to 500MB of memory. Does anybody know why Eclipse uses so much memory (leaky?), and more importantly, if there's anything I can do to improve this?
