Scrollview and image dragging issue

I have a scrollview that has a number of custom imageviews in it. I use the custom imageviews as I need to be able to drag any one of them off the scrollview and to another location on the iPad screen, bit like a photo picker. Problem is if I want to scroll the scroll view most of the time the custom imageview gets the touch and moves rather than the desired scroll? I notice in the sample code from Apple using the autoscroll example that they have the same issue but they have left a large gap between the images....ugly! Is there a way to let the app know when you want the touch to be a scroll and when to be a drag? Thanks
