Is a high number of support vectors a sign of overfitting?

I've tuned a SVM with radial kernel that has training error about 10%, but test error is about 38%, which surprise me. I tried to understand what may cause this and noticed the number of support vectors is high, about 50% of the observation are support vectors. Is this the cause of the problem? Does high number of support vectors leads to a high variance SVM? Here is the summary of the SVM. Parameters: SVM-Type: C-classification SVM-Kernel: radial cost: 31.62 gamma: 1e-04 Number of Support Vectors: 117 ( 58 59 ) Number of Classes: 2 Levels: high low
