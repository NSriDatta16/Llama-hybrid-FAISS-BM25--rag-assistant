According to the sklearn.svm.SVR documentation, the negative $R^2$ value indicates that your model is arbitrarily worse than the trend line on trainY. By default you should check the following: Does your model have a bias/intercept? If not you may observe negative $R^2$ . Is testY derived from your training data? Am I using a linear function to fit the data? You are as you have chosen: SVR(kernel = 'linear') If you've answered 'Yes' to each of those, you will realize that the average of testY provides a better prediction of the test data than the model fit by sklearn.svm.SVR. Therefore, if you believe such a model exists (one that outperforms the average of testY), you'll likely find it with more/different predictor variables.
