Clustered indexes are great for range based queries. For example, a log date or order date. Putting one on Artist, Album, and Song will [probably] cause fragmentation when you insert new rows. If your DB supports it, add a non-clustered primary key on Artist, Album, and Song and call it good. Or just add a unique key on Artist, Album, and Song. Having an autoincrementing primary key would only really be useful if you had to had referential integrity to another table.
