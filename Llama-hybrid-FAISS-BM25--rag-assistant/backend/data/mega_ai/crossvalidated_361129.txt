A GAN is a type of ANN, and therefore it makes sense to normalize: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4674623/why-do-we-have-to-normalize-the-input-for-an-artificial-neural-network Whenever you normalize data, you can just keep the statistics used to transform it to return it to its original state. Doing this makes normalizing data scale across nearly any machine learning process.
