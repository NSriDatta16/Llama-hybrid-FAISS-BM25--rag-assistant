Sample size calculation is a part of power analysis. There are two general ways to approach a power analysis: You can rely on some canned program or you can simulate. To rely on a canned program, you will need to know what test you are using (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression ....), the effect size that you want to be able to detect, and your tolerances for type I and type II errors. Then, all three of the programs you mention have programs to do power analysis. SAS, for example, has PROC POWER and PROC GLMPOWER.
