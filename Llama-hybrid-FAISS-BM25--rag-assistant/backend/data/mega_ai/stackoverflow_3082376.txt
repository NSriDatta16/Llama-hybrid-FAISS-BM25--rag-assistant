JQuery - Select all but last list (from multiple lists.)

I'm wondering if this is the most elegant and efficient way of doing this? I have multiple 'tag' lists, and through CSS, I want the tags to appear inline (display: inline) and be comma-separated. The challenge that I'm having is to append commas to all but the last list item in each ul.tagList: Tag A Tag B Tag C Tag D Tag E Tag F To append commas on all the ul.tagList list items, but the last, I use: $('ul.tagList').children(':not(:last-child)').append(','); and this produces: Tag A, Tag B, Tag C Tag D, Tag E, Tag F Is this the best way of doing this? Also why does :not(:last-child) work but not :not(:last) in this context? Thanks very much for your help + explanations. Prembo.
