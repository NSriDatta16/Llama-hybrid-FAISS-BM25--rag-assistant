Define $A_n$ - total time, that tourists that arrive on first $n$ buses spent on the site. It is easy to see that $A_n = \sum_{n=1}^{n}N_kT_{k+1}$ . Notice that Tk+1 is a time, spent by tourist, who arrived on bus number n. Define $B_n$ - total number of tourists arrived on first n buses. It is also easy to see that $B_n \sum_{k=1}^{n}N_k$ . Define: $D_n = \frac{A_n}{B_n}$ , and average time tourists spent on the bus. We want to find $\lim_{n\to\infty} D_n$ . This can be done with help of SLLN: $\lim_{n\to\infty} D_n = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{A_n}{B_n} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{n=1}^{n}N_kT_{k+1}}{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}N_k} = \frac{\mathbb{E}(N_1T_2)}{\mathbb{E}(N_2)} = \frac{\mathbb{E}(\mathbb{E}(N_1T_2|T_2))}{\mathbb{E}(N_2|T_2)} = \frac{\mathbb{E}(T_2(T_2 +3))/2}{\mathbb{E}(\frac{T2 +3}{2})} = \frac{q/p^2 +3/p}{1/p+3}$
