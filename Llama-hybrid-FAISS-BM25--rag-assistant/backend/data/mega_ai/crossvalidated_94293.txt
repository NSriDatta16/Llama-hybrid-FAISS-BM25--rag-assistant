If the subset is selected randomly, it will, on average, be a true representation of the data. So you evaluate performance over many random subsets, you should get an estimate of how good the classifier is. In fact, this is how classifiers are usually evaluated: You select a random subset of the data for which you know the class, train the classifier, and predict on the rest of the data. Then you quantify how well you did. The only limitation of this approach is that if the subset is too small, you might not be able to obtain good predictions.
