Do the agents store its state on the device itself? It depends on the device and the application; some devices stores it locally others use a proxy agent. If there is a trap set on an agent, can you do a poll on the same OID to get the same information? Yes, but it usually better to include information in the trap so the management station does not have to do multiple "round-trips" to the device. If you trap on an attribute value change, for instance, it is good practice to send the old and new value in the trap. Without using a mib file, is there a way to query a device for all of its information at once? If not, and you're writing your own customized manager, do you have to know the structure of what it reports up front? Generally no... the SNMP Get-next primitive is designed for just such a case. If you're setting up an agent to report, is there usually a way to control the frequency of how often it sends a trap? Or does it usually send a trap as often as some condition is satisfied? Yes, it is up to the agent on when to send traps. If you are developing your own agent, I highly suggest you look at Net-SNMP. Even if you choose to go with another product, the Net-SNMP code is very well designed and implemented. Plus it has lots of extras to help develop and test agents (and management systems).
