Do I need to standardize if I don't care about covariate effects? (Elastic Net Regression)

I am using elastic net logistic regression to develop a classification model. I understand that generally we standardize the covariates before fitting any models so that we "penalize fairly" all the covariates, even if they have different ranges, etc. But, hypothetically, let's say I do not care about which individual covariates are selected in this process, or how they effect the outcome on an individual level, because my number 1 goal is optimizing the performance of my model. If this is the case, do I still need to standardize my covariates before fitting my model? I wouldn't care if I penalize one covariate more than the other because all I am trying to do is find the model that is best for classification. But would I be doing something wrong mathematically? Would my model be incorrect in some other way?
