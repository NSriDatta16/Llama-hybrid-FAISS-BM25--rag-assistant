Here's how you do this, assuming your backing store is SQL Server. By the way, I corrected what I assume was a typo -- you assign a total number of minutes into a field called Hours. I renamed the field to Minutes for the purposes of future audiences. ObjectQuery visits = myentitys.Visits; var uQuery = from visit in visits group visit by visit.ArrivalTime.Value.Day into g select new { Day = g.Key, Minutes = g.Average(visit => System.Data.Objects.SqlClient.SqlFunctions.DateDiff("m", visit.LeaveTime.Value, visit.ArrivalTime.Value)) }; It is disappointing that LINQ to Entities doesn't support intrinsic conversion of DateTime subtraction into a DateDiff and then yield a TimeSpan object as a result.
