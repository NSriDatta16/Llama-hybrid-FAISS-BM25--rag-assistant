Dynamic programming idiom for combinations

Consider the problem in which you have a value of N and you need to calculate how many ways you can sum up to N dollars using [1,2,5,10,20,50,100] Dollar bills. Consider the classic DP solution: C = [1,2,5,10,20,50,100] def comb(p): if p==0: return 1 c = 0 for x in C: if x It does not take into effect the order of the summed parts. For example, comb(4) will yield 5 results: [1,1,1,1],[2,1,1],[1,2,1],[1,1,2],[2,2] whereas there are actually 3 results ( [2,1,1],[1,2,1],[1,1,2] are all the same). What is the DP idiom for calculating this problem? ( non-elegant solutions such as generating all possible solutions and removing duplicates are not welcome)
