Being realistic, any situation that would lead NSTemporaryDirectory to return nil, would most likely mean that you wouldn't be able to save anything yourself anyway. i.e.: It's likely to mean that the device is full, or that some form of corruption has occurred. As such, I suspect that you should stick to using NSTemporaryDirectory (why re-invent the wheel after all) and treat it returning nil as effectively meaning you can't write to local storage.
