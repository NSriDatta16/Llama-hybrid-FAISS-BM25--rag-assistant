How do SOMs make visualization of high-dimension data possible?

Self Organizing Map is credited to be a very effective tool for exploratory data analysis as it aids in visualization of high-dimensional data. However, the part where the dimensionality reduction is happening is not clear to me. From this article , I understand that the information is essentially embedded in the weight vectors of neurons which are of the same dimensions as of the original patterns. The same weight vectors are supposed to be used for visualization (if I follow from the highly popular colors example). If this is true, I do not understand how SOM is performing dimensionality reduction and how it is making visualization of high-dimensional data simpler. Could someone explain (if possible with an example of >3 dimensional data) how SOM performs dimension reduction and makes visualization possible?
