The answer to your question is Yes. The Find method works with all valid selectors. The set of elements returned by the selector $(".node-form .taxonomy-super-select-checkboxes") must contain one or more child elements that match "div#edit-taxonomy-tags-1-wrapper" , but contain zero child elements that match "div.fieldset-wrapper" . Without seeing the full context of the document fragment you have posted, thatâ€™s all I can say.
