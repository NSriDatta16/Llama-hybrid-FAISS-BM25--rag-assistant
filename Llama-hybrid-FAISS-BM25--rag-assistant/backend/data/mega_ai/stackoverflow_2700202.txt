Since answering your own questions is encouraged on SO, I'm going to present an idea I though of. But especially after reading the other answers on this thread, I don't have much confidence in this solution. Block login, or at least pop up a warning message (optionally rendering the application in annoying neon-yellow colors) until the default password was changed.
