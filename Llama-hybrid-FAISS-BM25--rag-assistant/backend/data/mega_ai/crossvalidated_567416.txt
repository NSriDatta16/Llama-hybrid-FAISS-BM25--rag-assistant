Not sure where you have read, but CNN will not have neuron per pixel. That is the very advantage of CNN compared to a fully connected neural network. Because of this only no. of weights will reduce, thus reducing the no. of computations in CNN compared to using fully connected neural network for solving the same problem. Example: Input image to CNN - 224x224x3 Weights - 5x5x3x4 (4 kernels of size 5x5x3) Output size - 224x224x4 (with padding and stride 1,no pooling) Output size - 112x112x4 (with padding and stride 1 and pooling of 2x2) The image shows how 2D convolution works only for 1 channel and 1 dimension of the weights kernel. Similar thing happens for all channels. This article has more intuitions. Convolution Intuition If you see, roughly the same weights are used for all the pixels.
