Several ways: 1. Do a string.IndexOf(" ") and then use a substring to chop off the header information. Then add the substring like this: xmlString = " " + substringXml + " ". Then you could parse the xml as valid XML. 2. Use an xmltextreader created with fragment conformance levels and read through the xml. Only stop on the Answer elements and do processing. 3. Add a root element to the document and open it in an XmlDocument and use an xpath expression to read out the Answer elements.
