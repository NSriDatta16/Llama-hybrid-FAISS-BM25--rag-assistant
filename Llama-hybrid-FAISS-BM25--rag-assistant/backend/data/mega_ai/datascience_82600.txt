Short answer: they are equivalent. Any results that suggest otherwise are due to random chance or due to modification of parameters other than the number of trees. A random forest is just a voted ensemble of decision trees. By default, each tree's vote is weighted equally and then these votes are averaged. Suppose sets X and Y are the same size. Then if you take the average of X, the average of Y, then average those two, that's the exact same thing as just combining X and Y and averaging them. This is the same as if you have two random forests with the same number of trees. Note, however, that if they have a different number of trees, then if you build two forests and average them, the individual trees making up the smaller forest will have their votes weighted more highly than the trees in the larger forest.
