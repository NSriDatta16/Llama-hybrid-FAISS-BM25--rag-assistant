Conceptually DataTemplates and UserControls solve two different problems. They are not really interchangeable so your comparisons are not really accurate. DataTemplates are all about applying a visual style to a DataType. Typically what this means is I have my own .NET class called Foo and I want to give it a visual style. I would do this by creating a DataTemplate with a DataType of Foo. I can then place this DataTemplate in my application (say in App.XAML) and I will have my visual style applied to my data object Foo wherever it is used. Often this means you will see a ContentControl that has a Content property bound to a property of type Foo. UserControls on the other had are all about organization of XAML. A user control helps in organizing chunks of XAML that you want to re-use throughout your application that has behaviors and functionality tied to it. This is more than what a DataTempate will do. A DataTemplate is tied to one DataType and display a visual for that type. A UserControl can be composed of multiple DataTypes and can include custom behaviors. That being said, I very rarely find the need for a UserControl. I use DataTemplates all over to model my data and implement my behaviors though data bindings and the MVVM pattern.
