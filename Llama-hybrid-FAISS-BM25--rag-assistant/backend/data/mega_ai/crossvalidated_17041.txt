The R statistical package has a simulate function that will simulate data based on a model fit to existing data. This uses the fitted model as the "known" population relationship, then simulates new data based on that model. There is a method for this function in the lme4 package. These fitted objects can take into account random and fixed effects and correlation (including autocorrelation for time series). This may work do what you want.
