You can use platform-dependent ifdef-include pragmas and as strict types as possible. GLib has some nice ones defined which could be used on nearly every platform or architecture. A shell script only option is not a viable alternative as on Windows platforms, there's no Bourne shell, Bash or KSH by default, and unfortunately PowerShell seems to be rare on XP machines. But you can create both a traditional batch file and a Bourne shell script. But as others said, it's easier if you use a higher level language that's platform independent. And why wouldn't you? :)
