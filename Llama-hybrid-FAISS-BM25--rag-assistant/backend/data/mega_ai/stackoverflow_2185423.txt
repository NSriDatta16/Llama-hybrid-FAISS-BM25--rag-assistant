You might want to look at the Managed Extensibility Framework as a way of adding extensions to your app for new storage methods without the need to rebuild the whole thing. You need some way to record the storage location and method used, I'd expect some kind of database store that you could migrate to the cloud later if required. Your question is very vague, you haven't put much work in yourself and as such you are unlikely to get the level of detail you are hoping for in the answers. At least try to implement the system and then ask specific questions around issues that you are having problems with.
