How make a better markdown for developer blog

I'm rebuilding my blog at http://www.elmalabarista.com/blog/ . I have use in my previous version markdown and now I remember why I have almost zero code samples. Doing code samples in markdown is very fragile. I try to put some python there I can't make markdown mark it as code!. The main culprit? The syntax is markdown for code is out spaces. Despite the fact I use wmd as the editor (how that work here in SO is a mistery for me), it never be able to move rigth the text so never get as code. this is the problem: I put something simple: :::python def hello(): pass But the problem is that something I have: :::python def hello(): pass or :::python def hello(): pass (yes bot was formatted but you see? not work). Any mistake -using tabs, too much, too litle spaces) is punished heavily. And if the code is long, the chance of a problem increase too. So, exist any way to simply do: ### My article My list entry one My list entry two :::python def x (a, b): return a * b and get converted rigth and never bother about this small thing again??? By the way, I'm using pygments & python markdown.
