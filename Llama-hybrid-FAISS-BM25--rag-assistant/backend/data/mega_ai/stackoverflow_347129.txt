This is a ruff business. Technology churn keeps everyone busy and workers who want to excel at their craft can become constantly busy in a sea of new technology. But, in the end all of these technologies follow the same patterns and practices to one degree or another. Becoming an expert in the fundamentals will go a long way to forwarding a career in this business. The Pragamatic Programmer is a classic source for direction. Also, what you can or should do (Windows vs. Linux) may depend greatly on Geography. I follow the job market in my area. Spend a little time finding out what business are looking for and what contractors are doing and choose technologies to learn based on this information. User groups, conferences, and code camps are also a good source. If the real problem here is that you are on your own building your first web app and find what you see on channel 9 is more compelling then maybe you should follow your instincts! BTW, I think you will find "clunkiness" everywhere, might as well get used to it.
