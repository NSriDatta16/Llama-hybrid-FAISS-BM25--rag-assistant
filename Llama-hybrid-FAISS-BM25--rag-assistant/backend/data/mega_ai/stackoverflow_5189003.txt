You'll receive error 150 when embedding videos that need age verification and for videos that have other restrictions in your country. If you load the videos in the non-chromeless player, you will see the real error message. You can try that here: http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/youtube_player_demo.html To get only the search results that you can actually play, search with the following parameters: format=5 (only return embeddable videos) safeSearch=strict restriction=[your IP or country code] See http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/reference.html for more information
