Superficially, the Student's t-test for paired samples would be a good choice, if the assumption of normality is met for the distribution of your source code measurements. If it isn't, then the Wilcoxon signed-rank test would be a good next step. However, there is a more subtle assumption of both tests that is likely violated here - that the observations are independent from one another. In other words, the source code properties after change 1 are independent of the source code properties after change 2. I've never measured source code properties before, but this seems unlikely to me. One way to improve the situation would be to look at the change in source code properties from one step to the next. This would get rid of any "baseline" differences causing correlations, but still doesn't help with e.g. an improvement in step 2 making the changes after steps 3 and 4 bigger. Dealing directly with the autocorrelation in the observations takes you into the realm of mixed models or perhaps time series analysis - it is not a question of a simple test statistic anymore.
