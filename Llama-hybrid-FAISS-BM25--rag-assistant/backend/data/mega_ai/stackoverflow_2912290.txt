The order in which you insert data will generally not improve performance. The issues that affect insert speed have more to do with your databases mechanisms for data storage than the order of inserts. One performance problem you may experience when inserting a lot of data into a table is the time it takes to update indexes on the table. However again in this case the order in which you insert data will not help you. If you have a lot of data and by a lot I mean hundreds of thousands perhaps millions of records you could consider dropping the indexes on the table, inserting the records then recreating the indexes.
