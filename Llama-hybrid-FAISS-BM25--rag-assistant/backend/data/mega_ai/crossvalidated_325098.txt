The concepts are not interchangeable. Ergodicity deals with studying the systems where different realizations of the process are not available. For instance, in coin toss we could reasonably argue that we could generate any number of realizations of the sequence of coin tosses. We'll toss 10 coins 1000 times, and it gives us the 1000 samples of the process. So, we could study the statistical properties of the 10 coin tosses. We could a few more 10 coin tosses and increase the sample, improve the estimates etc. This is not always possible. In many cases we cannot generate many realizations of the process, but we can observe one realization for a long long time. So, the ergodicity suggests that we could replace many realization of the process with a very long observation over time. That over time we can obtain the same estimates of the parameters of the process as if we obtained many realizations. Weak exogeneity (independence) deals with a one process, one time series. We're studying this process that is going on. We may need to forecast it in future etc. It's nice if the process has this property where the correlation doesn't stick for too long.
