I am developing a new estimator for a classical linear regression problem, let's call it estimator A. I want to show that estimator A is good. I ran some simulations and realize that estimator potentially works well even when a few outliers (but not too many) are present in the dataset. I then imagine a world where the leverage of the data $X_i(X'X)^{-1}X_i'$ and the variance of the error term $Var(\epsilon_i)$ correlate to generate a higher chance of outlier occurring. For example, when $X_i(X'X)^{-1}X_i'$ is large, then observation i is far from all the other observations, at the same time, if we allow positive correlation between $X_i(X'X)^{-1}X_i'$ and $Var(\epsilon_i)$ , then the same observation is likely to have a large error term, so you can imagine an observation that is far away from all the other observations and likely to deviate from the true regression line. The positive correlation between $X_i(X'X)^{-1}X_i'$ and $Var(\epsilon_i)$ gives rise to a higher chance of outlier occurring. Now, how can I write this down as a data generating process? Imagine the following. Most of the time, $(X,\epsilon)$ are drawn from a bivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix $\Omega$ , imagine that $\Omega$ is a diagonal matrix, so $X_i$ is independent from $\epsilon_i$ . With very small probability $\frac{1}{N}$ , both the leverage and variance are drawn from a bivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix $N^{q}\Omega$ where $0 . This data generating process ensures that I can expect exactly one outliers no matter what the sample size N is and the number of outliers won't explode as the sample size increases. Also, the unconditional variance of $\epsilon_i$ does not explode as the sample size increases. These properties are desirable for my theoretical work later on. Now, I want to prove that after some normalization, estimator A converges in distribution to a normal distribution. Lindeberg CLT is useful in this case.
