Image with gestures - phonegap

I'm making an application who needs to display a map, contained in a large image file (png). The user must be able to zoom in/out the image and drag it in order to scroll the image with touch gestures. I'm not sure that you get it, but i want to display a single image as it would be displayed by the "Photos" iphone application. I would like some hints about the best way to do it with those gesture and with a navigation header in order to leave the image view. Thanks in advance if you can give me any help about this issue because I did not find any clue on the phonegap doc. /ouss
