Yes, it makes sense to test for interactions regardless of main effects . b1 might have a positive slope if b2 is positive, and a negative slope if b2 is negative. That means that the average effect of b1 is 0. Real life example: When people watch you doing something, it can increase your nervous system arousal. If it's something you're very good at, that might make you better. If it's something you're bad at, it might make you worse. An audience watching people play pool makes the good players better, and the bad players worse. On average, the effect of the audience is zero. That doesn't mean that an audience doesn't have an effect.
