Just like the univariate variance is the average squared distance to the mean, $trace(\hat{\bf{\Sigma}})$ is the average squared distance to the centroid: With $\dot{\bf{X}}$ as the matrix of the centered variables, $\hat{\bf{\Sigma}} = \frac{1}{n} \dot{\bf{X}}' \dot{\bf{X}}$ where $\dot{\bf{X}}' \dot{\bf{X}}$ is the matrix of dot products of the columns of $\dot{\bf{X}}$. Its diagonal elements are $\dot{\bf{X}}_{\cdot i}' \dot{\bf{X}}_{\cdot i} = (\bf{X}_{\cdot i} - \overline{X}_{\cdot i})' (\bf{X}_{\cdot i} - \overline{X}_{\cdot i})$, i.e., the squared distance of variable $i$ to its mean. As such, $trace(\hat{\bf{\Sigma}})$ is a natural generalization of the univariate variance. A second generalization is $det(\hat{\bf{\Sigma}})$: This is a measure for the volume of the ellipsoid that characterizes the distribution. More precisely, $|det(\hat{\bf{\Sigma}})|$ is the factor by which the volume of the unit cube changes after applying the linear transformation $\hat{\bf{\Sigma}}$. ( explanation ). Here is an illustration for the matrix $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 & -.5\\ .5 & .5\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ with determinant $0.75$ (left: before, right: after transformation): I do not have a good answer for your second question. But it seems like the original scales of your variables should matter as they define what variance is "small". It might also be worthwile trying some thresholds and check the stability of the resulting estimates with (bootstrap) crossvalidation.
