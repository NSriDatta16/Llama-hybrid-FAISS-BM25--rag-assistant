Is a predictor with greater variance "better"?

I have a "basic statistics" concept question. As a student I would like to know if I'm thinking about this totally wrong and why, if so: Let's say I am hypothetically trying to look at the relationship between "anger management issues" and say divorce (yes/no) in a logistic regression and I have the option of using two different anger management scores -- both out of 100. Score 1 comes from questionnaire rating instrument 1 and my other choice; score 2 comes from a different questionnaire. Hypothetically, we have reason to believe from previous work that anger management issues give rise to divorce. If, in my sample of 500 people, the variance of score 1 is much higher than that of score 2, is there any reason to believe that score 1 would be a better score to use as a predictor of divorce based on its variance? To me, this instinctively seems right, but is it so?
