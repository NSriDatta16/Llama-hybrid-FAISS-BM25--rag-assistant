Understanding a paper combining cross section with time series in finance

I am reading a paper to do with reversal signals in finance. (Apologies I am not allowed to share the actual paper.) In the paper it says it does monthly cross sectional regressions and collects the time series of the regression coefficients over time, and finally conducts statistical tests on the time series of regression coefficients. The regression is $$ r_{i,t} = b_{0,t} + b_{1,t}reversal_{i,t} + e_{i,t} $$ where $r_{i,t}$ is the return of stock $i$ at time $t$, $reversal_{i,t}$ is the past one month return of stock $i$ at time $t$, and $e_{i,t}$ is the residual. There are approx. 1000 stocks at each time interval. The time interval is monthly, the data spans 1990 to 2010 (240 months). Then a table is shown like below (I've rounded the numbers etc.) estimate std. error t value intercept 0.02 0.003 3.2 reversal -0.01 0.005 -2.7 Questions: Am I right to believe they run all the monthly cross sectional regressions and then take the mean of the coefficients, or is there more to it than this? I would like to know how they got to these numbers. Did they simply take the average on the 240 estimate and standard errors they had for each regression?
