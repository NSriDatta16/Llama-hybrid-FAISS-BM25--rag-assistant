Need help programming with Mclauren series and Taylor series?

Ok so here's what i have so far: #include #include //#define PI 3.14159 int factorial(int n){ if(n and here's the output: McLaurin of 42 = 0 Enter x in degrees: 42 0.733038-1.00000011.0000001 Taylor of sin(42 degrees) = -1073741824 I suspect the reason for these outrageous numbers goes with the fact that I mixed up my floats and ints? But i just cant figure it out...!! Maybe its a math thing, but its never been a strength of mine let alone program with calculus. Also the Mclaurin fails, how does it equal zero? WTF! Please help correct my noobish code. I am still a beginner... ----Update---- #include #include //#define PI 3.14159 int factorial(int n){ if(n Gives me weird error. /usr/lib/gcc/i686-pc-cygwin/3.4.4/../../../../i686-pc-cygwin/bin/ld: cannot open output file a.exe: Device or resource busy collect2: ld returned 1 exit status Can anyone explain what's wrong now?
