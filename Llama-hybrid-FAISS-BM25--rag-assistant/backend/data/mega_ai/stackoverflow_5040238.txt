FWIW, in the 80ies you would first come across import statements in Extended Pascal and Ada in a somewhat different meaning than what is today's commonly accepted usage. In ADA you would [pragma] import functions from other languages (typically C). This was similar to JNI in java or declaring a function living in a dll in VB6. The same concepts were also introduced in extended Pascal (the namespace import concept in Pascal and ADA was actually relying on a combination of the with and uses keyword).
