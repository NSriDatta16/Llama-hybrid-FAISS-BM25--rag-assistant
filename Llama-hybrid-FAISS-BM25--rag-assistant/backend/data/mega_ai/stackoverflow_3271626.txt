This entirely depends on your goals. By default (i.e. unless you really need to do otherwise), just do a normal allocation for each next node. Memory pools as compared to just allocating nodes: Make allocation faster. Depending on underlying allocation mechanism, sometimes significantly faster. Usually less memory fragmentation, though this may not be a problem with some allocators. Major drawback: waste memory on reserved, but not used nodes. This is very important if you use data structure indiscriminately (e.g. 1000s of instances) as opposed to just having a couple of instances. Because of the drawback, memory pools are not suitable for generic situations. In C++ all standard containers have an allocator template parameter.
