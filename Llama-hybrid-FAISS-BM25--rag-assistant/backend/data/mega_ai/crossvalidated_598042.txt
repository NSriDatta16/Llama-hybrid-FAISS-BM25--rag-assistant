Longitude and latitude tend to be substitutes for the likely underlying things like air quality, pollution (closeness to major roads/other sources like factories), sources of allergens (e.g. local plants), socioeconomic factors, local weather etc., although with a huge amount of data and a sufficiently flexible model you'd eventually get something almost as good. If you could get information on some of these (e.g. closeness to green areas/parks/forest/roads/census information would obviously be something one can obtain with enough effort, details on local flora might be harder, pollution information might be available, weather information is available with some granularity etc.), those might be better than city as a categorical variable or longitude/latitude on their own. Additionally, these things would potentially generalize better to new unseen locations. I.e. knowing that New York is worse than Boston for asthma would not help you for saying anything about Los Angeles, if all you have is a category. And going by e.g. just latitude, while Los Angeles and Myrtle Beach, SC, (similarly, New York and Madrid) are on the same latitude their climate (as well as other details) are quite different. One can also try to create embeddings that capture all of the information available on cities or specific locations (e.g. an embedding layer trained to output known information about the location). Of course, the big limitation here is usually data availability.
