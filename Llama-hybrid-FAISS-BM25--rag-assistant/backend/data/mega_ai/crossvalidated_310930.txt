I have the standard deviation, mean and the maximum value for a distribution between t=0 and t=T. How do I approximate the best fitting curve?

I have the time series data. The mean and maximum value, standard deviation at every minute (60s) is given. However, I want to intrapolate it as I want the data of each second. Is there any way to do this ?
