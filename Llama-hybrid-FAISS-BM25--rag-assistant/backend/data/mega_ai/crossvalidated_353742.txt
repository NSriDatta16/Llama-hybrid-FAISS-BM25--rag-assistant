the way you are feeding seems appropriate, if you feel the dataset is getting huge for your problem, you could do a better feature engineering technique. I have worked on predicting the UCI ML Daily and Sports Activities dataset from where they have five devices like you have and take it operates at 25Hz. So for each second, they have 25 readings from 5 devices. So it was a lot, and I implemented this paper: K. Altun, B. Barshan, and O. Tun√ßel, Comparative study on classifying human activities with miniature inertial and magnetic sensors, Pattern Recognition, 43(10):3605-3620, October 2010. This is the above mentioned paper. Where they do various feature engineering techniques from mean to DFT peaks etc. I did the same using Python, it's available on github repo . I used sklearn mostly, and later went with pytorch , but never tried HMM, but you should definitely check out HMM from sklearn . Try both with feature engineering and without feature engineering, and maybe reduce using PCA. Hope that helps.
