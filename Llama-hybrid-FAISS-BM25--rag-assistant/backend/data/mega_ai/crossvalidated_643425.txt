Testing equality of unconditional variance of two stationary AR times series?

Suppose I have two stationary AR time series: $$ \begin{align} y_{1,t} &= \phi_1 y_{1,t-1}+\varepsilon_{1,t} \\ y_{2,t} &= \phi_2 y_{2,t-1}+\varepsilon_{2,t} \end{align} $$ with $\varepsilon_{1,t} \stackrel{\mathrm{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal{WN}(0,\sigma_1^2)$ and $\varepsilon_{2,t} \stackrel{\mathrm{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal{WN}(0,\sigma_2^2)$ I know their unconditional variances $$ \begin{align} \mathrm{Var}(y_{1,t}) &= \frac{\sigma_1^2}{1-\phi_1^2} \\ \mathrm{Var}(y_{2,t}) &= \frac{\sigma_2^2}{1-\phi_1^2} \end{align} $$ Q : How do I formally test the hypothesis $H_0: \mathrm{Var}(y_{1,t})=\mathrm{Var}(y_{2,t})$ ? I know that if all I were testing were, say, $H_0: \mathrm{Var}(y_{1,t})=5$ , I could do some sort of classical LR, LM, or Wald test. But I'm trying to test equality of two populations. I guess what I'm looking for is something like a two-sample t-test or F-test of equality of population means or variances. But those are for i.i.d. data. I have auto-correlation here. I could bootstrap, sampling from the most likely model for each population, re-estimating models for each, calculating the bootstrap sample unconditional variance for each, looking at their difference or ratio, comparing what would arise from a null of equality. But there must be an easier, straightforward way. I think I'm missing something fundamental here.
