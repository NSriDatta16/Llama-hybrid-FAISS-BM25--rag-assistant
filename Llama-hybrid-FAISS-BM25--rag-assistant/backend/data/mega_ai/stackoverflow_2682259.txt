Jquery UI Datepicker not displaying

UPDATE I have reverted back to Jquery 1.3.2 and everything is working, not sure what the problem is/was as I have not changed anything else apart of the jquery and ui library versions. UPDATE END I having an issue with the JQuery UI datepicker . The datepicker is being attached to a class and that part is working but the datepicker is not being displayed. Here is the datepicker code I am using and the inline style that is being generated when I click in the input box that has the class ".datepicker". $('.datepicker').datepicker({dateFormat:'dd/mm/yy'}); display:none; left:418px; position:absolute; top:296px; z-index:1; If I change the display:none to display:block the datepicker works fine except it dosen't close when I select a date. Jquery libraries in use: jQuery JavaScript Library v1.4.2 jQuery UI 1.8 jQuery UI Widget 1.8 jQuery UI Mouse 1.8 jQuery UI Position 1.8 jQuery UI Draggable 1.8 jQuery UI Droppable 1.8 jQuery UI Datepicker 1.8
