Comparing two groups based on how they ranked items

In a survey on Qualtrics, I have asked two groups (Group A and Group B) to rank their preferred mode of communication: "list the following modes of communication in order of your preference, drag and drop the most attractive on top to the least attractive on the bottom: portal-based; videoconference; phone; in-person; email)". Data look like the following. subject Group portal-based videoconference phone in-person email 1 A 1 4 3 5 2 2 B 3 5 2 1 4 3 A 5 4 3 1 2 4 B 4 2 1 3 5 5 A 1 3 5 4 2 6 B 5 4 2 1 3 Using R, I need to compare Group A and B in terms of a) whether Group A and Group B ranked communication modes significantly different. b) whether distribution of each single item differs significantly between Groups A and B. Any advice on the type of test and the code is highly appreciated. PS: I have seen this. It is not specifically applicable to my case.
