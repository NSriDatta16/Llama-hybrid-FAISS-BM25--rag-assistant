How do I change the mouse cursor when the left mouse button is down?

In Delphi 2007, in a mouse move event, I try to change the mouse cursor with: procedure TFr_Board_Display.PaintBox_Proxy_BoardMouseMove(Sender: TObject; Shift: TShiftState; X, Y: Integer); begin if left_mouse_button_down then begin if some_condition then begin Cursor := crDrag; end else begin Cursor := crNoDrop; end; end else begin if some_other_condition then begin Cursor := crHandPoint; end else begin Cursor := crDefault; end; end; end; for example. However, when the left mouse button is down, and I move the mouse, the cursor doesn't change to either crDrag or crNoDrop. The code is executed (e.g. Cursor := crDrag;) but the cursor does not change. When the left mouse button is up, and I move the mouse, the cursor changes no problem. (I originally tried to use some Drag & Drop events and properties, but couldn't get everything to work the way I wanted.) Edit: Clarified desired behavior, and formatted code. Edit: Thank you, Gamecat, but I want the cursor to change when the left mouse button is down and the while the mouse is moving the cursor should change back and forth between crDrag and crNoDrop.
