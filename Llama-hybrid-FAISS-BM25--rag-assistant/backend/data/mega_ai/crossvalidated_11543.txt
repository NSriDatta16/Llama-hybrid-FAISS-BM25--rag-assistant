How do I tell when and why to use specific statistical measures?

I've taken a few probability classes and now understand how to calculate some statistical measures like mean and confidence intervals. What I don't know is the what, when, and why of using these measures for specific situations. I'm hoping to put together a good collection of each of these measures, what they're used for, and what situations these are good to use. Specifically I'm looking for these (but not limited to): Mean (average) Standard Deviation Variance Confidence Intervals Median
