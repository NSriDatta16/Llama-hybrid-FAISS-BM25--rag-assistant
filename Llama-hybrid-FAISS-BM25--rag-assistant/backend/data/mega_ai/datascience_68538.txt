spaCy used to recommended (archive link) that you use spaCy when you want production-grade performance but don't need to customize your architecture. They recommended that you use allenNLP when you want to explore different architectures or use the state-of-the-art models. They recommended against using allenNLP for production, though. Since spaCy 3.0, they now recommend (live link) that you can also use spaCy for customized and state-of-the-art models. They still don't recommend spaCy for language generation models or for active research.
