When to use mean vs median

I'm new to data science and stats, so this might seems like a beginner question. I'm working on a dataset where I've user's Twitter followers gain per day. I want to measure the average growth he had over a period of time, which I did by finding the mean of growth. But someone is suggesting me to use median for this. Can anyone explains, in which use-case we should use mean and when to use median?
