How to account for multicollinearity in a partial F-Test?

I am trying to setup a model in R. I want to test if strategies picked by different agents have a joint significant effect on the outcome. My idea was to create a partial F-Test: DV = success variable (0 or 1) IV1 = agents IV2 = strategies (around 10 types) IV3 = agents_strategies (help variable created by me; a combination of each agent and each strategy they have chosen in the data) L0 How can I account for multicollinearity? Can I set up my model in this way? Any help is greatly appreciated.
