How to calculate average of a group when you know overall average, average of other group, and sample sizes per group?

I know the average of a group that consists of two subgroups. the number in the two subgroups the total the average of one of the subgroups. How can I work out the average of the other subgroup? Basically, overall average of group of say 200 is 65%, subgroup B which is 150 has an average of 70%, subgroup C is 50. What is the average score of subgroup C?
