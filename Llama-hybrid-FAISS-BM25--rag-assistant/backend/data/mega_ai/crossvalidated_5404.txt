I can tell you what I would do as a machine learner ;): Creating two models $M_1,M_2$ for x using $y_1,y_2$ respectively A prediction for x is calculated as the average of the predictions of $M_1$ and $M_2$ A "model" can be either a gaussian distribution (as described, if you know that x a) has a gaussian distribution and b) know that the function x to y is nearly the identity) or anything else, e.g. a simple linear regression model (if you are not sure whether there are additional factors). BUT: If x is indeed a bimodal distribution with the two gaussians y, than the suggested approach would not make any sense. In this case I'd try a more generic approach, i.e. EM to see whether one or two gaussians are more appropriate. It is quite hard to give a general answer to this questions, since it is not exactly clear what determines whether y1 or y2 can be observed. It could be that for both y x is missing completely at random (in this case y1 and y2 were just different random samples), but on the other hand it could be that for a certain fraction of x only y1 can be observed, but not y2, and vice versa for another fraction of x.
