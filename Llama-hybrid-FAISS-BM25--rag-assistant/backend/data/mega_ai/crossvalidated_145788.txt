For initial visual estimation, following graph can be used. Plotting the monthly data with loess curve and its 95% confidence interval, it appears that there is a mid-year rise peaking at June. Other factors may be causing the data to have wide distribution, hence the seasonal trend may be getting masked in this raw data loess plot. The data points have been jittered. Edit: Following plot shows loess curve and confidence interval for change in number of cases from the number in the previous month: This also shows that during the months in first half of the year, the number of cases keep rising, while they are falling in the second half of the year. This also suggest a peak in mid-year. However, the confidence intervals are wide and goes across 0, i.e. no change, throughout the year, indicating a lack of statistical significance. The difference of a month's number can be compared with average of previous 3 months' values: This shows a clear increase in numbers in May and a fall in October.
