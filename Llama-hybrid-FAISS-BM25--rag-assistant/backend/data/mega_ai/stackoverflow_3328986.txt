Redirect to non-www-url domain with ASP.NET?

This is not a duplicate post. I've looked through similar questions on SO but didn't find the solution to my problem. As someone has already suggested I should do the following to redirect www-url to non-www url (or vice versa): Hereâ€™s the IIS7 rule to remove the WWW prefix from all incoming URLs. Cut and paste this XML fragment into your web.config file under / / But the problem is when I add that block of code under I get a syntax error with blue underline saying: " The has an invalid child element ... ". Of course I've replaced domain.com with my domain. I have also tried putting that block of code outside but still inside of web.config file, which resulted in Internal server error 500 . If this helps: My hosting provider is GoDaddy (Shared Hosting). ASP.NET MVC on .NET Framework 3.5 And here's my entire web.config file: Asp.Net Configuration option in Visual Studio. A full list of settings and comments can be found in machine.config.comments usually located in \Windows\Microsoft.Net\Framework\v2.x\Config --> section enables configuration of the security authentication mode used by ASP.NET to identify an incoming user. --> section enables configuration of what to do if/when an unhandled error occurs during the execution of a request. Specifically, it enables developers to configure html error pages to be displayed in place of a error stack trace. -->
