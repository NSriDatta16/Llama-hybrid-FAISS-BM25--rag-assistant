Where does "œÅ" come from in the primary objective function ?

I'm trying to fully understand the primary objective of one-class SVM function . This function is defined in paragraph 3.2 of Enhancing One-class Support Vector Machines for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection as: $$min_{\omega, \eta, \rho} ||\omega||^2 - \rho + \frac{1}{\nu n} \sum_{i=-1}^n \xi_i $$ subject to: $$\omega^T \phi(x_i) \ge \rho - \xi_i$$ and to $$\xi_i \ge 0$$ I understand perfectly why $||\omega||^2$ is here (thanks to this wonderful link ). I also understand why $\frac{1}{\nu n} \sum_{i=-1}^n \xi_i $ is here, thanks to different links I read. But I cannot figure out why $ - \rho\ $ is here. I seems this part is specific to one-class SVM. (Please find here the link to the original paper.) So, where does this $ - \rho\ $ come from ?
