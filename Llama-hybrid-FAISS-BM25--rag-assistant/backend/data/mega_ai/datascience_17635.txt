Model parameters & Hyper parameters of Neural Network & their tuning in training & validation stage

I am new to Machine learning in that Artificial Neural Network. I am using nnet package in R for training of Neural Network. What is the difference between model parameters and hyperparameters? I have heard that the hyper parameters are set before we set the model parameters. What are the hyper parameters and model parameters of a Artificial Neural Network and when they are actually tuned? i.e. Are hyper parameters tuned in Training stage of Neural Network and model parameters in validation stage?
