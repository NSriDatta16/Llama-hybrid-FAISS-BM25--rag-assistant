No, you cannot consider cointegration between a stationary and an integrated time series. A prerequisite for cointegration is that all of the series under consideration are integrated of order one or greater to begin with. For an introduction to cointegration you may refer to LÃ¼tkepohl "New introduction to multiple time series analysis" (2005) or any other modern (post 1990) time series textbook.
