Is it possible to pair BluetoothDevice programmatically android?

Currently Iam using backport.android.bluetooth2.jar file for bluetooth programming with Android 1.5.Whenever device pairing fails it populates alert dialog for passKey and if i give passkey then in my log iam getting below error 07-21 12:25:52.419: WARN/BluetoothDeviceService(948): setPin(00:0E:6D:BA:89:F3) called but no native data available, ignoring. Maybe the PasskeyAgent Request was cancelled by the remote device or by bluez. For successfully pair my BT device I always rebooting my tablet and manually pair the device with Settings options.So at last i realised to give this passKey programmatically but i haven't found any method for this.But in google opensource i found one method that is commented with @hide setPassKey(String Address,int passKey) in BluetoothDevice.java of backport.android.bluetooth2.jar .This will n't appear in my jar file.If any way is there for pairing the unbounded device please give reply ASAP?
