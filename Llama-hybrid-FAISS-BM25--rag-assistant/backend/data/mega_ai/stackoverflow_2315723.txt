Passing money from a customer to a 3rd party directly (Paypal Payments Pro)

Let us assume that there are three parties. Organization X, which provides a SaaS, organization Y, which is using the X's service, and Consumer Z which is using X's service to make purchase from Y. This is similar to something like EBay for instance in a way. Now I would like to have Y and Z directly transfer money between them while also transfering funds between X and Z. The example would be X charges and covenience fee of some sort to Z and Y actually charges for the service. We are currently using website payments pro, but I would prefer not to have every single 3rd party (Y corporation) to need to use it. Does anyone have any ideas? The reason this would be done is to handle liability issues more directly.
