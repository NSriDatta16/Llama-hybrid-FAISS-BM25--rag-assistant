Bayesian inference on gamma distribution

The likelihood of an observation $x$ under a gamma distribution is $$L(x | \alpha, \beta) \propto \beta^\alpha x^{\alpha-1} \frac {\exp(-x\beta)} {\Gamma(\alpha)}$$ Suppose I have some observations d from a gamma distribution with unknown shape and reciprocal scale parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ I wish to evaluate $ \int_{\forall \alpha} \int_{\forall \beta} L(x | \alpha, \beta) \times L(\alpha,\beta | \boldsymbol{d}) \ d\alpha \ d\beta $ in order to find the likelihood of a new observation $x$ from this distribution. Is this integral tractable if I use Miller's prior ( http://www.leg.ufpr.br/lib/exe/fetch.php/projetos:mci:tabelasprioris.pdf ) for the distribution of the parameters of the gamma distribution, eg: $$L(\alpha,\beta | \boldsymbol{d}) \propto \frac {p^{\alpha - 1} \exp(-\beta s)} {(\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^{-\alpha})^n} $$ Where $n$ is the number of observations, $s$ is their sum and $p$ is their product? In other words, is it possible to exactly calculate $$\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \beta^\alpha x^{\alpha-1} \frac {\exp(-x\beta)} {\Gamma(\alpha)} \frac {p^{\alpha - 1} \exp(-\beta s)} {(\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^{-\alpha})^n} \ d\alpha \ d\beta$$ If this is not possible analytically, do I have to resort to maximum likelihood estimation, or is there another approach that will be viable? Such as an alternative prior? Or numerical techniques?
