Likelihood notation - Bayesian models

I was reading up about variational Bayesian logistic regression here: https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/2015/log/15b_lr_and_svi.pdf And the author first defines the model likelihood as $$ p(y|x,w) $$ But then in applying bayes rule, he redefines it as $$ p(D|w)$$ Why is that allowed? Is it because Bayesians view data as given/fixed? And how does the notation work more generally?
