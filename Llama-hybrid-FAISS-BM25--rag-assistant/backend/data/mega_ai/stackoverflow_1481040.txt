Depending on how you plan to use the result, you might try putting the incoming data into a rope datastructure instead of vector, especially if the strings you expect to come in are very large. Appending to the rope is very fast, but subsequent char-by-char traversal is slower by a constant factor. The tradeoff might work out for you or not, I don't know what you need to do with the result. EDIT: I see from your comment this is no option, then. I don't think you can do much more efficient in the general case when the size of the data coming in is totally arbitrary. Otherwise you could try to initially reserve enough space in the vector so that the data will fit without or at most one reallocation in the average case or so. One thing I noticed about your code: if(aPtr==NULL,aLen I think you mean if(aPtr==NULL || aLen
