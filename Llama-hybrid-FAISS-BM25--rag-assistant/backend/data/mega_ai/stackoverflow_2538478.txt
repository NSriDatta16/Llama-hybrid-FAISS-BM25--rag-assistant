How can you get the average of the count of records in Reporting Services

I have a report where I'm counting the number of records for a day. At the bottom, I have the total records for that time period. I'd like to display the average records for each day. An example: alt text http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/7168/ssrsexampletable.png I can accomplish this by aggregating the data by date in SQL then just doing the Average and Sum of the count from SQL, but that would complicate the report considerably as I'm doing other column filters for the types of tests performed. There seems to be a simple way to accomplish this that I'm missing. I can't do Average(Count(field)) in SSRS, unfortunately. Is there something I'm missing, or is there really not a way to accomplish this simply?
