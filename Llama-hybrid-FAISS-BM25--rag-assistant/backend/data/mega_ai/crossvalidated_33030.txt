I'm sure I'm not qualified to answer your question fully, but the way I have seen it done before is using something along the lines of a z-score for the factor that you are inputting. So for example if you were inputting something like amount of bodyfat on a person, that has a mean of 40 pounds with standard deviation 10, for someone who has 50 pounds of fat, you would input the value 1 into the neural network.
