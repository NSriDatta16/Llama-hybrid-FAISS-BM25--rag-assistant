A fairly standard approach to showing that your results were not heavily influenced by your choice of prior is simply to show that your results hold when choosing a different prior. For example, if you have an informed prior that suggests a certain result is more likely, you might want to also show your results also hold when a uniform prior is specified. A fairly new piece of software for checking such things is called JASP , which is like a free, modern SPSS that handles Bayesian versions of many frequentest statistical tests. What is nice about this, is that when you run a Bayesian test it outputs a graph showing what your test result would have been had a range of other priors been specified. I don't know if this output is something you would want to include in a report, but it is useful to get an idea of how sensitive your results were to your specific prior.
