Unfortunately, this answer is more of a comment, but I think that your question is too complex to be answered properly here without actually seeing your data. I would like to offer pointers that I consider important for you: Decide what your outcome should be. Your example and your data suggest that a person responds to a stimuli for some time and then stops and doesn`t respond again. In this case your outcome might be whether and when an individual stops responding. If the subjects can switch back and forth between responding and not, I would also go with some sort of binomial model. Consider whether your goal is to construct a model (explorative) or to do significance testing (confirmatory). When doing hypothesis testing you do not want to bias your p-values, so you should stick with a pre-decided model to answer these questions. If you want to construct a model, you probably would not go for hypothesis testing, but instead look at how well your model can simulate data that looks like your input. I think in Bayesian Data Analysis by Andrew Gelman there is a model for data very much like this. Unfortunately, I do not have my copy at hand.
