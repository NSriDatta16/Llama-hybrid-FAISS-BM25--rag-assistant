Technically, if the OS supports it, the SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEPORT options may be set on a socket to allow other processes to bind to the same address/port and thus allow multiple processes to receive messages on the same address/port. But both processes would have to set the option, and I doubt any agent implementations do that because it would not make sense to do so--it would just cause headaches having both agents potentially responding to a single request. Managers won't be equipped to handle it. However, you can instead run an SNMP proxy in the primary address/port, configured to forward requests to one of multiple agents based on query, security, or (with SNMPv3) context/engine ID parameters, and forward responses back. Also, using AgentX, you have an SNMP master agent running on the primary address/port, and one or more SNMP sub-agents connected to the master agent. The master agent dispatches requests to the sub-agents as appropriate, merging the results into a single response, so that to the outside world it appears as a single agent. Each sub-agent typically handles a different branch of OID space (one sub-agent implementing certain module(s), another sub-agent implementing other module(s)). But taking two agents intended to own the address/port exclusively, and forcing them to share through the REUSE options, while it may be possible, would not be wise.
