Oh my. I worked in a shop for many years that used Access as their platform of choice. The application eventually got so large that it began hitting an internal memory limitation of Access 2003. They began experiencing the exact same problem that you are having. As you have noticed, there is no external indication of memory problems when this happens. The company talked at length with Microsoft about the problem, and I believe Microsoft eventually supplied them with a patch. So you might want to talk to Microsoft about this, if it sounds like a similar situation to what you are experiencing, as they may be able to supply you with the same patch. Ultimately the long-term solution is to break the application into smaller pieces. Moving to Access 2007 didn't help; in fact, it made things worse because Access 2007 has more moving parts.
