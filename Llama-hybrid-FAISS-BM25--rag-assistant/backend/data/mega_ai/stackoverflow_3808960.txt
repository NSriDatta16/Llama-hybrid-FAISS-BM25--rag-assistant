Create a tuple, say LineTuple, consisting of a line and its string frequency. Have a min heap of LineTuples, with comparator as the comparison of the frequency values. For first k lines, insert them into the heap. From (k+1)st line onwards, extract the root, i.e. the tuple with minimum frequency, from the heap, and (This operation is O( lg k ) ). create a tuple with the current line, and insert it into the heap. (This operation is average constant time, worst case O( lg k ) ) At any point of time, the k tuples contained in the heap are the k biggest lines. I am not fluent in Java, so I can't provide any code sample. But, check here , here .
