How to make calibration plot for survival data without binning data?

To make a calibration plot for survival probabilities estimated from a Cox model, one can divide the estimated risk into groups, calculate the average risk within a group, and then compare this to the Kaplan-Meier estimate. What are alternative approaches that do not require binning? What are the specific steps required to implement such a technique, and what is the logic behind it? Some discussion is present in this question .
