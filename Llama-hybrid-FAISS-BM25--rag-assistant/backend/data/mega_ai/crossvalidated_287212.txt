How to train the Model in Time Series with Holiday, Weekends

I am working on time series to forecast the number of inbound calls for next 1 month on a daily basis. I built a model using auto.arima and forecasted. My forecasting data is showing gradually increasing no. of calls irrespective of holiday or weekend. (I have data for 2 months Aug-1-2016 to Dec-31- 2016. Here I want to forecast for next 1 month data.) Historical data is saying that there are fewer calls on weekends and holidays (for instance week days average no. calls per day: 1200, weekend average no. of calls: 700).
