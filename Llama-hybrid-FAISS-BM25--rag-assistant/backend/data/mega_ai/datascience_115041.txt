Is it possible to you MNIST model for thousands of classifications?

I am very new to ML and I am trying to create a CNN which basically does exactly the same thing as MNIST handwritten digit recognition model, but instead of 10 classifications I'd like to use over 2000. is such thing possible? I tried this: x_train = tf.keras.utils.normalize(x_train, axis=1) x_test = tf.keras.utils.normalize(x_test, axis=1) model = tf.keras.models.Sequential() model.add(tf.keras.layers.Flatten()) model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=tf.nn.relu)) model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=tf.nn.relu)) model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(2006, activation=tf.nn.softmax)) model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=3) Training does complete, however I get zero loss and zero accuracy. What am I doing wrong? (besides from not studying ML in depth) Sorry for the noobnes. Any direction or help would be highly appreciated! Thank you!
