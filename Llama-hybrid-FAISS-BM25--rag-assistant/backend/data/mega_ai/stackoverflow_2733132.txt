I'm using the Bitnami Redmine stack on Linux, and love it! Like you, I know little about Ruby and RoR, so I was really excited when I discovered Bitnami. I think the main things to consider are the location of the installation files. At least in Linux, I let Bitnami install MySQL to the default location. It worked just fine until I had to install plugins which required database migration; then I was up a creek without a paddle. On the other hand, Bitnami offers a slick uninstaller which gets rid of Redmine and all related services (MySQL, Apache, etc. - if you didn't have them installed before you began). If you're just wanting to test Redmine out, I highly recommend Bitnami. It'd probably even work well long-term, but you just gotta keep the installation locations in mind. I've been playing with it on Linux for about a week now, and I love it!
