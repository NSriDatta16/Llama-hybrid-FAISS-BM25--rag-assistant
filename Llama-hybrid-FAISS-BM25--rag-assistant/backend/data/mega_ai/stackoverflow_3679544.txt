Dynamically generated JNLP files is probably going to open you up to injection attacks, just like dynamic SQL. Further it looks as if you are expecting the user to trust the WebStart application which trusts the JNLP file which is untrustworthy. Assuming you have one application instance per desktop ( SingleInstanceService ), information about which files to use, which should not necessarily be trusted, can be passed through an applet using the PersistenceService ("muffins") or, apparently if the browser is IE, through cookies.
