One-class Classification of multidimensional vectors

I have a m x k User-feature matrix (m >> k) obtained by factorizing an original User-websites matrix (m x n) that has #page views as entries. Additionally, there are users (say r) who have been labeled as being part of a particular group. I'm now looking to find a way to see who among the remaining (m-r) users is 'similar' to these pre-classified r users. This seems like a possible scenario for a one-class SVM, but I'd like to know if there are any other methods that I should consider. On a related note, I'm not sure if there is a way I can fit a multivariate distribution to the pre-classified r users, and then for each of the (m-r) users, get a probability of being part of that distribution. One could then use some kind of a cutoff to decide the 'similar' users. I'm using R for my analysis, so any pointers on specific packages to consider would be helpful as well. Thanks in advance!
