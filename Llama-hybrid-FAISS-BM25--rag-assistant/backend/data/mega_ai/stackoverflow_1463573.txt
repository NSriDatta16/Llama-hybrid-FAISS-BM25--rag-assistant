It was two part. 1- the age/longevity of Cobol software, and 2- the 80 character limit of data records. First- Most software of that age used only 2 digit numbers for year storage, since no one figured their software would last that long! COBOL had been adopted by the banking industry, who are notorious for never throwing away code. Most other software WAS thrown away, while the banks didn't! Secondly, COBOL was constrained to 80 characters per record of data (due to the size of punch cards!), developers were at an even greater pressure to limit the size of fields. Because they figured "year 2000 won't be here till I'm long and retired!" the 2 characters of saved data were huge!
