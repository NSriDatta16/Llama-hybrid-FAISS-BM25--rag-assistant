What you're missing is that you're asking the compiler to know that T might be one of the types D1 and D2 when all you've said is that T is a Base. How could it possible know what properties or even type your object is as that information is only known at runtime. Even if you could go foreach (PropertyInfo in this.Properties) it's going to find out the name of those properties at runtime so be just as slow as Reflection because how else can it? (it is reflection, just prettier syntax). It can't know what properties are common until it knows what types it's dealing with and you've said "i'm not telling you until runtime" so the answer is "well I'll have to look at runtime" i.e. reflection. Secondly, just because D1 and D2 might both have a property named Size doesn't mean they are the same property (unless that property is present in a common ancestor). For example, ArtilleryAmmo.Shell and PecanNut.Shell. AcmeCorp.Staff and GandolfTheWizard.Staff California.State and MyBrokenEngine.State LoudSpeaker.Volume and MassiveCrater.Volume Cave.Bats and BasketballGame.Bats etc. etc.
