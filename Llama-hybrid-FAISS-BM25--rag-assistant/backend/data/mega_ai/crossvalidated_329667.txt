Bootstrapping Regression Models in R An Appendix to An R Companion to Applied Regression, Second Edition goes over a lot of this pretty well. They suggest using the confidence interval directly for hypothesis testing where possible (then you don't have to worry about the p-value). Of the intervals you used, the BCa confidence interval has the smallest coverage error when the bootstrapped distribution of the parameter is skewed. If your sampling distribution is normal then all the intervals you used would be the same. (see also Bootstrap confidence intervals: when, which, what? A practical guide for medical statisticians ) As a statistician, I would report the interval that best reflects the $\alpha$-level you are using (the least coverage error). However, I am sure there are many journals, etc that would prefer seeing all your intervals. This CV question and this ResearchGate deal with creating a hypothesis test and p-value that agrees with the BCa interval.
