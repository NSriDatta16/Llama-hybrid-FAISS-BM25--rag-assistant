Well, Weka does not have very many clustering algorithms. It's a classification and machine learning tool, not so much a general purpose data mining tool (I would not call "clustering" and "data mining" to be part of "machine learning" - they don't learn!). There is for example ELKI which has a lot more clustering and outlier detection methods. However, most of these algorithms are designed for continuous values. Clustering is a structure discovery approach (usually. You might call k-means a partition optimization approach, it does not really care about structure, but it optimizes the in-partition sum of squares of the partitions) In your use case, I do not think clustering is what you are looking for . You are interested in aggregation and grouping , but I wouldn't do this on a number vector level. For your use case, you might be much better off e.g. with decision trees or frequent itemset mining and consider the "branches" and "sets" of these algorithms your "clusters". But it's hard to give you advice if you do not give a particular aim that you are trying to solve . If you are just trying to do something , then anything will do.
