Read about the Drupal 7 JavaScript API here . You want to give attention to the behaviors section. Behaviors do the same thing you are trying to make in your example, however, when a Drupal page loads, one of the first things it does is instantiate the Drupal object. This object gets extended by every module with behaviors and attributes . When you use Drupal behaviors instead of the standard JQuery on document ready you have accessible in your JavaScript function all the properties and methods defined by other modules. These tutorials ( 1 , 2 ) are for Drupal 6, but they give you a good explanation and idea of what Drupal behaviors are.
