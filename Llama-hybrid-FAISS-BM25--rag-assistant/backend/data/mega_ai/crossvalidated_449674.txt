How to interpret/report regression scoring in the form of probabilities?

Around a hundred features are measured from a product. I've successfully modelled many of them based on a features subset thanks to historical data and random forest regression with very high R2 scores (0.95). How and what evaluation metric should I use in order to be able to make a statement like: 'The physical measurement of this feature can be stopped, replaced by the model's prediction because the chance of the error being greater than XX is only YY%' Or something similar that could be convincing enough for a quality responsible. Thanks in advance
