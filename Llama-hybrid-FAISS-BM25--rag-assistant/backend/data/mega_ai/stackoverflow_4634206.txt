How much JSON should I cache in Android app?

I'm planning to cache some JSON response strings, and I also know when they will expire (app is communicating with my web service). I want to store key-value pairs (key=URL, value={json content+expire date}) somewhere, and I think I have these options: store in cache folder retrieved by getCacheDir() - documentation says you should always have a reasonable maximum, such as 1 MB, for the amount of space you consume with cache files save on a folder in SD Card (what folder? /sdcard/.temp ?) - how much is reasonable here 4 MB? 16 MB store in SQLite database - here I assume that 1 MB limit for internal storage is OK too, and what size is OK for SD Card? Or should I put a combobox somewhere in app Preferences where the user will be able to choose cache location and size? related question
