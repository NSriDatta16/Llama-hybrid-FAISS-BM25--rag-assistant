Medians as input for t-test?

I have some biological data points collected from individual cells. In my field I often see that people average the data points per cell, and then run a t-test using these averages as input. So this means your n in each group equals the number of cells from which you collected and averaged data points. For example you end up with e.g. 5 averages in the control group (from 5 cells) and 5 averages from the treated group (another 5 cells), and then these 10 averages are compared using the t-test. But in my case, the data from each cell (hundreds of data points per cell) is not normally distributed, and as I understand the median will then represent the data more accurately. I used the normality tests in GraphPad Prism (Anderson-Darling, D'√Ågostino & Pearson, Shaprio-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov), all said that the data was not normally distributed. Is it then allowed to use these medians (one from each cell) as input for a t-test? Many thanks for your help! [edit for some additional details]
