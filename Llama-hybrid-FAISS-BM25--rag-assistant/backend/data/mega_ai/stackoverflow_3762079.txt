It sounds like jQuery UI Draggable is exactly what you're after. You'd use the helper: 'clone' option for the cloning, like this: $("img").draggable({ helper: "clone" }); You can attach whatever behaviors you want with the drop event, for example adding a close button, getting the position, etc, for example: $("img").draggable({ helper: "clone", stop: function(e, ui) { var top = ui.position.top; //new left position of cloned/dragged image var left = ui.position.left; //new top position of cloned/dragged image } });
