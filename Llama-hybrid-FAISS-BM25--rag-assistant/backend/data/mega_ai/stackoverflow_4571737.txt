DBMS_UTILITY and DBMS_PROFILER are both free to use. The packages (and views) that require additional licensing will generally be part of one of the various management packs and are documented in the Licensing Guide. For example, the DBMS_SQLTUNE package and the V$SQL_MONITOR view are part of the separately licensed Oracle Tuning Pack. If you use one of these packages or views, the associated entry in DBA_FEATURE_USAGE_STATISTICS should be updated so that the DBA can ensure that the organization is correctly licensed.
