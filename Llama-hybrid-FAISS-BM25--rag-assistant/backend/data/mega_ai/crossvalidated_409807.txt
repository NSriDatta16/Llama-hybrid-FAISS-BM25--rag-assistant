Robustness of Tjur's R^2 for Logistic Regression

I'm designing an experiment and plan to use Tjur's ${R}^2$ , denoted $D$ , to evaluate some logistic regressions. He defines the value in these three equivalent ways: $D = \bar{\hat\pi_1} - \bar{\hat\pi_0}$ where $\bar{\hat\pi_1}$ and $\bar{\hat\pi_0}$ denote the averages of fitted values (predicted probabilities) for successes and failure respectively $D = \frac{1}{2}\left(R^2_{mod}R^2_{res}\right)$ $D = \sqrt{R^2_{mod}R^2_{cor}}$ Let's say I want to test the effect of two features ( $F_1$ and $F_2$ ) on some dependent variable. I run an experiment for $F_1$ on Monday and an experiment for $F_2$ on Tuesday. I construct a Logistic Regression for both experiments and calculate Tjur's $R^2$ value for both regressions. Let's say I also know that the dependent variable is affected by the day of the week, but the relationship is unknown. Does this day of week affect prevent me from comparing $R^2$ values between experiments or does the construction of the value make it robust to underlying differences in probability?
