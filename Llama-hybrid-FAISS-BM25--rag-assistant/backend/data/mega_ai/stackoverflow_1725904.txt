Getting a text file into a two dimensional ragged array in Java

Hey guys this is a followup to my previous question . I now have a text file which is formatted like this: 100 200 123 124 123 145 What I want to do is get these values into a two dimensional ragged array in Java. What I have so far is this: public String[][] readFile(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException { String line = ""; ArrayList rows = new ArrayList(); FileReader fr = new FileReader(fileName); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr); while((line = br.readLine()) != null) { String[] theline = line.split("\\s");//TODO: Here it adds the space between two numbers as an element rows.add(theline); } String[][] data = new String[rows.size()][]; data = (String[][])rows.toArray(data); //In the end I want to return an int[][] this a placeholder for testing return data; My problem here is that for example for the line 100 200 the variable "theline" has three elements {"100","","200"} which it then passes on to rows with rows.add(theline) What I want is to have just the numbers and if possible how to convert this String[][] array into an int[][] array int the end to return it. Thanks!
