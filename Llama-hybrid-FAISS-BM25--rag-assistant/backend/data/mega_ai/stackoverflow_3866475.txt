Smalltalk with Seaside would be the most fun. One click image can be downloaded, and the book is online. 1 Smalltalk insists that you organize your code in classes and methods, but is open to suggestions on how to do that. Seaside is an opinionated web framework, with a strong focus on DRY. 2 It is a Smalltalk, so all objects and sources are available and inspectable. 3 You can easily get started without a database. Larger scale persistence is done most easily by deploying on a glass object-oriented database (zero code needed). It runs in a VMWare image or on a linux or os-x machine. If you want to write code, you can use the GLORP ORM with SqueakDBX to connect to all databases supported by openDBX, or directly to PostgreSQL. 4 Does it have to be that difficult? 5 If it provides an ODBC adapter. 6 There are interfaces to various NoSQL databases.
