EDIT/UPDATE OK, I think I know what you're trying to do now. After you have fixed the statement I described above (appending and then fading in), what you need to do is assign your hover event after the ajax retrieval/appending has had a chance to complete. What is happening is that your first block of code is firing off a bunch of asynchronous requests to the webserver for the images you want. Then, instantly after your first block has "completed", but (importantly!) before these requests have had a chance to complete, your second block of code is (trying to) execute. It is looking for the selector ".pf-box img" to try and add the hover event, but the problem is, these images do not yet exist on the page! What you need to do is wait until the images have come back from the server before you attempt to select them or add events to them. This is done via callbacks, which you already have partially working in your success function... (Please note, I haven't tested this, it is meant to demonstrate only...) // Loop through the images and print them to the page. // Attach hover event within the callback, after image has been added. for (var i=0; i
