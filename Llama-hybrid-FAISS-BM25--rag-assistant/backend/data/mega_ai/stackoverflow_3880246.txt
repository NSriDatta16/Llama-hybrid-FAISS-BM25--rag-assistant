You can also make it manually, by recording microtime() value in various places, like this: and then visualize it name so far delta per cent "; reset($TIMER); $start=$prev=current($TIMER); $total=end($TIMER)-$start; foreach($TIMER as $name => $value) { $sofar=round($value-$start,3); $delta=round($value-$prev,3); $percent=round($delta/$total*100); echo " $name $sofar $delta $percent "; $prev=$value; } echo " "; } ?> an IP address check implies that we are doing this profiling on the working site Though I doubt it's PHP itself. Most likely it's database. So, pay most attention to query execution timing. however, a "site" term is very broad. It includes also JS, CSS, images and stuff. So, I'd suggest to start form FirebFug's Net page to see what part of whole page takes more time. Of course, refining can be done only after analysis of profiling results, and cannot be advised here without it.
