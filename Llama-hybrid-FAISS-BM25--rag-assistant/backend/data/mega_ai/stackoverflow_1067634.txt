Does Visual Studio 2008 utilitize Windows Search for "Find in Files"

or any of the other search options? I usually disable all background indexing on my dev machines, but Find in Files feels slower on my latest dev machine when Windows Search is disabled, and I wonder why. I am unable to find any references to whether or not VS can leverage an existing Widows Search index for the files it is searching.
