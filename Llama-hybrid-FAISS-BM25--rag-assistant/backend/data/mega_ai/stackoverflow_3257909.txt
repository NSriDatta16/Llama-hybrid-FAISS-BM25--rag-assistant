Preventing infinite loop data retrieval with Hibernate

I was wondering: Imagine a scenario where e.g. //POJO public class User { private String userName; private String name; private String surname; private List blogList; //All getters and setters are found here and assume they're generated. } public class Blog { private String title; private String content; private User author; private Date datePublished; private Date dateLastModified; //All getters and setters have been generated (by Eclipse or NetBeans) } Imagine that these objects have been correctly mapped into their respective Hibernate configuration files. My question: How would I retrieve my user with the list of all the user blogs on code level? (i.e., not allow hibernate to populate blogList automatically for me. I want to add paging (i.e. from list 5, retrieve 20 list) and also, if you think carefully, this might be an infinite loop as a Blog has a User entity which has a List entity. How do I prevent this? PS Just out of curiousity, how would I let Hibernate populate my blogList on the configuration side? Thanks in advance.
