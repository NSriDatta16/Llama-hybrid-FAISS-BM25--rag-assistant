Zend Framework: How can I tap into the final view output before it's sent to the browser?

I'm trying to access the final xhtml output right before it's sent to the browser as a string. The postDispatch() methods of the actions and plugins seem to be too early to do this. When I step through Zend_Controller_Front::dispatch() method using a debugger, I can access the desired output as a string right before $this->_response->sendResponse() is called at the very end by adding a watch expression $this->getResponse()->getBody() . However, there seems to be no dedicated hook to tap into right there. I need the final response body as a string in order to send it to Prince XML to generate a pdf. Does anybody know an elegant way to do this? Thanks, Adrian
