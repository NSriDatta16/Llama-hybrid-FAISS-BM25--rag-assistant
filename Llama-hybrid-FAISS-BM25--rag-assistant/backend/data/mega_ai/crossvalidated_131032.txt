Parameterizing deviation from average

I am seeking help in parameterizing a concept. For instance: "Interest in literature" may be higher for poorer book owners than book owners with higher income, given that book ownership is only 10% in low income population in comparison to 90% in high income population. I would like to parameterize as ordinal variable "Interest in literature", using two variables, book ownership (binary) and income (continuous). Any suggestions or reference for doing this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
