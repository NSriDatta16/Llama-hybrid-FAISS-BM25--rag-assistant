Measuring debug vs release of ASP.NET applications

Which has the biggest impact? Building ASP.NET applications in release vs debug mode Setting in web.config Has anyone done any testing to get actual numbers about what the differences are, considering performance and memory usage? (Perhaps other metrics are useful as well?) For example, something like: Execution time | Debug build | Release build -------------------+---------------+--------------- Debug web.config | average 1 | average 2 Retail web.config | average 3 | average 4 Max memory usage | Debug build | Release build -------------------+---------------+--------------- Debug web.config | average 1 | average 2 Retail web.config | average 3 | average 4 Output file size | Debug build | Release build -------------------+---------------+--------------- | size 1 | size 2
