It seems like this is a perfect case for Java Web Start , particularly since you're already thinking of keeping the dependencies on a webserver. I don't know if Maven has a WS plugin; I remember writing code for Maven 1 to do the job. If you'd like to see WebStart in action, I recommend the FindBugs demo page: http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/demo.html -- you'll see a link in the second paragraph.
