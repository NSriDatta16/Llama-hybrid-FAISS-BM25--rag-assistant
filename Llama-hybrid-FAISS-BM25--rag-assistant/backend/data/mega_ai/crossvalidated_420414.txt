This Answer is limited to frequentist statistics and statistical model without random effect. In fact, the statistical modeling is to find the conditional distribution of response variable conditional on fixed values of the covariates, i.e., distribution of $Y|X=x$ . When writing the statistical model, abiding following 3 steps will keep you from mathematical mistakes. Find the form of the distribution of $Y|X=x$ . List the parameters that determine the distribution. Write down how the covariate determine the parameters through the unknown constant parameters. Example 1: Subject = 5-16 year old boys (indexed by $i$ ), response variable $Y$ = height, Covariate $X$ = age. E1-1: Distribution form: $Y_i|X_i \sim Normal$ E1-2: Parameters for normal: mean $\mu_i$ and variance $\sigma_i^2$ E1-3: Functions for parameters: $\mu_i = \mu_0+\beta X_i$ and $\sigma_i^2=\sigma^2$ It is the same as $Y_i = \mu_0 +\beta X_i +\epsilon_i$ and $\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ Example 2: Subject = Men older than 65 years (indexed by $i$ ), response variable ( $Y$ ) = death or alive in the next full year, covariate ( $X$ ) = age. E2-1: Distribution form: $Y_i=\text {death}|X_i$ follows Bernoulli with parameter $\pi_i$ . E2-2: Parameter for Bernoulli: $\pi_i$ , the probability that i-th person dies in next year E2-3: Function of parameters: $\pi_i = \frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X_i}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X_i}}$ or $log(\frac {\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}) = \beta_0+\beta_1X_i$ It is logistic regression and no $\epsilon$ after $\beta_0+\beta_1X_i$ . Example 3: 10 minuets at a specific street from 6:00 am to 9:00 am, $Y_i=$ # of cars passed the street at specific place, $X=int((\text{begining time - 6:00 in minuets})/10)$ E3-1: Distribution: Poisson E3-2: Parameter: $\lambda_i$ E3-3: Function of parameter: $\lambda_i = e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X_i}$ or $log(\lambda_i)=\beta_0+\beta_1X_i$ It is Poisson regression and also no $\epsilon$ after $\beta_0+\beta_1X_i$ . OP's question: Distribution: Any probability distributions belong to proportional hazard family Parameters: Depend on distribution, but we do not need to know because of proportional hazard assumption. Function of parameter: $$h_i(t) = h_0(t) \exp \left ( \sum_{k = 1}^p \beta_k z_{ik} \right )$$ Need to know the fact that hazard determines the probability distribution of the survival time. Obviously, there is no position for $\epsilon$ . If you still do not believe there is no $\epsilon$ in logistic, Poisson and Cox proportional hazard model, you can consider following two questions. In the linear model, $\epsilon$ appears in the process of model establishment. In the final conclusions, we can and need to estimate the variance of $\epsilon$ . We also can estimate $\epsilon$ itself by $Y-\hat Y$ . We also know that $Var(\hat \beta = (X'X)^{-1}\sigma$ . In other 3 kinds of models, if you insist there is $\epsilon$ , why it does not appear in the process of model establishment? What is the effect of $\epsilon$ on the model? Did and could we estimate anything related to $\epsilon$ ? So if you insist there is $\epsilon$ in that 3 kind models, then $\epsilon$ acts like a ghost, when you want it, it would appear,; when you do not it, it would disappear. But in mathematical statistics, this kind of ghost is not allowed in the model. You may ask why it is acceptable that baseline hazard function $\lambda_0(t)$ also appears in the model specification and disappears in the model fitting process and final results. The reason is in the process of model establishment, the $\lambda_0(t)$ is cancelled under the assumption of proportional hazard. If you really interesting in $\lambda_0(t)$ , you can get its estimate, $do not like $ \epsilon$ which cannot be estimated. Why linear model $Y\sim N(X\beta, \sigma^2)$ has an alternative expression $Y=X\beta + \epsilon$ , $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ , and other models do not have alternative expression with $\epsilon$ ?
