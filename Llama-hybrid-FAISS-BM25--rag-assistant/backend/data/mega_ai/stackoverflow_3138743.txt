make file running on Linux - how to ignore case sensitive?

I have a huge project, whole written in C language and I have a single make file that is used to compile it. The project C files contains lots of capitalize problems in it's header files, meaning there are tones of header files that were miss-spelled in lots of C files. The problem is I need to migrate this project to compile on Linux machine and since Linux is case sensitive I got tones of errors. Is there an elegant way which I can run make file in Linux and tell him to ignore case sensitive? Any other solution will be welcome as well. Thanks a lot. Motti.
