Delimiters shouldn't be separated by spaces: private static final String DEFAULT_DELIMITERS = " "; Also, keep the following in mind (from the Javadoc): StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead. String.split() was introduced in JDK 1.4. That said: Using a Scanner to tokenize a stream together with a StringTokenizer looks a bit weird to me; You call st.nextToken() twice in the inner loop; t is useless. You re-create it each time in your inner loop and use only one element of it. It seems that what you are trying to build is a lexical analyzer. Maybe you should look up some documentation on the subject.
