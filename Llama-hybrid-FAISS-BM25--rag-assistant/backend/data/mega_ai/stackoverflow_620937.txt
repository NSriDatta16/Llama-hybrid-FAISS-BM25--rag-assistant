From the HTML 4.0 spec : The NOSCRIPT element allows authors to provide alternate content when a script is not executed. The content of a NOSCRIPT element should only be rendered by a script-aware user agent in the following cases: The user agent is configured not to evaluate scripts. The user agent doesn't support a scripting language invoked by a SCRIPT element earlier in the document. It seems to me that this implies that the entire contents of the NOSCRIPT tag (in this case, your div) are ignored altogether if scripting is enabled in the browser. Have you verified that the "example" div is accessible through the DOM at all in your case?
