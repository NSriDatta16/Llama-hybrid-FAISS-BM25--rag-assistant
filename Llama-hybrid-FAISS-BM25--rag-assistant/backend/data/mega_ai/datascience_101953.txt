You haven't specified the programming language you are using,so I'll provide different options. The "ruptures" package in python would be a good option that would allow you to try out several different change point detection methods to your data. Before using it maybe it would be helpful to read this review, where the rupture methods are further explained - understanding the methods better will help you on the method selection.Another review paper that summarises and explains change point detection methods is " A Survey of Methods for Time Series Change Point Detection ". Alternatively if you are using R you could use the "changepoint" package (reference manual here ) Finally, from the description of the task I believe simpler change point detection methods could also work e.g. I would start with trying CUSUM method (available in R here and it is also integrated in the signal processing library in matlab )
