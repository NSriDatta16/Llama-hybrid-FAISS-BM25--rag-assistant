I think that you should not put median and average into the same plot, because they are fundamentally different. A standard way to display median statistics is the "box-and-whisker"-plot , which shows minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. In order to get that in gnuplot, you have to do several passes using multiplot: set multiplot set style fill empty set boxwidth 0.4 plot "data" using 1:3:2:6:5 with candlesticks lt -1 lw 5 notitle,\ '' using 1:4:4:4:4 with candlesticks lt -1 lw 10 notitle set boxwidth 0.3 plot "data" using 1:2:2:2:2 with candlesticks lt -1 lw 5 notitle,\ '' using 1:6:6:6:6 with candlesticks lt -1 lw 5 notitle This assumes that your "data" file has the columns x-value, minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum in that order. Of course, you can play around with the boxwidths, line types ( lt ) and line widths ( lw ) to get what you need. If you want average with standard deviation instead, you can use the standard errorbars; I believe that you can use boxwidth to adjust the size of the error bars. In order to set the output type, use set terminal . I would recommend to use a vector format in order to avoid pixelization. You can see which terminals are available in your installation with help set terminal at the gnuplot prompt. Also, use the butt option to that, if available (that prevents lines from "overshooting").
