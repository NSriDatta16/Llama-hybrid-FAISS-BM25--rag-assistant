Does fuzzy logic really improve simple machine learning algorithms?

I'm reading about fuzzy logic and I just don't see how it would possibly improve machine learning algorithms in most instances (which it seems to be applied to relatively often). Take for example, k nearest neighbors. If you have a bunch a bunch of attributes like color: [red,blue,green,orange], temperature: [real number], shape: [round, square, triangle] , you can't really fuzzify any of these except for the real numbered attribute (please correct me if I'm wrong), and I don't see how this can improve anything more than bucketing things together. How can machine fuzzy logic be used to improve machine learning? The toy examples you'll find on most websites don't seem to be all that applicable, most of the time.
