Following up on Louis Gerbarg's comment from last year, it's also useful to be able to easily filter by class name. Try the following D script: #!/usr/sbin/dtrace -s #pragma D option quiet objc$target:::entry /strstr(probemod,$$1) != NULL/ { printf("%s %s\n", probemod, probefunc); } Save it, chmod a+x objc-calls.d , and then do sudo objc-calls.d -c /Your/Binary NSObject to see just the invocations related to NSObject (and its categories).
