With regard to the class imbalanced topic, I would consider these two common/possible cases: is the class imbalance of your dataset caused by the way the data was gathered? If afirmative, and you do not have the chance to get more representative data, I would go over/undersampling methodologies as you are trying otherwise, if you think the dataset is representative enough of the nature of your problem, I would focus on selecting the right metric to evaluate your model, and keep the dataset imbalance as is (this way the model learns to predict on the real classes distribution which will find at inference time); in this case, you can select some standard metrics (among others) which help you pay oattention on the minority class (your "ones"), like could be F1-score or precision-recall AUC (in this second one you can afterwards select the best threshold for your classifier) and so on. About the technical problem you found, might it be test_df you are using? You should display all the code and some dataset rows example.
