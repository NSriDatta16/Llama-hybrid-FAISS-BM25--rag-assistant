Adaptive SVM formulation, finding the dual of the optimization problem

I am trying to find the dual optimization problem for the following adaptive SVM. $\mathbf{w}_t$ are the weights of the target SVM. $C$ and $B$ are regularization parameters (constants), $\mathbf{w}_s$ are the weights of the source SVM (constants) and $\mathbf{\xi}$ is a slack variable.
