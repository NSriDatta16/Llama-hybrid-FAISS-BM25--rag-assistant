$$ P(2k, n-2k| \Theta) = \frac{2^{n-2k} \binom{\Theta-k}{n-2k} \binom{\Theta}{k}}{\binom{2\Theta}{n}}.$$ Denominator - Unconstrained no. ways to choose socks This is given exactly by the binomial coefficient to choose $n$ objects from $2\Theta$ : $$\binom{2\Theta}{n}.$$ Numerator - No. ways to choose $k$ pairs This is again a binomial coefficient: we want to choose $k$ pairs out of a set of $\Theta$ : $$\binom{\Theta}{k}$$ Numerator - No. ways to choose the single socks There remain $\Theta - k$ pairs of socks ,and we want to to choose $n-2k$ of these: as before the number of ways to choose the types of socks will be $\binom{\Theta-k}{n-2k}$ . However we now need to account for the fact that for each pair of socks there were two possible choices (eg. left/right foot). So for each type of sock we need to multiply by a factor of $2$ , giving: $$2^{n-2k} \binom{\Theta-k}{n-2k}$$ Notes The above assumes that all of your socks go into the wash in pairs: note that this differs from Baath's assumption in the link that Tim provided, where he supposes that its possible that there are some single socks in the wash. ( Edited ) As discussed in the comments when $k = 0$ the likelihood will be maximised as $\Theta \rightarrow \infty$ . To get around this case you may wish to regularise by making assumptions about the reasonable expectations of the maximum (eg. what's the maximimum no. socks your machine could hold) - this is well suited to a Bayesian analysis where you would place a prior on $\Theta$ . Again, Baath's post gives a good introduction. Here's a blog post I wrote on the explicit calculation for Baath's analysis.
