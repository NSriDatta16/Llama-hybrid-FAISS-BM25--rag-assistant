Data Exploration - How To Bin Data?

There are 1100 data points split into about 35 discrete groups and distributed towards the left. After running a logistic regression which failed, then running it again by only predicting based on subsets of the data which worked, it seemed likely that there is a nonlinear relationship. I am trying to determine the nature of this relationship to decide on how best to build my predictive model. The first image below is each discrete value on the x axis, and the y axis is the percent of target variable success. Since the first image doesn't reveal much I tried binning the data, so the three graphs below are the x variables binned into different groupings on the x axis, and the y axis is percent of the target variable success. It seems pretty hard to draw any conclusions as all these graphs show different things, or they don't show anything obvious, at least to me. Question 1- How do I best decide on how to bin data, to show relationships? Question 2- Are there any important relationships based on the graphs below that you can see?
