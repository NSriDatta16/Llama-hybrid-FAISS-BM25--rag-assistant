How do I know whats my null hypothesis?

I was reading about t-tests and began wondering why the null hypothesis is chosen such that it states there is no difference between the means. The deeper question I have here is how do I state my null hypothesis? I could just as well say the null hypothesis is that the means are different. In the case of means, I know beforehand whats my null hypothesis but in any other case say whether applying a coat of paint on the roof reduces the temperature or not, how do I know what my null hypothesis should be? Is there a formal way to arrive at the null hypothesis?
