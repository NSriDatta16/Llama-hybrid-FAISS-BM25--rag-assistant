I think the /y just answers Yes to the "Are you sure?" prompt. I'd think that sc could be used as well, though it may time out waiting for the service to stop if there's a lot of inflight transactions. Does it give you any specifics of why it can't stop? Here's a couple of other methods to stop a remote SQL instance. Except for SHUTDOWN WITH NOWAIT, I'd recommend any of them. psexec will let you run net stop remotely. There's also the SQL SHUTDOWN command - you can issue that WITH NOWAIT to avoid waiting for current transactions to finish and checkpointing, which will make shutdown faster (but subsequent startup slower, and could lead to lost data). Or you could use either Configuration Manager or Management Studio to stop a remote instance. Edit: The error is pretty self explanatory . It means you must stop dependent services first. Sql Agent is probably at least one of them. Checking Admin Tools->Services will show you the rest.
