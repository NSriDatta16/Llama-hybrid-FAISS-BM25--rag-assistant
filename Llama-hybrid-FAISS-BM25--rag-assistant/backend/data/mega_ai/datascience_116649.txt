Handling NaN values in a feature representing prioritization ranking

I have a data set like so ID EmailRecOrder IPRecOrder DeviceRecOrder Spam 1 NaN NaN NaN 1 2 22 12 NaN 1 3 1 7 14 0 4 4 4 NaN 1 The RecOrder columns are rankings of how important they are. For example a EmailRecOrder of 1 means is high priority. Some of these rows won't have a ranking though and are left as NaN. How should I handle something like this if I want to put it in a machine learning model. I don't want to remove rows where there are NAs. Should I just set NaN to some random number like -99 since rankings can't be negative? I want to remove
