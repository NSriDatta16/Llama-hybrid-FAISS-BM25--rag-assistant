Being a one-man web-design studio I use a Basecamp free account to organize to-do lists (a nice thing their tasks have comments , so when you solve some task you can comment it step by step for further reference). Messages and milestones are useful also. To keep track of the code (php, html, etc) I use Eclipse and its built-in CVS. Note: I tried various project managers and version control systems, but all of them seem to be too functional for a single developer.
