Free IDE for Windows Mobile Development?

It's been a while now since Microsoft stopped supporting Embedded Visual C++ 4.0 (eVC 4), and they don't let you use the Windows Mobile SDK with the Express version of VS 2008. Now, I'm OK because I get an MSDN license through work (including VS 2008 Pro), but I'd like to work on a couple open-source projects, and not all the other contributing developers are so lucky. As a result, they're sticking with eVC, even though it doesn't run at all on Vista. Is there a (free!) common denominator here? An IDE that will build MFC (and/or .NET!) apps, which runs on both XP and Vista? It doesn't have to be fancy, per se, but the more VS-level niceties it has, the happier I think we'd all be with it. Suggestions for cheap commercial-ware are also welcome, though of course the very best option would be something open-source, especially cross-platform. I think MS is doing serious damage to the WM OS by discouraging development like this.
