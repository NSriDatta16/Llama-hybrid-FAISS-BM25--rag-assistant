A test coverage tool is a good way to do this. They tell you what part of an application is exercised by a test. Instrument the application to collect test coverage. Execute the functionality you care about. Record what is executed. Execute something similar, but not the same as the functionality you want. Record this. Take the set difference over the coverage. The diff selects code involved in the functionality of interest, excluding code which is common to similar functionality.
