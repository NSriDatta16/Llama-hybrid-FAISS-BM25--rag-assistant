You can use the HTTP_USER_AGENT header to see what's the browser that's submitting the request. For I.E it would be like : Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0 ; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E) P.S: This header can be manipulated by the client and submitted to browser so it is not 100% reliable. Am curious to know why you want to restrict users to I.E?
