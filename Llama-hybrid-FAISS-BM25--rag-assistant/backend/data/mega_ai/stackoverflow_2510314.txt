It looks like you want to use something like the hypernym/hyponym relationships in WordNet, but without actually using WordNet due to language and domain specific coverage issues? That is, if you had the domain specific hypernym relationships, you could get the "super" representation by just looking for the nearest parent that subsumed all of the words in the list, or the nearest node that was equal to one of the list words and subsumed all of the others. To start, I would first point out that WordNets are actually available for many of the worlds major languages see the list at Global WordNet . To get domain specific hypernym relationships , you could use the technique presented in Snow et al.'s Learning syntactic patterns for automatic hypernym discovery . That is, you could start off with a small list of seed hypernyms, and then use them to train a classifier to detected the hypernyms in a corpus. You would then run this classifier over data from your domain in order to build a list of domain specific hypernym pairs.
