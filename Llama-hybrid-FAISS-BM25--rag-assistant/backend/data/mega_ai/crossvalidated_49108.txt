Post-hoc test after 2-factor repeated measures ANOVA in R?

I have problems finding a solution regarding how to run a post-hoc test (Tukey HSD) after a 2-factor (both within-subjects) repeated-measures ANOVA in R. For the ANOVA, I've used the aov -function: summary(aov(dv ~ x1 * x2 + Error(subject/(x1*x2)), data=df1)) After reading answers to other questions, I gathered that I would first have to re-run the ANOVA using some other fuction (e.g., lme). This is what I came up with. Lme.mod Both main effects were significant, but there were no interaction effects. Then, I used these functions for the post-hoc comparisons: summary(glht(Lme.mod, linfct=mcp(x1="Tukey"))) summary(glht(Lme.mod, linfct=mcp(x2="Tukey"))) However, there were some problems: First of all, the R Help file says that "The mcp function must be used with care when defining parameters of interest in two-way ANOVA or ANCOVA models (...) multcomp version 1.0-0 and higher generates comparisons for the main effects only, ignoring covariates and interactions (older versions automatically averaged over interaction terms). A warning is given." And sure enough, I received the following warning message: Warning message: In mcp2matrix(model, linfct = linfct) : covariate interactions found -- default contrast might be inappropriate Another puzzling thing was that although both main effects were significant, there were no significant differences in the post-hoc comparisons for one of the factors (x1). I've never encountered this before. Are the scripts/analyses correct/appropriate, or is there something that I'm missing? Any help would be most appreciated!
