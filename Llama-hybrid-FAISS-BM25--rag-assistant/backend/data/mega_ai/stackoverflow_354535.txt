Object.clone() has some major problems, and its use is discouraged in most cases. Please see Item 11, from " Effective Java " by Joshua Bloch for a complete answer. I believe you can safely use Object.clone() on primitive type arrays, but apart from that you need to be judicious about properly using and overriding clone. You are probably better off defining a copy constructor or a static factory method that explicitly clones the object according to your semantics.
