The select nodes is returning two XmlNode objects. XmlNodeList saveItems = save.SelectNodes("Storage/Save"); Later in your code you seem to be selecting the first one and with saveItems.Item(0) and getting values from it which in this case would be the save node with the Name="LifeLine". So if you were to do saveItems.Item(1) and select nodes and its values then you would get the other set of nodes.
