So I take it the parent pom is referencing one of the submodules as a dependency? I would suggest if you have any build logic going on in the parent module you push it down into a new submodule. The parent should limit itself to specifying the , , and sections. All other work should be farmed out to submodules. See the following for more advice on organizing multi-module projects: http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/pom-relationships-sect-pom-best-practice.html
