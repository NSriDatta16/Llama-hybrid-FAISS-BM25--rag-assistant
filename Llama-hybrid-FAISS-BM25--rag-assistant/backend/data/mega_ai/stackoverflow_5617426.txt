The issue was resolved much later - I post it up here in case it helps somebody someday. It turned out to be a wrong precompiled header path: release configuration pointed to the default debug PCH path. So on transition from debug to release, a build would drag in all the debug PCH contents - apparently including some debug versions of MFC #pragma (comment "lib..") (included in afx headers). A clean build would rebuild the PCH correctly, but again into the debug folder - thereby causing identical problems on transition back to debug build.
