If you square the result, it puts it back on the original scale of measurement, and you have a kind of an alternative version of the mean - let's call it the "sqrt mean", say, or SM for short. Note that if you had used logs instead of square roots, then the antilog of the average of the logs does have a name -- the geometric mean. It can be shown (Jensen's inequality) that for positive data, $GM \le SM \le AM$ where $AM$ Denotes the ordinary arithmetic mean. So yes, I think there is meaning in the results you have.
