Java was never "innovative". It began as a crippled, "programmer-friendly" version of C++, and then started to slowly reintroduce missing features which have been existing in other programming languages for a looong time. Only that those decades-old "novelties" were mangled in order to make them fit into the limitations of the JVM. But maybe I misunderstand your notion of "innovative".
