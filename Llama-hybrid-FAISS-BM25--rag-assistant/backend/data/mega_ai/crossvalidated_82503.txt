Can Random Forest Methodology be Applied to Linear Regressions?

Random Forests work by creating an ensemble of decision trees where each tree is created using a bootstrap sample of the original training data (sample of both input variables and observations). Can a similar process be applied for linear regression? Create k linear regression models using a random bootstrap sample for each of the k regressions What are the reasons NOT to create a "random regression" like model? Thanks. If there's something I'm just fundamentally misunderstanding then please let me know.
