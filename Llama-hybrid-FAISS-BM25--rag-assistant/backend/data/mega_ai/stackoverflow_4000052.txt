Magento Multiple Authorize.net Gateways

I have a CAD and USD gateway accounts for processing credit card payments, both from a payment provider with support for the Authorize.net API. I've successfully configured one using Magento's built-in Authorize.net support... but how can I configure a second Authorize.net Gateway for use in my store?
