python sample code for hyperparameter optimization using Population Based Training

I am doing an experiment on word2vec hyperparameter optimization using Grid Search, Bayesian Optimization and Population Based Training. For this experiment, the code for Grid Search and Bayesian method has been written and working. Therefore I need help with writing the code for the Population Based Training Method. Please i need help with sample python code for hyperparameter optimization using Population Based training. Thanks
