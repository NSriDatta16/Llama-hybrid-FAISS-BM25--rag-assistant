For a time series regression, simply adding hourly dummies $D_h, h = 0,\cdots, 23$ , is the natural thing to do in most cases, i.e. fit the model $$ y_t = \beta_0 D_0 + \cdots + \beta_{23}D_{23} + \mbox{ other covariates } + \epsilon_t. $$ As a modeler, you're simply saying that the dependent variable $y_t$ has a hourly-dependent average $\beta_h$ at hour $h$ , plus the effect from other covariates. Any hourly (additive) seasonality in the data would be picked up by this regression. (Alternatively, seaonsality can be modeled multiplicatively by, say, a SARMAX-type model.) Transforming the data by some arbitrary periodic function (sin/cos/etc) is not really appropriate. For example, say you fit the model $$ y_t = \sum_{h=0}^{23} \beta_{h}\sin(2 \pi \frac{h(t)}{24}) + \mbox{ other covariates } + \epsilon_t, $$ where $h(t) = 12$ if observation $y_t$ is sampled at the 12th hour of the day (for example). Then you're imposing a peak at hour $h = 6$ (or whenever, by transforming the sine function) on the data, arbitrarily.
