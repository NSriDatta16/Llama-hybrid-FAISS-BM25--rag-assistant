Clearly there is no universal answer to you question. First you need to create some simple program using DLL's or statically linked libs (simply as an exercise). Before you know how to create such application from scratch it is not advisable to attempt fragmenting real-life project. There are couple of MS tutorials here and here for static libraries and DLLs correspondingly. After that you can approach your application. First try to understand the structure of your project. Ideally you would be able to figure out GUI part, business logic and back end. The easiest usually is GUI (because business logic is often interwoven with backend, my prediction you are going to have hard time separating those two). Move all the files that drive GUI (dialogs, user event handlers and such) into separate DLL. Once GUI is separated look at the rest. From my experience next thing to do is to separate utilities, that are used everywhere in your application but do not really depend on the application state (or provided with relevant state on every call). While doing so you will learn a lot about the rest of the project, hopefully enough to fragment it even further. Process is incremental and there is no magic wand. Sorry.
