As for SARIMA, it's definitely a good idea to take seasonality into account, but it may depend on the specifics of your data. Have you tried looking at the seasonal decomposition of your time series? That could help you determine whether you need to include seasonality in your model. Also, keep in mind that sometimes even the best models can give poor performance. It might be worth exploring other methods of prediction, such as machine learning algorithms or hybrid models.
