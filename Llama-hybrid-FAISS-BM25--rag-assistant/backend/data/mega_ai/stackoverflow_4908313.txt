It seems that this site requires an Accept HTTP request header: client.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.Accept] = "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8"; One of the problems you will encounter with what you are currently doing is that you are totally dependent on how the site you are trying to scrape works. Not to mention the fragility of your HTML parsing code. What is worse is that this could change anytime and you have no control unless you own the site. Tomorrow the site might start requiring some other HTTP header and your code will stop working once again. Just saying this so that you are prepared. Maybe you could contact the site owners and see if they are offering an official API to consume their content.
