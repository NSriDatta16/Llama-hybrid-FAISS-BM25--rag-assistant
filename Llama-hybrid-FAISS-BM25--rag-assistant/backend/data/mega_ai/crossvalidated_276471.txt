The output of an rnn is not a 'class'. You'll need to do something to the output to make it into a class. typically this will involve adding something like: a fully-connected layer, with the number of output neurons identical to the number of classes a softmax layer, to normalize the outputs of the fully-connected layer into a probability distribution, ie sum to 1 finally, an argmax , which chooses the class to be the neuron of the softmax having the maximum value After adding these layers onto the output of your rnn, you can then backpropagate your target classes through these as normal, and thence into the rnn. By the way the input to this sequence of output layers will be the final state of your rnn, since you're doing sequence -> one essentially, squashing your sequence of input values into a single feature vector, being the final state of your rnn.
