Frequentist vs Bayesian and deterministic vs stochastic

So this is sort of a general/basic, likely dumb question. I'm hoping to get a general idea, to better guide what I search/read. How do these terms relate to each other. I know with Bayesian theory, you use priors to inform the model, where in frequentism you're just using the variables you have measured to build the model. Do both of these approaches use deterministic and stochastic models? Can you have a frequentist stochastic model?
