Isolated storage will give you a folder you can read from and write to without dealing with file and folder permissions. That's always nice. The thing is, though, accessing isolated storage isn't as easy as accessing a local folder. That said, it depends on what you want to store. App_Data is for data files (database files, etc.). If that's what you need to store, then by all means, use it. If you need a space for temporary or slightly more permanent storage of a file, then look into isolated storage.
