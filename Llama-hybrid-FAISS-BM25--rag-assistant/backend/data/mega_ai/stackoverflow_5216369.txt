My next step would be to fire up profiler and find out what your application is ACTUALLY sending to SQL Server. Make sure the values coming in are what you expect them to be, then execute the query directly in SSMS/QA to make sure it behaves as expected. I'm with Alex in that the culprit is probably an unexpected value in your label. Find out for sure what SQL Server is seeing so you know which value needs more attention throughout the page life cycle.
