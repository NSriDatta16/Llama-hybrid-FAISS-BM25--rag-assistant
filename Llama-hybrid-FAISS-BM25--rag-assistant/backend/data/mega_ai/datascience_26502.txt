Working back and forth with DataFrame and nparray in Pipeline transformers

Little backstory : I've recently purchased the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow and I've started trying to apply what I've read so far in the book. Before this, I tested my knowledge on the Kaggle Titanic "competition". I now want to refactor my code to use some good practices I learned while reading the book. At some point, the author talks about sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline . I started writing my own Transformers to populate my pipeline. The problem I face is that, in some transformers, I'd use some pandas functions, in other numpy functions and I keep converting my dataset back and forth. I did some research and din't find anything useful, it would be of great help if someone can answer the following questions: Are there good practices concerning Pipeline ? Should I stick to pandas , numpy , is it a good practice to convert back and forth?
