How do I generate a series of hourly averages in MySQL?

I've got data in ten minutes intervals in my table: 2009-01-26 00:00:00 12 2009-01-26 00:10:00 1.1 2009-01-26 00:20:00 11 2009-01-26 00:30:00 0 2009-01-26 00:40:00 5 2009-01-26 00:50:00 3.4 2009-01-26 01:00:00 7 2009-01-26 01:10:00 7 2009-01-26 01:20:00 7.2 2009-01-26 01:30:00 3 2009-01-26 01:40:00 25 2009-01-26 01:50:00 4 2009-01-26 02:00:00 3 2009-01-26 02:10:00 4 etc. Is it possible to formulate a single SQL-query for MySQL which will return a series of averages over each hour? In this case it should return: 5.42 8.87 etc.
