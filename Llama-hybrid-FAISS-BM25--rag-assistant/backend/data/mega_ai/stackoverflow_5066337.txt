Getting a Caught NoReverseMatch error in django

I have a view called edit_order, and I have another view called client_items. def edit_order(request, order_no) change_item = order.contact.client def client_items(request, client_id = 0): client = None items = None try: client = models.Client.objects.get(pk = client_id) items = client.storageitem_set.all() except: return HttpResponse(reverse(return_clients)) return render_to_response('items.html', {'items':items, 'client':client}, context_instance = RequestContext(request)) And in my edit order template I have a template tag url. This works. Now, I want to make another view which does the same but can use an order_no parameter. But for some reason this does not work. I have called this view test_items. def test_items(request, client_id = 0, order_no=0): client = None items = None try: client = models.Client.objects.get(pk = client_id) items = client.storageitem_set.all() order = models.Order.objects.get(pk = order_no) except: return HttpResponse(reverse(return_clients)) return render_to_response('test.html', {'items':items, 'client':client, 'order':order}, context_instance = RequestContext(request)) And in my template I have changed the url to this. So I get this error. Caught NoReverseMatch while rendering: Reverse for 'tiptop.views.test_items' with arguments '(17L,)' and keyword arguments '{}' not found. The reason why this is causing this is the order_no parameter. But I want to be able to use this parameter. Is there a way I can overcome this issue? I hope this all made sense.
