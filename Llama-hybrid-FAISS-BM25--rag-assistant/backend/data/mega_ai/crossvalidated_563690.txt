First of all, this is not a well defined problem. One cannot simply sort n-dimensional vectors in general without making assumptions. Meanings of your features will play a key role. For example, Using some naive methods as taking average of all feature values for a datapoint and then comparing those averages against each datapoint doesn't sound very good. It indeed sounds good enough if these features were just exam results of students. How to combine the features into a single number for sorting is your choice because you own the data. This could be vector norms, weighted averages etc. It's best to try different approaches and ask stakeholders' opinion (this maybe you as well) if the order makes sense or not.
