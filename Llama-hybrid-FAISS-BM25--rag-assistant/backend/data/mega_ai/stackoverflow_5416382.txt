Using CONTENT keyword while creating a table with an XML column from XML Schema Collection

While creating a table that has an XML type column, I am referring to a complex XML Schema Collection . When I specify the XML Schema , I have the option of mentioning either CONTENT or DOCUMENT keyword. The latter will ensure that the XML data is stored as a document in a single column. According to a video tutorial the CONTENT will store the XML data in fragments . Besides the above statement I don't find reference anywhere else regarding the usage of the CONTENT keyword and it's implication on schema & data. I would like to know how the fragments are created and managed and whether and how they can be queried individually. Further, how the fragments are correlated. Next, when I amend the XML Schema Collection, what is the impact.
