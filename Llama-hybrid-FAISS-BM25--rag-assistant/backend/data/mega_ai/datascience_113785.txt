Time Series Forecasting in Python Question

I am trying to understand what is the best possible way to execute a time series forecast. I am trying to forecast the number of employees that are going to call in sick on a given day. My data has the current features. Employee hometown Job title of employee Seniority of employee Date Day of week Week of Year Sick count The Employee hometown, job title, and seniority columns are important because sick numbers historically are heavily dependent on these attributes. Also, I would like to execute an algorithm that also puts a heavier weight on 2021 and 2022 sick counts. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!
