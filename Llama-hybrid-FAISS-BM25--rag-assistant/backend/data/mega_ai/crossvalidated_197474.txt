Predictive density and likelihood evaluation at time t+1 of GARCH model

I am new to forecast and I would appreciate any help. I want to do Bayesian estimation of GARCH models. I read a similar question here , but I have some additional questions. The model is $$y_i=\sigma_i\epsilon_i,$$ $$\sigma^2_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 y^2_{i-1} + \alpha_2 \sigma^2_{i-1}, $$ $$ \text{where } \epsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim}\mathcal{N}(0,1),\ i=1,2,\cdots,T.$$ The parameters of the model are estimated using the first $t$ observations, and these estimates are used to make one-step-ahead forecasts for the remaining $T-t$ periods. The vignette of the package stochvol says (page 23, Algortihm 1) to do the following steps: Algorithm 1 (Predictive density and likelihood evaluation at time t + 1) Obtain M posterior draws of $\theta, \text{where } \theta=(\alpha_0,\ \alpha_1,\ \alpha_2).$ Obtain M draws from the conditional distribution $ \sigma_{{t+1}|[1:t]}|y_{[1:t]},\theta_{[1:t]} $ by computing $ \sigma^{(m)}_{{t+1}|[1:t]} =\sqrt{ \alpha_{0,[1:t]}^{(m)} + \alpha_{1,[1:t]}^{(m)} (y_t^{o})^2+\alpha_{2,[1:t]}^{(m)} ( \sigma^{(m)}_{t,[1:t]})^2 } $ To obtain $\text{PL}_{t+1}$, average over M densities of normal distribution with mean $(1,y_t) \times \beta_{[1:t]}^{(m)} $ and standard deviation $\exp( \sigma_{t+1,[1:t]}^{(m)}) $, each evaluated at $y_{t+1}^{o}$ for $m=1,2,\cdots, M.$ To obtain M draws from the predictive distribution, simulate from a normal distribution with mean $(1,y_t) \times \beta_{[1:t]}^{(m)} $ and Standard deviation $\exp( \sigma_{t+1,[1:t]}^{(m)}) $ for $m=1,2,\cdots, M.$, where by using the superscript $(^o)$ in $y_{[1:t]}$, we follow Geweke and Amisano (2010) and denote ex post realizations (observations) for the set of points in time ${1,2,\cdots,t}$ of the ex ante random values $y_{[1:t]}$ (page 22). My questions are: For step 2: the term $(y_t^{o})^2$ represents the observed price at time $t$? I read here (page 7) that starting from the GARCH(1,1) equation for $\sigma_{t}^2$ , we can derive our forecast for next period's variance, $\hat{\sigma}_{t+1}^2$ by $$ \hat{\sigma}_{t+1}^2 =\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 E(y_t^2|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}) + \alpha_2 \sigma_t^{2} = \alpha_0 +(\alpha_1 +\alpha_2)\sigma_t^{2}$$ While we use the observed value at step 2, we use the term $ E(y_t^2|\mathcal{F}_{t-1})$ at the last equation. Please, can you explain this to me. Moreover, why do we use the term $ E(y_t^2|\mathcal{F}_{t-1})$ and not $ E(y_t^2|\mathcal{F}_{t})$? For step 3: My question is similar. The terms $(y_{t+1}^{o})^2$ are the true values? Here, I don't have $\beta$-parameters, so the mean is zero? Could you please propose a book that will help me?
