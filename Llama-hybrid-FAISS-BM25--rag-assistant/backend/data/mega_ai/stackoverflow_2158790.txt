As an exercise this is sort of interesting, but everyone telling you not to use XML for this is right. An RDBMS is the typical best solution for storage you're reading from and writing to. As for your problem, I would be likely to add an id attribute to any node I cared about having an id for. Then, if I used the DOM extension, I'd do setAttribute , or if I were using SimpleXML, I'd use addAttribute . But there are even more solutions to dealing with XML in PHP. I'd have a look at many and see which meet your needs best. Best of luck.
