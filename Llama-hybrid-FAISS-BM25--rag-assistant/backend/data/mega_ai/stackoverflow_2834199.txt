Keep in mind that by changing the values shown by a menu, you aren't preventing a user from accessing a page directly -- even if the user can't get to xyz.jsp by dropping down a menu item, they can still enter xyz.jsp into the address bar of their browser. So you'll have to block the access in another way. If you have any experience with Spring, or are considering implementing it, take a look at Spring Security . It can be used to limit user access rights to different parts of your application. It isn't terribly hard to implement if you are already familiar with Spring. ETA : For some basics that don't involve Spring Security, check out security in web.xml: http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bncbe.html#bncbj
