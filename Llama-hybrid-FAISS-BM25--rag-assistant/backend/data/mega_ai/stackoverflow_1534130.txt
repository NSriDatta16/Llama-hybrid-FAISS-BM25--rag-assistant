TeamCity MSBuild Gallio NCover Reporting

I'm a complete build system newbie through and through. I've been playing with this for about two weeks on and off now and I just can't crack it, I think I've reached a point where I need a fresh pair of eyes. Ultimately I'm aiming for having a new NCover coverage report (the summary one at least) in my TeamCity build project. I've tried all manner of things, some demo's I've found online, the Extras from the NCover guys and read so much I'm pretty confused! I have the following task in my MSBuild script: The error message I see in the gallio_cover.xml report that is produced is: I've snipped off a load of stuff from the last message. I've seen so many different examples of how this 'should be done' that I can't seem to track down the problem with how I'm calling NCover via Gallio. Any ideas or input would be really appreciated. Thanks, James.
