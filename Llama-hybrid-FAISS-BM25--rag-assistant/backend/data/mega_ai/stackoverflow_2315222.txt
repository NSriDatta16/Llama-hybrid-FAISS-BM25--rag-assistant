Neural Network Recommendation Engine

How would one design a neural network for the purpose of a recommendation engine. I assume each user would require their own network, but how would you design the inputs and the outputs for recommending an item in a database. Are there any good tutorials or something? Edit: I was more thinking how one would design a network. As in how many input neurons and how the output neurons point to a record in a database. Would you have say 6 output neurons, convert it to an integer (which would be anything from 0 - 63) and that is the ID of the record in the database? Is that how people do it?
