Parameters of the model that you describe are indeed only $a$ ( slope ) and $b$ ( intercept ). Other, more complicated models, have other parameters. By training ( fitting ) of the model you mean finding the values of these parameters that make the model explain your data (in the sense of minimizing some objective function). Parameters of the model can be sometimes called also weights , for example, in the context of neural networks, this is usually the case.
