php / js facebook API Internet explorer fb_xd_fragment

I'm debugging my website on Internet Explorer and, each time I try to use Facebook and connect with IE, it logs me in with Facebook, but in the popup it changes the URL to something beginning with "fb_xd_fragment" and it doesn't set the cookies for my domain... Any idea how to fix this? It only happens on IE, works perfectly on FF/Chrome/Safari. Thanks
