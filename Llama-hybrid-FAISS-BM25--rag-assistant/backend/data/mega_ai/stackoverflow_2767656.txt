This is kind of a design issue forced by a technical issue. I'd probably redesign/reorganize my content into one of three ways: 1- Click-activated mega-menus ( example ). The downfall here is that you might have real estate issues. 2- Top-Level Category links that lead to Navigation Pages. The downfall here is that it requires an extra page load to get to the content. 3- Make each Menu Item consist of two buttons, one to navigate to the page (the text) and one to expand the child menu (an arrow.) You'd still need, though, to provide the child navigation, if present, on the page the user goes to when they click a menu item.
