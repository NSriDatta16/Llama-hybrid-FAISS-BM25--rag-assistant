ASP.NET MVC: How to avoid circular reference between 2 projects

My application has at least 2 projects, the OrganizationMangement and the ContactManagement. Previously, I referenced ContactManagement because I need to work with a class located in the OrganizationManagement. Now I need to do the reverse but I'm getting the following error " Cannot reference OrganizationManagement ... to avoid circular reference. " I guess the error makes sense. But, how can I avoid that? I mean I need those classes just to transfert data from one project to another. To solve the problem, I copied the class to a folder located in the other project and tried this var contact = (Contact)TempData["contact"]; Now, I'm getting this error: Cannot convert implicitly ContactManagement.Contact to OrganizationManagement.Contact... an explicit conversion exists... Thanks for helping
