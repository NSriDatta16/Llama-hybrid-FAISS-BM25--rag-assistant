WCF Server returning "Content-Length: 0"

Greetings, I create a new project (in VS2010) using; File -> New Web Site -> .NET Framework 3.5 -> WCF Service Service works great via Cassini, can view the WSDL metadata with success. Then I attempt to setup the application to be served via IIS. Using a .NET 2.0 application pool with "Integrated" pipeline. I made sure the svc handler is setup on the application (both managed and script) and ran this command as well: "%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.0\Windows Communication Foundation\ServiceModelReg.exe" /r Then when I attempt to view the service metadata via the IIS service I get this (text from a Fiddler session); GET http://localhost/WCFService2/Service.svc HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Connection: keep-alive Accept: application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/8.0.552.224 Safari/534.10 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8 Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5 X-Powered-By: ASP.NET Date: Wed, 12 Jan 2011 19:04:43 GMT Content-Length: 0 I was getting a HTTP Error 500 but I changed the permissions on all the files in the folder to "EveryOne" and "full" - just to remove any security issues. Its after this action that the error 500 stopped but the empty content started. I am using Windows 7 64 bit, VS2010 and have v2.0, v3.0, v3.5 and v.4.0.30319 frameworks installed. I hoped that it would work as simple as this screencast , silly me. Any suggestions?
