I think the reason querystring parameters do not override the defaults is to stop people hacking the url. Someone could use a url whose querystring included controller, action or other defaults you didn't want them to change. I've dealt with this problem by doing what @Dale-Ragan suggested and dealing with it in the action method. Works for me.
