Distance for Clusterization: Similarity Measure via Covariance Structure

I work with time series - vectors of length of $10^6$ real numbers. I have a lot of these vectors and use some algorithms that have $O(n^2)$ time complexity (n - number of samples), so if I will try to analyse, i.e., thousand of time series at once, I will wait for ages. I decided to perform a similarity-based clustering, divide the dataset into groups and perform the analysis independently within each group. What I know about the data: we can consider $x$ time series as generated with covariance matrix $\Sigma_x$, $y$ time series with covariance matrix $\Sigma_y$ and so on. I do not know the number of different classes. Question: how to do clustering? The simplest solution is to use correlations between time series as a distance measure, however, it is really rough and sensitive to outliers. Can PCA help in this case (PCA + k-means on several first components)?
