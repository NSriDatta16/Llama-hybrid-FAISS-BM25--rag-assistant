Parsing XML API data to Rails app

I've been trying to Google and find some guides or heads-up on how to do this, but to no avail. I don't quite know if the title is right even. I don't know the term whether it's meta programming, or just parsing XML data to Rails. Let's say I have this third-party who has agreed to provide XML API to feed data to my website. I would like to receive the data and store it in my model. I checked through SO and found this link which partly answers my question: Parse then Store XML Data from API in Ruby on Rails , but I would like to know the exact way to apply on my third-party's method.
