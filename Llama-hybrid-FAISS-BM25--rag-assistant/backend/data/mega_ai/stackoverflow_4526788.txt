You have two open source projects ( e.g. Papyrus and Topcased ) and two commercial tools (Omondo EclipseUML and RSA IBM). btw, UML is really very few uses today. It seems to me that the GMF project on which Eclipse modeling tools are based is stopped since Eclipse 3.5. A difficult upgrade to 3.6 was made but I doubt that 3.7 will ever be done. I therefore consider that Eclipse 3.6 is the last UML version for Eclipse and no other smart UML tool will be developped on the latest Eclipse indigo 3.7 and further builds.
