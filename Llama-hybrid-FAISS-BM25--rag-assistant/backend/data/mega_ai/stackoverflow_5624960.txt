Reading a text file dynamically on user selection in Android

I am building an android application that reads text files. Now,i have multiple text files in the sdcard . Location of files is /sdcard/textfile/ filenames: abc.txt def.txt ghi.txt i want that when users select any one of the file,the selected file should be read. i know the code to read a single file i.e File sdcard = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); File file = new File(sdcard,pathtofile); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)); pathtofile stores the path to file abc.txt that is defined . Is there any way i can pass the filepath to file object for the file that user selected currently,it works for abc.txt as i have defined its path in pathtofile
