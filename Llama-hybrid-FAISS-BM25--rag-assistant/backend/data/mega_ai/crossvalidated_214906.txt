I'd be inclined to fit either a dummy-seasonal or a trigonometric-seasonal set of predictors in a logistic regression model. In the case of dummy-seasonal for example you might fit an effect for each month. If you think seasonality will be smooth across a year you might prefer the low-order terms in a trigonometric parameterization. If you expect serial dependence you might need to consider form of time series model (but you have varying gaps between points, so it would not be the usual discrete-time form)
