You could look at statistical anomalies. For example, keep a running average of the percentage of failed logins for each hour over the last day. If that percentage suddenly becomes, say, three times as large, you may be looking at a password breaking attempt. There's no way to tell up front what the right parameters for such an algorithm would be. I'd say you start by making them overly sensitive, then tune them down until the number of false positives becomes acceptable.
