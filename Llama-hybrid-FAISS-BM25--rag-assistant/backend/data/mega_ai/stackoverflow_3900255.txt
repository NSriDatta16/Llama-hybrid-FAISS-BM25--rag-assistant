I think storing it there is acceptable (or jQuery.fn.myPlugin.data for that matter)...or instead use your own ID in $.cache which is for storage but uses integer IDs for jQuery events and data, so you won't have any conflict, for example: $.cache["myPlugin"] = myData; //and to get: var dataToUse = $.cache["myPlugin"]; The main reason I'd take this route is it eliminates the potential jQuery.something naming conflicts that could arise with future versions.
