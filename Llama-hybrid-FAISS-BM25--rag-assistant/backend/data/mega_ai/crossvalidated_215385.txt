If $_nm_x$ is the death rate at age group $x$ to $x+n$ and $_nP_x$ is the population in the same age group,the total deaths will be $\sum{_nm_x}\times{_nP_x}$,the sum is over all age groups. Then $CDR$ is $m=\frac{\sum{_nm_x}\times{_nP_x}}{\sum{_nP_x}}$ Clearly,if the values $_nP_x$ are increased for older ages at the expense of the younger ages then not withstanding the constancy of the age rates of mortality,the $CDR$ will rise.The weights used in such an average are therefore important. Consider the CDR's for two communities $A$ and $B$, $m^a=\frac{\sum{_nm_x^{a}}\times{_nP_x^{a}}}{\sum{_nP_x^{a}}}$ and $m^b=\frac{\sum{_nm_x^{b}}\times{_nP_x^{b}}}{\sum{_nP_x^{b}}}$ Even when two communities have same mortality situations at different age groups,then $m^a$ and $m^b$ may be unequal simply beacuse the proportions $\frac{_nm_x^{a}}{_nP_x^{a}}$ and $\frac{_nm_x^{b}}{_nP_x^{b}}$ may not be the same beacuse the age distributions of the two communities may not be identical.Hence,$CDR$ can not be used to compare mortality situations in different places unless the populations of the places have identical age/sex distributions,a condition which is seldom fulfilled.
