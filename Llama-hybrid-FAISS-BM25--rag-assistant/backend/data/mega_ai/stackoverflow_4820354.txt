Having a varchar(max) field in your "primary" table is a bad idea, especially if you already have it somewhat normalized. This will also lead to page splits, fragmentation, and really poor performance on your main table. When someone adds a note, if the field is not in that notes table, it may fill up the data page and cause it to split to another page, which is fragmentation, which is BAD .
