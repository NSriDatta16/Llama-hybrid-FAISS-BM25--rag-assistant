No PDT can't do that. Generally expandable code sections are identified by function and class method bodies. If you think you need artificial sections identified by comments I recommend to rather think about reorganizing your code into more fine grained files, function, classes and methods that can be easily documented using PhpDoc (which is the standard PDT uses).
