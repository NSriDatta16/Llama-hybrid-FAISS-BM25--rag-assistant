It's true that time series models and signal processing filters are not exactly the same things. However, the same form of equation relates the noise process to the current value of a time series in an MA model as relates the input to the output of an FIR filter. That is, time_series_or_filter_output(n) = b0 * noise_process_or_filter_input(n) + b1 * noise_process_or_filter_input(n-1) + ... + b_q * noise_process_or_flter_input(n-q) This means that the impact of a previous value of the noise_process_or_filter_input can be felt on the current value of the time_series_or_filter_output only over finite number of time steps. To see this, consider the following MA/FIR equation: series_or_output(n) = b0 * noise_or_input(n) + b1 * noise_or_input(n-1) Then series_or_output(n+1) = b0 * noise_or_input(n+1) + b1 * noise_or_input(n) series_or_output(n+2) = b0 * noise_or_input(n+2) + b1 * noise_or_input(n+1) So by time n+2, the noise_or_input at time n no longer has an impact on the current value of the series_or_output. Furthermore, the same form of equation relates the past value to the current value of a time series in an AR model as relates the input to the output of an IIR filter. That is, time_series_or_filter_output(n) = a1 * time_series_or_filter_output(n-1) + a2 * time_series_or_filter_output(n-2) + ... + a_p * time_series_or_filter_output(n-p) This means that the impact of a previous value of the time_series_or_filter_output can be felt on the current value of the time_series_or_filter_output over infinite number of time steps. To see this, consider the following AR/IIR equation: series_or_output(n) = a1 * series_or_output(n-1) Then, series_or_ouput(n+1) = a1 * series_or_output(n) = a1 * (a1 * series_or_output(n-1)) series_or_ouput(n+2) = a1 * series_or_output(n+1) = a1 * (a1 * a1 * series_or_output(n-1)) â€¦ So there will never be a time when the series_or_output at time n-1 no longer has an impact on the current value of the series_or_output.
