Is there a better way to have dynamic text appear next to a combobox?

I have a combobox, and based on the current selection, I would like dynamic text to appear beside the combobox. My current solution works, but seems kludgy and fragile. It may not work at all depending on where the combobox appears in the DOM. Here is the crux of my current solution (called when dropdown changes): var child = owner.el.first().next().first().first().first().next().first(); if (child.dom.childNodes.length == 3) { child.createChild({ tag: 'span', html: c + Ext.id() }); } else { child.last().replaceWith({ tag: 'span', html: c + Ext.id() }); } I'm mostly concerned about the first line...this can't be a good way of finding an insertion point. Here is a pic of the combo box with the dynamic text appearing beside: And here is what I looked at to find where I wanted to insert the text: Can someone suggest a better way of achieving this effect? Thanks.
