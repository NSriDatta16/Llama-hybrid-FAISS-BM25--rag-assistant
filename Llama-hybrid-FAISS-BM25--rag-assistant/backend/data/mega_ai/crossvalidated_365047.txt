Indeed you need to account for the correlation in the repeated measurements of each subject. Options are to use a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) approach, Alternating Logistic Regression (ALR) and a mixed effects logistic regression (GLMM). The GEE and ALR provide you with coefficients with a marginal/population interpretation, whereas the GLMM approach with coefficients that have an interpretation conditional on the subject. Most often you want the coefficients with marginal interpretation. If you fit a GLMM, you can also get marginal coefficients in second step by applying a transformation. If you have missing data (i.e., some persons do not responding in the second trial), the GLMM approach would be preferable, because it will provide you correct results under the missing at random assumption (whereas GEE and ALR under the missing completely at random assumption).
