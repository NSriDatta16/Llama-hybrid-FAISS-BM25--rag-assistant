Personally I dislike the method suggested (though @Michael Chernick did a good job of describing why it gives an approximation). In my mind this requires to many assumptions and approximations. In a logistic regression the variance varies with the mean, but in a gaussian regression the variance is assumed constant. Instead I would suggest using simulations, then you can use the exact same methods that will be used in the analysis and you know exactly what assumptions you are making about the data (including predictor variables). Basically you simulate data under the conditions you expect to see, then analyze it and see if you get significance for the primary test of interest. Repeat this a bunch of times and the proportion of times that the null is rejected is your power. I think this would be easiest in R, but could be done in SAS using macros to do the multiple replications, the data step to generate the data, and proc glm to analyze. Or it may be easier to use proc IML for parts. There may be other tools in SAS to make this even easier, I just don't use SAS that much recently.
