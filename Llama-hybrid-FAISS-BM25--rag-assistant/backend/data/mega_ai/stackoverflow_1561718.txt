Quoting from this link I've come across this myself. If you are able to change the spaces to %20s then IE7 will convert them correctly. Firefox though will take them literally ( at least when using the Content-disposition header) so you will need to do this for requests from IE7 only. We did the following in our app. ( a tomcat based document repository) String userAgent = request.getHeader("User-Agent"); if (userAgent.contains("MSIE 7.0")) { filename = filename.replace(" ", "%20"); } response.addHeader("Content-disposition", "attachment;filename=\"" + filename + "\"");
