How can I increase the number of iterations per epoch in MATLAB?

I am training a deep learning network using MATLAB and would like to increase the number of iterations per epoch. Using trainingOptions options = trainingOptions('sgdm', ... 'Momentum',0.9,... 'MaxEpochs',100, ... 'ValidationData',{XValidation,YValidation}, ... 'MiniBatchSize', 64,... 'Verbose',false, ... 'Plots','training-progress'); I get the following, where the number of iterations per epoch is set automatically to 1. Therefore 1 pass of 64 training examples is needed for one epoch. How can I increase this to, for example 10 iterations per epoch? According the the docs: An iteration corresponds to a mini-batch. As I understand, the number of iterations is the number of passes, each pass using 64 ( batch size ) number of examples. So in the above, I have 1 pass of 64 training examples for 100 epochs . Does this mean the iterations per epoch are set automatically according to how many training examples there are present? Can I alter this parameter?
