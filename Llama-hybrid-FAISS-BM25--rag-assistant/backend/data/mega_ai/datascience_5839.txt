The Apache™ Hadoop™ project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing. " Hadoop " typically refers to the software in the project that implements the map-reduce data analysis framework, plus the distributed file system (HDFS) that underlies it. Since version 0.23, Hadoop disposes of a standalone resource manager : yarn . This resource manager makes it easier to use other modules alongside with the MapReduce engine, such as : Ambari , A web-based tool for provisioning, managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters which includes support for Hadoop HDFS, Hadoop MapReduce, Hive, HCatalog, HBase, ZooKeeper, Oozie, Pig and Sqoop. Ambari also provides a dashboard for viewing cluster health such as heatmaps and ability to view MapReduce, Pig and Hive applications visually along with features to diagnose their performance characteristics in a user-friendly manner. Avro , a data serialization system based on JSON schemas. Cassandra , a replicated, fault-tolerant, decentralized and scalable database system. Chukwa : A data collection system for managing large distributed systems. HBase , A scalable, distributed database that supports structured data storage for large tables. Hive , A data warehouse infrastructure that provides data summarization and ad hoc querying. Mahout , a library of machine learning algorithms compatible with M/R paradigm. Pig , a platform/programming language for authoring parallelizable jobs Storm , a system for real-time and stream processing ZooKeeper , a system for coordinating distributed nodes, similar to Google's Chubby Oozie , a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs. Spark , a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. Flink , a fast and reliable large-scale data processing engine. Recommended reference sources: Hive Language Reference Commercial support is available from a variety of companies .
