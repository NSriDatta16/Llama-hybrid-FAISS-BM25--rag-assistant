Specifying Required / Optional Claim Types in the Relying Party for a Passive STS

I have an asp.net application (relying party) that uses a passive STS for authentication and retrieval of claim values. The relying party is using the FederatedAuthenticationModule (FAM) to enable a passive redirect to the sts. I found documentation on how to specify required claims when using InformationCards, but have yet to find detailed information on how to configure this using a FAM. Does anyone have any examples of this? The closest example I could find is in the Geneva Framework samples, but they deal with active STS and WCF, which does not apply. Thanks in advance.
