probably a bit late, but still. In sklearn, Pipeline/ColumnTransformer (and other) have usually function get_feature_names_out() returning feature names after transformation (so matching the shape of transformed data) and shap.Explainer takes feature_names as argument, so in your case: explainer = shap.Explainer(pipe["classifier"], feature_names=processor.get_feature_names_out())
