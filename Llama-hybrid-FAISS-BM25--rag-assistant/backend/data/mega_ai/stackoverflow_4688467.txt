Class vs Object hierarchies

How do you explain class hierarchies. I think my google power has gone down because when i searched for 'Class hierarchies' as the term i got a few examples of how classes are organized and the inheritance relationship between them. Is that all about class hierarchies? How do you explan class hierarchy to a C developer? Also whats the difference between class hierarchy and object hierarchy? Actually i am due a presentation on Saturday to my office mates and coming across so many theoretical topics :( Any help would be appreciated. Many thanks
