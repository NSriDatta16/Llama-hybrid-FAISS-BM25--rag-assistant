No way, you either have some of the non-class data already and set them into a 6th class and train the model with the 6th class. Or you set some thresholds for scoring the likeliness that a sample falls into each class evaluated by something like hidden markov model, but the accuracy would be worse than machine learning models. And as you don't even have non-class data now, you can't really have a fair classifier that can distinguish the true non-class data.
