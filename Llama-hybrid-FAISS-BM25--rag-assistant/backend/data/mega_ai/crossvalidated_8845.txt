What does $d$ mean in this notation of the "usual noninformative prior of $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$?"

Samiuddin, (1976) states: or, typset with $\LaTeX$ as originally posted We start with the usual noninformative prior distribution of $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i (i = 1,2,\ldots, k)$ $$\pi(\mu_1, \mu_2, \ldots, \mu_k; \sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_k) \propto d\mu_1d\mu_2\ldots d\mu_k \frac{d\sigma_1d\sigma_2\ldots d\sigma_k} {\sigma_1\sigma_2\ldots \sigma_k}$$ What does this notation mean?
