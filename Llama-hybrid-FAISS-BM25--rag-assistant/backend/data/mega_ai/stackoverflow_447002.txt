In Flex, how do I know when the properties of a dynamic object change?

I have a dynamic class that serves as a storage container for configuration settings. The settings are variables of that class and it has methods to read from and write to a configuration file, database etc. Now I want to trigger writing to the persistant storage whenever a class variable is changed. As the variables are added dynamically at runtime, I can't use get/set methods, also, if I could, that would lead to a lot of boilerplate code. How can I have an event triggered for changing properties of my class?
