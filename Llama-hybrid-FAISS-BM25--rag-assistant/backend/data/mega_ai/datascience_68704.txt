How do I build a model to predict which service a customer will use on an app?

There's an app with over 50 services. I have the data on the type of service a specific customer (they have a unique customer number) does on the app, the date, location, time, duration on a service and the volume of that service. I want to build a ML model to personalize the services the customer gets daily when they open the app. i.e. Top 6 services they're likely to use for that day Which machine learning technique would be optimal to achieving this?
