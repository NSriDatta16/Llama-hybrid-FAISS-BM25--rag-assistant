I'll put this as an answer as it probably won't fit into a comment. Please be warned that I don't know anything about the fish or biology :) so I don't have any subject knowledge. But I'll try to give my 2 cents. So, first of all, there is a clear effect of inst_diff_1 on success across all fish on average. This, as we already discussed, is represented in the OR format as OR = 1.40. That is probably your main result. Regarding individual differences in this relationship, your output says that the individual-fish-related variance in the the inst_diff_1 --> success relationship is 0.03. Now it's hard to interpret this number without subject knowledge, I'd say it's small but not non-existent. However, you can formally test whether the fish-related differences in this relationship are statistically significant by running 2 models, one forcing all fishes' regression coefficients to equality (i.e., removing the random slope), and then your current model, and run a model comparison ANOVA to check whether having the random slope improves the model, like this: mylogit_s If the anova test is significant, there are significant fish-related differences in inst_diff_1 -> success relationship. Maybe, if you have measured other fish-related variables, they might explain this variance and you could add them as predictors of success? If not, you can anyways report that you found significant fish-related differences in the relationship (...but probably quite small ones). If the anova is not significant, then there are no statistically significant fish-related differences in the relationship. (The following may be irrelevant, but just for completeness:) The ICC refers to the relative amount of variance in the level of success_1 attributable to fish identity, so basically the average level of success of each individual fish, but (here I'm a little unsure) it is my understanding that ICC is interpretable only if you run an unconditional model with no random slope and no predictors apart from the fish identity. So you can check this with mylogit_unconditional
