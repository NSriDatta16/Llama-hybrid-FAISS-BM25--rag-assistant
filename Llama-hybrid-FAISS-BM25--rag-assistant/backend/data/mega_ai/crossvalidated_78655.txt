Genetic algorithms and neural networks are not really competing methods. For instance one could use a genetic algorithm to train a neural network (a field called neuroEvolution). Genetic algorithms are used to optimise 'thing' and neural networks are 'something' to be optimised. i.e. one could optimise a neural network using backpropagation, some form of hebbian learning or a genetic algorithm. 1) If you are going to use a genetic algorithm to optimise the weights of a polynomial function then as @alto suggests there are likely better methods. As for neural networks, they can be universal approximators, so in theory you could achieve a very good approximation. 2) I couldn't find and results on typical training times. Firstly people do not often quote the training time in 'wall time'. The backpropagation world are more concerned with the final result and the genetic algorithms world compare methods using the number of evaluations to find a suitable solution. So a comparison between the two can't be made.
