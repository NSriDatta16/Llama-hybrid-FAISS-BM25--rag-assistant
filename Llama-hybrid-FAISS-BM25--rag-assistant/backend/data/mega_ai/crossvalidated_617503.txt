Why am I missing the result of a smoothing effect in a GAMM while interpreting results from summary command

I have been using GAMMs to analyze time series data and I have included a smoothing term (hour of day by season) and I can't seem to find the results for the winter season. I have the proper information (edf, Ref.df, F, and p-value) for all my smoothed terms and each season except for winter. I am using the summary function and calling on the gam results within the model (instead of the lme summary output).
