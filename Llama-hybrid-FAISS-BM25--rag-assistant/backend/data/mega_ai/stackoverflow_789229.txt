If you're using .NET, whatever mechanism you end up using, make sure that you pay attention to .NET code access security. Read MSDN documentation to see if the class, method(s) you're using requires full-trust or not. This may be an issue if your app is supposed to run in partial trust or less privileged trust environment.
