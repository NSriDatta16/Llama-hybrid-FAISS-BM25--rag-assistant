According to Jennings and Wooldridge who are 2 of the top Mulit-agent researchers an agent is an object that is reactive to its environment, proactive and social. That is an agent is a piece of software that can react to its environment in real time in a way that is suitable to its own objeective. It is proactive, which means that it doesnt just always wait to be asked to perform a task, if it sees a chance to do something that it feels would be beneficial to its objectives it does it. And that it is social, ie that it can communicate with other Agents, doesnt nessecaily ever have to do any of these things in meeting its own objectives but it should be able to to do these if the situation arose. And thus a multi-agent system is just a collection of these in a distrubuted system that can all communicate and try to perform their own personal goals hat normally lead to an overall achievement of the system goal.
