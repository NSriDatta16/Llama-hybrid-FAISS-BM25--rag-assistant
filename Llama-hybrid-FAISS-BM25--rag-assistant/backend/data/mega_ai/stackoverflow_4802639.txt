My personal opinion is that the Panorama (and Pivot ) control should not be used to display dynamic items in one item based on a selection in another item. Take a look at this channel 9 video where Chad Roberts and Amy Alberts discuss these two key controls. My suggestion would be to navigate to another page on category selection and to load the feeds under that category in the target page. Shawn Wildermuth has a blog post on page navigation if you need any help in that respect.
