I'm not super familiar with the CMS module, but I can tell you how to get the XML tag/handle (cms_index_index) for any page in your system. Download and install the LayoutViewer Module from this tutorial (reading the tutorial is probably a good idea too) Load your CMS page with the added query string showLayout=handles http://example.com/helloworld/index/index?showLayout=handles You should now see a list of "handles". Handles are used to identify particular requests. For example cms_index_index is the handle that identifies a request for the CMS module's index action on the its index controller. You should see similar handles on your other CMS pages. If this works post a follow up in the comments, I'm curious how the CMS handles are formed and haven't had time to search it out. Update : I've done this on a testbed install of Magento that I have kicking around. I created a simple CMS page available at the following URL http://example.com/index.php/this-is-my-identifier And I got the following handles default cms_page STORE_default THEME_frontend_default_default cms_page_view page_one_column customer_logged_out So, based on this, it looks like Magento doesn't create an individual handle for each CMS page (I'm kind of surprised the cms_index_index you mentioned above works ... which means there's probably something going on I don't quite understand). So, what I'd try to do is define your blocks within a or tag. That should make them available to all your CMS pages.
