How should I get started using PHPUnit as a testing framework for a bunch of functions and classes I have already made?

I've already read the documentation. Basically I've tried tests while following the BankAccount example. But I get errors: Warning: require_once(PHP/CodeCoverage/Filter.php) [function.require-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in [...]/unitTest/phpunit.php on line 38 Also, the PHP scripts seems to start with #!/usr/bin/env php which indicate they should be run from the console. I'd rather run these from the browser... Suppose I have a function f1() that returns a string. How should the tests be made? Am I missing something?
