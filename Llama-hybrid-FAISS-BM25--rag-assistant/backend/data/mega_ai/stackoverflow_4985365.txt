Every HTTP Response must include a Content-Type header. PHP happens to insert one by default. Whatever Python library you are using apparently doesn't. Therefore you need to provide one explicitly. This leaves the question as "Should a fragment of HTML be served as text/html?" The RFC says: The text/html media type is now defined by W3C Recommendations; the latest published version is [HTML401]. In addition, [XHTML1] defines a profile of use of XHTML which is compatible with HTML 4.01 and which may also be labeled as text/html. These specifications do not define HTML fragments, so you should probably use something like: Content-Type: x-text/html-fragment
