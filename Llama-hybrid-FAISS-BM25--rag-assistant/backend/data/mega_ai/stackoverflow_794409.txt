jQuery jqModal Ajax and nested modal problems

I just started using jqModal as I need support for nested modals. I'm noticing some erratic behaviour with nested modals and AJAX, but I don't know exactly how to fix it. What happens is when I load the main modal, that has a nested modal in it, I get two jqmOverlay divs, it's like it's applying the overlay for both modals, even though the nested one hasn't been triggered yet. So when I close the modal, there's still one overlay being displayed. Here's the code: // Main Modal $(function(){ $("#modal").jqm({ajax:'@href'}); }); View Supplier // Nested Modal code fragment within the /suppliers/2/edit html $(function(){ $("#nested_modal").jqm({ajax:'@href', zIndex:3001}); }) Add Bill It seems to work the first time, but if I close the main modal, then open again I get the double overlay problem. Is this a bug? or the way I'm calling my nested modal? Also, I know it has to do with the nested modal, because when I remove the jqm call on the nested modal, the main modal works fine every time.
