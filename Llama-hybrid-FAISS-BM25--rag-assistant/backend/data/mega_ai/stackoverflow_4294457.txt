JQuery consuming ASP.Net Web Service webserver - Request format is unrecognized for URL unexpectedly ending in

Done a lot of Googling on this but cant seem to find an answer. When I call my web service from Jquery I am receiving the error Request format is unrecognized for URL unexpectedly ending in '/AirportSearchGeneric'. Factors I am currently calling a webservice that is on the same machine but on a different webserver (calling app is port 64004 and receiving app is 1400) - possible cross "domain" issue? Both are local host. Both are using the test web server that is part of visual studio. I have tried adding the 2 protocols to the web.config (add name="HttpGet" add name="HttpPost") The error occures in the Event Viewer on the server. I get the following in Firebug... OPTIONS AirportSearchGeneric http://localhost:1400/services/airportservice.asmx/AirportSearchGeneric 500 Internal Server Error localhost:1400 ... not seen OPTIONS before but the request is being accessed with a POST request. JQuery code... $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "http://localhost:1400/services/airportservice.asmx/AirportSearchGeneric", data: "{'criteria':'EGBB', 'maxResults':'10'}", contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", dataType: "json", success: function (msg) { alert(msg.d); } }); Web service code... [WebService(Namespace = "http://localhost/WebServices")] [WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)] [ScriptService] public class AirportService : WebService { [WebMethod] [ScriptMethod(ResponseFormat=ResponseFormat.Json)] public string AirportSearchGeneric(string criteria, int maxResults) { IAirportService svc = new Airports.AirportService.AirportService(); List res = svc.AirportSearchGeneric(criteria, maxResults); DataContractJsonSerializer serializer = new DataContractJsonSerializer(res.GetType()); MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(); serializer.WriteObject(ms, res); string jsonString = Encoding.Default.GetString(ms.ToArray()); ms.Close(); return jsonString; } } ... dont think its a problem in here as when debugging, no code in here gets executed. Pretty sure I have covered off all of the reasons I have read as to why this occurs so would be greatful for any advice on how I can get this working. Cheers. For reference the firebug headers are as follows: Host localhost:1400 User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0E) Accept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language en-gb,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 115 Connection keep-alive Origin http://localhost:64004 Access-Control-Request-Me...
