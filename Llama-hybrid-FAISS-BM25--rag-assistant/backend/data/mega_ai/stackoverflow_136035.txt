Catch multiple exceptions at once?

It is discouraged to simply catch System.Exception . Instead, only the "known" exceptions should be caught. Now, this sometimes leads to unnecessary repetitive code, for example: try { WebId = new Guid(queryString["web"]); } catch (FormatException) { WebId = Guid.Empty; } catch (OverflowException) { WebId = Guid.Empty; } I wonder: Is there a way to catch both exceptions and only call the WebId = Guid.Empty call once? The given example is rather simple, as it's only a GUID . But imagine code where you modify an object multiple times, and if one of the manipulations fails expectedly, you want to "reset" the object . However, if there is an unexpected exception, I still want to throw that higher.
