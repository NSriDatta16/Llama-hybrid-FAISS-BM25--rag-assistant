Class based impersonation

Is it possible for a class to impersonate its identity? For example, Class A attempts to access Class B methods. Class B methods uses getClass().getName() to attempt to check Class A to ensure it is who it is. Can impersonation take place ? e.g. Class C impersonates Class A to get pass the getclass().getName() Class B uses for checks? If Class B wants to implement getClass().getName() for checks effective on the sample method below, how do I implement it properly in the sample code below ? public byte[] getStoragePrivateKey(String application) { if (application.getClass().getName().equals("correctClass") { // Allow access to Private Key. } else { // Access denied } } The above example is a simulation of a plugin applet in the system trying to access an internal key server database in the system.
