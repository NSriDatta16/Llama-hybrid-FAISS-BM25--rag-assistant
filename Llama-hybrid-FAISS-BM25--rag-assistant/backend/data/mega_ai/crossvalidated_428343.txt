Moments of an AR(1) Process

Definition of an AR(1) process In an Autoregressive Process , a time series can be generated based on a stochastic difference equation. \begin{align} X_t = c + \phi \, X_{t-1} + \epsilon \end{align} Typically, $\epsilon$ is chosen to be normally distributed and $0 . What I already know As described on Wikipedia , as well as on Stack Exchange , one can derive the mean and the variance of the resulting time series if one knows the parameters $c$ and $\phi$ , as well as the distribution of $\epsilon$ . \begin{align} Mean(X_t) & = Mean(c + \phi \, X_{t-1} + \epsilon) \\ & = Mean(c) + Mean(\phi \, X_{t-1}) + Mean(\epsilon) \\ & = c + \phi \, Mean(X_{t-1}) + 0 \\ \end{align} Assuming that $Mean(X_{t}) = Mean(X_{t-1})$ , it follows that: \begin{align} Mean(X_t) = \frac{c}{1 - \phi} \end{align} Similarly for the variance : \begin{align} Var(X_t) & = Var(c + \phi \, X_{t-1} + \epsilon) \\ & = Var(c) + Var(\phi \, X_{t-1}) + Var(\epsilon) \\ & = 0 + \phi^2 \, Var(X_{t-1}) + \sigma_{\epsilon}^2 \\ \end{align} Assuming that $Var(X_{t}) = Var(X_{t-1})$ , it follows that: \begin{align} Var(X_t) = \frac{\sigma_{\epsilon}^2}{1 - \phi^2} \end{align} My question How can this be generalised to higher order moments , central moments and/or cumulants ? Following this post, is it correct to assume that: \begin{align} \mu_k(X_t) = \frac{\mu_k(\epsilon)}{1 - \phi^k} \end{align} On Wikipedia , it is noted that: ...the central limit theorem indicates that $X_t$ will be approximately normally distributed when $\phi$ is close to one. Which makes me doubt whether the above generalisation is correct. Secondly, $\mu_k$ refers to cumulants . Is there a similar expression for moments and/or central moments ? Context I would like to end up with an AR(1) process which generates data with a particular non-normal distribution. I want to be able to specify the desired mean , standard deviation and skewness and subsequently work back what distribution I need for $\epsilon$ to give me the expected result.
