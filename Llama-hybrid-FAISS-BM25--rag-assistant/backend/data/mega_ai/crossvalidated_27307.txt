Without bothering to check P(A), you should know that books like this (to include books on pure math, programming, and statistics, as well as probability) always have typos. That's not a remark intended to disparage the authors or editors, etc. It simply isn't possible to have a book like this without something getting by. There is no question that there is more than one way to roll 2 fair dice and get a 10. I would guess that the real typo was to calculate the probability of getting a 12 rather than a 10, but as stated, you're right here. One other thing, they presumably also meant p(A or B).
