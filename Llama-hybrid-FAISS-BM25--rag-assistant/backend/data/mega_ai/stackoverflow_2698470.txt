Here's the start of something perhaps. It is just in javascript, but you could easily bring it over to jQuery. PLEASE NOTE: The onmousedown and onmouseup would normally be on the image instead of the document, but since I don't have any kind of handle, you just end up dragging the image itself (in Safari anyway). So the way it is right now, you need to click OUTSIDE the image in order to resize it. img { width: 400px; height: auto; position: relative; } var positionX; var startWidth; var image = document.getElementById('image'); document.onmousedown = function(e) { if(!e) e = window.event; positionX = (e.clientX); startWidth = image.width; document.onmousemove = function(e) { if(!e) e = window.event; image.style.width = (startWidth + (e.clientX - positionX)) + 'px'; } } document.onmouseup = function() { document.onmousemove = null; positionX = null; startWidth = null; }
