This answer would likely be better as a comment but I do not have the reputation. You say, in fact #2 has a noticeable increasing trend (therefore suggested non-stationary) however a time series can have a trend and be stationary (trend-stationary) around that trend. There are three versions of the Dickey-Fuller test , one of which is a test of unit root in the presence of a deterministic trend. Broadly speaking, 12 data points is likely not sufficient for a reliable ADF test. If you think about what is happening in the Dickey-Fuller test, we are testing for a significant relationship between the value of $$y(t-1)$$ and the change $$ \Delta y(t) = y(t) - y(t-1) .$$ In the ADF test, we also incorporate lagged values of the process $$\Delta y(t) $$ which means that we are using very few data points to test for a unit root. With regards to the specific series #2, I agree it does appear trend-stationary by sight.
