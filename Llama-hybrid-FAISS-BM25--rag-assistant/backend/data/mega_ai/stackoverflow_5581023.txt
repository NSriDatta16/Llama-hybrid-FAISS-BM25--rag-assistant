R: Graphing binned data

I am sorting data into bins and averaging, see this solution . I am using the exact same solution as in the above link but fixing my data to a scatter plot instead. The code which is causing me difficulty is : myData.class The call to lines is producing an error : Error in model.frame.default(formula = mean.yaxis ~ seq(0, 30, length = 60), : variable lengths differ (found for 'seq(0, 30, length = 60)') A call to str(mean.yaxis) produces : num [1:59(1d)] 0 0 0 0.349 4.652 ... - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 1 ..$ : chr [1:59] "[0,0.508]" "(0.508,1.02]" "(1.02,1.53]" "(1.53,2.03]" ... How can I access to correct data in my call to the function lines(...) ?
