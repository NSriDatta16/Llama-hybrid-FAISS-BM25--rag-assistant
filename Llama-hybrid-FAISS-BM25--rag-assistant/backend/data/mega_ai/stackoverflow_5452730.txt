Mysql Scaling for small app

I can not buy more hardware. I have 2gig ram for mysql. Now my widget is being displayed on 57 websites with 3000 views on average. My widget requires 200 insert per view for the best user optimization of the content. which means on average there are almost 400 inserts per second. Now what do you suggest I do to speed up the inserts. The data inserted is divided in the three tables with two of them getting 80 each and the last one getting 40 inserts. I am using MYISAM, I dont like INNODB because I have never used it, nor I am cormfortable using it right now, but a good reason may persuade me to. The problem is that at peak times there are around 1200 inserts per second, which is a real bottleneck. Mainly the queries are updates to increase the impressions. So update impressions = impressions + 1 where widget=widget_id Any suggestions to speed up the database queries would be fantastic. Also can there be a cache for the inserts, for example running inserts in batch. Something like that. Timely inserts, bulk inserts, etc. BTW, I would really appreciate if this could be explained in details, since I am a complete noob. Thanks Guys
