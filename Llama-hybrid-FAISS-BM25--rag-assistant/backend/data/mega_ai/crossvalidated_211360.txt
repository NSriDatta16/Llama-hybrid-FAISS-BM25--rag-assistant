I could not find this variant after quite a bit of Googling, Binging, Duckduckgoing... whoever uses it probably keeps it to themselves. I found this paper on Time series forecasting using a weighted cross-validation evolutionary artificial neural network ensemble by Donate et al. (Neurocomputing, 2013) where as an alternative to softmax weighting they use rank-based weight in the same way as in the $\sigma^\prime$ where they set $\alpha = e$; (2.7182...) but that's about it. I suspect you know of the hierarchical softmax function as a variant of the softmax (or normalized exponential ) but this is not related to ranks. A distant relation I can see is with the softrank function by Taylor et al. , which is the normalized discounted cumulative gain (see here for an application in a GP setting).
