logistic regression with non boolean variables

I have trouble wrapping my head around the concept of logistic regression and its interpretation for non-Boolean variables. An example from our course material goes as follows: Calculating a generalized linear model in R for the formula liked(boolean)~ highCalories(boolean) , the coefficients look like this Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.47367 0.04369 -10.841 With the intercept being -0.47, the chance of liked being 1 with highCalories being 0 is logit(-0.47) -> 38.4% If highCalories is 1, the chance of liked being also 1 is logit(-0.47367-0.71497) -> 23.4% So in the case of the examined variable being Boolean it's clear to me. Let's look at an example with non-Boolean variables: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -3.806e+00 2.801e-01 -13.589 this is for MailIsRefound(boolean)~dayofstudy(numeric) Because dayofstudy is not Boolean, the logit for the intercept doesn't seem that meaningful, but for day we get logit(-3.806e+00 -1.934e-03) -> 2.1% How is this value to be interpreted?
