Proving estimated accuracy of exclusively combining two classification models

I have two classification models; $\text{model}_1$ and $\text{model}_2$. $\text{model}_1$ averages $80\%$ accuracy (on a hold-out dev set) and $\text{model}_2$ averages $50\%$ accuracy (on a hold-out dev set). Given an unseen sample, I will random use either $\text{model}_1$ with $\alpha$ probability or $\text{model}_2$ with $(1-\alpha)$ probability. It seems natural that my expected accuracy of exclusively choosing either $\text{model}_1$ or $\text{model}_2$ would be $\alpha\times80\% + (1-\alpha)\times50\%$ But how do I prove such?
