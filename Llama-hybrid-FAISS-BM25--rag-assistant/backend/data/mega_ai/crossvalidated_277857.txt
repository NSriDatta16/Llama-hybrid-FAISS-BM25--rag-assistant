Create a discrete variable from continuous one

Have any sense, in order to solve a classification problem (only 2 possibles target classes) to create a new discrete column from a continuous one? For example, I have one column that is Age, that has integer numbers. I have created Age_Over variable with 2 possible values 1 or 0. Is it useful for use it in a machine learning problem maybe with certain models or just a a bad idea? Let me explain more. I have data from workers of a company. I'm trying to solve a classification problem to predict the employee attrition. For example I'm tempted to do this with one variable called YearsAtCompany. I have calculated the median of this column and created a new column with 1 if the value is grater than the median and a 0 otherwise. I have noticed that the rate of attrition in the employees with less years at company than the median is significantly greater than employees with more years than the median. What do you think?
