I managed it by putting the web method (in your case, GetCompletionListOggetti) in the code behind file of the content page instead of master page. And it works only for web method in the same code behind file not in a separate asmx service. For this, don't forget to add EnablePageMethods="true" property to your script manager too. It seems like AutoCompleteExtender's service method is never called when it's defined inside a user(or custom) control's code behind file and a master page is a kind of control indeed. The downside of this fix is that you have to put the same service method in EVERY contents page which uses this master page. Not very elegant. Another downside is somehow the css of suggestion dropdownlist is not working properly. Still I couldn't figure out the walkaround. Anybody better idea?
