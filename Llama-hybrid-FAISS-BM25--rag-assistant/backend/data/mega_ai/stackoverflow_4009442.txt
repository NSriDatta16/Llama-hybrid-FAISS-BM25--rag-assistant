It's the exact opposite, this code was optimized by not using List<> or similar collection object. Everything that List does is inlined here. The added advantage is that the locking is cheap (TrySetSlot uses Interlocked.CompareExchange) and saving the cost of dragging around a locking object. Explicitly inlining code like this rather than leaving it up to the JIT compiler isn't that common in the .NET framework. But exceptions are made for low-level primitives like this.
