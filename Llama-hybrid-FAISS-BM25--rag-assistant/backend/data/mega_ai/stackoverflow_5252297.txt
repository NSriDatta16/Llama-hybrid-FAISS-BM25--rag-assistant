HTML: IE9 standards mode print TFOOT on every page

Tables in HTML can have " footers ": Your header goes here Your footer goes here Page body in here -- as long as it needs to be Normally, legacy Internet Explorer would only display the TFOOT at the bottom of the entire table. But there was a style that can be applied to TFOOT (and THEAD ) to make it print at the bottom of each page spanned by the table. From MSDN : table-footer-group Object is rendered as tFoot . Table footer is always displayed after all other rows and row groups, and before any bottom captions. The footer is displayed on each page spanned by a table. Adding table-footer-group as a style to TFOOT causes it (in Internet Explorer) to print at the bottom of each page spanned by the table: tfoot { display: table-footer-group; } But if IE9 ( release candidate ) is placed into standards mode: then the TFOOT is no longer rendered at the bottom of every page spanning the table, but only at the end of the entire table. i checked the HTML spec to see what the proper behavior is, and it's undefined!: table-footer-group (In HTML: TFOOT) Like 'table-row-group', but for visual formatting, the row group is always displayed after all other rows and row groups and before any bottom captions. Print user agents may repeat footer rows on each page spanned by a table. If a table contains multiple elements with 'display: table-footer-group', only the first is rendered as a footer; the others are treated as if they had 'display: table-row-group'. Note: Emphasis added for effect. Is there a way in IE9 standards mode for me to choose to print a TFOOT at the bottom of each page spanned by a table? Update One It is interesting to note that table-footer-group is a typical default value for TFOOT elements, but in previous versions of IE you could choose which behavior you wanted: bottom of entire table bottom of entire table and every intermediate page by choosing to include the style. Update Two As it is now i am forcing Internet Explorer to remain in IE8 standards mode with: See also Is there a way to get a web page header/footer printed on every page?
