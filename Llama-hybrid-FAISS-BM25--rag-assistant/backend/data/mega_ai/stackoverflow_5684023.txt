Your problem is that, if the file exists, you don't return anything. I think you're intending to use recursion to check the new filename, but you don't return the result of that call. Here's a stab: def checkExists(fileName, index=0): print "checkExists(" + fileName + ")" if exists(fileName): splitPath = split(newFile) splitName = splitext(splitPath[1]) newSplitName = splitName[0] + "-" + str(index) index += 1 newName = splitPath[0] + "/" + newSplitName + splitName[1] print "newName = " + newName return checkExists(newName, index) # recurse else: print "(else) fileName = " + fileName print "(else) fileName = " + str(type(fileName)) print "" return fileName I also took the liberty of moving the recursive call closer to the generation of newName and removing the global variable and replacing that with recursion as well.
