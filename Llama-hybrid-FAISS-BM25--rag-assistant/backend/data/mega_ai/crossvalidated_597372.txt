It sounds like you actually want 1:1 nearest neighbor matching with an exact matching constraint. That is, set method = "nearest" and include the variables you want to exact match on in the exact argument. The default is 1:1 matching without replacement so that is what you will get. If you want coarsened exact matching, you can coarsen the variables manually and use the method above or use method = "cem" with k2k = TRUE , which coarsens them automatically and returns a matched sample with an equal number of treated and control units. I have explained what the effective sample size (ESS) is here and in the MatchIt documentation. I encourage you to read the documentation; it explains what each matching method does and what arguments are allowed with it.
