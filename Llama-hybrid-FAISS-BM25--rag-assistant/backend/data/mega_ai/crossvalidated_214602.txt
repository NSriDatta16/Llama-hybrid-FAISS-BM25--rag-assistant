Decomposition of SARIMA models

I use R for time series analysis. I would like to evaluate decomposition algorithms. decompose and stl from "stats" package lead to good results but often, the residuals are not meaningless. Example: dec p-value There is still a lot of autocorrelation in the residuals, the same for decompose with type = "multiplicative" and for stl . If possible, I would like to extract all meaningful information from the residuals. Thus, I had a look on classical forecasting techniques: library(forecast) dec p-value = 0.01356 Fitting a SARIMA model leads to less autocorrelation and thus, better "information extraction". For p > 0.05, one could argue for a Gaussian error distribution. Is there a way to decompose the ARIMA fit into slowly varying components and oscillating components like with classical decomposition techniques?
