Bayesian structural time series with few data points (using CausalImpact)

I am experimenting with the CausalImpact package https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html (Brodersen et al. 2015) which uses Bayesian structural time-series models. All of their examples have many time points pre and post intervention. In my data set, I only have 4 measurements before the intervention, and 20 after the intervention. Is this a problem for the validity of the model? I could not find something about how many time points you should have, but for example, the very similar prophet package says you should have many. I can provide several covariates, perhaps that helps.
