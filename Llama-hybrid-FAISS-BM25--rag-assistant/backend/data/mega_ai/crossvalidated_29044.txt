Plotting confidence intervals for the predicted probabilities from a logistic regression

Ok, I have a logistic regression and have used the predict() function to develop a probability curve based on my estimates. ## LOGIT MODEL: library(car) mod1 = glm(factor(won) ~ as.numeric(bid), data=mydat, family=binomial(link="logit")) ## PROBABILITY CURVE: all.x This is great but I'm curious about plotting the confidence intervals for the probabilities. I've tried plot.ci() but had no luck. Can anyone point me to some ways to get this done, preferably with the car package or base R.
