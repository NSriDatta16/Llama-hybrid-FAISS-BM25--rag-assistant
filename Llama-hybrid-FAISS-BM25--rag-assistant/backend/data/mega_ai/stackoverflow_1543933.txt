Script to download CAPTCHA images

For completely non-nefarious purposes - machine learning specifically, I'd like to download a huge dataset of CAPTCHA images. However, CAPTCHA is always implemented using some obfuscated javascript that makes getting at the actual images without a browser a non-trivial task, at least to me, who is a javascript novice. So, can anyone give me some helpful pointers on how to download the image of the obscured word using a script completely outside of a browser? And please don't point me to a dataset of already collected obscured words - I need to collect the images from a specific website for this particular experiment. Thanks! Edit: Another way this question could be asked is very simple. When you click "view source" on website with complicated javascript, you see the script references, but that's all you see. However, if you click "save webpage as..." (in firefox) and then view the source of the saved webpage, the javascript will be resolved and new html and the images (at least in the case of ASIRRA and reCAPTCHA) is in the source. How can I mimic this "save webpage as..." behavior using a script? This is an important web coding question in general, so please stop questioning me on my motives with this! This is knowledge I can use from now on in all web development involving scripting and I'm sure other stack overflow visitors can as well!
