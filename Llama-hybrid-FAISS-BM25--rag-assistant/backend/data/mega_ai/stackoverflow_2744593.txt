If you think your array sizes are not big enough to warrant such an error, maybe your previous operations fragmented available memory. MATLAB requires contiguous blocks so fragmentation can lead to such errors. So before the point in your code where an out of memory error occurs, try running the pack command. That's all I can think of apart from the usual fixes.
