Time series in R

I am tracking my body weight in a spread sheet but I want to improve the experience by using R. I was trying to find some information about time series analysis in R but I was not successful. The data I have here is in the following format: date -> weight -> body-fat-percentage -> water-percentage e.g. 10/08/09 -> 84.30 -> 18.20 -> 55.3 What I want to do plot weight and exponential moving average against time How can I achieve that?
