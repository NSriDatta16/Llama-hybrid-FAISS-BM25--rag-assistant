Dealing with missing month values in dataset and plotting a time series

So i currently have a dataset in R: Date Mean_Value 2003-10-01 7.94 2004-02-01 3.17 2004-03-01 4.62 2004-04-01 5.38 2004-05-01 4.17 2004-06-01 6.40 2004-07-01 4.12 2004-08-01 3.09 2005-01-01 5.32 . . and I'm planning to plot a time series for the above dataset, but one thing I'm concerned with is that is it the right thing to do, to just plot the time series even though there are some months of the year in the dataset above missing? for example, in the year 2003 , the missing months are "November" and "December" while in the year 2004 , the months missing are "September,October,November and December" . The year list goes on until 2012, and there are indeed some years with all months present . Although some years are missing certain months like the example above, would i still be able to plot the time series, ignoring the fact that there exist missing months in some years?
