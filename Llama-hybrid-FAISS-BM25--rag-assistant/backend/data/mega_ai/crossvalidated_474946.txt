Bootstrap the estimated GARCH volatility....for the two stage estimation

GARCH(1,1) model is represented as \begin{aligned} x_t &= \sigma_t z_t, \\ \sigma_t^2 &= \omega+\alpha x_{t-1}^2+\beta\sigma_{t-1}^2, \\ z_t &\sim i.i.d (0,1). \end{aligned} If I want to uses estimated GARCH volatility as an input in some vector autoregressive model (VAR), I should incorporate the uncertainty of the GARCH estimates for the estimation of the VAR model. I could think of two ways of doing it. Alternative 1 Proposed bootstrap procedure is as follows. Estimate the GARCH(1,1) parameter $\theta= \{\hat{\omega},\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}\}$ . Draw $M$ samples of $\theta$ from their estimated distribution and simulate $\sigma^m_t$ using the equation 1, where $m$ is $1\dots M$ . It is important to highlight, that we are not simulating the $x_t$ , rather than we use observed $x_t$ of the stock returns and pass that in the equation 1. Now we have K sample of simulated volatility series for each of the stock, which we use to estimate the VAR model (K times). Is it a legitimate bootstrap method? If not, why? Alternative 2 Bootstrap $K$ paths of the original time series ( $x_t$ ) using block bootstrap. Then, estimate the GARCH volatility for all $K$ time series. Then estimate the VAR model ( $K$ times). My question is, which of these methods is theoretically correct? If both are wrong, what should be the correct way to do so?
