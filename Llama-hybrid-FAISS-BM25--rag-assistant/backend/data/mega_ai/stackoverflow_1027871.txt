Rails: An elegant way to display a message when there are no elements in database

I realized that I'm writing a lot of code similar to this one: You have no messages. Is there any construct in Ruby and/or Rails that would let me skip that first condition? So that would be executed when iterator/loop won't enter even once? For example: You have no messages.
