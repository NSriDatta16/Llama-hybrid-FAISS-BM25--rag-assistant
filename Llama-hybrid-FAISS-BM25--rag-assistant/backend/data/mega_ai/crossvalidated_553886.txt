Your current description could be interpreted a number of different ways. One approach is to model "relative abundance" as count data, e.g. how many deer are spotted on average per square mile. These averages could be compared across different types of deer, e.g. bucks vs does. This could be performed in a glm using a Poisson or negative binomial model. "Relative abundance" might also refer to the proportion of one type of deer to another type, e.g. bucks vs does, in a given region. This could be performed in a glm using a Bernoulli model for the relative proportions. If you add clarity to your question the appropriate glm should also become clear.
