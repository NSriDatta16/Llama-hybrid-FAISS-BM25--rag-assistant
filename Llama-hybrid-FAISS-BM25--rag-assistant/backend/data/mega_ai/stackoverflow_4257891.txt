There are two problems here, as I see it. You did forget the return, again. :-) The WhoAreYou function doesn't actually return anything, it just alerts. Hence secretAgent.WhoAreYou() returns undefined too. The alert shows "My name is undefined, undefined undefined". This is because of the scope of the variables used. You assign the WhoAreYou to person , and within the body you reference this.lastName . The this here refers to the person variable, and as you can see this object does not have a lastName property. There are two ways then that you can fix the latter issue. Firstly, by adding the name variables to the person object: var secretAgent = (function(){ var person = {}; person.firstName = "James"; person.lastName = "Bond"; person.WhoAreYou = function() { alert("My name is " + this.lastName + ", " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName); }; return person; } )(); // Although the first three lines would be more natural as: var person = { firstname: "James", lastName: "Bond" }; Secondly, you can instead choose to drop the this reference, which will instead refer to the local variables you just defined: var secretAgent = (function(){ var person = {}, firstName = "James", lastName = "Bond"; person.WhoAreYou = function() { alert("My name is " + lastName + ", " + firstName + " " + lastName); }; return person; } )(); You'll of course need to add appropriate returns to the WhoAreYou function in both examples.
