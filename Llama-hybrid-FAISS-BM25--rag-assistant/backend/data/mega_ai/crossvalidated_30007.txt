Statistically, this question seems reducible to: how can you compare two distributions to see which one is bigger? You are right to question the naive use of the mean as a blind summary of the distribution. However, there are still very many ways you could approach this. Here are a couple of options: 1) The two-sample Kolgomorov-Smirnov test. You can think of this as a way to plot the two empirical cumulative distributions and then search for the point with the largest maximum vertical deviation between the distributions. This has the advantage of being agnostic about precisely where in the distribution you look for the differences. I actually think this page is better than the Wikipedia page at explaining it, because it has better graphics. 2) A Bayesian comparison between the case that both samples are drawn from the same distribution and the case that both are drawn from different distributions. Here you will likely want to bin the distributions into histograms. This paper discusses and demonstrates a nice way of performing this. It models each histogram as coming from a Poisson distribution, and then infers whether they share the same rate parameter or whether the rate parameters differ. This is captured by a parameter $\pi$, whose probability mass is near one in the case that the histograms are the same, and is near zero in the case that the histograms are different, (The code is available online . You'll need ROOT installed.) This method is likely to give better answers, but will take more time to implement. Whether you should use it or something like it depends on how crucial it is to you to get an extremely accurate answer rather than a good enough one. Q-Q plots This might be a nice way to visualize the differences between the two usage distributions. From what I can tell, Q-Q plots are more often used to compare one empirical distribution to a theoretical one, e.g. to a normal distribution, to justify its use. If you want to do a Q-Q plot with two empirical distributions you will first need to estimate the quantiles . Q-Q plots may be worth investing some time into, but as a descriptive plot (i.e., you can't easily get a summary statistic out of them), you will either have to convert what you learn from them into a form that is easier to interpret, or make sure that whoever you are presenting the data to can interpret them. And they are not that easy to interpret. So, bottom line: yes, they could work, but unless you are already good at them I think it'd be easier to use another option.
