I teach iOS development and if your colleagues want a non-beginner app I have a suggestion. There are lots of services that have public APIs that are usually REST based. Some of them that come to mind are SimpleNote, Dropbox, Evernote, ArcGIS, and even Twitter. Writing an app that accesses one of these APIs in some custom manner for your organization might be a good learning app. These types of apps use a lot of common UI and data libraries. Some of the libs and concepts that could be learned are: table views, saving settings, Core Data, NSURLConnection coding or a 3rd party lib like ASIHTTPRequest, repeating operations with a timer, and UI design in general. Because there would be lots of objects in play getting a handle on memory management would also be required. I'm using this concept in my advanced iOS development course at the college where I teach. If you can write an app with all these pieces, then you can write a lot of useful apps.
