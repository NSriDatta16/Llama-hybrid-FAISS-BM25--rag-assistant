Fixed Width, Large Data Problem

I'm currently designing a web application which may be viewed by people in all kinds of resolutions 1024..1920 or even larger resolutions. I've opted for a fixed-width design (as many other popular websites are, e.g. StackOverflow, CNN , Mint , WSJ , BofA etc.) with the lowest common denominator fitting in, meaning 1024. Now a problem is that on some pages in my application I have to display grid-based data. I think I'm really going to anger people with large screens if I restrict them to 1024 width compacted grid data while keeping most of their screen empty. I thought about making different style sheets and so forth for different resolutions but that will increase much of the maintenance work, graphics work etc. above of what I can manage. Do you have any ideas how to solve this is a graceful manner (I'm just thinking maybe I have a 'creative block' here right now :) ) without having to go fully to a fluid design, which brings a bunch of problems in itself?
