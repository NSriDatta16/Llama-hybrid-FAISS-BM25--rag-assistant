Jquery Accordion Is not working right

I do want to hide/show About-paragraph located in the header, just under navigation bar and I can not see what I am doing wrong. So, When I click About from top navigation bar I do want to show my about content below it; pushing down the main page content. Please, See My Coding so far: http://jsfiddle.net/bbmWK/
