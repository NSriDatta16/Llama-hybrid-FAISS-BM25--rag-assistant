Hierarchical Bayesian Regression with an Indicator Variable, one group has all zeros for the IV Variable

I'm attempting to form a Bayesian Hierarchical Regression Model and one of my regressors is for an indicator variable. My hierarchy structure has separate group-level regressors related across-groups by the assumption that these regressors are drawn from a common distribution. For one of the base-level groups I'm considering, all of the values for that group corresponding to the indicator variable are zeros. As this will be problematic given that this will result in rank-deficient matrices, what, if anything, can be done in this case? Am I forced to drop the variable? Thanks
