Detect when the last item in an array has come to a stop

I've got an array of sprites which I'm animating by incrementing their rotationX property. What I want is for them all to disappear once the last item in the array has come full circle. The problem is that their rotation speeds are being generated by a randomized function, so I can't just go to the end of the array to find the last one. Each time it will be a different one. So I have an array of Sprites: for(var i:int=0; i Then I have my event listener: addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, loop); And my handler: private function loop(e:Event):void { for(var i:int=0; i There's got to be an elegant way to do this. Anyone know what it is? Thanks, David
