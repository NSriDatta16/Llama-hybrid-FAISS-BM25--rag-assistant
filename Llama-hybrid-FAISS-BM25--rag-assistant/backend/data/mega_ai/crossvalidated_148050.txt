There are many possible ways to discretise a continuous variable: see [Garcia 2013] On page 739 I could see at least 5 methods based on chi-square. The optimality of the discretization is actually dependent on the task you want to use the discretised variable in. In your case logistic regression. And as discussed in Garcia2013, finding the optimal discretization given a task is NP-complete. There are lots of heuristics though. In this paper they discuss at least 50 of them. Given my machine learning background (I guess people in statistics prefer other things) I am often biased toward the Fayyad and Irani's Minimum Description Length (MDL) method. I see it is available in the R package discretization As you said, Chi-square is biased towards high number of intervals and many other statistics (as the information gain used in the MDL method) are. However, MDL tries to find a good trade-off between the information gain of the discretized variable and the class and the complexity (number of intervals) of the discretised variable. Give it a try.
