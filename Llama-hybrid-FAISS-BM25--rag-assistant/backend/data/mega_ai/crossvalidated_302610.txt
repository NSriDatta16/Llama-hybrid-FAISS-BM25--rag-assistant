AUC Scores greater than 1 with multi class classification in R?

I am implementing machine learning algorithm for multiclass classification problem in R programming. The problem is that when I predict the accuracy I am getting around 90% accuracy but when I calculate the AUC score I am getting more than 1. Will the AUC support multi-class classification? Which is the better approach to consider the evaluation metric of machine learning model for multi class classification? Below is my code library(dplyr) smp_size Output: > conf_matrix test_labels svm_pred 0 1 2 3 4 0 896 75 50 18 28 1 71 919 28 13 16 2 7 6 112 1 9 3 31 44 12 1023 2 4 1 5 9 0 55 > library(MLmetrics) > Accuracy(svm_pred, test_labels) [1] 0.8758379 > AUC(svm_pred, test_labels) [1] 1.047074
