JQuery UI sortable: restore position based on some condition

I call sortable.stop() to make an ajax call to store some data after drag & drop operation. When the ajax call returns an error (application logic error or net problem) I want to move the dragged element to its original/start position, how can I achieve it? The scenario should be user drags A to B the sortable.stop() event is called, it triggers an ajax call the ajax call returns an error inside the stop() event we get the ajax error move A to its original position user again move A to B everything is ok A remains in its new position in B Steps 6-8 are shown to clarify a successive drag can be done and previous error must be forgotten.
