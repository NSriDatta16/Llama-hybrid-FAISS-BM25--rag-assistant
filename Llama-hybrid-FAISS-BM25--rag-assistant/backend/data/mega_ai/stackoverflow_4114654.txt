Instead of Toast.makeText(this, "!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); put in android.util.Log("TabActivity", "motion event type="+(event.getAction() & MotionEvent. ACTION_MASK) Then you should see various events for touch down (0), move (2) and touch up (1). Take a look at Android log to see events (filter on TabActivity). Edited: I was not paying attention. TabActivity contains child Views which consume touch events. You should place your code inside child Views.
