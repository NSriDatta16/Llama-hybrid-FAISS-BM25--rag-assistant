else doesn't go with while . You'd want something more like: void beginStorage(PicLib *lib) { while (command != 'q') { //let's assume I add a whole bunch //of stuff to PicLib and have some fun here } delete lib; lib = NULL; // Setting to NULL is not necessary in this case, // you're changing a local variable that is about // to go out of scope. cout The delete looks good, but you should make sure to document that beginStorage takes ownership of the PicLib object. That way anyone using beginStorage knows that they don't have to delete it later.
