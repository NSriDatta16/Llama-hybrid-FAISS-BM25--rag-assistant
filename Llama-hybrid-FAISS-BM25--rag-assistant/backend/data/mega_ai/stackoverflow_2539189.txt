If I remember correctly, a class method pointer may be larger than a normal function pointer due to implementation details. This would explain why the compiler does not allow this cast – the method pointer wouldn’t fit inside the storage space of a “normal” pointer. The solution, as I’ve stated above in a comment, is to use a proper C++ hash table implementation that allows arbitrary types via C++ templates.
