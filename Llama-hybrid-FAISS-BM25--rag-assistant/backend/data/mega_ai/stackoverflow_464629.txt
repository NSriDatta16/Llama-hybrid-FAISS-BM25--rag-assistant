(question) Don't you get that info in select * from pg_user ; or using the view pg_stat_activity : select * from pg_stat_activity; Added: the view says: One row per server process, showing database OID, database name, process ID, user OID, user name , current query, query's waiting status, time at which the current query began execution, time at which the process was started, and client's address and port number . The columns that report data on the current query are available unless the parameter stats_command_string has been turned off. Furthermore, these columns are only visible if the user examining the view is a superuser or the same as the user owning the process being reported on. can't you filter and get that information? that will be the current users on the Database, you can use began execution time to get all queries from last 5 minutes for example... something like that.
