C# FileSystemWatcher And FTP

I monitor files that are dropped on a ftp via filesystem watcher then move to another dir. Now I trigger the copy off the create event of the filesystem watcher but obviously in the case of ftp the create is just a stub file and the data comes in and fills the file as it uploads till complete. Anyone have an elegant solution for this, or do I have to do what I think I have to do 1 wait till last access time is about n ms in past before I copy 2 throw a control file in there to state that that file is done being copied, then delete control file 3 pound the crap out of it
