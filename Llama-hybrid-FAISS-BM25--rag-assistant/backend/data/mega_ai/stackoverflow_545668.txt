I did some timings as recommended. here are the results for my app. Its the whole app, not just the regex searches. It scans 60,000 lines. 11 Regular expressions average short length was about 30 characters. The longer but anchored ones are about 120. Short real 0m58.780s user 0m54.940s sys 0m0.790s Long (anchored) real 0m54.260s user 0m53.630s sys 0m0.490s Long (not anchored) real 0m54.705s user 0m54.130s sys 0m0.400s So anchoring the long strings is slightly faster. Although not by much. It would appear that if my strings were any larger it might be a different matter.
