From your USER_AGENT info it looks like this is a web spider from puritysearch.net. I suggest you do is put a CAPTCHA code in you website. Program it to trigger when something tries to access 10 pages in 10 seconds (mostly no humans would do this or figure out a proper criteria to trigger your CAPTCHA). Also, maintain robots.txt file which most crawlers honor. Mention your rules in robots.txt . You can say the crawlers to keep off certain busy sections of your site etc. If the problem persists, you might want to contact that particular site's system admin & try to figure out what's going on. This way you will not be completely blocking crawlers (which are needed for your website to become popular) and at the same time you are making sure that your users get fast experience on your site.
