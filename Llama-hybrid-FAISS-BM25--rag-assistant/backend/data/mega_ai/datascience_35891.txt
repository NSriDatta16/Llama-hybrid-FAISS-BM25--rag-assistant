This sounds like a job for a Recurrent Neural Network. I must be honest I have yet to fully dive into them but the idea is it has connections pointing backwards which it feeds to itself. It is often used for stock predictions and time series related problems. There is a entire section dedicated to it in O'Reillys "Hands on Machine Learning with SKlearn and Tensorflow". I highly recommend it. Great tool to have. Good luck.
