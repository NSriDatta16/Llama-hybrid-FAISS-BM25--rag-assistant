Frameworks, tools, languages and skills are all designed for tasks , therefore it's relatively meaningless to talk about the organisation instead of about the tasks which an organisation might wish to perform. A kid in garage could use every piece of Java Enterprise software available just as well as a Fortune 500 company could choose to use PHP. So in essence, your question doesn't make a lot of sense without reference to what you might want to do with it. It's true that a small business is unlikely to want many of the large-scale features that Java can offer, but it doesn't mean they can't use them if it's appropriate for the task at hand!
