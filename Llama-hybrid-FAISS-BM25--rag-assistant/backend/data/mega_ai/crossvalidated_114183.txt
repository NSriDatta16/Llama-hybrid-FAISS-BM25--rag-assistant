Let's assume that your criterion estimates the probability of correct classification and it's not biased. I.e., if the criterion is 0.6, then the probability of correct classification is 0.6. Then, the appropriate threshold will still depend on your loss function. E.g. if you gain \$1 when you classify the case right and lose \$1 when you misclassify then it's enough to set the threshold at 0.51 to win on average. If you gain \$1 and lose $5, then the threshold should be much higher. This reasoning also assumes that you get to make a lot of predictions and you only care about the aggregate result.
