How do I implement snap to grid functionality for a UIImageView?

I have a draggable view that I have set up with the following code: #import @interface DraggableView : UIImageView { CGPoint startLocation; } @end #import "DraggableView.h" @implementation DraggableView - (id) initWithImage: (UIImage *) anImage { if (self = [super initWithImage:anImage]) self.userInteractionEnabled = YES; return self; } - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { // Calculate and store offset, and pop view into front if needed CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; startLocation = pt; [[self superview] bringSubviewToFront:self]; } - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { // Calculate offset CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; float dx = pt.x - startLocation.x; float dy = pt.y - startLocation.y; CGPoint newcenter = CGPointMake(self.center.x + dx, self.center.y + dy); // Set new location self.center = newcenter; } How do I go about snapping this view to a grid? From a broad viewpoint, I understand that I could offset the new location in a touchesEnded method call. However, I am hitting a brick wall when I try to implement this. Thanks in advance for any assistance with this issue.
