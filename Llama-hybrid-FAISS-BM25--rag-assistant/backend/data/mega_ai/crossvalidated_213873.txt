Residuals of SARIMA follow Student's $t$ distribution - implications?

I have fitted a SARIMA model to my time series. The diagnostics of the residuals are all good (ACF, PACF, ...), i.e. it seems they behave like white noise. But when I plot the normal qq-plot, they seem to be asymmetrically distributed. I tried doing a Student's $t$ qq-plot and the errors seems to be corrected. My only problem is that now, I do not know how to interpret this result. What does it mean for the residuals to follow a Student's $t$ distribution?
