A measure that is often used to validate logistic regression, is the AUC of the ROC curve (plot of sensitivity against 1-specificity - just google for the terms if needed). This, in essence, evaluates the whole range of threshold values. On the downside: evaluating the whole range of threshold values may be not what you're after, since this (typically) includes thresholds that result in very large numbers of false negatives or false positives. There are versions of the AUC that account for this (partial AUC), so if that is an issue for you, you can look into that.
