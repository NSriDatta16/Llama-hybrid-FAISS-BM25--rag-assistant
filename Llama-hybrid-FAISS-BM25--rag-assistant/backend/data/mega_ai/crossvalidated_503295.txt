How do I determine when a (non-independent) time series approaches a horizontal asymptote?

I have time series data with many data points per subject over time. I want to determine the marginal time interval within which my dependent variable (dv) falls within given "equivalence" bounds around a (a priori unknown) horizontal asymptote. I thought about fitting a linear mixed model with polynomials in time as fixed effects and the corresponding by-subject random intercept and slopes to get a (simultaneous) confidence region for the corresponding regression function and determine the desired time interval based on that confidence region. But I'm not exactly sure (1) whether this is a reasonable approach, and if so, (2) how I could construct the (simultaneous) confidence region and get the desired time interval, or (3) if there is another approach which is usually used to solve this tasks. The functional form of the population relation between time and the dv could be something like $\mathrm{dv}=\alpha\cdot\exp(\frac{\beta}{\mathrm{time}})+\epsilon$ but I'm more interested in a general approach that can be applied without assuming this functional form.
