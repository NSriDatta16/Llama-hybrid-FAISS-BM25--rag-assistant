Implementing a tree view in seam / JSF using Richfaces or jsTree

I am using seam with EJB3 + JSF and I would like to add a tree view component to the UI. The tree view must allow sorting of the nodes (preferably drag and drop) and must allow selection of leaf nodes. The options I have looked at are: RichFaces Tree jsTree Is there a major benefit to one option over the other? If I use jsTree, what is the best way to connect to my data in EJB3? Should I use RESTEasy , Java script Remoting, or some other way?
