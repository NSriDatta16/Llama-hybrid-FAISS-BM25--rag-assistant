Determine postion of dart in dartboard

I'm new to machine learning and I want to built my first project. I decided to write an application which determines the postion of a dart in a dartboard. The neural network would have the following requirements: Mapping the images of 3 cameras to a 2D representation of the dartboard. Determining the amount and exact position of up to 3 different darts sticking in the dartboard. Since I don't have prior knowledge to machine learning my question is regarding the optimal type of neural network and libaries I should look into for this project. Thanks in advance Jan
