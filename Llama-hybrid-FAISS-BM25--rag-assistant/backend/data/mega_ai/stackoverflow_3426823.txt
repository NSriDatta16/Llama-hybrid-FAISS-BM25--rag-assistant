As you seem to be aware, retrofitting testing into an existing project is not easy. Your method of writing tests as you go is the better way. Your problem is one of both process and technology- tests must be required by everyone or no one will use them. The recommendation I've heard and agree with is that you should not attempt to wrap tests around an existing codebase all at once. You'll never finish. Start by working testing into your bugfix process- every fixed bug gets a test. This will start to work testing into your existing code over time. New code must always have tests, of course. Eventually, you'll get the coverage up to a reasonable percentage, but it will take time. One good book I've had recommended to me is Working Effectively With Legacy Code by Michael C. Feathers. The title doesn't really demonstrate it, but working testing into an existing codebase is a major subject of the book.
