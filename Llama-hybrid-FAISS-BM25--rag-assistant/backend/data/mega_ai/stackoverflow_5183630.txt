Calendar Recurring/Repeating Events - Best Storage Method

I am building a custom events system, and if you have a repeating event that looks like this: Event A repeats every 4 days starting on March 3, 2011 or Event B repeats every 2 weeks on Tuesday starting on March 1, 2011 How can I store that in a Database in a way that would make it simple to lookup. I don't want performance issues if there are a large number of events, and I have to go through each and every one when rendering the calendar.
