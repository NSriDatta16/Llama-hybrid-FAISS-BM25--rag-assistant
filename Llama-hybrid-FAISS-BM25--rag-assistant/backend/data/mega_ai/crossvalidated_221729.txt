There's a big gain to be gotten by reorganizing your data. Right now, you're treating the wall thickness of each point in the heart as a completely separate dependent variable (DV), when clearly there are meaningful relationships among all these things. Instead, move the position information to $X$, so now you have only one DV. (How to encode the position in $X$ is potentially a deep topic, for which see a textbook on spatial data analysis, but whatever coordinate information you use to identify the positions in the first place is a decent place to start.) Note that you now need to add a subject identifier to $X$ since you now have $m$ rows for each subject instead of just one. Now, you can build one big regression model instead of $m$ small ones. You can look at, e.g., the overall effect of age on wall thickness by using a main effect of age, or the effect of age on wall thickness at a particular point on the heart by using an interaction term. You will probably want to use a mixed model where each person gets a random intercept, and perhaps also each position gets a random intercept. Heteroscedasticity may or may not show up again, which there is no doubt many ways to respond to, but you can avoid it optimistically biasing your conclusions by predictively validating your model instead of relying on significance testing.
