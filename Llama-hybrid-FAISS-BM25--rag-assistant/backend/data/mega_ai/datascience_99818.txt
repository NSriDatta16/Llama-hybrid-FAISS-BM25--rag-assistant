How to use new dataset on a pretrained neural network model?

I have built a dataset that I would like to pass to a pretrained model in oder to perform some predictions. I am looking for some steps/processes to guide me in this. Should I fine tune?If so what exactly should I fine tune? Is there other ways? Any help is appreciated :)
