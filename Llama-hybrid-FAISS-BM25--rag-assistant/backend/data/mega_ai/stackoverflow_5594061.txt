To your main question: you should use jQuery.val function instead of jQuery.attr('value') . Many other things in your code seams me strange or unclear. It is not clear for me how you use reloadOnEnter in the loadCompleteHandler . If would be good if you include the corresponding code fragment. The value for the url seems me also very strange. You use additionally searchOnEnter: false option of filterToolbar but in the reloadOnEnter you wait for the 'Enter' key. Inside of the body of if(e.keyCode == 13) you get jQuery(':input[name=field1]').attr('value') and then set the same value back. Why? Probably you could describe in the text of your question a little more what you want to archive with the code?
