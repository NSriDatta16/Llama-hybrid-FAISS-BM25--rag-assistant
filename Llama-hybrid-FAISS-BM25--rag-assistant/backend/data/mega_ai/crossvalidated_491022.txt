How to compare differences between two logistic regression models?

I've made non-linear estimation predicting percent of viable cells depending on drug dose given. The curves were fitted using the y=a*ln(x)+b equation, where y stands for the percent of viable cells, and x stands for concentration of drug. The curves are quite well fitted and could be published, yet I would like to find out, if the curves are "statistically different" - is it possible to determine the significance of differences between them? Is it even a valid question? Comparison between two most different models is presented below. The equations are: y=(-18,7047)*log(x)+(128,96) y=(-27,4459)*log(x)+(141,982)
