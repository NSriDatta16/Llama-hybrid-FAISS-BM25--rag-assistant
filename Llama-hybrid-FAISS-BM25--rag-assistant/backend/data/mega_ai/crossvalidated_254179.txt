The accepted answer and the answer by Franck are both awesome, but I want to detail a bit the process about the subtraction in $\beta$. And I hope my answer is an easy-to-read one. The general equation for the probability of the dependent variable $Y_i$ being fallen into the category $c$(in all $K$ categories), given the sample(observation) $X_i$, is defined as: $$Pr(Y_i=c) = \frac{e^{\beta_c*X_i}}{\sum^K_{k=1}e^{\beta_k*X_i}}$$ Since for all $Y_i$, $\sum^K_{k=1}Pr(Y_i=k)$ is 1, then there must be a certain $Pr(Y_i=c)$ that is determined by all the rest probabilities( when $k\neq c$). As a result, there are only $K-1$ separately specifiable coefficients($\beta$) for each sample $X_i$. According to the characterizations of the aforementioned equation, the probability remains the same if we subtract a constant from each item in the $\beta$ vector. That is: $$\frac{e^{(\beta_c+C)*X_i}}{\sum^K_{k=1}e^{(\beta_k+C)*X_i}}=\frac{e^{C*X_i}e^{\beta_cX_i}}{e^{C*X_i}\sum^K_{k=1}e^{\beta_k*X_i}}=\frac{e^{\beta_cX_i}}{\sum^K_{k=1}e^{\beta_kX_i}}$$ Then it is reasonable for us to make $C=-\beta_K$(alternatively any other $k$), resulting in the Kth item of the new coefficient for each vector $\beta$ becomes 0(only $K-1$ categories are considered separately specifiable now). $\beta'_1=\beta_1-\beta_K$ ...... $\beta'_{K-1}=\beta_{K-1}-\beta_K$ $\beta'_K=\beta_K-\beta_K=0$ Hence we can transfer the first general equation in the form of: $$Pr(Y_i=c) = \frac{e^{\beta'_c*X_i}}{e^{0*X_i}+\sum^{K-1}_{k=1}e^{\beta'_k*X_i}} = \frac{e^{\beta'_c*X_i}}{1+\sum^{K-1}_{k=1}e^{\beta'_k*X_i}}$$ When we have two categories, that is when the distribution of the dependent variable is binomial, or $K=2$, we have(if the Kth category is when $Y_i=2$): $$Pr(Y_i=1) = \frac{e^{\beta'_1*X_i}}{1+e^{\beta'_1*X_i}}=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\beta'_1*X_i}}$$, and $$Pr(Y_i=2) = 1-Pr(Y_i=1)$$ That is the familiar equations you see in binomial logistic regression.
