Algorithms by Robert Sedwick, It was mentioned that linked list can be represented using Arrays, at following link http://flylib.com/books/en/3.55.1.34/1/ Fig 3.8, here if 5 is removed from my understanding next 4 should be changed to index 6 as val 5 is removed, as we go thourgh the figure at item 4 is removed next of val 3 is chaned. I am not following the logic of the figure. can aany one please help me. Thanks!
