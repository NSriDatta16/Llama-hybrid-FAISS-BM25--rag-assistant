Do you know what "correct" is for your situation? Determine what correct means then test your implementation against your data and see how close you are. Unless your test coverage is 100% you'll never know if you have a nasty edge case bug in your code. You wouldn't if you had the initial parameters of the algorithm you are modeling unless your test touched the code where the bug lives.
