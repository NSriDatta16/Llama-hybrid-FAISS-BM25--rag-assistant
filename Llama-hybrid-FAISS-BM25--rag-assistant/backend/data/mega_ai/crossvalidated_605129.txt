Section 4.1 of the Wooldridge text describes what's being considered: The correlation of explanatory variables with unobservables is often due to self-selection : if agents choose the value of [independent variable] $x_j$ , this might depend on factors ( $q$ ) that are unobservable to the analyst. A good example is omitted ability in a wage equation, where an individualâ€™s years of schooling are likely to be correlated with unobserved ability. We discuss the omitted variables problem in detail in Section 4.3. In that context, the "linear projection" in Equation 4.23 (from Section 4.3) is a hypothetical projection. (It might only be considered a linear "regression" if you had actual values to work with.) If you somehow knew how $q$ is associated with the $x_j$ , then you could perform the substitutions shown to come up with the critical result: if $q$ is uncorrelated with $x_j$ , then in linear regression it introduces no bias into the estimate of the corresponding $\beta_j$ ; if $q$ is correlated with $x_K$ then (Equation 4.24): $$\text{plim } \hat\beta_K = \beta_K + \gamma \left[\text{Cov}(x_K,q)/\text{Var}(x_K) \right] $$ where $\text{plim } \hat\beta_K$ is the limit in probability of the coefficient estimate in the model omitting $q$ , and $\beta_K$ is the true coefficient. In practice, if you can make reasonable assumptions about that correlation, it allows you to gauge the nature of the bias.
