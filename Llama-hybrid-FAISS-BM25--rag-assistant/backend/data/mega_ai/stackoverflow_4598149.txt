flip the operation and the int is faster..have you taken into account log and data file growth? Run each separately declare @i int, @t1 datetime, @t2 datetime set @t1 = GETDATE() set @i = 1 while @i the problem with UUIDs is when clustering on them and not using NEWSEQUENTIALID() is that they cause page breaks and fragmentation of the table now try like this and you see it is almost the same declare @i int, @t1 datetime, @t2 datetime set @t1 = GETDATE() set @i = 1 while @i And reversed declare @i int, @t1 datetime, @t2 datetime set @t1 = GETDATE() set @i = 1 while @i
