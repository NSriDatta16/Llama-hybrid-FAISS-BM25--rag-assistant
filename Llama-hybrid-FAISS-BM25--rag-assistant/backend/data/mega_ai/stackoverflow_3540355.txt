Using SQLite with C on Windows

I am trying to develop a project in C (on Dev-Cpp IDE) using SQLite for data storage, on Windows Vista. I am trying to run this code : Sqlite with C I moved sqlite3.h in the /lib path. But when I am trying to run the program, I get lots of linker errors, saying "undefined reference to sqlite3_open" ,etc. Google gives me Linux commands, which cant be used here :( Can somone please guide me through the whole process of using sqlite with C , I am very new to such things. Where do I put the sqlite3.exe ?? Thanks a lot !!
