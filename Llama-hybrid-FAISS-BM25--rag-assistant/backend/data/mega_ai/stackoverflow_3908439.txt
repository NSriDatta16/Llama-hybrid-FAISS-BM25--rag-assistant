Wrapping in xul:hbox

I have strange problem with XUL layouts. My current code: .. some elements .. .. some elements .. ... .. some elements .. I need to make hbox with buttons resizable, but if buttons doesn't fit in container - it should be wrapped for 2 (or more) lines. Currently, when I shrink browser size - some of buttons hiding behind the right border of window. my:button is box with display: inline-block; and some content inside. I have tried float: left on button, display: block , overflow: visibel and other tricks worked in HTML/CSS. Thanks for attention.
