There is no such thing as an HTML5 reference implementation. http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Implementations_in_Web_browsers has information on what Web browsers have implemented so far regarding HTML5. As for what HTML5 is. It is both a document and application language, defining various APIs applications can use, including storage and offline capabilities. For detailed information it is probably easiest to browse through the specification: http://www.whatwg.org/html5 "Threads" is part of a separate specification, done by basically the same group of people, named Web Workers: http://www.whatwg.org/ww (Disclaimer: I'm a WHATWG Member and W3C HTML WG Member.)
