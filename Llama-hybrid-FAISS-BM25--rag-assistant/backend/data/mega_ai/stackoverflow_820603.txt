What should one map strings to in a database ORM?

Strings are unbounded, but it seems every normal relational database requires that a column declare its maximum length. This seems to be a rather significant discrepancy and I'm curious how typical ORMs handle this. Using a 'text' column type would theoretically give you much more string-like storage, but as I understand it text columns are not queryable, or at least not efficiently (non-indexed?). I'm thinking of using something like NHibernate perhaps, but my ORM needs are relatively simple, so if I can just write it myself it might save some bloat.
