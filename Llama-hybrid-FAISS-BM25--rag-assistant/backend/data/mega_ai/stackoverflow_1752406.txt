Yes, there's some excellent discussion happening with Albert Kallal and others on this topic in the newsgroups. See my blog postings on the topic of SharePoint and Access 2010 . I've given you a link to the SharePoint tags as I will be blogging any additional discussions in the newsgroups using that tag. So keep checking back every week or two. Also I believe Access 2010 is now available as a public beta this week so you can download some or all of it yourself. Visit Technet/MSDN.
