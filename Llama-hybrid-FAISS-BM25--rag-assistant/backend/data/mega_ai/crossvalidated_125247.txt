One could duplicate each $S$ state hence the construction you have in mind seems to be always trivially possible--unless you have more constraints in mind, in which case you should explain them. An interesting concept is the opposite one, where one groups some states of a Markov chain and one considers the resulting process, called the lumped chain .
