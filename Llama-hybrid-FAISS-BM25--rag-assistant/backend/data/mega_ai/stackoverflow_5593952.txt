I can not make the container show again the Login box to validate the user, and be able to change of user... And my user always can go back, pressing the BACK button in the browser or just writing the URL, and continue doing thnigs there when is supposed that there should not be a existing session. Those pages are likely displayed from the browser cache rather than re-requested from the server. To stop this, create a Filter which is mapped on URL pattern of interest ( *.jsf maybe?) and does the following job in doFilter() method: HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) response; httpResponse.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate"); // HTTP 1.1 httpResponse.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); // HTTP 1.0 httpResponse.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); // Proxies. chain.doFilter(request, response); Clear the browser cache before testing.
