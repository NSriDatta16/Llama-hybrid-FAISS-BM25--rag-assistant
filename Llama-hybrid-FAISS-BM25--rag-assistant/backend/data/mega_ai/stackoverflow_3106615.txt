I think the best practice is this : 1/ Put all the methods in the same protocol near each other 2/ Put the #pragma at the top of that block #pragma mark UITextFieldDelegate - (void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField { // some code } - (void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField { } #pragma mark UIPickerViewDelegate So, when people use XCode to see the list of methods, they will know where to look for a method in a particular protocol:)
