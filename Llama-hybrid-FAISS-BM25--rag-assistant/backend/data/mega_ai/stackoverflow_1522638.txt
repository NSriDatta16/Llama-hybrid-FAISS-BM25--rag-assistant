Having good reasons to go with one standard over another should be the guiding factor. Use these: VB.NET seems much more verbose than C#. (ex: " Dim var as MyClass" vs "MyClass var") C# is similar to C++ and Java. VB.NET is similar to... well, nothing. (unless you count VB6...) Try making a ragged array in VB.NET. I dare you.
