How to prevent xml.ElementTree fromstring from dropping commentnode

I have tho following code fragment: from xml.etree.ElementTree import fromstring,tostring mathml = fromstring(input) for elem in mathml.getiterator(): elem.tag = 'm:' + elem.tag return tostring(mathml) When i input the following input : 1 2 3 Uitleg --> It results in: 1 2 3 Uitleg How come? And how can I preserve the comment? edit : I don't care for the exact xml library used, however, I should be able to do the pasted change to the tags. Unfortunately, lxml does not seem to allow this (and I cannot use proper namespace operations)
