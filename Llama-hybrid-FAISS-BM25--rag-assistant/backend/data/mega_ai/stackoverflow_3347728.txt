Documenting in grails

I want to generate something like http://grails.org/doc/latest/ for my grails project. I have tried grails doc, but It doesn't organize the project in Taglibs, etc. I want something to fetch easily the taglib for a given namespace. Also to see more clearly the global state of documentation of the project. Do you know if exists a plugin for this or any workaround? thanks in advance
