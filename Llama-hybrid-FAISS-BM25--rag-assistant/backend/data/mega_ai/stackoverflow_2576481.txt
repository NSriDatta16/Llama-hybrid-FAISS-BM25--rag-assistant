Start PyGTK cellrenderer edit from code

I have a treeview with an editable CellRendererText: self.renderer = gtk.CellRendererText() self.renderer.set_property('editable', True) But now I need to launch the edition from code instead from user, this is to focus the user attention in the fact he just created a new row and needs to be named. I tried this but does not work: self.renderer.start_editing( gtk.gdk.Event(gtk.gdk.NOTHING), self.treeview, str(index), gtk.gdk.Rectangle(), gtk.gdk.Rectangle(), 0) Neither does not throw errors, but the documentation about for what is each argument is not clear, in fact I really don't know if start_editing method is for this. All suggestions are welcome, thanks.
