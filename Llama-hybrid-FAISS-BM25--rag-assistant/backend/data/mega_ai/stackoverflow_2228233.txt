can/does SQL Server use the index (LastName, FirstName) for queries on just LastName as well as queries on both? Yes, the database will use the index (LastName, FirstName) for queries on LastName. It will not use this index for queries only on FirstName though. Does it store compound index parts left-to-right or right-to-left? Storage is in a B-Tree . Whether you think of it as being stored right-to-left or left-to-right is just a useful visualization aid, and not related to the actual data storage.
