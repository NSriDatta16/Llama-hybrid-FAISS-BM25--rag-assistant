 findability of the web content on your webpages. Keyword matching: At a semantic level, terminology used by the searcher and the content producer be different. Bridging the gap between the terms used by customers and developers is helpful for making web content more findable to more potential content consumers. On-site findability On-site findability is concerned with the ability of a potential customer to find what they are looking for within a specific site. More than 90 percent of customers use internal searches in a website compared to browsing. Of those, only 50 percent find what they are looking for. Improving the quality of on-site searches highly improves the business of the website. Several factors affect findability on a website: Site search: If searchers within a site do not find what they are looking for, they tend to leave rather than browse through the website. Users who had successful site searches are twice as likely to ultimately convert. Related links and products: User experience can be enhanced by trying to understand the needs of the customer and provide suggestions for other, related information. Site match to customer needs and preferences: Site design, content creation, and recommendations are major factors for affecting the customer experience. Evaluation and measures Baseline findability is the existing findability before changes are made in order to improve it. This is measured by participants who represent the customer base of the website, who try to locate a sample set of items using the existing navigation of the website. In order to evaluate how easily information can be found by searching a site using a search engine or information retrieval system, retrievability measures were developed, and similarly, navigability measures now measure ease of information access through browsing a site (e.g. PageRank, MNav, InfoScent (see Information foraging), etc.). Findability also can be evaluated via the following techniques: Usability testing: Conducted to find out how and why users navigate through a website to accomplish tasks. Tree testing: An information architecture based technique, to determine if critical information can be found on the website. Closed card sorting: A usability technique based on information architecture, for evaluating the strength of categories. Click testing: Accounts for the implicit data collected through clicks on the user interface. Beyond findability Findability Sciences defines a findability index in terms of each user's influence, context, and sentiments. For seamless search, current websites focus on a combination of structured hypertext-based information architectures and rich Internet application-enabled visualization techniques.
