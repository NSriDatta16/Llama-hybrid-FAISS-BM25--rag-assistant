What is the difference between Dilated Convolution and Deconvolution?

These two convolution operations are very common in deep learning right now. I read about dilated convolutional layer in this paper : WAVENET: A GENERATIVE MODEL FOR RAW AUDIO and De-convolution is in this paper : Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation Both seem to up-sample the image but what is the difference?
