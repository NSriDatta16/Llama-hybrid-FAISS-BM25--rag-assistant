How many observations to estimate a parameter of an Archimedean copula?

Let's consider for example the bivariate Gumbel copula. $$C(u_1, u_2)=\exp \left[-\left(\left(-\ln\left(u_1\right)\right)^{\theta}+\left(-\ln\left(u_2\right)\right)^{\theta}\right)^{\frac{1}{\theta}}\right].$$ In R there are some functions (such as fitCopula ) which estimate the parameter $\theta$. Do you maybe have a reference which suggests how many observations $(u_1, u_2)$ I should consider to reliably estimate $\theta$? And is this number maybe influenced by the number of time series (I have a Gumbel copula with 9 variables)?
