Xsl transformation of large xmls

I am aware of ways of applying XSL transformation to XMLs in java using javax.xml.transform.Transformer This approach works well for small XML data. But when it comes to large XML data where DOM based approach is difficult to use because of memory constraints, this becomes a nightmare. I want to know what is the best approach to apply XSL transformation to large XMLs. Is there any transformer which operates on SAX and not DOM?
