Are the features in IIS 7 on Vista Business the same as on Windows 2008 server?

We're migrating development to Vista 64 bit mainly so we can leverage >4GB memory on the dev PCs. IIS 7 looks pretty different to the flavour we've come to know and love on Windows XP Pro so we're looking at buying some reference materials. Would buying a book on IIS 7 targetted primarily to Windows 2008 be also applicable to the version installed on Vista? Thanks, Rob.
