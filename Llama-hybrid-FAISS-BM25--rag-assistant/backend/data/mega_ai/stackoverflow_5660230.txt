Modules In Ruby On Rails

I am building a CMS using Ruby on Rails to teach myself the framework. One thing I am trying to work out and can't find resources for is how to build it in a modular format (By this I don't mean Ruby modules, but like the style of Zend Frameword Modules) so for example: App : Admin : Controllers : Views : Models : Pages : Controllers : Views : Models : Localisation : Controllers : Views : Models Now I know that there may be a different way to achieve this, but I guess my specific aims are for easy separation of different parts and easy drop in/out, so for example a localisation module could be dropped in to achieve specific extra functionality for localisation etc. Edit: I am not trying to build this in the same way as ZF, however I am assuming there is some way to organise sections of the site. I am trying to work out what RoRs answer to this kind of 'problem' is. I am just using ZF as an example.
