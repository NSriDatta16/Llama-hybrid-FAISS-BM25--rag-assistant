AIMA implementation bayesian networks

I would like to code bayesian networks in java to understand them better, and I have found some code of Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach (3rd Edition), "AIMA" Do you recommend I read the code there and adapt to a particular problem, or how do I start? Could you please orient me where in how to use the code? I found google has it here and here ,
