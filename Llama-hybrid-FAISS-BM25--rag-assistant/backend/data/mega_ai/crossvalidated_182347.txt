Remember you are interested in $Pr(Y|X)$ and not $Pr(X)$ or $Pr(Y,X)$. Therefore there is nothing to do on $X$. But if the number of $X$ columns are large then you might want to reduce that by a PCA. If you use a technique that is sensitive to the units of the $X$ columns (LASSO, Ridge regression), you might want to scale $X$ columns to the same scale.
