I believe the issue is that the permutation test you are using is too liberal; it assumes a Null hypothesis in which all observations are exchangeable. From what you say, observations within a cage are exchangeable, but are not exchangeable between cages. To use the more restrictive null in the permutation test we can use a restricted permutation design, in which we ask vegan to only permute observations within cages and never between cages. This is most easily done using a blocking factor. Create the blocking factor: m_char Next, define the restricted permutation design (the defaults for how() mean we get randomisation within the levels of the factor passed to blocks ) ctrl Now fit the model and remove the between-cage variation, which is also required for these analyses with blocks my.cca Now do the restricted permutation test set.seed(10) anova(my.cca, by = "terms", permutations = ctrl) This produces: > anova(my.cca, by = "terms", permutations = ctrl) Permutation test for cca under reduced model Terms added sequentially (first to last) Blocks: m_char$cage Permutation: free Number of permutations: 1000 Model: cca(formula = grooming ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + Condition(cage), data = m_char) Df ChiSquare F Pr(>F) x1 1 0.52470 1.4119 0.15185 x2 1 0.60901 1.6388 0.03397 * x3 1 0.21703 0.5840 0.96503 x4 1 0.36739 0.9886 0.36563 x5 1 0.83984 2.2600 0.03497 * Residual 7 2.60129 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 And the triplot shows different behaviour to that you obtained Does this make sense now?
