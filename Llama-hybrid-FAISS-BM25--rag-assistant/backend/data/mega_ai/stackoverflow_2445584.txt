Uploading files to file server

Using the link below, I wrote a code for my application. I am not able to get it right though, Please refer the link and help me ot with it... Uploading files to file server using webclient class The following is my code:- protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { filePath = FileUpload1.FileName; try { WebClient client = new WebClient(); NetworkCredential nc = new NetworkCredential(uName, password); Uri addy = new Uri("\\\\192.168.1.3\\upload\\"); client.Credentials = nc; byte[] arrReturn = client.UploadFile(addy, filePath); Console.WriteLine(arrReturn.ToString()); } catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex.Message); } } I also used:- File.Copy(filePath, "\\192.168.1.3\upload\"); The following line doesn't execute... byte[] arrReturn = client.UploadFile(addy, filePath); tried changing it to:- byte[] arrReturn = client.UploadFile("\\\\192.168.1.3\\upload\\", filePath); IT still doesn't work...Any solution to it?? I basically want to transfer a file from the client to the file storage server without actually login into the server so that the client cannot access the storage location on the server directly. THIS IS THE ERROR I GET :- "An exception occurred during a WebClient request"
