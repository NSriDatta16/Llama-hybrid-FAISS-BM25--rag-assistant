Basic references on MCMC for Bayesian Statistics

I'm looking for some papers or books with practical and theoretical examples about basic MCMC for Bayesian Statistics (With R). I've never studied about simulation, and that's why I'm looking for "basic" information. Can you give me some recommendations or advice?
