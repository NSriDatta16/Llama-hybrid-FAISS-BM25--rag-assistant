Advice on sensitivity analysis for priors in Bayesian statistics

I'm not clear on how to perform sensitivity analysis on the priors. Many sites have different answers. One site indicates to perform three non-informative, weakly informative and known priors. Another suggest running the model with different priors. Here are my questions: I want to estimate this parameter A, in which A = mean1 + mean2 . So, the priors for mean1 and mean2 are formulated ( in coding ) as the following : mean1 ~ N(u1, tau1) A ~ N(mean1, tau2) where tau1 ~ gamma(alpha1,beta1) tau2 ~ gamma(alpha2,beta2) With the above formulation, how do I perform the sensitivity analysis? Should I define a range of u1, tau1, and tau2 ? If so, what is the systematic procedures? It seems to me there are various combinations: varying u1 and fixing tau1 and tau2; or fix u1 and tau2, varying tau1; or fix u1 and tau1, varying tau2. How do we know what are the correct priors to use? How do I incorporate weakly informative priors to the above formulation? What if the sensitivity test returns different estimated mean1 and A by varying the priors? How do we make conclusion? Your advice will be appreciated and help me get started. Thank you! EDIT: I corrected an error. You can calculate the estimated mean2 from estimated parameters A and estimated mean1 .
