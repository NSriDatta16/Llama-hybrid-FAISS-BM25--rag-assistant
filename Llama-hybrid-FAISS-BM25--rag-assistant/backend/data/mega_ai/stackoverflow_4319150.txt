Make QListWidget only show 1 item

I have created a class that inherits the QListWidget and is meant to be a stack of cards. I have overloaded the drag and drop functions to allow a card to be dragged to the table (another object of my program) and now I stumble on another problem. The QListWidget shows all my items (mainly because I add them to the GUI from the beginning). So this is how it goes: in my mainwindow I initialise my CardPile object and fill it up with a shuffled vector of cards. Now I want my QListWidget to show only one (but its showing a grid with all my cards). On a drop I remove the item from my QListWidget. But I have no idea if I were to add and remove 1 card at a time (so it only shows 1 card ofcourse) in my code. public: TileStack(QWidget *parent = 0); void addCard(QPixmap pixmap, QPoint location); QPixmap showCard(); protected: void dragEnterEvent(QDragEnterEvent *event); void dragMoveEvent(QDragMoveEvent *event); void startDrag(Qt::DropActions supportedActions); //in this function I remove the current item These are the functions in my CardPile : QListWidget. so: void TileStack::startDrag(Qt::DropActions /*supportedActions*/) { QListWidgetItem *item = currentItem(); QByteArray itemData; QDataStream dataStream(&itemData, QIODevice::WriteOnly); QPixmap pixmap = qVariantValue (item->data(Qt::UserRole)); QPoint location = item->data(Qt::UserRole+1).toPoint(); dataStream setData("card", itemData); QDrag *drag = new QDrag(this); drag->setMimeData(mimeData); drag->setHotSpot(QPoint(pixmap.width()/2, pixmap.height()/2)); drag->setPixmap(pixmap); if (drag->exec(Qt::MoveAction) == Qt::MoveAction) delete takeItem(row(item)); //should I also make the add to the next item here? and how exactly should I put it here? } Because I currently have my vector of shuffled cards in the mainwindow (where I add all the cards in a forloop). Or should I make a signal and slot that connect between mainwindow and CardPile - so when delete takeItem(row(item)); is called I emit a signal that says to add the next card to the list? Thanks for feedback
