If you want to know if your confidence interval is well-defined, you can simply run a simulation and check if you get 95% coverage. To do this, choose a parameter set and repeat: sample data with these parameters apply your method to calculate CI check if your CI covers the true value -> in your case the analytical cdf. You may want to check this for different values of the cdf. After repeating, e.g. 1000x, you can calculate how often your true value is outside the CI, to see if you have nominal coverage. You should repeat this for different "true" parameter values. Let me add that good nominal coverage != 95% probability for predictions, see here . Note: this is a copy of my suggestion from the comments, which seemed to have helped. Note also that the question about underflow issue was answered by @StijnDeVuyst.
