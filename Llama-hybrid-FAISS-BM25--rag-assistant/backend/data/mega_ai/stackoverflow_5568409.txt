Java generics void/Void types

I am implementing a ResponseHandler for the apache HttpClient package, like so: new ResponseHandler () { public int handleResponse(...) { // ... code ... return 0; } } but I'd like for the handleResponse function to return nothing, i.e. void . Is this possible? The following does not compile, since void is not a valid Java type: new ResponseHandler () { public void handleResponse(...) { // ... code ... } } I suppose I could replace void with Void to return a Void object, but that's not really what I want. Question : is it possible to organize this callback situation in such a way that I can return void from handleResponse ?
