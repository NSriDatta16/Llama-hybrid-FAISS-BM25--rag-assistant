Placemark image being stretched on Google Maps API application

Has anyone else experience a custom placemark being vertically stretched and found a solution to it? Example: http://www.mattpotts.com/so-stretched.png And this is the code I have: var blueIcon = new GIcon(G_DEFAULT_ICON); blueIcon.image = "images/beer-24x24.png"; var marker = new GMarker(point, {draggable:true, icon:blueIcon})
