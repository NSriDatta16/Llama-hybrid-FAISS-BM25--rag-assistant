(.Net + SQL Server +Azure ) vs (Java + Oracle +Google App Engine) which is better for this project specifically?

I have to develop an ERP System for a 2,000+ end users organisation. Could you please suggest me with comparable points that among (Java or .Net) in which technology I should invest money and time? Although I have done some average projects in both, but this project is going to be very big in near future in terms of scalability. I want to know your experiences and some tips from you people, so that I can develop and deploy this project efficiently. I rate .Net > Java for this project only due to less development time available. We have to use some Rapid App Development technology. I have to deploy this on Cloud (Azure or Google App engine). It will be better if I got answers from those people who works in both (.Net and Java). I will appreciate answers from your experiences.
