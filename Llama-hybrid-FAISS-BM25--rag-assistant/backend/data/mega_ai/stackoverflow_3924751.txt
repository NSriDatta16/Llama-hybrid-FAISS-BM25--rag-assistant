Events not firing/or observer not working in magento

I have a module which listens to a few events. It works fine in at least a dozen installations I have tested it on. On on specific installation, a client which I installed it, on Magento version 1.4.1.1, It does not work. When I tested his system, and I fire the events manually, eg Mage::dispatchEvent('..') the observer does listen to them. What should I look into ? I do not have a clue what could be the reason for this.
