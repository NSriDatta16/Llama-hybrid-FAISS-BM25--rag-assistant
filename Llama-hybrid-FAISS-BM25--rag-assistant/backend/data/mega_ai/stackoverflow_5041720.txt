Don't use fb:serverFbml, Facebook has made it very clear they are phasing this technology out and are encouraging developers to re-write their applications as iframes. Facebook will continue to improve the FB.ui({method:'apprequests',...}) code. One issue developers have raised about FB's on page solution for other FB.ui dialogs is the placement on the page. For pages that are more than a screenful, the dialog often appears in an illogical location. The Popup, if used correctly as part of a click event, will display for the majority of users. I've also created a post illustrating the use of the new apprequests method http://af-design.com/blog/2011/02/17/using-facebook-requests-to-promote-a-website/
