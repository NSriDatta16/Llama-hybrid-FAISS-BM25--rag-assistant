I've spent a few years building real estate price regressors, which are known as "AVMs" (Automated Valuation Models). A few comments: Yes, "median absolute percentage error" is both a reasonable metric and one that gets used in practice. (And in an instance of catastrophic acronym failure, "MAPE" can refer either to "Mean" or "Median" absolute percent error.) Measuring "median absolute percentage error" is very strongly related to measuring "median absolute log error", and the latter has some advantages. If you're considering log error, then deviations become symmetric. (This addresses quarague's observation about overestimating or underestimating by 2x.) Implementing this metric should be very easy-- you just take the log() of everything and evaluate the MAE() . The logarithm also suppresses very large outliers (e.g., absurdly expensive mansions), which is one of the problems with examining real estate data. This can have both modeling and numerical stability advantages. (There are also non-arms-length real estate deals, which lead to outliers that are very small, but these are frequently easier to detect.) There are companies that provide AVMs for banks and so forth; there are also companies that exist solely to evaluate the first set of companies. If you're trying to understand standard evaluation methodology in this space, you may want to examine the latter. To get started, maybe check out AVMetrics . (I have no connection with that company, by the way, aside from having read one of their analyses.)
