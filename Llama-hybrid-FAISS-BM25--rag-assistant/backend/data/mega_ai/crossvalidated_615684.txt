Can I decrease the sampling interval and still have accurate results?

A company has been collecting water chemistry data annually for 20+ years to monitor water quality. Now they're wondering if they can decrease their sampling interval to once every 2 or 3 years and still detect exceedances when they occur. What would be the best approach to assess this? My first instinct is to use a Monte Carlo simulation to look at every 2/3 year sampling interval combination in their 20+ year dataset and see how much it deviated from the "true" annual measure, and then calculate how many exceedances it missed detecting. But I understand that a Monte Carlo usually needs 1000's of combinations to run effectively and I would only have 10-20 possible combinations. Is it still possible to determine this with a different analysis? I also thought a Bayesian analysis might be appropriate, but I think that would require a very deep understanding of the interaction between the various water chemistry variables and how their changes affect one another. Or is it more about uncertainty? For instance I can say "If you're sampling annually you have an X% chance of detecting an exceedance if it occurs, if you're sampling every 2 years you have a Y% chance, and if you sample every 3 years you have a Z% chance"?
