As I said here , I really recommand the journal paper by Brook University and IBM Watson Labs in the "Transaction of Storage" about file system benchmarking, in which they present different benchmarks and their strong and weak points: A nine year study of file system and storage benchmarking: A nine year study of file system and storage benchmarking . They give lots of advise how to benchmark a filesystem benchmark. It is not an easy task to do it right. I would say: It is better with multiple disks and multiple machines otherwise I as reviewer would probably have doubt about your evaluation. I really know the problem: I myself have only a few nodes and a few dozen disks available for my research. There are disk simulators, e.g. DiskSim , that maybe can be used for fake disks, but in a distributed setting you probably have to fake the other components (networking, locking, too). It maybe isn't impossible -- simulations are often used on other distributed settings, e.g. sensor networks -- but it is hard to do it in a rigorous way. Edited: Related to books: There isn't any really good book, but here is a short list: UNIX Filesystems: Evolution, Design and Implementation (2003): Older book and not really good, but on of the best I am aware of. Practical Filesystem Design (1999): Gives a nice overview about filesystem design in the 90s. I covers the BeOS filesystem in depth. But both books cover only single node filesystems. A lot of storage courses at storage research labs recommend NFS Illustrated (2000). P.S. And please! Stop moving everything to serverfault where the title contains "file systems"!
