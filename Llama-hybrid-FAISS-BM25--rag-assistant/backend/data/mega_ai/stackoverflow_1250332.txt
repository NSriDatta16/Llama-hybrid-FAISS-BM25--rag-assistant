Hashing passwords for on-disk storage (More details inside)

I need to store hashes of passwords on disk. I am not entirely sure which hash function to use (they all seem somewhat troubled at the moment), but I am leaning towards SHA-256. My plan is to take the user's password and combine it with their user ID, a random user-specific salt, and a universal site-wide salt. Should I concatenate these values together and then hash the single resulting string, or should I hash each separately, concatenate the hashes, and then hash that? Also, does the order (password, user id, user salt, site salt) matter? Can I rearrange them however I like, or is it a bad idea to have something that doesn't change (site salt) or something completely predictable (user id/user salt) first? Thanks.
