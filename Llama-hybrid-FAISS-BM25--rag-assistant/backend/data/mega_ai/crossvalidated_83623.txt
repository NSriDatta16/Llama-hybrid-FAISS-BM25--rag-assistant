I would write the second definition as $y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(X_i\beta, \sigma^2)$ or (as Karl Oskar suggests +1) $y_i|X_i \sim \mathcal{N}(X_i\beta, \sigma^2)$ i.e. the modelling assumption is that the response variable is normally distributed around the regression line (which is an estimate of the conditional mean), with constant variance $\sigma^2$. This is not the same thing as suggesting that $y_i$ are normally distributed, because the mean of the distribution depends on $X_i$. I think I have seen similar formulations to this in the machine learning literature; as far as I can see it is equivalent to the first definition, all I have done is to rexpress the second formulation a little differently to eliminate the $\epsilon_i$'s and the $\hat{y}$'s.
