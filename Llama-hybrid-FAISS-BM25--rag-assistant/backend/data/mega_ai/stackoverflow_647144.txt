You could try something similar to "drag rectangles" on Windows. When you hold down the mouse button on something, you don't start a drag operation until the mouse moves outside a small region around the mouse-down location. Reason being that it's very hard to keep the cursor on the same pixel while clicking. So a first attempt could be (int)e.getX() >= this.mTouchX + DEAD_ZONE and similar for the other case, where DEAD_ZONE is a small integer. This does not deal with turning around in the same stroke, however. You could deal with that by only turning left when the current position is at least DEAD_ZONE pixels to the left of the last position after turning right, and vice versa.
