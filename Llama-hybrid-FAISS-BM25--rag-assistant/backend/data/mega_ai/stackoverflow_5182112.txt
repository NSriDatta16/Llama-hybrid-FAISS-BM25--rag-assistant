What term do you use for manual database changes?

The company I am working for calls manual database changes (ie., writing a SQL update/insert/delete) a "data hammer". While the term makes sense, I have yet to find any other organization or group that calls it by this name. A search here on SO yields no results. How do you refer to manual database changes? Is there a standard term?
