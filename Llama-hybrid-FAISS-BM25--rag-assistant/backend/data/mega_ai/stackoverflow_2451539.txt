I don't see how checking for null is overly verbose. If you're doing the exact same thing everywhere (pulling a node out). You can abstract that out into a single method/function that performs the null-check. That way you won't have a null-check everywhere you are trying to grab a node since the null-check is neatly encapsulated inside the function/method. Otherwise, I think you would have to perform an explicit null-check. There may be other ways to do it, but be careful. There is a fine line between elegant, clever, and hackish. ;)
