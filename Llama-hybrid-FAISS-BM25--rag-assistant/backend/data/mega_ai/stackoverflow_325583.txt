Run-time error 0 when populating a combo box in vb6

Strange error specific to a particular machine... I have a app in which a combo box's text value is set to the path of a document (i.e... cmbAIDFile.Text = clsTonyToolkit.GetSetting("ExportAIDFile",gtypmetadata.gcnnCentral) & "" Forget about all the GetSetting procedure etc, just that it returns a line of text and works fine. This works properly on all machines except one. This particular Vista machine throws the error Run-time error 0 and throws the user out of the program regardless of the ErrorHandling on the procedure. Other Vista machines work fine. Any answers to this confusing issue would be gratefully received. Thanks for your help. The machine is running Vista Business 64 bit. User has the ability to get admin rights through User Account Control which is turned on. Following your prompts I have tried running the app as admin and getting all sorts of strange responses (missing files, dependencies not registered etc). Have uninstalled the app and will try reinstalling. I think shadow copies of the folder might be confusing things too.
