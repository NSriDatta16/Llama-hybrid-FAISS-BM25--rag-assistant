Generating a propensity score for multiple treatment using multinomial logistic regression

I am analyzing data from a representative cohort (>10,000 persons, 10 years follow-up) and I would like to perform a retrospective cohort study comparing the effect of a treatment on the outcomes. Although the population is representative, applying regression models solely might introduce a selection bias because these are historical data and people were assigned to different treatments for different reasons. Certainly controlling my regression models for a full set of covariates should work just fine but still I would like to perform a sensitivity analysis adjusting for a calculated propensity score (regression adjustment rather than matching). However, I would normally calculate the PS with a logit model when the treatment variable is a binary variable, while in this case I have three categories. Would it work just fine to calculate the PS using a multinomial regression model? If not, could you suggest any other way (I use Stata as statistical software)? Thanks a lot
