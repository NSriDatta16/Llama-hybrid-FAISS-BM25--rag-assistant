Random walk on set of integers

im trying to find the matrix and the graph of this markov chain, let $(Y_i)$ a sequence of iid RV in $\mathbb{Z}$ and identically distributed, let $Y_0$ be independent of $(Y_i)$ -idk why they said this could someone explain its effect- now define $X_0 = Y_0$ and $X_n = \sum_{i=0}^n Y_i$ i proved that $(X_n)$ is a markov chain because it only depends on the previous state using $X_{n+1} = X_n + Y_{n+1}$ now im very confused on how to look at the transition matrix of such markov chain . EDIT: from what i've seen of nicolas proposition , yes thats an infinite walk over the set of integers, but what i dont understand is: by definition the transition matrix is : $(p_{ij})_{i,j \in \mathbb{Z}}$ but since this is an infinite walk the matrix is of infinite dimension?! this is extremely new to me
