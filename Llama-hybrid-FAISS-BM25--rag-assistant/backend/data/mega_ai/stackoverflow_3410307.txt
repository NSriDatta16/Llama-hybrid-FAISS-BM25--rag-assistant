jQuery draggable: access the being-dragged element on drag start

I need to modify the element when as soon as it starts being dragged. The 'start' callback takes two arguments, only the first of them seems to be usable for me. The deal is that I'm using helper: 'clone' which makes event.originalTarget to point only the "original" element, not the new one (which is in fact the one being dragged). Any solutions? Thanks, m.
