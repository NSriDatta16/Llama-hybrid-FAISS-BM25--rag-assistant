In gereral, there are four ways one can "connect" neural networks (depending on you application at hand) as described in Combining Artificial Neural Networks, Sharkey et al. : In the cooperative mode, there are various ways in which one can combine the decisions made by different models. One common way is to take the average of the predictions. Other ways are taking the median, or some weighed average of them. In the competitive mode, it is winner-take-all, where the prediction from the best model for that test point is selected. In sequential mode, you classify on coarse classes (i.e. natural objects vs. man made objects), the prediction from this stage would be used to decide what to do next..(i.e. if the model predicts, man-made objects, one can have a classifier to do fine grained classification). Neural networks have lot of hyper-parameters to tune. In the supervisory mode, one can train an neuralnet just to select these hyper-parameters of a "real" neuralnet that is actually trained on your problem at hand. Please dig deeper into the above mentioned article for more details.
