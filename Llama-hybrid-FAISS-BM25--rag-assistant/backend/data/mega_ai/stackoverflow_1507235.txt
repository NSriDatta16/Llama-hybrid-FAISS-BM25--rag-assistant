This question doesn't involve any objective-c features, so the answer is found in the c standard. C99, section §6.7.8, paragraph 10: If an object that has static storage duration is not initialized explicitly, then: ... — if it has arithmetic type, it is initialized to (positive or unsigned) zero; UInt32 (which itself is just uint32_t) is an arithmetic type. Hence, initialized to zero.
