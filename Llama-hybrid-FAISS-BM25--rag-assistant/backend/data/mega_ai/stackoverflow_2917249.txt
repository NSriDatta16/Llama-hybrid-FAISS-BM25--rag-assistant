I would organise all these apps in their own repositories: 1) Your framework code, where you then release constantly different versions: 1.0, 1.1, etc. 2) Web app 1, where you plugin your framework-component version x.y.z 3) Web app 2, where you plugin your framework-component version x.y.z If now WebApp1 needs a new feature, you implement this in your framework-code and then you release a new version, or maybe you first collect some changes which you want then to integrate into your WebApp1 and after that you make a new framework release. With this you can easily say WebApp1 is dependent on the framework code version 1.0 and maybe the WebApp2 is dependent on a newer framework code for example version 1.2. Important is, that you can integrate your framework code as "component" or "plugin" to your webapps. Then you can easily replace the framework code with newer ones. I hope I had understand your question.
