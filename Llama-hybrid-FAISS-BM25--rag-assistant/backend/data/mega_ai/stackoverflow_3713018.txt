iAd: ADBannerViewDelegate methods only called once after viewDidLoad()

I have the following ADBannerViewDelegate implementations: #pragma mark ADBannerViewDelegate Methods - (void)bannerViewDidLoadAd:(ADBannerView *)banner { self.headerView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 94); [self.tableView setTableHeaderView:headerView]; adBannerView.hidden = FALSE; } - (void)bannerView:(ADBannerView *)banner didFailToReceiveAdWithError:(NSError *)error { headerView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 50); [self.tableView setTableHeaderView:headerView]; //hide the ad if it doesnt fill adBannerView.hidden = TRUE; } If an ad is unavailable, I want to shrink my headerview. If there is an ad, I want to expand it. This works fine, when the view loads. However, it seems like these delegate methods stop getting called after the view has loaded. I can possibly run into the following scenario: View A loads, but no iAd is available so headerView is shrunken User goes to View B User comes back to View A PROBLEM: View A has already loaded, so the headerView is shrunken, but the ADBannerViewDelegate methods aren't called, so I can't check to see if an ad is available How can I make sure these delegate methods get called even after the view has been initially loaded?
