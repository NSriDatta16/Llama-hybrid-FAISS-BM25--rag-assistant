I am not quite sure if I understood your question well, but you could perform Monte Carlo simulations and average the results. As soon as it doesn't change dramatically from one iteration to another, this is probably a good approximation. See the example bellow, in R: minVector=matrix() meanMinVector=matrix() nIter = 800 allNumbers = runif(100,min=0, max=10) for (ii in c(1:nIter)){ nSample = sample(allNumbers,10) minVector = c(minVector,min(nSample)) meanMinVector = c(meanMinVector,mean(minVector, na.rm = TRUE)) } plot(meanMinVector, type="l") See bellow that the value converges well with few hundreds iterations: Please, let me know if my answer was useful for you :)
