How to generate subsets with the highest T-value

I following this data mining project. It explains how to do it but I don't understand the T-value part. "For each class, generate subsets with top 2,4,6,8,10,12,15,20,25, and 30 top genes with the highest T-value" So I calculate the T-value like this: $$(Avg1 - Avg2) / \sqrt(Stdev1^2/N1+ Stdev2^2/N2)$$ $Avg1$ is the average for one class across the gene sample and $Avg2$ is the average for the other 4 classes. $Stdev1$ is the standard deviation for one class and $Stdev2$ is the standard deviation for the other classes. $N1$ is the number of samples that have the class whose $T-value$ we are interested in, and $N2$ is the number of samples that does not have the $T-value$ that we are interested in. How do I use that T-value to create those subsets? The bold values in the data represent Average and Stdev per column.
