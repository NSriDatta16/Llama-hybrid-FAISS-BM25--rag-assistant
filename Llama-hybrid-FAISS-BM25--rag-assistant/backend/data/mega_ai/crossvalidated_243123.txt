How do I choose the Natural Actor Critic weights dimensions?

I am trying to apply the natural actor critic algorithm described in Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning by Csaba Szepesv√°ri. I want to use it for the MountainCar-v0 environment of OpenAI. As function approximation, I use tile coding right now, but I don't know how to use it along with the actor. If I use a neural network, how should I set the dimensions of the weights such that the update w = w + beta * theta and all the rest works? I don't really know yet how theta and w are related to eachother.
