On Windows to could add C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.1.36\bin\ to you Environment Variables path. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable That way you could just call shell_exec('mysql ...'); Alernatively you could not use mysqldump, you could use SELECT INTO OUTFILE in MySQL although you'd need to do it for each table. Not as elegant as mysqldump.
