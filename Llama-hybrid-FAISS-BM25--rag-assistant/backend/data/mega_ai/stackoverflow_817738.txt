If its purely the compilation time then often the most efficient approach is to hit the website yourself after the recycle. Make a call at regular intervals to ensure that it is you who receives the 15 second delay not your client. I would be surprised if that is all compilation time however (depending on hardware) - do you have a lot of static instances of classes? Do they do a lot of work on start-up? Either with tracing or profiling you could probably quite quickly work out where the start-up time was spent. As to why keeping a process around is a bad idea, I believe its due to clear-up. No matter how well we look after our data or how well behaved the GC is, there is a good clear-up performed by restarting the process. Things like fragmentation can go away and any other resource issues that build up over time are cleared down. Therefore it is quite a bad idea to keep a server process running indefinitely.
