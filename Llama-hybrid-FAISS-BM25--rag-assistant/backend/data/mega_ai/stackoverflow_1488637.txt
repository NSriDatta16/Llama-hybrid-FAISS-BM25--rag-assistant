Can I ask for some more details? What is the real requirement? Is it that the session time out within x seconds of a user logging in? In that case, you you can use the getCreationTime() method on the HTTPSession object http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpSession.html#getCreationTime%28%29 remainingTimeInMilliseconds = System.currentTimeMillis - session.getCreationTime() OR Is the requirement for the session to time out after x seconds of inactivity? If so then do a remainingTimeInMilliseconds = System.currentTimeMillis - session.getLastAccessedTime()
