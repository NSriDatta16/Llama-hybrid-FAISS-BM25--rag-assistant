I have resolved the issue. Actually when i imported the project there was drawable folder along with drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi and drawable-ldpi folder.It was causing the conflict. I have removed the drawable folder and put the image which was in it to the hdpi,mdpi & ldpi folders. Now when i run the application, it works as expected.
