Obfuscation differs from encryption in that obfuscated code must remain legal IL. This means that with enough effort, any obfuscated app can be cracked. However, some original information cannot be recovered (renaming is, for example, lossy - there is no way to get original names - however, you can still learn alot about an app even without the original names). Renaming is just ONE obfuscation transform - there are MANY. Control flow (reorganizing the instruction stack) has nothing to do with renaming - so - it does not break when reflection is used for example. Control flow is good for breaking machine reverse engineering (like from reflector) renaming is good for defeating human inspection (and neither are bulletproof). Here is a link to a more thorough article on transforms, their side effects, why you would use one or more (and why you might not).
