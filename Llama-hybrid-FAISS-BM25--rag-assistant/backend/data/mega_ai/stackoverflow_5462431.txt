Problems with dynamic content in jquery Booklet (builtbywill)

The problems I'm having are several-fold. Firstly, this is only working in firefox at the moment. Chrome doesn't even give me an error and doesn't give me the alert in 'after'. Secondly, and this is the main problem, the code below is working to a degree; it gets as far as the first call on 'after' but I think I need to refresh the booklet somehow to realise that there are new divs in there. Basically what I'm asking is can someone tell me why it isn't working in chrome and is there a way to refresh booklet so that it realises that there are two new divs? If you need more code from me please let me know. Thanks in advance The jquery code $(function() { $('#booklet').booklet({ height: 600, width: 960, manual: false, pageNumbers: false, pagePadding: 0, after: function(opts){ var btn = $('#next-page').attr('className'); //alert(btn); $.get('../../ajax/getAjaxBrand/'+btn, function(data) { alert(data); $('#next-page').replaceWith(data); }); } }); }); The returned HTML HOLLYWOOD JUSTICE 6 x 30MINUTE EPISODES Hollywood Justice takes an in-depth look at Hollywood's famously challenged.
