Mixed models: predict random intercept with partial data

I have a dataset with growth data for teens between 12 and 18 years old, where I want to predict throwing speed for all ages using a couple of other predictors. These predictors have been collected in the dataset for all participants at all times, but in practice they are time dependent and thus cannot be taken into account for future real-life prediction. I have longitudinal data on speed, height, strength and weight for these kids ranged 12 to 18 (all of which change (and grow) over time for each individual), and although unfortunately few measurements for the ages below 13, I have many measurements for the ages 13-18. As per request a short overview of the data: > str(dat) 'data.frame': 390 obs. of 12 variables: $ PPnumber : Factor w/ 126 levels "","FB_001","FB_002",..: 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 ... $ Height : num 170 172 174 NA 176 ... $ ageyrs : num 13.6 14.2 14.6 15.1 15.6 ... $ weight : num 64.1 69.1 74.2 NA 74.3 73.2 77.6 78.5 49 49.8 ... $ AverageBallSpeed: num 61.6 68 65.8 71.2 71.4 ... $ F_ER_DA : int 102 128 138 126 154 185 150 186 115 103 ... etc However due to the fact that the study only lasted 3 years I have no data from 12 all the way up to 18, but I had hoped that multilevel or mixed effects modelling would overcome this limitation, as it also uses the group-level data when predicting for the individual. A workaround for using the time-dependent variables might be to include the other variables in the intercept; $$\begin{array}{l} Y_{ij} &=& \beta_{0j} + \beta_{2}a_{ij} + \beta_{3}a_{ij}^2 + \delta_{ij},\label{eq:intcurve} \\ \beta_{0j} &=& \gamma_{00} + \boldsymbol{X_{1j}}^T\boldsymbol{\beta_{1j}} + \varepsilon_{0j}, \nonumber \end{array}$$ (Where $Y_{ij}$ is the speed I'm trying to predict and $a_{ij}$ the age at point $i$ and participant $j$ , $\boldsymbol{X_{0j}}^T$ would be the other predictors such as height and strength at measurement 1). Although here only the first measurement would be used, I woud like to be able to use the first $n$ measurements to compute the random intercept, and then disregard these variables and plot a prediction over time of the speed. I have two questions regarding this method: Is this a valid way to define a multilevel/mixed effects model? I have little experience with these models and although it seems fine to me, perhaps this is not the best "workaround" to apply. Would this same method also work for a random slope model? If so, is there a method for applying this in lme? I've tried the following: MLMfull but I believe this means that the other variables are taken into account for the later predictions as well, and I would like to be able to predict future speeds without knowing the height of the participant at a certain future age. Edit : Although my initial questions have not been answered, I have gotten some helpful advice for my problems, for which my gratitude. I'll mark one of the answers for now, but if anyone can still answer my two questions above, I would be much obliged.
