Add a drop callback to the droppables and apply the style changes necessary. Because right now the item is still positioned absolutely it will not recognize your center css. Something like this: WRONG (see below) drop: function(ev, ui) { $(this).css({position: 'static'}) } I updated the fiddle . I was wrong before. this is the droppable, and ui.draggable is the draggable. drop: function(ev, ui) { $(this).append(ui.draggable.css('position','static')) }
