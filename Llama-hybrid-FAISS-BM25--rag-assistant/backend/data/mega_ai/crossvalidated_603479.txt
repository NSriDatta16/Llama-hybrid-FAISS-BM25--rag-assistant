YOU DO NOT All you need are values to compare. How you create the values will influence how you interpret the ROC curve or the AUC, but the calculation does not know or care about their origin. For instance... library(pROC) set.seed(2023) N The reason so many tutorials first create a model is because most people care about these curves for model evaluation, so it makes sense to do some kind of model evaluation in the tutorial. Note, however, that a model does not have to be a machine learning or statistical model. A model could be showing an x-ray to a physician and asking for a probability that the patient is sick, which seems to be along the lines of what your "predictive test" is.
