The DevEx Grid is awesome, though I've got no experience with the UltraWinDataGrid. Would I be willing to spend my own money on DevEx stuff? Yes, and I do - I've been using their stuff from way back in the Delphi days (maintained Delphi subscription for about 5 years, coming up 4 years for the .NET subscription now). They've got fabulous support and a very strong product line. Edit: on the basis of what I've seen at the Infragistics site for their NetAdvantage WinGrid, the DevEx Grid can do all that and more. All the filtering, sorting, grouping and custom layout stuff you're probably used to, plus Card Layouts amd more. Plus, DevEx have a no-questions money-back guarantee if you're not happy with their stuff. Honestly, I'm not a DevEx shill, just a really happy customer who - yes - pays his own money for their stuff :)
