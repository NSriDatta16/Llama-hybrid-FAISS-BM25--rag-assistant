You can keep two variables in memory: The running average $\mu$ of the difference between the two series at every time-step so far. A running average based on the last $w_{s}$ values. Now at each time-step you update $\mu$ and $w_{s}$ until you detect that the difference between $\mu$ and $w_{s}$ becomes to large (use a threshold to determine sensitivity) which indicates a deviation. As soon as you detect this you stop updating $\mu$ and for the next time-steps keep on updating $w_{s}$, as soon as the $w_{s}$ becomes in range of the $\mu$ again you can start updating the $\mu$ again. This approach is easily implementable, requires few parameters to tune and should thus be used when you rapidly want to get some results.
