How do you get Count R2 in R (with missing data)?

I am doing binary logistic regression in R and I need to calculate the Count R squared for various model specifications. Count R2 is the number of correctly predicted observations using the model divided by the total number of observations. It measures how well the model predicts the correct value of the dependent variable, using known values. I'm planning to use the model for prediction, so the percent of observations that are predicted correctly would be really useful for me. Creating a classification table is difficult because I have missing data, so the fitted table and the original table have different numbers of records. I'm pretty inexperienced with R, so I don't know if there's a straightforward way to get around that. My specific question is: Is there a command in R to get the Count R2, (and better yet, the adjusted count R2)? If not, is there an easy way to get R to put the predicted probabilities and the original dependent variable in a table together, when there are different numbers of records? This would allow me to calculate the Count R2 myself.
