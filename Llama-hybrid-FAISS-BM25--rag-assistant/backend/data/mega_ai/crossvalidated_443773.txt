I am certainly not an expert in cancer research, but have read that genomic markers (also known as genetic markers) have been studied with respect to their relationship to various diseases. To unmask the true strength of such genetic markers, I suspect, one might want to control for exposure to agents likely associated with cancer especially relating to geographic locations. The latter can serve as proxies for areas of elevated pollution either in the air, water or the food stock, or places noted for fresh fruits (like mangos,...) believed to be beneficial to the immune system. Other control factors could be age (as a nonlinear variable to proxy the general strength of the immune system). Also, income levels, may be a proxy for healthcare access and a possible indicator for those starting point with better health. Also, my research on chemotherapy and survival rates, revealed a positive benefit that may arise from one's ancestry. For example, ancestors of people who endured long ocean voyages seeking new habitats (a darwinian survival of the fittest) apparently have better cancer survival rates following chemotherapy. Controlling for such factors may make the statistical process of assessing the impact of genetic markers more accurate (and also may allow MORE such factors to be included in the model). Here are some studies mentioning some of the controlling factors .
