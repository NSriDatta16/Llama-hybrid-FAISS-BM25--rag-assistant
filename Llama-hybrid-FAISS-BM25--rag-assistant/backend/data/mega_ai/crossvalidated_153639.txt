What is the meaning characterizing a model as "conditional mean"

I've been going through time series material of late, trying to re-invent myself as a practitioner in the field. Until I got to the point of actually trying to Matlab some models, I had never run across the characterization of models as "conditional mean". This term is pervasive throughout the entire documentation set; from what I can tell, it carries a particular significance in terms of modelling. I haven't been able to wrap my head around what this significance is. It is explained as the expression of the expectation of a variable of interest, conditional upon the values of other variables. All the time series models that I've seen (indeed, all regression models) fall under this definition. So I'm not sure how the term classifies models of interest, or identifies a subset, or identifies features that have modelling implications. Nothing I've found on line makes it any clearer. Thanks if anyone can provide a clarification, elaboration, or explanation of this. My question arose in the context of Matlab (it just happens to be what I am using), but it is a conceptual question that isn't necessarily tied to Matlab. It has been posted to: What is the meaning characterizing a model as "conditional mean" , https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30406645/what-is-the-meaning-characterizing-a-model-as-conditional-mean , and http://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.soft-sys.matlab/zQK8yScPFkk
