Binary Classification with Imbalanced Target

I have a dataset and my objective is to run a Binary Classification, but my target feature, that is supposed to have "True" and "False", only has "True", as a value. I was wondering, is this kind of data useable or not for Machine Learning in general? I was thinking about using SMOTE (SMOTE is an oversampling technique where the synthetic samples are generated for the minority class), and the generated data of course will have True for the target feature then I change it to False and aggregate them, hence I'll have a balanced target. Is this a reasonable approach, otherwise how can I fix this issue?
