"Predict how many points a player can be expected to have at the end of the season" could be framed as count-based regression problem (not time series). A player will have a collection of features (e.g., age, position, team, minutes plays). A machine learning model can learn how to weight to the features to make a prediction. In this case, the prediction is the number of goals by the end of the season (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, â€¦). The data and features might have time component but the model does not have to be time-series.
