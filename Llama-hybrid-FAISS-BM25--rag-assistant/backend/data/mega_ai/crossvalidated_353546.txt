1) in this case X and Y are properties of the real event as you call it. The output of the model is usually written $\hat{y}$, and you would get $$ \hat{y}=f(X) . $$ 2) This depends on the machine learning tool you use. For example with a OLS Regression, you will always get the same fitted $\hat{Y}$ for the same input and thus also the same $\epsilon$ because $$ \epsilon=Y-\hat{Y} . $$ If you use methods with stochastic features (for example shuffling in NN), the output can indeed be different.
