How do I model the chaotic behaviour(like the sequence from Lorenz attractor) in a stochastic sense?

Recently, I encountered a difficulty of prediction Lorenz attractor by using a GRU. (See the code from here .) I think that it's inevitable since the original system, i.e. Lorenz equation, is too sensitive to the perturbation,which can cause the random behaviour and the difficulty of prediction. On the other hand, some theories for modeling the probability of dataset by using neural networks have been developed in the Machine learning area, like GANs, VAE, etc.. So, let me pose this question here: Can the chaotic behaviour(like the sequence from Lorenz attractor) be characterised by an ML technique in a stochastic sense? More precisely, given a sequence from Lorenz attractor: $y_{1} \cdots y_{N}$ , can we get the probability of $p(y_{1}, ..., y_{N})$ based on a neural network?
