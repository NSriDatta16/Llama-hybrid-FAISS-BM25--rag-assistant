I think Linear regression is more feasible than time series analysis here, becasuse I think you have lots of categorical variables, and time series analysis works better with purely numeric data. Many of your categorical vriables are likely to be NA, and many might have high cardinality and thus might not be suited for one-hot-encoding. So you have to choose an algorithm that can handle NA values well and can deal with many unique categorical variables turned into indicator variables. You can also handle this with appropriate preprocessing. Also you didn't tell use whether your dataset has sub-daily (e.g. hourly) or daily resolution. I think daily resolution is too coarse (weather may change several times per day), guest arrivals may peak in the morning or evening. So time series analysis shines when you want to determine, say, the periodicity (which is likely on an hourly scale for the workdays most restaurants), but your variables seem to be on the daily level and less predictable.
