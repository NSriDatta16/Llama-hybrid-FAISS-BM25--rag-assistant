There also is a followup / rebuttal to that comment... It's linked at the original site, in "TECHNICAL COMMENTS": Response to Comment on "Clustering by Passing Messages Between Data Points" Brendan J. Frey and Delbert Dueck If you went to the original site instead of spammy ResearchGate, you would have seen it cross referenced. Roughly this comment says that for larger data sets, AP works faster and yields better results in their experiments. Other than that: try it out. Every data set is different, and there is no one-size-fits-all clustering algorithm. There are hundreds, because none is the ultimate clustering algorithm.
