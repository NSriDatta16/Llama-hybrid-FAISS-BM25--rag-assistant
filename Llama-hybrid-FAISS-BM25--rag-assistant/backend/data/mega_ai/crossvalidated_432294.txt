How to do principal component regression for repeated measures?

I have between-subject repeated measures data. I want to select the parameters for my regression model. PCR /PCA is one option to reduce dimensionality. How can I do this in the case of a repeated measures mixed linear model ( aka random effect model)? As my data points are not independent, using PCR or PCA might be wrong?
