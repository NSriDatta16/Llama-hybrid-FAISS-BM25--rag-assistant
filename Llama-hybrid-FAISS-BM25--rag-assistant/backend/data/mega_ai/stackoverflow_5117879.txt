Why does Magento's translations fail after an unsuccessful payment transaction?

we are using magento with onestepcheckout module in our shopping system. But when the payment process fails and when we get an error about payment, not all but some translations fails on the checkout page. Has anybody face this problem before. I will be very happy if there is an solution. P.S. I can solve the situation by hard-coding the translations. But I dont want to use this method. Thank you
