When you are dealing with many class problems like this, some of the classes will likely be not well represented. If you are really interested in getting these "not-well-represented" classes right, aka increasing the number of True Positives but generating a lot of False Positives, you may need to tune your model. In Random Forest you will need to play with class weights or sampling strategies that up sample the not well represented classes. K-Nearest-Neighbors is another potential classifier.
