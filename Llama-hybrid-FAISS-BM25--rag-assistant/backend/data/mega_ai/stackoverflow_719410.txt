Finding duplicate iPhone apps

How do I most efficiently determine whether my idea for an iPhone app has been done already? iTunes's search isn't great for this purpose, and the websites I've seen covering iPhone apps are not comprehensive in their coverage. (Perhaps I just haven't found THE website that does it.) I'm not yet signed up in the iPhone developer program; perhaps this search tool is in that walled garden.
