The MyISAM storage engine doesn't support foreign key constraints. The constraint is parsed but silently ignored. To fix your problem use the InnoDB engine instead (for both tables). CREATE TABLE ( ... ) ENGINE = InnoDB ... ; Instead of dropping your tables and recreating them you can also change the storage engine: ALTER TABLE myDB.app_info ENGINE = InnoDB; ALTER TABLE myDB.tab_info ENGINE = InnoDB; After changing the engine you will need to add the foreign key constraint again.
