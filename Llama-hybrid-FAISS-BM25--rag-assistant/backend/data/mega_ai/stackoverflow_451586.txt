asp.net is the first place I go. Scott Gu's blog has a good Linq to SQL series as well. http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/09/07/linq-to-sql-part-9-using-a-custom-linq-expression-with-the-lt-asp-linqdatasource-gt-control.aspx I'm sure someone will mention that you might want to take a look at Linq to Entities as Linq to SQL isn't going to be getting much attention from Microsoft in the future.
