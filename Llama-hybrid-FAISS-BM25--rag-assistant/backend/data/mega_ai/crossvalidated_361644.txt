does independence relation hold for autocovariance in a time series context

I've been wondering the following for a while because it comes up on the dsp exchange site that I also belong to. Maybe it's obvious but not to me. Background: Clearly, If $x$ and $y$ are independent random variables, then it is well known and pretty easy to show that $var(\alpha_1 x + \alpha_2 y ) = \alpha_1^2 \times var(x) + \alpha_2^2 \times var(y) $. Actual Question: Does the same relation hold for autocovariances of the same variables in a time series context ? By this I mean that, if the same two variables are still independent, then does $cov(\alpha_1 x + \alpha_2 y )$ at lag $i$ = $ \alpha_1^2 \times $ ( autocov($x$) at lag i ) $ + \alpha_2^2 \times $ ( autocov($y$) at lag i) ? Thanks. Any references or useful notes are also appreciated.
