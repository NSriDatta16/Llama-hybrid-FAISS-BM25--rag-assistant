Firefox 3.5.3 Windows + Flash + swfobject wmode problem

I'm having issues with Firefox 3.5.3 Windows embedding Flash using wmode. If I set the wmode parameter to 'transparent' or 'opaque' Firefox 3.5.3 Win XP (Flash player 10.0.32.18 r32) completely fails to embed the movie, but it works in everything else, including IE on the same machine and the same FF in Mac OS. Can anyone help please? I put together a test page of this issue here. If it works you should see a video player and streaming movie. http://mutualsforum.wanderingbear.co.uk/flashtest.html Thanks
