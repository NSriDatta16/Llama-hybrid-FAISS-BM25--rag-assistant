Using statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose, my trend line does not cover the entire time period of the data. any words of advice?

I am trying to do a time series decomposition using this 1 article as a guide--it uses statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose. However, the trend line I get does not extend to the beginning or end of my data's time period, it only sits in the middle. is this expected? any ideas around what I may be doing incorrectly? I would appreciate any direction!
