Your gradient is very strong in all your layers for your first steps. It seems that your model is learning very fast first (normal with gradient learning), and then only the last layer continue to learn to be able to fix the last issues of your model. So if your model doesn't learn, you have an issue of vanishing gradient (conv too deep or gradient step too low). Or maybe an issue with your dataset if he is able to learn all (overfitting) in some steps. Maybe check your batch too, if your batch is too big it will average too much your weights (and your gradients won't change after the first steps) I am still new in deep learning, but it seems to be because of these reasons, according to my low knowledge yet.
