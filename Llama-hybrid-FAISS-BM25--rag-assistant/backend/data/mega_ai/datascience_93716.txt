Which output of a BiLSTM layer should be used for classification

I am trying to implement a BiLSTM layer for a text classification problem and using PyTorch for this. self.bilstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, lstm_hidden_dim//2, batch_first=True, bidirectional=True) lstm_out, (ht, ct) = self.bilstm(embeddings) Now, in some examples (I came across in internet) people are passing ht through Linear layer and generating output. Some people are using lstm_out for the same. Now I have two questions - For a text classification which one should be used? If I use ht , for bidirectional=True it is of the shape (2, m, n) - but we need (1, m, n) - what is the best way to convert it?
