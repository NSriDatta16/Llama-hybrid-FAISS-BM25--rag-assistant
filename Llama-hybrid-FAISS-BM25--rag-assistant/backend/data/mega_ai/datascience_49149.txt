Here's a one-dimensional problem that should be impossible for logistic regression: Generate x uniformly on [0, 10] Let y = sin(2 * pi * x) If you want a classification problem define y_disc as: 0 if y > 1/sqrt(2) 1 if 1/sqrt(2) > y > -1/sqrt(2) 2 if y This is non-linear, so logistic regression should do poorly. Further, if you decide to put higher powers of x into your logistic regression classifier, I think you'll need a lot of powers to accurately represent the Taylor series near 10. If fact, you could try adding a small noise term to y before discretizing - I suspect that will result in your logistic regressor overfitting long before it's able to accurately approximate the behavior near x=10.
