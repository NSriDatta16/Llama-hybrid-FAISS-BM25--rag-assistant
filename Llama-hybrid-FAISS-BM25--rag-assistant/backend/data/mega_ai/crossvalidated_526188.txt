Cross Correlation between highly unevenly spaced time series

I have the following problem. I have 2 time series, one on a yearly basis (2010 - 2020) and one on a daily basis (01/01/2010 - 31/12/2020). I looking for methods how I can investigate the correlation between those 2 series since they are highly unevenly spaced. Does anyone has suggestions or is this even possible in some way?
