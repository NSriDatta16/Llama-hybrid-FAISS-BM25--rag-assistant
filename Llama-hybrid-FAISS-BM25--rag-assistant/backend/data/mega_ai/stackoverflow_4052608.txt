Php file download through ajax request

I am trying to download file through ajax request. I have below code in my php file to dowload $filedata="File data here" header("Content-type: application/octet-stream"); header("Content-Disposition:attachment; filename=report.txt"); header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary'); header("Pragma: public"); header("Expires: 0"); echo $filedata; It giving me ajax response but not providing file download dialog box. Is any solution? Thanks in advance.
