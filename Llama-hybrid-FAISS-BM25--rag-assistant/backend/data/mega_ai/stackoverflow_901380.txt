Good Gantt-diagram software?

I have multiple projects on my own, each one with a deadline and a (personal) estimate of the time that I should invest to get the thing done. At a particular time I can be involved in multiple projects. What I need is a software that lets me plan and display a "timeline": a line for each project that extends when I've to push efforts into it. Did you know something that does something similar? I remember that this is a technique used in Software Engineering, but I don't remember the name... EDIT Thanks to duffymo , I know that I want a Gantt diagram manager :) Related: Which Gantt chart/Project management tool would you recommend for linux?
