The mentioned steps are correct. Feature scaling (min/max, mean/stdev) is for numerical values so it doesn't matter to be before or after label encoding; but keep it in mind that you SHOULD NOT do scaling on encoded categorical features. For dimensionality reduction or feature selection, you need to have numerical values; so you should do them after label encoding.
