The solution is somewhat related to what Adrian Regan sais. If you push another element onto the vector-of-nodes in the "createChildren()" method, there's a fair chance that the vector needs to resize itself. When it does that it copies any existing elements over to the newly allocated storage. So, the first time this happens it is copying the inital value of node 0 with value 0. The compiler will generate a default copy constructor which does a bitwise copy. However, just implementing a copy constructor is not going to help since you will always lose the updated value of node 0. h.
