Is Kalman filtering a suitable approach to predict data from a set of/or a single feature?

I have multiple repeats of a time series that I would like to use to train a model to predict future repeats. The time series contains feature data (easy to measure) and target data (hard to measure). I would like to use the feature data to predict the target data. Is Kalman filtering a suitable approach for this? I would be interested in doing this using python.
