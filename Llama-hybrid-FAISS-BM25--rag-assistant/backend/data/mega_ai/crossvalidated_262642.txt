Neural network selecting features,layers and neurons

So I'm experimenting with a feed forward network, I'm trying to learn how to use neural networks, and I'm some what confused when it comes to selecting features, hidden layers and neurons. I have 2 datasets that I'm playing around with. Both datasets have 113 features where dataset 1 has about 630 datapoints and dataset 2 has around 3500 datapoints. The package that I'm using is caret, mostly because of the abundance of neural network types and settings.
