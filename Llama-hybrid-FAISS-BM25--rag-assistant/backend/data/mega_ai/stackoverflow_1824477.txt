You really need to provide much more information: how much capacity do you need? what costs are acceptable? what physical form factor do you need? what lifetime do you want? If your storage needs aren't particularly huge and you can deal with the cost, There are battery-backed SRAM parts (up to at least 2 Megabytes per part) that are as fast as RAM (that's what they are) and have no limit on number of writes. But they cost a lot more than flash. You could also get a drive with a SATA interface that's populated with DRAM.
