If you want store the results using as little space as possible you could probably do something like this (pseudocode): integer = ( sum(all_values) / all_values.count().float ) * 100; This will give you the value 352 for an average of 3.52 so you can store it as an integer (byte would be big enough I guess), and just divide it by 100 when you want to display it. On the other hand if you don't care about the storage of the average value, using float values is maybe faster. (Test both to see what's actually fastest on your system.)
