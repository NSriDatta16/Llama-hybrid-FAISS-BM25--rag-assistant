Presenting results of SVM model following LOOCV

I have a small dataset of 60 points and used an SVM regression model (with linear kernel) to train a model to predict $\bf{y}$ from two features, $\bf{x_{1}}$ and $\bf{x_{2}}$ . I used LOOCV to provide an estimate of the model's performance. In addition to reporting the statistics (e.g. MAE, $r^{2}$ ) from the LOOCV procedure, I'd like to make a parity plot of $\bf{y_{pred}}$ vs. $\bf{y_{actual}}$ . My question is: what are the values of $\bf{y_{pred}}$ that I report? Are they the values obtained from the LOOCV procedure, or are they the predicted values obtained by training the model on all the data points. I imagine, an ideal scenario, the best option would be to have a separate dataset to test the model on, but I do not have the luxury of additional data.
