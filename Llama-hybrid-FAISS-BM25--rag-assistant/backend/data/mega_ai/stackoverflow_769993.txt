Are you running this target as part of a Team Build (on the build server) or as a Desktop build (i.e. locally)? The BuildUri property is normally populated passed in to the build by the build agent when it is triggering a new team build. In your script the Uri is used to tell TFS what build detail to attach the build step to. If you are running a desktop build then this will be empty unless you pass the property in on the command line.
