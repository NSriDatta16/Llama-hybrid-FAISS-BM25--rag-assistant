I think your stronger argument will be in maintenance. I designed the intranet for the last major company I worked for. I created page templates that have valid markup and used conditional comments to target stylesheets for different versions of IE. The site was launched 2 years ago; it looks the same in Firefox 2 & 3, Safari 2 & 3, and IE 6, 7, & 8! No markup or style changes were necessary. This means that when the organization finally updates to IE 7, the web developer team will not have to do anything. Big win in reduced maintenance costs.
