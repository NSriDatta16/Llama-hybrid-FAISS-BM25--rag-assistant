PCA - How to show that linear combination has maximum variance

Let $$x_1,..., x_n$$ be random variables with a covariance matrix $\Sigma$ . $ a^Tx:=\sum_{i=1}^na_ix_i $ $ \sum a_i^2=1 $ how do I show that the linear combination of 1 and 2 has maximal variance when a is an eigenvector of $\Sigma$ with maximal eigenvalue? I was reading all day trying to understand the steps and I'm sure there is something that I'm missing
