How to call a specific, unknown Python object attribute?

I'm working to create a simple Python script that will ultimately tell you how many blog entries were posted in a given month, and the pyblog app is proving very helpful. However, when I create the blog object, I don't know how to access it's various attributes. I can print them all out by printing one item from the dictionary, as shown (in excerpts) below: print blog.get_recent_posts(1) [{'mt_keywords': 'Storage in 2010, Storage, Twitter', 'permaLink': 'http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/IT-watch-blog/cream-of-the-twitter-crop-storage-edition/', 'wp_slug': 'cream-of-the-twitter-crop-storage-edition', 'description': ' Here they are, this month\'s specialized top 10 Twitter accounts.
