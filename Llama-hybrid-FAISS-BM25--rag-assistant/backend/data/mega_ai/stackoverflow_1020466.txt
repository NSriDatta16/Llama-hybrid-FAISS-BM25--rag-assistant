We have over 75 Gigs of logs a day zipped. We currently don't keep more than a months worth of logs for obvious reasons but we're looking into solutions including a DFS so we can easily add more. Storage is cheap but you always have to think about the "what ifs". At $0.15/month/gig you're only talking about $8/month to store on S3 and then you don't have to worry about loosing anything. I suggest you look into that. Drives are cheap too, if you're that concerned pick up some cheap $50 drives and copy the logs to that and store them at a friends/relatives house. :-)
