XSL is meant to transform an XML into another XML, not to build interactive editors. What you want is an XML editor. Also, editing XML via drag'n'drop or by clicking buttons and filling out popup dialogs will be very tedious. Most modern XML editors work like normal text editors but they offer type-ahead and code completion plus an overview and short code templates. If you want to build something like that for the web, read up on AJAX and start with CKEditor as your editor.
