I have come across a very similar problem where I have to use IPCW in order to calculate the weights to account for censored data. I have found this article that might be useful for you, it talks in depth about IPCW. "Adapting machine learning techniques to censored time-to-event health record data: A general-purpose approach using inverse probability of censoring weighting" By David M. Vock & Others https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046416000496 Also, if you have managed to solve your problem, it would be nice to hear what approach you took in the end.
