Have you tried defining the default_scope a lambda ? The lambda bit that defines the options get evaluated every time the scope is used. class Page "organization_id = #{Thread.current[:organization]}"} end # yadda yadda end It's essentially doing your third option, by working in tandem with your before filter magic. But it's a little more aggressive than that, kicking in on every single find used on the Page model. If you want this behaviour for all models you could add the default_scope to ActiveRecord::Base, but you mention a few being a couple of joins away. So if you go this route, you'll have to override the default scopes in those models to address the joins.
