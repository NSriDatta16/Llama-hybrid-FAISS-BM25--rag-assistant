Population vs sample variance

This is perhaps a very basic question, but I am a bit confused. I have a time series of day some time varying data, say the amount of sunlight as the day passes. I bucket the data in say 10 bins say according to just time, so later bins occur later in time and calculate the variance of each of the bins. Is there a relationship between the calculated variances of the 10 bins and the overall population variance (variance of the whole data set)?
