iphone: Sending multitouch from the device to the simulator?

I need to record a video of a multitouch game I'm working on, and I'd like to record it from the simulator. My idea was to send touches from the device to the simulator (like this project does with the accelerometer). Just by googling I haven't found anything like that, but before I start implementing it I thought I'd ask here if anyone knows about an already existing solution. Just to be clear, I do need full multitouch (up to 5 fingers). The pinch and drag that are available on the simulator are not enough.
