AFAIK log shipping and replication would probably be better suited the other way around. Log shipping is scheduled synchronization, therefor replication would be better suited for manual switching because the backup-server would be as up to date as it could be unless you had any communication-problem (however, log shipping would have the same issue). offline-data isn't as sensitive to delays as a backup-server, but personally I don't really see the need for log-shipping at all, I can't see when it ever would be a more suitable alternative to replication (but it could be that replication wasn't implemented before sql2005) Maybe I'm confusing replication with mirroring, and as a note, mirroring doesn't give you automatic failover, only HA-cluster gives you that functionality, meaning: using atleast SQL server 2005 standard, Windows Enterprise and a shared data-storage (like a SAN).
