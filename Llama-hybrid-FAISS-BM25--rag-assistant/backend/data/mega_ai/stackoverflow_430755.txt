jar resources in jnlp are not signed by the same certificate

I've been working with web start for a couple years now and have experience with signing the jars and what not. I am taking my first attempt at deploying a RCP app with web start and though I have in fact signed all of the jars with the same certificate I keep getting this error: 'jar resources in jnlp are not signed by the same certificate' Has anyone else came across this? If so, any ideas on how to fix?
