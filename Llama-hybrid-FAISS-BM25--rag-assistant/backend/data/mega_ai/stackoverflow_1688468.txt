Microsoft Access required for C# database access on end-user machines?

Silly question, perhaps. I've developed an app on my machine that uses a Microsoft Access database (.mdb) to access certain information and populate a table with monitoring data using OLEDb. The application works fine on my machine, but when I put the release on test machines (without MS Access), it crashes. Interestingly, if I were to launch the application on the testing machine with the database filename just renamed, it loads like it should albeit without the data. I seem to get an UnauthorizedAccessException exception thrown which further clouds my confusion. Both the development machine and the machine I'm testing it on have .NET 3.5 installed. I would expect a barage of 'No's in reply to my question, but what the heck - does the testing machine need to have MS Access installed? Regards
