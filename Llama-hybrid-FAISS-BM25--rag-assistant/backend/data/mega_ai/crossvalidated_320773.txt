auto.arima returns a non-seasonal model even though I am forcing seasonality

Per this post , you can force seasonality in auto.arima by selecting D=1. I have a weekly time series which looks like it might (or might not) have a seasonal component (I have a priori reasons for thinking it might have a seasonal component). Data I tried manually fitting a seasonal model: fit gave an "OK" forecast (see first graph). So I tried improving on it by using auto.arima to find the best model. AutoFit This returned an ARIMA(1,1,1) model, which I then fit using: #fit But this gave worse results than the seasonal model I selected manually (see second graph). So I tried to force seasonality by running: AutoFit But I still get the same ARIMA(1,1,1) model. Why is auto.arima not trying to fit a seasonal model, even why I try to force it? I've also tried: AutoFit and AutoFit
