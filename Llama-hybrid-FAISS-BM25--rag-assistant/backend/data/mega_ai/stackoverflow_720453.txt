I work with a remote development team every day and I can only support other responders in saying that NOTHING beats working face-to-face. You need the subtle cues of body language, facial expression, and the ease of communication when you're physically present such as doodling on a whiteboard. Video conferencing is a close second but the organizational issues are difficult to overcome (meeting rooms, webcams, bandwidth...). Communication through documentation works to some extent, but is often perceived as unnecessary overhead by developers who drank the Agile kool-aid. I try to use the phone, skype, MSN or e-mail as much as possible, but it works better with those people of the team that I've actually worked with in-person for at least a few days.
