It's not very elegant, but you could try the following. Obtain lg a_i from log a_i (divide by log 2 ). Let lg a_i = k + q where k is integer and q is real and 0 >= q >= 1 Get a_i with 2 k pow(2,q) (use bit shifting for 2 k = 1 ). You can speed up pow(2,q) with precomputed tables of limited precision for [0,1] So the whole idea is to leverage a fast power-of-2 function. Hope it helps!
