What does "completely expressive hypothesis space" mean in machine learning?

I understand the term "hypothesis space". A classifier must be represented in some formal language that the computer can handle. Conversely, choosing a representation for a learner is tantamount to choosing the set of classifiers that it can possibly learn. This set is called the hypothesis space of the learner. References A Few Useful Things to Know About ML Chapter 3 of Tom M. Mitchell. Machine Learning (free) uses a term "completely expressive hypothesis space" Decision tree learning is one of the most widely used and practical methods for inductive inference. It is a method for approximating discrete-valued functions that is robust to noisy data and capable of learning disjunctive expressions. This chapter describes a family of decision tree learning algorithms that includes widely used algorithms such as ID3, ASSISTANT, and C4.5. These decision tree learning methods search a completely expressive hypothesis space and thus avoid the difficulties of restricted hypothesis spaces. Their inductive bias is a preference for small trees over large trees. what does that mean here?
