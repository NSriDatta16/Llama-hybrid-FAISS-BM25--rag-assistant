Learning under imbalanced datasets is an active research area in machine learning [1]. Algorithms that have to deal with imbalanced datasets can be categorized into 4 groups: (i) under-sampling, (ii) over-sampling, (iii) combination of over- and under-sampling, and (iv) ensemble learning methods. imbalanced-learn is a Python library that implements some of the aforementioned algorithms, has a simple interface and it is compatible to scikit-learn .
