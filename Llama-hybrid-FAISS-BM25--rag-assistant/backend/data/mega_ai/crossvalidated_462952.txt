With Monte Carlo methods you can approximate integrals that are otherwise very difficult to compute analytically. At each step of a Bayesian procedure you may need to normalize the product of the likelihood times the prior by computing an integral. Example of a basic integration of x^2 in the interval [5,12]. The exact result is 1385/3 = 461.66. You can sample with uniform distribution in [5,12]. You obtain a MC approximation of the integral by computing the mean of the squares of the samples multiplied by 5. More simulations give better results. a=runif(100)*5+7 mean(a^2)*5 [1] 485.4334 a=runif(1000)*5+7 mean(a^2)*5 [1] 462.2768 a=runif(10^8)*5+7 mean(a^2)*5 [1] 461.6724 Monte Carlo methods are also used to summarize the posterior distribution by sampling from it and obtaining highest posterior density regions, mean, mode...
