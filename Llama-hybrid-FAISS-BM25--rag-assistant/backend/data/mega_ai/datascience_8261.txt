With (d=256, n=10) as well as with (d=16000, n=1000) you are under the curse of dimensionality . The essence of the curse (quoted from Wikipedia) nearly all of the high-dimensional space is "far away" from the centre. To put it another way, the high-dimensional unit hypercube can be said to consist almost entirely of the "corners" of the hypercube, with almost no "middle". For an intuitive explanation I also found this IMHO, for your problem with n=10 you can use d IMHO, you should try to reformulate your problem and significantly reduce dimensionality (maybe try to use SVD or PCA). This may automatically solve your problem of noisy data.
