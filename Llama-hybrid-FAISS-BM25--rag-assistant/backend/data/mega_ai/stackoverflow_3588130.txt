Good practice to modify MSDB stored procs?

At work, we've working on SQL Server 2008 now, and my boss seems a little bit paranoid about security, so instead of having people be sysadmin (or whatever they need to be to own/modify jobs) he's been editing stored procs in MSDB (such as sp_update_job) and adding a role to the TSQL that checks for required permissions (such as adding SqlAgentOperatorRole). My gut tells me this is not the right thing to be doing, but I can't find anything online stating it's bad practice, so I'm curious what experienced SQL Server folks have to say on the issue.
