Since this is most likely homework I am going to give you advice rather than source code. Take a look at this page on sorting algorithms . You should choose the correct sorting algorithm based on your requirements. Choosing the wrong algorithm can mean poor performance or unnecessary complexity. Assuming you have only a small number of items and want a simple algorithm then you could look at insertion sort . The Wikipedia page includes pseudocode. This algorithm has O(n^2) performance. If your lists are quite long and you want better performance at the cost of a slightly more complicated algorithm, you could try merge sort . This algorithm has O(n log(n)) performance both average and worst case and is a popular choice in language libraries.
