How to produce several forms for a nested form?

Intro I have an object @organization that has_many :quick_facts Basically, I want to produce a _form for each :quick_fact but with one save button, that saves all of the quick_facts. My two problems: First Problem: My quick_facts are not prepopulated with their information. They only appear as blank for each quick_fact I have. Second Problem A save button appears on every single form My sad sad attempt : - for quick_fact in @organization.quick_facts - fields_for :quick_facts do |f| = f.error_messages :header_message => FORM_ERROR_HEADER_MESSAGE, :message => FORM_ERROR_MESSAGE = f.label :quick_fact, 'QuickFact' %br/ = f.select :quick_fact, QUICK_FACTS, {} %br/ = f.submit 'save', :class => 'button'
