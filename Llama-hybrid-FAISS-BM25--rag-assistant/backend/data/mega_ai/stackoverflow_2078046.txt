Yes, there's a font which contains Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. I'm not sure if there's a way to specify the style of the font though. You can type Japanese straight into an 'NSString' and set the label text, it will show up no problem. **Edit: ** I found this list of fonts on the iPhone, which lists "Hiragino Kaku Gothic ProN W3", a Japanese font. You can find it on the Mac too, it's the standard Japanese font. There's also a bold version. There doesn't seem to be a rounded version, just gothic. http://www.alexcurylo.com/blog/2008/10/05/snippet-available-uifonts/
