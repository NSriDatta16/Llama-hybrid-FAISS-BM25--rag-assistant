I think the crucial part to consider in answering your question is I'm trying to identify the best model to predict the prices of automobiles because this statement implies something about why you want to use the model. Model choice and evaluation should be based on what you want to achieve with your fitted values. First, lets recap what $R^2$ does : It computes a scaled measure based on the quadratic loss function, which I am sure you are already aware of. To see this, define residual $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$ for your i-th observation $y_i$ and the corresponding fitted value $\hat{y}_i$. Using the convenient notation $SSR := \sum_{i=1}^Ne_i^2$, $SST:=\sum_{i=1}^N(y_i - \bar{y})^2$, $R^2$ is simply defined as $R^2 = 1 - SSR/SST$. Second, let us see what using $R^2$ for model choice/evaluation means . Suppose we choose from a set of predictions $\bar{Y}_M$ that were generated using a model $M:M \in \mathcal{M}$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is the collection of models under consideration (in your example, this collection would contain Neural networks, random forests, elastic nets, ...). Since $SST$ will remain constant amongst all the models, if minimizing $R^2$ you will choose exactly the model that minimizes $SSR$. In other words, you will choose $M \in \mathcal{M}$ that produces the minimal square error loss! Third, let us consider why $R^2$ or equivalently, $SSR$ might be interesting for model choice . Traditionally, the square loss ($L^2$ norm) is used for three reasons: (1) It is easier computable than Least Absolute Deviations (LAD, the $L^1$ norm) because no absolute value appears in the computation, (2) it punishes fitted values that are far off from the actual value much more than LAD (in a squared rather than an absolute sense) and thereby makes sure we have less extreme outliers, (3) it is symmetric : Over- or underestimating the price of a car is considered to be equally bad. Fourth (and last), let us see if this is what you need for your predictions. The point that might be of most interest here is (3) from the last paragraph. Suppose you want to take a neutral stance, and you are neither buyer nor seller of a car. Then, $R^2$ can make sense: You are impartial, and you wish to punish deviations to over- or underpricing exactly identically. The same applies if you just want to model the relation between the quantities without wishing to predict unobserved values. Now suppose you are working for a consumer/buyer on a tight budget: In this situation, you might want to punish overestimation of the price in a quadratic sense, but underestimation in an $L^p$ sense, where $1 \leqslant p In summary, model choice/evaluation cannot be considered independently of the model's aim.
