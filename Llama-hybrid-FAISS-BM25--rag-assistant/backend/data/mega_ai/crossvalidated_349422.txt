Does it make sense to add error bars in a bar chart of frequencies?

Assume a survey plot that shows a histogram of percentages of respondent's answers, like the following which shows " Percentages of respondents' answers for five tornado warning behaviors across six lead time and daylight scenarios ": Do error bars make any sense for a plot like that? As far as I know, error bars are useful only when showing averages or median values.
