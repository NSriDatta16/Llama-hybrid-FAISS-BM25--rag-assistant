Class imbalance in one hot encoding for CNN

I am building a 2D Convolutional Neural Network for MFCC features for audio classification. The issue I am facing is that there are 2 classes and huge imbalance between them. One class has 17687 samples while other has 67737 samples. I have done one hot encoding so I have two CNN outputs as [1,0] and [0,1]. From my research it seems that adding class_weights in model.fit only seems to work for binary classification problems. Is there any way I can assign weights to one hot encoded results?
