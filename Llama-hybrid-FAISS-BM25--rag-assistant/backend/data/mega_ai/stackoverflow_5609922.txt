styling hr-tag, unclear heritance?

I usually use this to get a one-px high separator line between paragraphs .narrow_red_hr {color: #ffa0a0; background: #ffffff; border-left-style:none; height: 1px;} .hr3 { margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; height: 1px; background: #00ff00; width: 100%; font-size: 1px; /* IE 6 */ } function separator(){ if (BrowserDetect.browser == "Explorer"){ document.write(' '); } else { document.write(' '); } } It usually comes out as I want it, like this: http://e-dog.info/tmp/correct.bmp On one page it comes out like this, though, in IE: http://e-dog.info/tmp/unwanted.bmp It should be red and one px high, but here, in IE, it comes out as grey and has an unwanted left margin (about 1 px high) in grey. (This styling is only made in IE-browser) I am not so good with CSS inheritance and how earlier style declarations can affect later. There are several preceding style sheets, I read through them and cannot find any declaration for the hr tag. My guess is that the hr tag has inherited a property somehow. (It is grey like the surrounding text?) How do I tackle this problem? I want to rid the hr tag of all previous style declarations or I want to overwrite the declaration giving the wrong color and unwanted left margin. (That's why I tried giving it background #ffffff, f.ex.) I am very grateful for all assistance, I am no a trip though and it may take a little while before I can reply. I will definitely appreciate and consider all advice thoroughly, thanks. :-)
