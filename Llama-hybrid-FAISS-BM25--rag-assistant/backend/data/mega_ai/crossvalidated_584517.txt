Calculating the Gamma Posterior distribution Scikit Stats

Say I have lots of data that I am using to model the weekly rate of some event, with 0 being the minimum frequency and 7 being the maximum frequency. I am looking to perform bayesian analysis on this data. I would like to use the gamma distribution as a conjugate prior. I can create this prior using the gamma.fit(data) method where data is a large array of frequency values(0-7 values). I am trying to basically update the prior with new information to find the posterior. Ive seen the equation for updating the gamma distribution, however, the equations are a little unclear when working with real data. Here is some code to illustrate my point (values are > 7 obviously as this example was taken from an example problem. # see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOSFibkuUis import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np from scipy.stats import gamma pr = [8,10] li = [12,11,15,2,9,12,13,10] x1 = np.linspace(0,50,1000) def calculateGammaParams(data): mean = np.mean(data) std = np.std(data) shape = (mean/std)**2 scale = (std**2)/mean print("sh/sc:", shape, scale) return (shape, 0, scale) s1,l1,sc1 = calculateGammaParams(pr) y1 = gamma.pdf(x1,s1,l1,sc1) s2,l2,sc2 = calculateGammaParams(li) y2 = gamma.pdf(x1,s2,l2,sc2) plt.plot(x1, y1, label=" prior") plt.plot(x1, y2, label=" lik") plt.legend(); From here, how would I go about calculating the posterior?
