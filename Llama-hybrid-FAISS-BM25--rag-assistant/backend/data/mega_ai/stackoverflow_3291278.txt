Making a mock of IEmailer doesn't by itself expose too much of the class. Rather, it makes it open for extensibilty . There's a certain tendendency that heavily relying on interaction-based testing (i.e. mocks) makes tests more fragile, but this is more of a design issue than an issue with mocks. The Hollywood Principle can be really helpful here, because if your dependencies are mostly designed around void methods, dynamic mocks like Moq or Rhino Mocks will generally just ignore the method calls unless you specifically tell them to care about a particular one.
