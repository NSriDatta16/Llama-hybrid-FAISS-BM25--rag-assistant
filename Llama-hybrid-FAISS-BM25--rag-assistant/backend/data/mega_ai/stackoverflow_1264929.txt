DRVTBL , from the query you have posted, looks like an alias. The work like temporary tables in your T-SQL Query. SQL Server 2005 has a little bit advanced version of this functionality, called Common Table Expressions . An example - SELECT * FROM ( SELECT Id, Name FROM Employee WHERE Name LIKE 'A%' ) EmployeeA WHERE EmployeeA.Name = 'Albert' This will create an aliased table containing all the Employee s whose name starts with A , and the outer query will, in turn, select the employees with the name Albert . Same can be written using CTE as - WITH EmployeeA AS ( SELECT Id, Name FROM Employee WHERE Name LIKE 'A%' ) SELECT * FROM EmployeeA WHERE EmployeeA.Name = 'Albert'
