WP7 ListBox how to allow user to order items

Scenario: Windows Phone 7 application using MVVM. I have a ListBox that is bound to a collection of items from my ViewModel. The main usage of this view is to allow the user to re-order the items to his liking. How do I implement this in WP7 ? The way I would like to do this would be to simply allow the user to drag items to the position he wants. Is there any built-in support for such a gesture ? (I haven't been able to find any).
