Modeling data with logistic regression

I am new in statistical modeling and l am trying to model a financial data with logistic regression and I am facing a challenge here. Some of the predictor variables have integer values( negative, zero and positive) in them. How to I treat them? In school professors dont use negative data values in teaching. The dependent variable(binary) has about 97% of zeros and 3% of ones and I am modeling the case where the dependent variable is 1. Since the zeros are so much, do I take a reasonable sample (like 2/3)of data so that the ratio of the ones to zeros will be say 1:3?
