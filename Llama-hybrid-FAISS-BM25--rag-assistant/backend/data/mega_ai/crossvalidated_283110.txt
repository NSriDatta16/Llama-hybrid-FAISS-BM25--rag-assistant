How do I use my model to predict new cases?

I mainly use spss modeler but I don't think it has the functionality to use a generated model to predict the group new unseen cases belong to (one of two). It seems like it would need to be done manually? I was wondering if it's possible in R? For instance, after splitting my data into training and test, I want to create some predictive models such as random forest, logistic regression etc. using the training set and then use those generated models to predict the test data set. I found some material online for predicting using Weka but have not used it before and can't seem to find a (safe) place to download it from. However I have only basic skills in R so if it would be better to use Weka, can someone provide me with the link to downloading the tool? Thanks!
