First, not all methods rely on independence - e.g. paired t-tests, repeated measure ANOVA, multilevel models, generalized estimating equations and a whole array of time series methods do not. In fact, they rely on the data not being independent. Second, we don't usually know events are independent, but it often makes a lot of sense to assume they are, because there is no plausible source of dependence. Suppose, for example, I am studying the relationship between political preference and various demographics. If I survey a bunch of people and the people are at least roughly randomly selected from some population, it doesn't seem that there is any way there could be dependence: My political preferences (and their relation to my demographics) are not related to some other random person's. On the other hand, if we were interested in the role of being a husband or being a wife, we might study married couples. Then the data would certainly be dependent and we would need to use methods that account for this.
