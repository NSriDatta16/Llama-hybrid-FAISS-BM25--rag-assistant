Multiple Regression Models vs. Single Regression Model

I had the following question about Multiple Regression Models vs. Single Regression Model Suppose you have a standard regression problem: there is a dataset with several covariates and a single response variable - you want to fit a linear regression model to this data with the objective of predicting the response variable for new observations in the future. Case 1: You can fit a standard linear regression model to this data Case 2: You can perform the following: Step 1: Take a 10% random sample (with replacement) from the data Step 2: Fit a standard linear regression model to this sampled data from Step 1 Step 3: Repeat Step 1 and Step 2 "n" times - you now have "n" linear regression models Step 4: For predicting an unseen observation, have each of the "n" models individually make a prediction - then, take the average of these "n" predictions. This averaged prediction can be considered as the final prediction My Question: Is the approach suggested in Case 2 a valid approach? Is Case 2 already being used in statistical modelling under a different name (e.g. "Bootstrap Regression")? I thought that perhaps such an approach might "overfit" the data less - but I am not sure if Case 2 will just end up being equal to Case 1. Could Case 2 provide more realistic error estimates on the regression parameters and the predictions? Thanks!
