For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that the 10 samples on the same random variable are independent. Then the answer to your question is yes. It's not necessary to assume independence of the samples. However if we don't, then the "average" may never occur. For instance, assume perfect dependence of the 10 samples. Then with probability = 0.1, all samples will result in the wrong conclusion, and with probability = 0.9, none of the samples will result in the wrong conclusion. The expected (i.e., mathematical expectation of) percentage of samples resulting in the wrong conclusion is 10%, yet there is 0 probability that 10% of the 10 samples will result in the wrong conclusion. To put it another way, the average (expected value) is the (a) minimum likelihood outcome. This of course is an extreme example, but serves to make the general point about what can happen if the samples are not independent.
