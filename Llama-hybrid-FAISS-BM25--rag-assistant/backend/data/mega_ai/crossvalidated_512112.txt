If I understand the problem description correctly, it's easiest to summarize with a relatable example. Suppose you place several weather monitoring stations at various locations within a city and collected monthly data over several years and your goal is to summarize the climate of the city (rainfall, temperature, etc.). For simplicity we are assuming the various stations are independent (for more detailed methods, look into universal kriging). There is nothing too complicated to summarizing simple cross-sectional data. You can report the average December temperature as the average of December temperature over all stations and over all years. Going farther, you can assess the alignment of various sites or years by considering the root-mean-squared error of the series against the average, or any other adequate norm, (such as $\mathcal{L}_{\inf}$ norm which, in other words, measures the maximal deviation from a particular series from the average). This method relies on the data being collected at regular intervals. If irregular, other methods may be used (but it's a different question, IMO).
