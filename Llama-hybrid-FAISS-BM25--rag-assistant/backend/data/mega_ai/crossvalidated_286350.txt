There is not a difference; the online method in Chong et al. is an instance of the method later generalized in Hoffman et al., a fact that is tucked into a footnote in the SVI paper: This section is organized as follows. We first give some background on the Dirichlet process and its definition via Sethuramanâ€™s stick breaking construction, which is a distribution on the infinite simplex. We then show how to use this construction to form the HDP topic model and how to use stochastic variational inference to approximate the posterior. $^7$ This algorithm first appeared in Wang et al. (2011). Here we place it in the more general context of Section 2 and relate it to stochastic inference for LDA.
