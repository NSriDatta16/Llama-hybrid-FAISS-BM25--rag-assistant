CCMenuItemImage not responding to touches!

So I am adding a CCMenuItemImage to my layer like so: CCMenuItemImage *pauseButton = [CCMenuItemImage itemFromNormalImage:@"pausebutton.png" selectedImage:@"pausebutton.png" // TODO add selected image disabledImage:@"pausebutton.png" target:self selector:@selector(pauseGame:)]; pauseButton.position = ccp(24, 292); [self addChild:pauseButton]; The problem is my pauseGame: selector is never triggered when I touch the pause button! I have verified that the selector is set properly by doing a [pauseButton activate] (calls the selector). Also, I have verified that my layer is responding to touches by outputting logging information in ccTouchesBegan and ccTouchesEnded. It is also worth noting that I have sprites in my layer which register themselves for touches like so: - (void) onEnter { [[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher] addTargetedDelegate:self priority:0 swallowsTouches:YES]; [super onEnter]; } What could the problem be?
