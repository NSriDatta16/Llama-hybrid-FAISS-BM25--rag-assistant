In general not! In practice it is often the case (but only on a suitably chosen scale), because many confidence intervals are based on normal approximations of the form $\hat{\theta} \pm 1.96.. \times \text{SE}(\hat{\theta})$ (or on Student-t distributions that are also symmetrical around the estimate) on a suitable scale. For example, confidence intervals for linear regression are on the usual linear scale, but for logistic regression this is only symmetrical around the estimate on the log-odds-# scale (but no longer on the odds/odds-ratio scale), for Poisson regression on the log scale (but not on the rate or rate-ratio scale). and so on.
