Get relative risk ratio and confidence interval from logistic regression

There are many examples on these forums of people calculating risk ratios from logistic regressions, but none of them seem to match my situation. I have two predictor variables - one continuous and one binary. I'm interested in how the association between the continuous predictor and the outcome differs for group1 vs group2. I know this information is contained in the model coefficients, but I'd like to present the predicted risk ratio and confidence intervals for group1/group2 as a function of the continuous variable. Here's some simulated data: library(tidyr) library(dplyr) set.seed(42) N $Y X1 - 0.3*dat $X2 - (0.2*dat$ X1*dat$X2) + rnorm(N, 0, 1) dat $Y Y, breaks=c(-Inf, median(dat$Y), Inf)))-1 mod % spread(X2, y_pred) %>% mutate(relative_risk = `0`/`1`) -> newdat Basically, I would like to know whether it is possible for me to obtain a confidence interval for that relative_risk variable, and if so, how to compute it. Bonus points if the method can be generalized to multilevel models.
