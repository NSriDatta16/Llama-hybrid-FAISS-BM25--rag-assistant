Azure Storage Simulator performance issues

I am trying to setup a windows server to be my on-premises server . I was able to overcome the connection issues (the Computer Emulator only listens to 127.0.0.1), and now I face a new, more difficult problem. Writing to the local BLOB storage takes a very long time. I wrote a simple "hello world" ASP.NET Web Role that writes a random file to a Queue and to a BLOB . The web role runs on the same machine with the storage emulator. Writing to the Queue is fairly fast, but the BLOB is a completely different story. Writing to the BLOB made my web role work 50 times slower (!). Using the exact same code against the cloud storage made it work much faster. This tells me that the problem definitely lies in using the local storage emulator. Does anyone have an idea how to boost the storage emulator's performance? Thank you for your time, Elad
