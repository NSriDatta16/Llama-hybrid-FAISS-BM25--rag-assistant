Thanks for the iframe hack solution. It's ugly and yet still elegant. :) Just a comment. If you happen to be running your site via SSL, the dummy iframe tag needs to have a src specified, otherwise IE6 is going to complain with a security warning. example: I've seen some people recommend setting src to blank.html ... but I like the javascript way more. Go figure.
