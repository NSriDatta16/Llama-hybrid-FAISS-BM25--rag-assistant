WPF MVVM Drag and Drop onto another Control to raise an event only

I've got two ListBox's with objects as an ItemsSource populating them. Right now, I'm using a DragDropHelper to let me drag an object from one ListBox to the 2nd ListBox. I run custom code to change an attribute on the Object and update my two ListBox collections of objects. However, now I want to be able to drop one of these objects onto another control in the window. But, I dont want to necessarily "DROP" the object. I just want the external control to realize (by raising an event) that it just got dropped onto by an object with an ID. To recap, I've got 2 listboxes. one listbox is Favorites, the other is NonFavorites. I can happily drag/drop between the two listboxes and everything works. now i want to drag a favorite/nonfavorite away from the listboxes and drop it onto another control. I want that control to simply say "HEY! I just got a favorite/nonfavorite object dropped on me". any ideas?
