How to untangle the knots in al those threads... Clojure did not invent threading, however it has particularly strong support for it with Software Transactional Memory, Atoms, Agents, parallel map operations, ... All other have accumulated threading support. Ruby is a special case as it has green threads in some implementations which are a kind of software emulated threads and do not use all the cores. 1.9 will put this to rest. Regarding web servers, no they do not always work multithreaded, apache has traditionally ran as a flock of daemons which are a pool of separate single threaded processes. Now currently there are more options to run apache servers. To summarize all modern languages support threading in one form or another. The newer languages like scala and clojure are adding specific support to improve working with multiple threads without explicit locking as this has traditionally be the great pitfall of multithreading.
