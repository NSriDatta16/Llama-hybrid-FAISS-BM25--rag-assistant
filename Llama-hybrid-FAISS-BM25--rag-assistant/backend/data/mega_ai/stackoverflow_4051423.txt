Using HTML in Rails flash messages

I use flash[:error] to display a simple message to users that they cannot do a delete operation under certain conditions. I also have a link that will help them to get information about the entity that they wanted to delete and why they cannot do so. Is it advisable to include this hyperlink in the flash message? Which would mean that I would have a HTML fragment in my controller. If not, how would I go about doing this?
