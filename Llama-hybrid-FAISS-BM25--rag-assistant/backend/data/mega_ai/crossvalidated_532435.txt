ARIMA model - non normal time series

I am using R, and I have a time series with both positive and negative values. It is stationary but non-normal. Acf, pacf and auto. arima suggest a MA(1) model. I fit this, and the residuals are again non- normal and also suggest MA(1). Is there some procedure to determine best transformation for the time series? I am bit confused about how to choose the arima method (maximum likelihood or conditional sum-of-squares). Many thanks!
