Minimum Spanning Tree in R (vegan): managing identical values

In R the package "vegan" contains the function spantree . It takes a matrix of distances among terms and it creates a tree with all the points... unless two or more rows (ex: A, B, C) are identical. In that case only one term (ex: B) among the identical ones is plotted and linked to the tree. The other points (A, C) are represented outside the tree. I know I could link the identical terms as one. For example, if the terms "Lazio" and "Forza" are identical (same distances from all the other terms) I could take only one term ("Forza_Lazio") instead of two, but I don't like this solution very much. How can I solve this problem? Are there other R packages managing this (not that rare) case?
