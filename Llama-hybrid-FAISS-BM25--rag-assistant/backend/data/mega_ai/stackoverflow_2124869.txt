It depends on the version of Graffiti CMS and your web server. In the past Graffiti has written directories and default.aspx files to support urls without extensions (i.e. mysite.com/post). This does require write/modify permissions for the account that your App Pool is running as to the root of your site. Typically this is the Network Service account. You do not need to give everyone elevated permissions. However if you are using the latest open source version of Graffiti CMS on CodePlex, and IIS 7.0 or above, it uses URL routing and does not write directories/files for posts. In this scenario the service account would only need write permissions for the file storage folders. Hope that helps.
