Earth (generic name) is just a way to make nonlinear basis functions $f_i$ . Once you have those basis functions, you can apply a link function $g$ for a GLM, such as logistic regression or probit regression. $$ \text{EARTH: } \mathbb E[Y\vert X] = \sum_{i=1}^k\beta_if_i(X)\\ \text{GLM EARTH: } g(\mathbb E[Y\vert X]) = \sum_{i=1}^k\beta_if_i(X) $$
