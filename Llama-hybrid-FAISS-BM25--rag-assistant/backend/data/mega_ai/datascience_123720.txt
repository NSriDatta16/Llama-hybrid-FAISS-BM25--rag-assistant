Is this Dataset somehow skewed?

I am working on a dataset that has 100K points, it's about Customer churn. So I don't know whether this dataset is skewed, incomplete or what. I tried doing some feature engineering on it but couldn't get any further. I tried fitting the data to multiple models, but the performance I am getting is terrible. I just think there are not enough features to get a better performance(I maybe wrong). Any nudge in the right direction would be very much appreciated. I am attaching some snapshots of the data. If you need more info about it, drop a comment. What sort of Feature engineering and data preprocessing needs to be done here? I'd be glad if someone helped me out here. Update: I tried using XGBClassifier and found much-increased performance, is there any parameter tuning that I can do to get a further improved performance?
