As commented @ Marc's solution. The most pragmatic way right now (I'm developing a proof of concept for a big chunk of complex functionality) is to default the object after it has been deserialized with a simple public void. In this method I can empty the undo stack and set the status of the object to unchanged. If I come up with some better ideas I'll post them here.
