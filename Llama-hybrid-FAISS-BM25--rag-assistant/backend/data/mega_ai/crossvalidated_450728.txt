What loss function should I use to model a multimodal distribution?

Hi I'm trying to use a neural network to solve a regression problem where my response variable has the following distribution From what I understand using MSE will result in my model learning the mean of this distribution and will miss both peaks. Is there a loss function that will allow the model to learn both peaks?
