Personally, I think the separation is a step back from the actual implementation. In my estimation, an application is planned. It has multiple goals, it has multiple deliverables. There are tasks set aside at design time in advance of coding that the application must meet. A script however, is just thrown together as suits, and little planning is involved. Lack of proper planning does not however downgrade you to a script. Possibly, it makes your application a poorly organized collection of poorly planned scripts. Further more, an application can contain scripts that aggregated comprise the whole. But a script can only reference an application.
