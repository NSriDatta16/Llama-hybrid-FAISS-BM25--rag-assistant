A question about Dynamic Random Forest

On this article , Simon Bernard proposes a new approach for constructing Random Forest called Dynamic Random Forest . I am new on this subject, so after reading the article, I have a doubt regarding the algorithm about how he uses the weights. To follow notation: Let $T=\{(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_N,y_N)\}$ the training set. I think the algorithm is as follows for $l=1$ and $l=2$. $l=1$: We obtain a sample of $N$ training samples from $T$ according to an uniform distribution, and we call it $T_1$. Then we obtain a sample of $N$ training instances from $T_1$ according to $D_1$ (in this case, it would also be uniform). We build the tree and perform the calculation below. $l=2$: We obtain a sample of $N$ training samples from $T$ according to an uniform distribution, and we call it $T_2$. Then we obtain a sample of $N$ training instances from $T_2$ according to $D_2$, which is no longer an uniform distribution. Example: Let $T=\{(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_5,y_5)\}$ $l=1$ $\longrightarrow$ $T_1=\{(x_2,y_2),(x_4,y_4),(x_2,y_2),(x_5,y_5),(x_4,y_4)\}$ and we use to build the tree (using $D_1$) $\{(x_4,y_4),(x_2,y_2),(x_2,y_2),(x_5,y_5),(x_2,y_2)\}$ $l=2$ $\longrightarrow$ $T_2=\{(x_3,y_3),(x_4,y_4),(x_1,y_1),(x_4,y_4),(x_3,y_3)\}$ and we use to build the tree (according to $D_2$) $\{(x_4,y_4),(x_1,y_1),(x_3,y_3),(x_3,y_3),(x_1,y_1)\}$ Questions: Did I understand the algorithm correctly? When you are finished, if we give the forest a new input $x$, how do we decide its class? By majority vote? Article: Simon Bernard, SÃ©bastien Adam, Laurent Heutte. Dynamic Random Forests.
