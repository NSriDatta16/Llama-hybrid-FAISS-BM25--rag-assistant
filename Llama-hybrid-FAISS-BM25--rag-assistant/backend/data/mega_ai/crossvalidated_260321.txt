While Bernhard is right that having some more info or a pilot would be ideal, a pragmatic approach in a situation where neither is available would be Fix your question Fix your statistical analysis Decide on the minimal effect size that is of SCIENTIFIC significance, i.e. that you want to be able to pick up if it is there, and use this as effect size in the power analysis Get an estimate about variability from the literature / colleagues (very unlikely that there is no precedence for a measurement method)
