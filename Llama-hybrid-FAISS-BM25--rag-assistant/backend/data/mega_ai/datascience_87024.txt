No: a CMS, like many other software tools, processes data. But this process is predefined, it's not "learnt" from the data. Machine Learning is supposed to involve at least one step where the system "learns" from the data, i.e. uses some algorithmic process to determine the characteristics (patterns) inside the data. In supervised learning there is a specific training stage where the model "learns", which is followed by a testing stage where the model is applied to some new data. In unsupervised learning, learning and applying happen in a single stage: the model discovers the patterns and directly produces an output based on these pattern.
