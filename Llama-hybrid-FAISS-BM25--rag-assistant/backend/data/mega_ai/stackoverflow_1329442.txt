You could pass the address of the first element, for example: #include void fun(const double data[]) { } int main() { std::vector > > data3d; .... fun(&data3d[0][0][0]); } The elements of vector are stored contiguously. So this way is standard as I hope :) 23.2.4 Class template vector 1 A vector is a kind of sequence that supports random access iterators. In addition, it supports (amortized) constant time insert and erase operations at the end; insert and erase in the middle take linear time. Storage management is handled automatically, though hints can be given to improve efficiency. The elements of a vector are stored contiguously , meaning that if v is a vector where T is some type other than bool, then it obeys the identity: &v[n] == &v[0] + n for all 0
