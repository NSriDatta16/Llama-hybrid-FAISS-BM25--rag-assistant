Fitting Mixture of Poissons Without GLM

I am looking for a way to fit a mixture of 2 univariate Poisson distributions, but the R packages I checked, mixtools and flexmix , assume a GLM model. They require a "formula", etc.. How can I fit a non-GLM model to my data? In Hidden Markov Models for Time Series: An Introduction Using R by MacDonald et al. one exercise suggests to fit Poisson distributions using nlm of optim ; I guess that is possible too, the error function could be tied to the likelihood of the data, the routine would optimize on that. Note: Per @Tim's comment, I used library("flexmix") y This seemed to work; my goal was fitting two Poisson distributions to coal mining accident data to find a switch point between two different regimes. Thanks,
