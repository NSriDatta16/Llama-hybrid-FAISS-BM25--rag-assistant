An average user of an all-purpose web site is likely to have 1280*1024+ resolution. If you also support 1024*768 (i.e. max 960px width) and put your content to the left side of the screen, users at 1280*1024 would just have to turn their head a little bit but think of a user at 1920*1080, who would need to actually change seating position to clearly read the content, which would be occupying just the left half of the screen. Apart from those, I don't see any technical advantage or disadvantage of floating to the left.
