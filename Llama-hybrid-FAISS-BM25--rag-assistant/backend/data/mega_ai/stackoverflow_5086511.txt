It doesn't really matter where you put it. I usually organize my hg-related files in a single directory in my home directory which I call ~/.hgstuff . I have an hgignore and some other common settings files in there. You can also use the [alias] section to define aliases which will automatically apply your style file. Eg: [alias] stip = tip --style ~/.hgstuff/my-style Then you just need to run hg stip to get your stylized version. If you want to use the style for every command, you can set it in the [ui] section: [ui] style = ~/.hgstuff/my-style
