Yes. If the variables were standardized (that is alias to say that the PCA was based on correlation matrix), then loading values are correlations between the PCs and the variables. (All the p X m loadings are the correlations.) Likewise: Yes. If the variables were centered (that is alias to say that the PCA was based on covariance matrix), then loading values are covariances between the PCs and the variables. No. The loadings are covariances. Because there was no standardization, only was centering, the matrix implicitly analyzed is the covariance matrix, it has variances, not $1$ s, on its diagonal. Yes. Eigenvector entries are the cosines of orthogonal transformation (rotation). It is so in both cases - when you analyze centered variables (covariance matrix) or standardized variables (correlation matrix). But the cosines will usually be different in the two cases because the rotation is different. That is to say, PCs are different when you base your PCA on standardized data and when you base it on centered data.
