How to set and preserve minimal width?

I use some wx.ListCtrl classes in wx.LC_REPORT mode, augmented with ListCtrlAutoWidthMixin. The problem is: When user double clicks the column divider (to auto resize column), column width is set to match the width of contents. This is done by the wx library and resizes column to just few pixels when the control is empty. I tried calling self.SetColumnWidth(colNumber, wx.LIST_AUTOSIZE_USEHEADER) while creating the list, but it just sets the initial column width, not the minimum allowed width. Anyone succeeded with setting column minimal width? EDIT: Tried catching wx.EVT_LEFT_DCLICK with no success. This event isn't generated when user double clicks column divider. Also tried with wx.EVT_LIST_COL_END_DRAG this event is generated, usually twice, for double click, but I don't see how can I retrieve information about new size, or how to differentiate double click from drag&drop. Anyone has some other ideas?
