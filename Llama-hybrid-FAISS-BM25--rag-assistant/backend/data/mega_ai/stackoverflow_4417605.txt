In IB, add a UINavigationController to your MainWindow.xib. Drag the existing view controller onto the nav controller icon to make it the nav controller's root controller. In your code, add a property to your application delegate for the navigation controller. Mark it as IBOutlet . In IB, connect the navigation controller object to the navigation controller outlet in your app delegate. In your code, in -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: , change the references to your original view controller to the new navigation controller property.
