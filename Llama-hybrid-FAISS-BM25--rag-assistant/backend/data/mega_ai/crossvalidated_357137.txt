PCA doesn't do variable selection. Instead, it does dimensionality reduction, which isn't the same. In your example, PCA might tell you that actually $3L + 5A - 2V$ explains a lot of the variation in your data, but no other combinations of $L, A, V$ do anything useful whatsoever. This may of course solve the problem you have, but it doesn't tell you to that only one of the variables is useful. As a side note, having variables which are correlated in this way isn't necessarily a bad thing and can in fact be a good thing. If you want to do linear regression with your features, then you mostly need to be concerned about variables for which there is a linear relationship. But in your case there is a polynomial relationship between the variables, so you should be fine. Further, polynomial regression is often very useful if the original relationship wasn't really linear. In your case, using $L, A, V$ as variables would roughly correspond to doing a polynomial regression with $L, L^2, L^3$. To get an idea which of $L, A, V$ would be a good variable to include, you could look at a scatterplot of $L, Y$ and look whether it looks linear, quadratic or cubic.
