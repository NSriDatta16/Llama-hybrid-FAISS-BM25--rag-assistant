Log transformed MAE to original value

In order to evaluate the forecast accuracy of a model I'm using a step wise cross validation to get a MAE value and use that again to calculate the MASE. As part of the model specification the data is logged and differenced (diff = 1). My question is: How can I convert the MAE from a logged difference to a number in the original format (in this case Mn USD)? The MAE's I get are between 0.041 and 0.078, hence simply taking the exponential returns a very small range of average errors when looked at in light of its original value. exp(0.041) = 1.041852 exp(0.078) = 1.081123 Assuming that this is in fact the wrong way to go about it (the results sure seem strange), what is the correct way of going about it? The answer in this question suggests that the transformation needs to be done before calculating the MAE (or RMSE in the example), but given the fact that it's based on the output of a cross validation where the model is run several times, I suspect that might skew the results.
