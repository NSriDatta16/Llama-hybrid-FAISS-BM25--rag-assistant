I posted a comment about PubSubHubbub, but I also think this applies for analytics. With this you'll easily be able to know how many service subscribe to each feed. (note that it's service, not people). Then, to measure the actual Views, or even susbcriber, it is much harder. One way would be to track different things and extrapolate from there. First, you can of course track the number of "hits" on each feed. Check for the IP and the Useragent as they may give adequate information. Then, you can insert (X)HTML content in your feeds, like images. A 1pxx1px transparent image may be able to give you some valuable insight on how many times a given entry in the feed is seen. Finally (I'm sure there are other ways though!), track the clicks on the links for example. That is extrelemly useful. I'm sure services like Bit.ly can be of help here...
