Namespaced resources

This is an excerpt from my config/routes.rb file: resources :accounts do |account| account.resource :profile, :except => [:new, :create, :destroy] account.resources :posts, :collection => { :fragment => :get }, :has_many => [:comments, :likes] # even more code end I would like that each nested resource to be loaded from from the account namespace such as Account::PostsController instead of PostsController . Using resources :accounts, :namespace => 'account' tries to load AccountPostsController. Trying to nest the structure doesn't really work all that well: map.namespace :account do |account| .. end The previous code will load the files from the locations I want, however it does add the namespace to the url and the generated paths so I'll have methods such as account_account_posts_url and similar paths. Another alternative is to use something like: account.resource :profile, :controller => 'account/profile' I really don't like this as it involves both code duplication and forces me to remove some of the rails magic helpers. Any thoughts and suggestions?
