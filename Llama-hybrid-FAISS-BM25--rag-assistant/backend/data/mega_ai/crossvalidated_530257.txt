Textbook suggestion: Multivariate Data Integration and PLS

Apparently Partial Least Squares regression is very used in my field of research. I am looking for an applied textbook that covers Multivariate Data Integration methods, especially PLS and ideally its variants (e.g., Sparse PLS). Any suggestion? The ones I have mainly focus on PCA, Correlation Analysis, etc ... but they devote very little pages to PLS, if any.
