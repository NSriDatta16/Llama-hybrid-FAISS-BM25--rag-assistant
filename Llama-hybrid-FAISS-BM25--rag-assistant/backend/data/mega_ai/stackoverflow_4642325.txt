iPhone Provisioning Question

I've recently reinstalled OSX, and now, when trying to build a new version of my already active app, I'm running into issues. Firstly it is complaining: Code Sign error: The identity 'iPhone Distribution: Joshua ONeal' doesn't match any valid certificate/private key pair in the default keychain So, I realized that I deleted my certificates. So I went over to developer.apple.com, and redownloaded the WWDR Certificate, my development certificate, and my distribution certificate. All 3 installed into Keychain with no issues. Now, when I try to download the team development provisioning profile, and the app specific distribution provisioning profile, and install them, they both throw the following error in XCode's organizer: A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain. What gives? Am I missing a certificate? Or, do I have to revoke them at dev.apple and recreate them with my fresh install? Thanks a lot, this is very confusing, and it is stressing me out that I can't get a bug fix out asap. UPDATE: Here is what fixed it for me. Revoke the developer and distributor certificates, as well as the two provisioning profiles. Open Keychain Access, and delete the old certificates. Create 2 new certs, and 2 new prov. profiles, and install them. Open XCode, go to the app's target on the left side, get info, update the two code signing options to use the new certificate. Clean all targets, build and archive.
