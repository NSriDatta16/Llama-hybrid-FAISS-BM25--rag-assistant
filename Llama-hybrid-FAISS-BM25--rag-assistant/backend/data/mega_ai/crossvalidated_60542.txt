VAR with dummies, how to analyze dummy effect?

I'm currently trying to perform a VAR model analysis. I have the following variables, all on a one-minute scale, with 900 entries. Put in eViews as endogenous: Y1: Amount of tweets per minute Y2: TV ratings Put in eViews as exogenous, because they are dummies: X1: Times when social media encouragement was on-screen (0,1) X2: Emotional moment (0,1) I would like to test the effect of X1 on Y1 and in my VAR I get a coefficient of around 150. Which can be correct, according to this graph. graph Now, most papers do not use these coefficients but test the effect of a shock. Though, this is only possible for the endogenous variables Y1 and Y2. I cannot find any research where the effect of a dummy in a VAR is explained. Can anyone help me get into the right direction? Do I use the VAR coefficient or can I do other tests with these dummies? Thanks so much, I'm pretty much stuck here!
