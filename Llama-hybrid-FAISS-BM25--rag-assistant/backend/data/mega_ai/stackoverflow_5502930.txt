If you want to force context to get fresh data each time you don't want to use Find method. Find method always query internal storage first. Use this instead: public virtual T Get(long id) { return All().SingleOrDefault(e => e.Id == id); } But I don't understand what do you need this? What do you mean by: an update in the database is reflected when the page displaying the products is refreshed Context is unit of work. It should be used as unit of work - in web application or web service it means creating new context instance per request. In winforms / wpf application it means using context per logical block (per presenter etc). Because of that you should need this only in very specific scenarios but you want it globally. Your description seems like you are reusing context among requests which is completely bad solution . There are no performance costs in recreating context for each request.
