This may not fix your link error, but it might help with your dependency tree issue. What I do, is just use a #pragma to include a lib in the .cpp file that needs it. For example: #pragma comment(lib, "wsock32") Like I said, I'm not sure it would keep the symbols in that object file, I'd have to whip up an example to try it out.
