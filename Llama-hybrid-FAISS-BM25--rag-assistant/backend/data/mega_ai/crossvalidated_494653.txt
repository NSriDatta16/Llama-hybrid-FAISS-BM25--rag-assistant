why split data between train and test?

I am looking to buy a house, and I therefore look at a database of houseprices up to today (some are sold, some ads are live). I want to do a regression so i can see if a house for sale is over or underpriced. Lets assume i have a simple model: Houseprice = sqm + renovated + swimmingpool + area Now I want to do a random forest to see what the predicted price for a house should be. The normal wisdom is to split the dataset in a training and testing set. However I dont get that. For my purpose, isn't it better to use all the data to estimate the model, and then use the residual to see if a house is over or underpriced? I dont care about future predictability. Is now I need to estimate the house that is the best bargin.
