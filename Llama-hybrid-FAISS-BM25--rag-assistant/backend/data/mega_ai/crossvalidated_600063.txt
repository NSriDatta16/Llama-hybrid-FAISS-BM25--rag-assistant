MSE or RSE, and how to interpret each?

I'm on page 69 of ISLR 2nd Edition. I've created a linear regression modeled after the toy dataset in the book, where we predict number of unit sales given a particular TV advertising budget. Here are the linear regression results and its respective RSE and MSE: I have 2 questions: Do we use the RSE or the MSE to determine which is the best fitting linear regression and why? In the book, it says since RSE = 3.26, it means actual sales in the market deviates from the true regression line on average by 3260 units (multiplied by 1000 due to conversion to per $1000 dollars of ad spend), which I understand. Well my MSE number is 24358.22 - how would this be interpreted? Pretty sure its not "actual sales in the market deviates from the true regression line on average by 24.3 million units"...
