CSS / HTML text wrap for webkit

I am trying to achieve the same effect facebook has with wrapping your status if it's too long. Try to set your status to something like 300 "A" characters with a webkit user agent. How do they do that? Yes... I know you can use: word-wrap: break-word I googled alot and all these tricks only work if you can set the width in advance, which I cannot. My width is adjusting to 100% screen size to allow stretching when resizing (landscape). So to sum this up, how can I achieve text wrap without giving a specific width to the element or a parent element, without using JS, under webkit only browser? I could notice that FB use this property on the parent container: -webkit-box-sizing: content-box But I was not able to apply this to my case...
