I feel Eclipse is the route to go because: Eclipse and Google make it easy and fast to set up the IDE for Android development. Google even has step-by-step documents on how to do it. So if you have people helping you install the IDEs for the team, they can resort to those documentations without constantly resorting to you. Plus they have tons of tutorials to get your team started using Eclipse. I recently got into developing Android apps and Eclipse helps streamline the process of creating apps faster and like Squ36 said, the AVD is a perfectly easy to use emulator that I can't live without when testing my apps. Honestly the only reason I use Netbeans is to create AWT or SWT GUI's for my prototype desktop applications. It's not organized at creating the generated code but its usually a start for me to speed the process up As for J2ME: I have never developed J2ME apps but a colleague of mine did and used Eclipse since the IDE has tons of support and documentation for Java. Hope this helps you decide :)
