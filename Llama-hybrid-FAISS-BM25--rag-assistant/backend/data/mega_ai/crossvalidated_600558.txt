What is independent censoring and what are its assumptions?

I'm reading the Introduction to Statistical Learning book. In chapter 11 (Survival Analysis, page 463), the authors state: In general, we need to assume that the censoring mechanism is independent: conditional on the features, the event time T is independent of the censoring time C. I also read the given two examples: In order to analyze survival data, we need to make some assumptions about why censoring has occurred. For instance, suppose that a number of patients drop out of a cancer study early because they are very sick. An analysis that does not take into consideration the reason why the patients dropped out will likely overestimate the true average survival time. Similarly, suppose that males who are very sick are more likely to drop out of the study than females who are very sick. Then a comparison of male and female survival times may wrongly suggest that males survive longer than females. But I don't think I fully comprehend it (because I'm not confident while doing the exercises). Could you explain to me what independent censoring is in another way and give me some examples?
