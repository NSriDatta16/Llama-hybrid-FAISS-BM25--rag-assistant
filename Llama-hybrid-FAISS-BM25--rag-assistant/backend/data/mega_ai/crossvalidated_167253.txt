One class SVM with caret in R using cross validation

I am using one class SVM to train and predict anomalies. I would like to train the model using cross validation in an easy way as I have done with a multiclass SVM with caret in R. Now, I train the model doing: svm.model However, I would like to use caret, apply cross validation and do something like: train_control But instead of training a multiclass SVM I would like to use one class SVM. Is there a way to do that in R with caret?
