Considering 10+ weeks worth of code with no test coverage makes me cringe. When will you have time to manually test all that code? And under evolving requirements, you will use a lot more time tracking down impacts the changes will have throughout your code base. I cannot advice strongly enough to use unit testing. Even when doing DDD, let unit tests drive implementation. Coupled with good patterns like DI/IoC and SRP, you should find both your code base and tests to be more resilient to change, and thus save you a lot of time throughout those sprints.
