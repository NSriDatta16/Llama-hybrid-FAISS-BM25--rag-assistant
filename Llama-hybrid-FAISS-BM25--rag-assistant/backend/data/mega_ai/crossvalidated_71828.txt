Can I perform Cox regression on left truncated records?

Is a Cox proportional hazards regression model appropriate for records which are left truncated ? I'm developing a model that predicts risk of hospitalization during a two year time period. Some members of my study population have been hospitalized prior to the study period (left censoring) based on records prior to the study period. No problem, there are exisitng techniques to adjust for left censoring. However, there are also left truncated members for whom we have no information whether they have been hospitalized or not prior to the study. Some of these subjects float through the 2 year period without being hospitalized. Is there any way to retain the left truncated subjects in the Cox regression model? Should I consider another methodology, such as logistic regression? Edit: To clarify, here are some record examples for clarification. I apologize for the formatting - I don't know how to create tables in the editor. As per stnd methodology for a recurring event Cox regression, there are multiple records for member 1 (CT0001) associated with each interval ending in an IP admission or the end of the time period. The Start and End columns display the beginning and end dates of each interval, or . if missing. Member 2 (CT0002) didn't go to the hospital during the study period. But we still want member 2 in the dataset, since we're predicting risk of hospitalization for the entire population based on demographic variables even if there was no IP visit. **MemberID IP_admit IP_disch Start End Censoring/Truncation?** ---------- CT0001 10/1/2010 10/20/2010 . . .
