Integrating the confint command to my default logistic regression output

I would like to hear of possible solutions to the following problem. I want to integrate the confint command with the general logistic regression glm command on R so that it can be default provide the confidence intervals when runing logistic regression models. I am posting another discussion post that refers to confint and it is a useful link to avoid any misunderstandings as I rarely post questions here. Computing Confidence Intervals for Coefficients in Logistic Regression I tried the following code for generating the effects plot but it did not work due to the lack of confidence intervals: M1 Alternatively, I would like to know whether is is possible to integrate the confint command into a normal effects plot (see the one above) which will allow me to graph it together with the confidence intervals.
