using conditions in magento layout xml

Wondering if anyone has used the or statements in magento's layout XML for a custom module? I realise that I could check the values in the module controller or block itself, but it seems like a logical place for the logic to live. Mage_Core uses them in catalog.xml to test for javascript. can_load_calendar_js --> Thanks, JD
