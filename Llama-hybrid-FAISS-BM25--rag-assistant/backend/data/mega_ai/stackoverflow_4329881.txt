You can have client configuration by using Isolated Storage . You work with Key/Value pairs as in this example from the linked page: // Create an instance of IsolatedStorageSettings. private IsolatedStorageSettings userSettings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; // Add a key and its value. userSettings.Add("userImage", "BlueHills.jpg"); // Remove the setting. userSettings.Remove("userImage"); So you can have the value as your URL - just choose a suitable key.
