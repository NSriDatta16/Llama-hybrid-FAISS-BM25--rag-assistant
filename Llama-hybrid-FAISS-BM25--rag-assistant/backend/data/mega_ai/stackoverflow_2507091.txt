The fact that the system console consistently indicated that the executable could not be found did not by itself indicate the need to reinstall the OS. When X11 failed on my MacBook, I then decided to reinstall because X11 was an "out-of-the-box" installation which worked perfectly in the beginning. No indications were found explicitly demonstrating a virus was present, so I began the reinstallation process. Now that the reinstall is done, NetBeans, X11 et al are running perfectly.
