PHP is not returning me a number type

I tried to follow the instructions in this question: STAR rating with css but I've just a big problem. When I do: 1.75 or $foo='1.75'; echo ' '.$foo.' the stars is correctly shown , but as soon as I do: while($val = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { $average = ($val['services'] + $val['serviceCli'] + $val['interface'] + $val['qualite'] + $val['rapport'] ) / 5 ; .$average. } the stars stops working I double checked the data type in mysql: they're all TINYINT(2) and I tried this: $average = intval($average); but it's still not working,
