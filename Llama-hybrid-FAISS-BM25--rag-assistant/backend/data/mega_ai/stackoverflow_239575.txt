Web Application Infrastructure

I have custom coded several enterprise applications for mid to large organizations to use internally (some with a minimal external footprint). I now have plans for a web project that may (hopefully) see a large userbase with more daily traffic than my previous projects have ever attained. Obviously I want my design to be scalable and maintainable. The problem is that from a physical layout perspective (servers/VMs) I do not know what to expect. The question: What are some good resources for this? Books? Websites? I have found plenty on scalable application design, but nothing on scalable physical design.
