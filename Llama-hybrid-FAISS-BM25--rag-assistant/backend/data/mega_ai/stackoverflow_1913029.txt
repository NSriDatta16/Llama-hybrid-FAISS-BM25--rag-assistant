In the day job, it's my standard language for those little bits of build process that are too much for .bat files and not heavyweight enough to demand a separate executable; this includes anything that could use a little bit of XML processing or reflection -- generating Wix files with systematic handling of 32 and 64 bit installs, for example. It beats out PowerShell in this role because IronPython is an XCOPY install onto build machines. It's also very useful for prototyping fragments of code against unfamiliar or complex APIs (WMI and Active Directory being the usual ones for me), or diagnosing problems in code using those APIs (like sniffing out the oddities that happen when you're on the domain controller, rather than elsewhere).
