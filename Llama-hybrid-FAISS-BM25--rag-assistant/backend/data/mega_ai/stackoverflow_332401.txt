No, ' isn't a comment in SQL, but a delimiter. Mom supposed the database programmer made a request looking like: INSERT INTO 'students' ('first_name', 'last_name') VALUES ('$firstName', '$lastName'); (for example) to add the new student, where the $xxx variable contents was taken directly out of an HTML form, without checking format nor escaping special characters. So if $firstName contains Robert'); DROP TABLE students; -- the database program will execute the following request directly on the DB: INSERT INTO 'students' ('first_name', 'last_name') VALUES ('Robert'); DROP TABLE students; --', 'XKCD'); ie. it will terminate early the insert statement, execute whatever malicious code the cracker wants, then comment out whatever remainder of code there might be. Mmm, I am too slow, I see already 8 answers before mine in the orange band... :-) A popular topic, it seems.
