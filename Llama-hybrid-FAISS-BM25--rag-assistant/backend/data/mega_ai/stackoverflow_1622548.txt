Lets attack this as a refactoring problem. ie Instead of adding more to your presentation, Is there a way in which you can take stuff out? For example I don't think showing off that your demo App can use multiple data sources is essential, much less grants for you to program right there during the presentation. I know it took care in the design of your app to reach that point, but still most people are more interested in the OUTPUTS not the INPUTS of an app. And even more in the BENEFITS of said app. Some guiding points: Make the presentation about them . If the audience has felt the pain that your program solves, remind them of that pain. If they are other researches like yourself then ask them to put themselves in the shoes of the organization you helped. Compare the old way vs the new way of doing things. Why is the new way more efficient? Will it lead to more sales? will it reduce inventory? or save money? Will someone lose his/her job because your solution makes his task irrelevant. Note: When making technological presentations I've observed is important to address what happens to the people that was doing the task previously. Fortunately most of the time people don't lose their jobs, in most cases the same people can manage a much larger volume of work thanks to Technology. Show results . What are the real results your demo company has observed? Use meaningful visuals . If you could make some animations that explain your algorithm even better. Tell your point at the beginning and the end . Most people will forget what happened in the middle so make sure to tell the most important thing at the beginning and the of your talk. Practice, Practice . Yeah it sounds ridiculous but do your whole presentation in front of a mirror or video recorded at least twice. The more the better. Don't give one of the most important presentations of your life without a rehearsal. Breath and be positive you will do fine :-D PS: My suggestions are derived from this webpage.
