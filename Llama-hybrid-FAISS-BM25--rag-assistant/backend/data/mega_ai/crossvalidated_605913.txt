Bayesian statistics for a simple finite population

This question has probably been asked before but I couldn't find it so here we go. Let's assume we have a finite statistical population of $N$ members $x_1... x_N$ . Then for sure $\mu = N^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^Nx_i$ is a fixed parameter of this population. How does it make any sense to assume $\mu$ has a certain distribution i.e. $\mu$ is actually a random variable?
