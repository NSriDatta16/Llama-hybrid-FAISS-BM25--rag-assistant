Encoded character buffer storage problem in MySQL varchar using C

I have a encoded character buffer array of size 512 in C, and a database field of varchar in MySQL. Is it possible to store the encoded character buffer into varchar? I have tried this, but the problem which I face is that it only stores the limited area of the buffer into the database and ignore. What is the actual problem, and how do I solve this problem?
