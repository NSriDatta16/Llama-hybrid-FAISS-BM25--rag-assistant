Your question in the first paragaph has been asked and answered before at Cross Validated. You will find answers by searching for prediction and multicollinearity . See e.g. here . If the answers are not sufficient, try to explain what exactly you are missing. Answering the first question in your last paragraph, OLS assumptions do allow for imperfect multicollinearity and the estimation will be consistent. Depending on the degree of correlation, it may take a very large sample for this consistency to take over the effect of multicollinearity. So in practice it remains a problem when the correlation is close to perfect. I cannot answer the two questions in the penultimate paragraph nor your last question.
