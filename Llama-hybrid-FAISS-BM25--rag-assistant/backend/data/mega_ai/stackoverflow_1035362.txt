The using keyword is used for importing namespaces or aliasing classes or for managing scope on disposable objects. Here we are talking about the namespace usage. using StringFormat=System.Drawing.StringFormat; The way using was used here is a little unusual in C# but more common in Java import statements. What it does is provide a StringFormat alias without importing the entire System.Drawing namespace. Some people with a Java background like to proactvely import only the classes being used rather than whole anmespaces (aka Java packages). Arguably you proactively avoid potential name conflicts if you import only specific class names but it isn't very common in C# and Visual Studio doesn't encourage it the way, say, Netbeans does for Java. The more common usuage of aliasing is to resolve class names to a shortened alias when there is a naming conflict. using System.Drawing; using AwesomeCompany.ReallyAwesomeStuff.AwesomeLibrary.Drawing; /* AwesomeCompany.ReallyAwesomeStuff.AwesomeLibrary.Drawing has a StringFormat class */ using AwesomeStringFormat = AwesomeCompany.ReallyAwesomeStuff.AwesomeLibrary.Drawing.Stringformat; using StringFormat = System.Drawing.StringFormat; public class AwesomeForm() : Form { private AwesomeForm() { AwesomeStringFormat stringFormat = new AwesomeStringFormat(); stringFormat.Color = Color.Red; /* etc */ } }
