Following on from what Unfalkster said, you can use the hitTest method to achieve what you want, but you don't have to subclass UIWindow. Just put this in your web view subclass. You will get a compile time warning but it does work: - (void)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (event.type == UIEventTypeTouches) { // get location info CGFloat x = point.x; CGFloat y = point.y; // get touches NSSet *touches = [event allTouches]; // individual touches for (UITouch *touch in touches) { if (touch.phase == UITouchPhaseBegan) { // touches began } else if (touch.phase == UITouchPhaseMoved) { } // etc etc } } // call the super [super hitTest:point withEvent:event]; } Hope that helps!
