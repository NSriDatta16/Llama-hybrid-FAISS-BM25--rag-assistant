You could create a unique integer, not so elegantly, using SELECT MAX(ID) + 1 FROM tblFiles And simply return this from your query or sproc as the case maybe. Otherwise follow as marc_s says if it is known already. UPDATE: have to say, rather than this fudge as requested, I would strongly recommend pushing back hard and getting table changed so this is an identity column, as this is what is. all answers so far are simply fudges, mine especially.
