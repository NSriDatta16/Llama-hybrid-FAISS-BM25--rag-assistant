Probability distribution of the standard deviation of a gamma distribution

I want to generate some data using a series of Gamma distributions in a Bayesian hierarchical setting. I need to generate the data for a series of contexts, but I got only 2 data points per context, which represent the means of the context data I want to generate. Specifically, I have a mean waiting time per context and I want to generate individuals' waiting times that would produce such mean. These gamma distributions are parametrized with their mean and SD, transformed in shape ( $(\mu/SD)^2$ ) and scale ( $SD^2/\mu$ ) parameters. I can simulate the mean parameter distribution for a context using its characteristics (bayesian regression predictive distribution) but I don't have any way to generate an SD distribution for a specific context. Therefore I thought of using the SD of the predictive distribution of the mean (little bit of a hack, not having data on individuals; if you got better solutions, feel free to suggest). But this parameter would be 1 value for each context, while I would like to have a multivariate distribution of means and SDs for each context, to increase variability. Of course, I will have to decide arbitrarily the scale of the SD distribution. Reading around I understood that both Gamma and Chisquare distribution can model the PDF of an SD. but I didn't understand which one should be used, in which case and how.
