the built-in property() function does exactly the opposite of what's described here in the answers. it's not about generating getters and setters for member variables. it just allows you to call a method by accessing a property (so, although you just access a variable in te Python class, a function will be called). ( this post ecplains how and why to use it.) this said, Java doesn't offer anything like this. even more, property access is discouraged in Java. i guess you could do it in Groovy script language and the meta magic though. but i don't know out of my head how to do this.
