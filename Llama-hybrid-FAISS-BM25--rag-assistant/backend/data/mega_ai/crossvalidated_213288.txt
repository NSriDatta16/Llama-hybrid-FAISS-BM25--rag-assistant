Significant model but not the predictors? (Logistic regression)

I'm doing a binary regression, with two predictors one binary and one continuous. I'm using the enter method. I want to know if my model can be significant when I compare it to the model with only the constant while at the same time all my predictors are not significant? Or there something wrong about my model?
