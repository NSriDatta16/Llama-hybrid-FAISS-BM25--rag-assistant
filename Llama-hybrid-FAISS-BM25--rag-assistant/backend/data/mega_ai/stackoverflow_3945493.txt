Make sure to clear your Mac user account's Keychain of all old certificates (or use a different Mac User account), clear the Xcode Organizer of all old provisions and then quit and restart Xcode, and delete all old provisions off of your device (Edit: you can keep the old provisions if they are named differently and are for different app IDs). Also make sure to register the new app ID in the provisioning portal and create and download new mobileprovisions.
