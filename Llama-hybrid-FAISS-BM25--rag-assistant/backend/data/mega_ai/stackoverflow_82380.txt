Best way to handle URLs in a multilingual site in ASP.net

I need to do a multilingual website, with urls like www.domain.com/en/home.aspx for english www.domain.com/es/home.aspx for spanish In the past, I would set up two virtual directories in IIS, and then detect the URL in global.aspx and change the language according to the URL Sub Application_BeginRequest(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Dim lang As String If HttpContext.Current.Request.Path.Contains("/en/") Then lang = "en" Else lang = "es" End If Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo(lang) Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(lang) End Sub The solution is more like a hack. I'm thinking about using Routing for a new website. Do you know a better or more elegant way to do it? edit: The question is about the URL handling, not about resources, etc.
