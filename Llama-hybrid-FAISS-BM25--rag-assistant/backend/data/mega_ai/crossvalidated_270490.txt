What is tuned_parameters? If I train SVC with default parameters on your dataset, it works fine with 61% accuracy, predicting both classes. model.predict(X_test) with the model trained with your parameters outputs both 0 and 1 for me, with 98% accuracy: model = svm.SVC(kernel = 'rbf', C=10, gamma=10) model.fit(X_train, y_train) print(model.predict(X_test)) print(model.score(X_test, y_test)) So the question is, how do you check what the model outputs on your test set? You may have a mistake there.
