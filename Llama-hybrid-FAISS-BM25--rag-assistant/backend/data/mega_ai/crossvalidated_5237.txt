I don't know if this may be useful in your case, but in bioinformatics I often feel the need to visualize the distribution of gene counts in a give data set. This is definitely not as large as your data set, but I think the strategy can be followed for most of the large data sets. A typical strategy would be to find a predetermined number of clusters using, say, hierarchical clustering (or any other clustering procedure). Once you have the clusters, you can sample a gene from each of these clusters. Assuming that the gene is representative of the cluster, visualizing the count for the gene (in form of density plot, histogram, qq-plot, etc.) is equivalent to visualizing the behavior of the cluster. You can do the same for all the clusters. Basically, you reduce the huge data set to clusters and then visualize the representatives from these clusters assuming "on an average" the clusters' behavior will remain "more or less" the same. Warning : This method is highly sensitive to a lot of things, a few are, clustering method, how many clusters you choose, etc. I believe visualizing all the words if the number of words is reasonably large (say $\geq$ 50) would be pretty difficult. As as whuber aptly points out, it may be almost impossible.
