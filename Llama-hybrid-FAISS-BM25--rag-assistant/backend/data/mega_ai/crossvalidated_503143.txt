Coverage of the C.I for the variance on a non-normal population

Consider the confidence interval for the population variance $\sigma^2$ constructed under normality: $$\left[A_n,B_n\right]=\left[\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{n-1,\alpha/2}},\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{n-1,1-\alpha/2}}\right] $$ Supposing that our data it's non-normal, what would be the limit coverage of said interval? i.e, what's the limit: $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mathbb{P}\left(A_n I know that: $$\chi^2_{n-1,\alpha/2}=\sqrt{2n-2}~z_{\alpha/2} + n-1 + o(1),$$ so if you substitute on the C.I expression (after a little manipulation) you end up with: $$ \mathbb{P}\left(-\sqrt{2n-2}~z_{\alpha/2} + n-1 + o(1) Now,i also know that the limit distribution of the sample variance $s^2$ is: $$N\left(\sigma^2,\frac{\mu_4-\sigma^4}{n}\right)$$ , but I fail to see how to approach the problem with this. Edit: We can assume that that $\mu_4$ is finite
