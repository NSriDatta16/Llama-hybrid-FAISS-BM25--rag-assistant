Interpreting logistic regression on from R.

Thanks for clicking! I wanted to see the effects of certain medical conditions on the revision rates on patients undergoing a cosmetic procedure. The independent variables I looked at included: age, gender, BMI, opioid use, and tobacco use. However, the data from R came back with a confidence interval of 97.5%, which I'm not really sure how to interpret. I was hoping to see if you guys could tell me what is statistically significant and not, as I know if it contains "1" it is not considered statistically significant with a 95% confidence interval.
