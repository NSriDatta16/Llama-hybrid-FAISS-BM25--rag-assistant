nical architecture were shared with them before starting the work on the project." The statement further accused Dr. Roberta Pang Wen Chi, Clarisse Poon's mother (Ronnie Poon's current wife), of attempting to control public perception following June's controversy surrounding the project's true authorship. Regarding institutional response, Jemaa expressed concerns about the Hong Kong Academy for Gifted Education's investigation, noting they had "closed the case without correcting the record" just weeks after commencing the probe, and that subsequent requests for clarification from AI Health Studio received no response. On 22 August, the parents of Poon announced that they will voluntarily return all the awards MediSafe won, citing concerns to the mental and physical well-being of their daughter. In a public statement, Dr. Pang admitted that she had independently approached AI Health Studio to develop a MVP, although she insisted the concept of MediSafe was independently conceived by her daughter. On 27 August, St. Paul's Co-educational College issued a public statement, stating that the school had no prior knowledge of AI Health Studio's involvement of the project, and only learnt it through public media. This statement was condemned by a group of concerned alumni the following day. Official and institutional responses The Digital Policy Office said it had requested a full investigation by Hong Kong Education City and the Hong Kong ICT Awards’ Quality Assurance Panel. On 20 June, the Hong Kong Academy for Gifted Education and the Hong Kong New Generation Cultural Association issued a joint statement saying that the student had complied with competition rules. They also said no real patient data had been used and that company involvement came only after the competitions ended. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data confirmed it had received a complaint and was reviewing the matter. Media coverage and public response The controversy was widely covered in both English- and Chinese-language media. The SCMP explored the timeline of MediSafe's development and highlighted discrepancies between its public narrative and archived versions of related websites. The Standard reported on government involvement and noted public doubts about the project's origin. Other local outlets, including the Ming Pao, HK01, and the Oriental Daily News, examined possible issues of academic outsourcing and privacy violations. On 24 June, HK01 reported that the jury of the International Exhibition of Inventions Geneva reviewed the case and decided to keep the award, stating the submission met its criteria.
