I don't know at a quick glance what might be causing this, but in order to help diagnose, you might want to enable debug logging for org.apache.wicket.Session or possibly more of the wicket code. The retrieval of a page definitely involves calls to a method public final Page getPage(final String pageMapName, final String path, final int versionNumber) in this class, and it has some debug logging. For help with setting up this logging, have a look at How to initialize log4j properly? or at the docs for log4j .
