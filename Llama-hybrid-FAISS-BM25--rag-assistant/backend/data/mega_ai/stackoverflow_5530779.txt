You declared your method as public String which means it has to return a String object from the function (using the return keyword) if you don't want the function to return anything, use the void keyword instead of String . The second error means that somewhere you called SDSave method using a String as arguments ( SDSave(extStorageDirectory + "/qr11.PNG"); ) while this function takes no arguments ( public String SDSave( ) ). I suggest you would try a Java tutorial or two , since those rules are the very basics of Java (and actually, of many programing languages).
