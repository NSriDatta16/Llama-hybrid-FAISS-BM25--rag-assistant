Sure, many people have done that. You can also ask it to add comments or try to find bugs. Just take into account that LLMs are known for generating bullshit, so the explanations could be mere fabrications and the generated code may not work (in evident or subtle ways). I myself have tried chatGPT for generating code, but I had to iterate a few times until I got it working. I suggest you prepare some unit tests and integration tests to ensure that everything is working as before chatGPT's suggested changes. Take into account that the amount of text/code an LLM can use as context is not that large, so you may need to ask multiple times regarding different parts of the code base. There may also be privacy concerns regarding the fact that you are basically sending the source code of your company to a third party, which is something many employers would frown upon.
