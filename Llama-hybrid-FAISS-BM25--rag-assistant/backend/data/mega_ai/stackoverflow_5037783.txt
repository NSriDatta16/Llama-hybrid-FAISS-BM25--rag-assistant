Any inline element will pay attention to line-height : On a block container element whose content is composed of inline-level elements, 'line-height' specifies the minimal height of line boxes within the element. In your case, you have elements (which are inline elements by default) inside your elements (which are block containers). Changing the font-size implicitly alters the pixel value of line-height , the default is line-height: normal and that means: Tells user agents to set the used value to a "reasonable" value based on the font of the element. So, altering either the font-size or line-height will change the vertical space that your inline elements occupy.
