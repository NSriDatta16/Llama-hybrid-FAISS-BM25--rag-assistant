The reason I'm looking into it is to avoid the generated code from VS2005's DAL tools (schema mapping, TableAdapters). The DAL/BLL i created over a year ago was working fine (for what I had built it for) until someone else started using it to take advantage of some of the generated functions (which I had no idea were there) It looks like it will provide a much more intuitive and cleaner solution than the DAL/BLL solution from http://wwww.asp.net I was thinking about created my own SQL Command C# DAL code generator, but the ORM looks like a more elegant solution
