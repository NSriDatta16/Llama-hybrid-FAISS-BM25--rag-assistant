From your question alone, the partition you consider seems to be flat. But from your additional comments, I understand you are dealing with hierarchical clusters. So I am considering the latter here. For the former, many measures already exist to compare partitions such as the (Adjusted) Rand index, or the Normalized Mutual Information. See Comparing Clusterings - An Overview . For the comparison of hierarchical clusters, there seems to be quite a literature, too. As proposed in this Stack Overflow post , one na√Øve method can be to process a 'flat' measure such as those cited above (ARI, NMI...), for each level of both dendrograms, and then combine them (e.g. average) to obtain an overall score. Otherwise, you'll find more advanced methods online, such as A Method for Comparing Two Hierarchical Clusterings or Multilevel comparison of dendrograms: a new method with an application for genetic classifications .
