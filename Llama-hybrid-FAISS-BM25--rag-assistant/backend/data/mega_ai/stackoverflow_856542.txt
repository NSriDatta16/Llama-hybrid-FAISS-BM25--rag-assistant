Elegant solution to duplicate, const and non-const, getters?

Don't you hate it when you have class Foobar { public: Something& getSomething(int index) { // big, non-trivial chunk of code... return something; } const Something& getSomething(int index) const { // big, non-trivial chunk of code... return something; } } We can't implement either of this methods with the other one, because you can't call the non- const version from the const version (compiler error). A cast will be required to call the const version from the non- const one. Is there a real elegant solution to this, if not, what is the closest to one?
