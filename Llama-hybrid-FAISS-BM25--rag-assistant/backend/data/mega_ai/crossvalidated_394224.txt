Time shifting in time series forecasting

I am working on an ANN model for univariate time series forecasting. The step size is 1, so I try to forecast value of t+1, using value of t. Unfortunately, my forecasts have time shift problem. The obtained forecasts for t+1 is more fit to the value of t as shown in figure. How can I avoid this problem? Can I shift one step back the forecasts and is there a paper about this issue?
