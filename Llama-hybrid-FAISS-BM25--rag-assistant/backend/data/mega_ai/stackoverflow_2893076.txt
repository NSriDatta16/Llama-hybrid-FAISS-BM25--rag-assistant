iPad App Cookies Storage?

I have an application that sends you to one website that shows a login form. I've read up on cookies from the apple reference ( http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSHTTPCookie_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSHTTPCookie/initWithProperties :) I'm honestly just not understanding this at all. Can someone please explain how to get cookies working for an app? Post sample code? Thanks.
