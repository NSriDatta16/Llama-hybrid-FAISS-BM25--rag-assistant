Should the word "component" be singular or plural in the name for PCA?

I'm wondering which of the namings is right: Principal component s analysis or principal component analysis. When I googled "principal component analysis" I got 526,000,000 related results, whereas when I googled "principal component s analysis" I got 482,000,000. So the former outnumbers the latter on Google, and indeed when I typed "principal component s analysis" google only showed the websites that contain "principal component analysis" in its title, including Wikipedia. However, PCA is written as "principal component s analysis" in the famous "Deep Learning" book by Ian Goodfellow, and as far as I know "principal component s analysis" is more widely used in biological literatures. Although I always assume no algorithmic differences whichever people use, I want to make it clear which one is more preferably used and why.
