I've been thinking about this for a little while now, and unless you know how many sets there are (6 in your example) I don't think there will be a terribly elegant way to do this. One solution may be to use a rather vague rewrite RewriteRule ^(.*?%.*?)\.php$ foo.php?bar=$1 then process the data in PHP where you have a few more options and quite a bit more flexibility. Details of the Regex: ^.*?%.*?\.php$ Options: case insensitive Assert position at the beginning of the string «^» Match any single character that is not a line break character «.*?» Between zero and unlimited times, as few times as possible, expanding as needed (lazy) «*?» Match the character “%” literally «%» Match any single character that is not a line break character «.*?» Between zero and unlimited times, as few times as possible, expanding as needed (lazy) «*?» Match the character “.” literally «\.» Match the characters “php” literally «php» Assert position at the end of the string (or before the line break at the end of the string, if any) «$» Created with RegexBuddy
