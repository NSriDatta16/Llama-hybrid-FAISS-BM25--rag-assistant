How do ISO standards work (particularly ISO 9126)

I'm taking a course in software project management and right now I'm writting a "quality plan"... We've discussed ISOs in class, and I would particularly like my fake company to say the project complies with ISO norm 9126. The thing is I don't really know what that means. Is it just something you say to your client, does your company need to be affiliated under some international organization for standard compliance, do you have to have your project audited? How does it work? By the way, if you have any tips on what I can say I'll do to guarantee project quality, just tell me. Edit I know what ISO 9126 is, what I don't know is who's is responsibly to certify you, how do auditory works, or if auditory is at all necessary (if the project is small does it suffices to show the client you met the goals you talked about when applying ISO 9126?)
