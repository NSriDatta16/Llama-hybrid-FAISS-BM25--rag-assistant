When using standard managed operations, you need to make the "outer" color (that outside the rounded part) a specific color (magenta is a common one) then use SetColorKey to set that color as transparent. This MSDN article has the basics on how you'd achieve it. EDIT 1 Since you are P/Invoking your GDI operations, you could also continue with that. If you were drawing an image with transparency info, you could use alpha blending , but in this case you need to draw your entire "button" to a separate buffer and then P/Invoke MaskBlt to copy it to the Form's DC (which is what the CF is doing when you use colorkey transparency). Here's a desktop example , but the process is the same.
