Unless you are making an arbitrary decision to choose one of t2, t3 or t4 (i.e. pick one randomly for each observation of t1), I don't see how you can merge t2 through t4 in a kosher way. If you're submitting this analysis to a journal, your version of averaging likely won't be deemed proper by the review committee. If you're doing this for a business, you may be able to get away with it (but that's not really the point, obviously).
