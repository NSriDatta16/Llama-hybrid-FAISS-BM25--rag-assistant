spring.net application scope repository object on loadbalanced application

We have an application running on a loadbalanced environment, let say webserver A and B. The loadbalancing is on the HTTP level, so the loadbalancer directs each user request to one of both webservers. The scope of the repositories in the application is managed by the spring.net container, and the application relies on data that can be cached by the repository (performance reasons). In this case we can never be sure that the cached data in the repositories on both webservers is the same. Is there mechanism in spring.net that can manage this kind problem? Or is there another common approach for this kind of thing? Any ideas? Thx, Bert
