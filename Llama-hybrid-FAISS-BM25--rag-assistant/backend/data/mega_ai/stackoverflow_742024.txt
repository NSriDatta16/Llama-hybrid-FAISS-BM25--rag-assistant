Which .NET library / wrapper do you recommend for sniffing packets?

As far as I understand all sniffing libraries in .NET just a wrapper around WinpCap, which is OK. If you know any other better option please write as answer. Have you used any of them? Which one is the best according to your experience? I'm only looking for libraries which have commercial friendly licenses, Also commercial libraries are OK as soon as they got a decent price tag
