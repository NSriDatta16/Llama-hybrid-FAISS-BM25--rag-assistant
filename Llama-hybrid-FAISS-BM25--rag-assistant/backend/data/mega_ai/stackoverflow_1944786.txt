A simple no-brainer attempt I would first try would be to use SVM to learn the SIFT keypoints obtained from the samples. But before you can do that, you need to label a small subset of the images, giving it either -1 (a floor plan) or 1 (a logo). if an image has more keypoints classified as a floor plan then it must be a floorplan, if it has more keypoints classified as a logo then it must be a logo. In Computer Vision, this is known as the bag-of-features approach, also one of the simplest methods around. More complicated methods will likely yield better results, but this is a good start.
