I would suggest unifying the html into one string... like so. htmlStr = ""; htmlStr += " some paragraph"; htmlStr += " another paragaraph "; $("#content").html(htmlStr); this way you can see where your html is breaking down and it adds a lot of readability to javascript created content. Also... if there is content in this TD that you'd like to keep, I would use the append() jquery method. the jquery documentation is your best friend!
