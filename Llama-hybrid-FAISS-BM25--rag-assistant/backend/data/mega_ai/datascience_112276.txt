There is a perfect mapping between the rule and the decision. You know the percentage change; now apply your rule to map that to a buy/sell/hold decision. There is no machine learning to do, but even if there were, now is a nice time to post a reminder that class imbalance isn't much of a problem when proper statistical methods are used . Models like the SVM and na√Øve Bayes approaches are useful because they discover rules that you did not know. Logistic regression figures out the optimal coefficients, even if we specify the functional form. However, you already know the rule for mapping percent change to a buy/hold/sell decision. You don't have to figure it out.
