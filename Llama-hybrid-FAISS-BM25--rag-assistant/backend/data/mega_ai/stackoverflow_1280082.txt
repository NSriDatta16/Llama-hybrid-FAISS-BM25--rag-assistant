Alternative to having an aggregate concatenation function

I have the following tables in SQL Server 2005 ReceiptPoint: ID (PK), Name GasIndexLocation: Location (PK) ReceiptPointIndexLocation: ReceiptPointId (FK), IndexLocation (FK), StartDate, EndDate On any given day, a ReceiptPoint can be mapped to 1 or more IndexLocations. I need to be able to, for a given day, see what IndexLocations are being compared against. For a ReceiptPoint with multiple IndexLocations, it should show up as some kind of delimited list (for displaying to a user). I have two problems with this. 1) ReceiptPointIndexLocation has no primary key, currently. Is the best way to handle this to just add a incrementing index field on to the table? 2) How can I get the list of IndexLocations used on a given day? From what I can tell, it would require using a non-existent string concatenation aggregate function. Is there a totally different way I should go about organizing my data? This is still in the development stage, so I'm open to changing it.
