The NA stems from perfect multicolinearity in your data, yes. I think you could still retain both groups, by including only interaction dummies. By that, I mean a dummy for every combination of (group1-value, group2-value) . Based on your data, the possible options are (1, b) , (1,d) , (2, a) and (2, c) ). Drawback of this approach is, however, that every cell will be dealt with independently and 'switching' the value for group1 from 1 to 2 will have a different marginal effect, depending on the value of group2 . In your particular case, this approach will lead to a simple 'within-cell' average of the cells for which you have data available (the other cells are not identified). Interpretation of the output is easier when we remove the intercept (also to avoid another version of the perfect multicolinearity problem: the dummy trap ): dat$cells
