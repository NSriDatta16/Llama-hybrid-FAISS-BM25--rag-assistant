The model you would use depends on whether you are willing to assume that the probability of a particular outcome for a group is fixed each round, and if it is not fixed each round, whether there is any auto-regression or other dependency structure in outcomes over the rounds. Since this is a repetitive game, it is possible that players will learn and adapt their play as the rounds go on, so I would suggest starting with a simple model that allows different probabilities over rounds but does not use a complicated dependency structure (at least in the first instance). If you want to proceed in this way (at least as a starting point), you have a regression model with a binary outcome, so you could use something like logistic regression, with the regression equation: outcome ~ factor(group) + factor(round) This method will require you to have a reasonable amount of data for each group in each round, to ensure reasonable estimation of the parameters. You can then examine residual plots and auto-correlation plots for the residuals to see if there is any evidence of a more complicated dependency structure that would require a more complex model.
