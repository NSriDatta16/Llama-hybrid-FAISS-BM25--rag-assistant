start a timer from different thread in c#

Hi i have stepped into some problem related to timer. hope somebody can help.. I have a windows form containing a button when i click on that button i start a parameterised thread Thread thread1 = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart( execute2)); thread1.Start(externalFileParams); the code inside the thread executes very well at the last line of this thread i start a timer . public void execute2(Object ob) { if (ob is ExternalFileParams) { if (boolean_variable== true) executeMyMethod();//this also executes very well if condition is true else { timer1.enabled = true; timer1.start(); } } } } 5 but the tick event of the timer is not fired I am working on VS2008 3.5 framework. I have dragged the timer from toolbox and set its Interval to 300 also tried to set Enabled true/false method is timer1_Tick(Object sender , EventArgs e) but its not fired can anybody suggest what I am doing wrong?
