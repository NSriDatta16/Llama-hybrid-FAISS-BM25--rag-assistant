CMYK is a substractive color system, while RGB is an additive one. If you have a CMY(K) value of (1.0, 1.0, 1.0), it's black, while an RGB value of (255, 255, 255), it's white. Cyan + Magenta = Blue: (0, 255, 255) + (255, 0, 255) != (0, 0, 255). But not exactly, because we're talking different color systems. You need to first construct the pixels in CMYK, and then convert them to RGB, which can be approximated by doing (R, G, B) = (1-C, 1-M, 1-Y) . In order to convert a 1-bit value to an 8-bit value, you just need to transform every 0 into 0x00 and every 1 into 0xFF : Multiply bitValue by 0xFF .
