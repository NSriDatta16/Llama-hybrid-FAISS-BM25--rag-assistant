Adjusting web.xml listeners, filters and servlets

Following is outline of what I have in my web.xml config file. I need help putting this into the correct order. web.xml web-app 1. contextConfigLocation applicationContext.xml 2. defaultHtmlEscape true 3. listeners 4. servlets 5. filters 6. session-config timeout 120 7. error page 404 500 UPDATE: I'm getting ClassNotFoundException on all my listeners in tomcat's logs/localhost.log There are not problems after the application starts just log entries that indicate that something is off. I have organized it as per BalusC's suggestions. Any idea why is this happening? Where should the session-config go?
