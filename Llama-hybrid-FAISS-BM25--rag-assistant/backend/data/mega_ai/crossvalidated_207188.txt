As a note, the moments of a standard normal random variable have an elegant recursive relation: $$E[Z^{n + 1}] = n E[Z^{n - 1}], n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots. \tag{1}$$ From $(1)$ and $E[Z] = 0, E[Z^2] = 1$, it is easy to see that \begin{align} & E[Z^{2n}] = (2n - 1)!! \\ & E[Z^{2n - 1}] = 0. \end{align} To show $(1)$, consider integration by parts.
