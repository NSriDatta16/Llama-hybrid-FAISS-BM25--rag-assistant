Logistic regression-like model for non-discrete outcomes

If I have a set of continuous predictors $X$ and a binary outcome $Y$ and I wanted to build a predictive model of $P(Y|X)$, I would start with a logistic regression model. However, in my particular case, my $Y$ isn't binary, it's continuous between 0 and 1. Is there a similar Generalized Linear Model that can be applied in this case? My optimistic/naive attempt in R reveals that set.seed(123) df Note that some of the predictions are outside of $(0,1)$. Any suggestions?
