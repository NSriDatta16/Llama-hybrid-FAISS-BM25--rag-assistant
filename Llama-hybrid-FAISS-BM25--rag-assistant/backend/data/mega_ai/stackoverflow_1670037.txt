Question 1a : How to calculate the new average rating: vote count : 5 average rating: 3 new vote with rating of one 5*3+1 new rating= ----- = 16/6 = 8/3 = 2.666.. 6 You must take the "weight" (1/6 of all votes) of the new vote and the old average (5 occurences out of 6) into account .. the old average 3 is counted 5 times, the new rating once => 5*3 +1= 16. Then you divide by the total of 6 votes received. Question 1b: Should you store votes? really depends if you expect to be gamedor not I suggest you do it.
