Well, the more people the more answers. My answer is to generally avoid external commands execution. If you can - use modules. There is no point executing "cp", "mv" and a lot of another command - there exist modules that do it. And the benefit of using modules is that they usually work cross-platform. While your system("mv") might not. When put in situation that I have no other way, but to call external command, I prefer to use IPC::Run . The idea is that all simplistic methods (backticks, qx, system, open with pipe) are inherently insecure, and require attention to parameters. With IPC::Run , I run commands like I would do with system( @array ), which is much more secure, and I can bind to stdin, stdout and stderr separately, using variables, or callbacks, which is very cool when you'll be in situation that you have to pass data to external program from long-running code. Also, it has built-in handling of timeouts, which come handy more than once :)
