I need help interpreting this PCA plot

I have a dataset of 116 observations and 10 numeric variables. The dataset contains information about healthy patients and patients attained with breast cancer. I did a PCA plot showing the cluster of healthy/sick patients to see the relation they had with the variables but to my surprise the "N/A (breast cancer patient) cluster" is very far away from any variable. What could that possibly mean ? I'm fairly new to PCA or how to read the plots so any help would be appreciated !
