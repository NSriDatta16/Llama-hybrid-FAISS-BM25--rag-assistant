I hope Google answers this. Some guesses: The Python docs talk about how these property types are represented in gdata . Can you instantiate an Email property from a gdata feed and then set it on a datastore entity? Could your app engine app (some day) provide a gdata-style web service? Maybe Google has heuristics about the storage requirements of these types that help them optimize storage in the datastore. Maybe they'll add functionality to these types in a later release. Maybe they like typing for typing's sake.
