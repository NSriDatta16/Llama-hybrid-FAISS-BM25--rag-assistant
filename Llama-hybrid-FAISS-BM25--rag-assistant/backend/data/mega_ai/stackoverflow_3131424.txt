PHPUnit code coverage report generation fails

I'm trying some supposedly nice features of PHPUnit, but I cannot generate a freakin' code coverage report. What I get is: rolf@dev ~/projects/current/tests $ scripts/phpunit --configuration $PROJECTS/current/tests/conf/inc/tests.xml [...] Generating code coverage report, this may take a moment. [...] Fatal error: require_once(): Failed opening required 'lib/DataSource.php' (include_path=':::') in path/to/lib/WS/DataParser.php on line 10 However, in this very class, a specific include path is defined, and the require_once works like a charm when the application is launched. Could it be that PHPUnit cannot solve include paths ? Thanks in advance and long live stackoverfl√∂w! Rolf
