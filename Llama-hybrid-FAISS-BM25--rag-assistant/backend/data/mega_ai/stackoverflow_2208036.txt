Have you thought about server-side fragment caching? I've used it extensively, and it couldn't be more awesome. You could simply cache the content 'fragments' and render normally whatever depends on the logged in user. There are many good resources for fragment caching, I'd start at the documentation: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Caching/Fragments.html Also very good from the Scaling Rails series: http://railslab.newrelic.com/2009/02/09/episode-7-fragment-caching
