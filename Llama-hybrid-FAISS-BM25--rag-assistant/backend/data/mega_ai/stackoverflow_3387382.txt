Well, you could inherit those 2 controls from a your custom base control that has the dragging logic that you need in both of them. Just like ListBox and ComboBox derive from ItemsControl . That way, they share the same properties and behavior. If these two controls cannot inherit from the same control, you could implement a common interface just like ICommandSource that is implemented by a lot of controls.
