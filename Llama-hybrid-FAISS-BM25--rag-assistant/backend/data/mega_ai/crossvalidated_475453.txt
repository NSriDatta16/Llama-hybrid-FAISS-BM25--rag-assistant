The most relevant reference imho is Steve Stigler's "Epic history of maximum likelihood" (2007) "There were early intelligent comments related to this problem [ of seeking the most probable distribution for the observation] already in the 1750s by Thomases Simpson and Bayes and by Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1760, but the first serious assault related to our topic was by Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1769." S. Stigler (2007) "By introducing restrictions in the form of the curve only after deriving the estimates of probabilities, Lagrange’s analysis had the curious consequence of always arriving at method of moment estimates, even though starting with maximum likelihood!" S. Stigler (2007) He also points out at Daniel Bernoulli (1769) and Carl Friedrich Gauß (1809), albeit the later started using Bayesian arguments to see the MLE as a posterior mode. "...a long memoir by Karl Pearson and Louis Napoléon George Filon, published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1898 has a place in history, more for what in the end it seemed to suggest, rather than for what it accomplished." S. Stiegler (2007) "...the method of maximum likelihood was proposed independently by Lambert and Daniel Bernoulli, but with no practical effect because the maximum likelihood equation for the error distribution considered was intractable." A. Hald (1999) "It is an astounding fact that Edgeworth’s papers were unknown to Fisher when he wrote his paper on maximum likelihood estimation in 1912." A. Hald (1999) A. Hald (1999) also mentions Encke (1832) and Hagen (1837) as maximising $p(\mathbf x|\theta)$ in $\theta$ to find the "most probable" sample. He further cites Chauvenet (1863) and Merriman (1884) before Edgeworth (1908). "Edgeworth (1908) anticipated a good part of the (Fisher) 1922 version, but nobody noticed until a decade or so after Fisher had redone it." J. Aldrich (1997) "...the [maximum likelihood] criterion appears at the head of the derivation of least squares in Chauvenet (1891, p.481), Bennett (1908, p.15) and Brunt (1917,p.77)" J. Aldrich (1997) " Pearson (1896, p.265) states that the "best" value of r is found by choosing the value for which "the observed result is the most probable." J. Aldrich (1997) Looking at Thurstone's bibliography , it does not appear a relevant paper predates 1912.
