You can call DoDragDrop with a data object containing or representing the control to begin a drag&drop operation, then handle the container's DragDrop event and move the control. If you want to see the control as it's dragged, you can either make a transparent (handle WM_NCHITTEST ) form under the mouse showing the control (call DrawToBitmap ), or not use drag&drop at all and instead handle mouse events and track state manually. If you want Visual Studio-style snaplines, you can compare the control's bounds to other controls, make a set of lines to draw, and draw them in a paint event.
