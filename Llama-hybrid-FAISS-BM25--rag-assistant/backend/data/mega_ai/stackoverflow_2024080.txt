Seeking COM-based Tree control with specific features

For reasons I won't go into, I need a COM-based tree control with the following features: C# accessible Multi-node select Drag/drop nodes within the same (and possibly different) instances of the control within the same application 32 and 64-bit compatibility I had nearly settled on Bennet-Tec's "TList" control, but found that it doesn't support 64-bit. Any pointers? * Edit * I just found "SftTree/OCX 6.5" at... http://www.softelvdm.com/Products/ActiveXControls/TreeControl.aspx Downloading the demo now. It sounds like just what I need, but if you know of other controls I should look at, please let me know. * /Edit *
