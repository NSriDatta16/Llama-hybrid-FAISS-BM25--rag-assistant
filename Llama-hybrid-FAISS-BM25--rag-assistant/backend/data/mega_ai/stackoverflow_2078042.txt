Pattern-matching Seq's in Haskell

Pattern matching is one of the most elegant Haskell features. I've been working on a project recently where I need a queue data structure so I'm using Data.Sequence. However, it looks like I have to give up the elegance of pattern matching and resort to guards: floodFillWorker :: Image -> RGBAColor -> Double -> PixelQueue -> Image floodFillWorker image base tolerance queue | Seq.null queue = image | otherwise = doSomeWork image Can I use pattern matching with sequences or do I need to use guards?
