Logistic regression with ordinal variables

There are 5 variables (y and x1, x2, x3, x4). All of them are ordinal (take values 0,1,2,3). Sample consist of 200 observations. Is it possible construct multinominal logistic regression in this case. And how can I estimate weight of each factor (in percent).
