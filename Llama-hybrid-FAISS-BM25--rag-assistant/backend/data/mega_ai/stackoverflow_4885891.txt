Regex for removing all attributes from a paragraph

I know that regex usually should not be used for parsing html content. In my special case i need them (reason is, am using a rte editor and when pasting into the editor some replacement for attributes of paragraphs needs to be done). I have something like text blah blah and i need all attributes stripped out so that i get text blah blah How can this be done using a regex? A solution to strip out attributes from all possible html tags is appreciated too.
