HTML5 support is a little better then you think. Android has various support for HTML5 standards, with the inclusion of Google Gears into most versions and Android 2.0+ having native support for HTML5 (at least as far as audio/video, canvas, offline storage, and geolocation go). IPhone also supports offline storage along with audio/video tags. WebOS seems to have offline database support, but I don't know much beyond that. http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/ is the web worker draft implemented in Firefox 3.5 and Safari 4, so they should wind up in IPhone's version of Safari eventually. So if you can live without worker threads and don't mind limiting yourself to Android, WebOS, and IPhone, you can use a hybrid approach of HTML5 with a fallback to Gears. I don't think supporting other smart-phones is going to be possible in a truly portable way, although Firefox for Mobile (which is nearing release on the Nokia N900) will support all the HTML5 as Firefox 3.6.
