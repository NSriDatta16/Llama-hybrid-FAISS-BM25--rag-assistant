There is no reason to force a set of predictor values into a normal distribution. Some ways of teaching least-squares regression (e.g, starting from correlations of normally distributed variables) might seem to begin with such an assumption, but there is absolutely no normality assumption about either the predictors or the outcome variables themselves in regression. Your data are left censored at an MRD of $10^{-5}$ . That means the actual MRD is somewhere between 0 and $10^{-5}$ , but you don't know exactly where. This answer suggests a simple way to start. Add a separate binary predictor variable indicating whether the MRD value was observed or was set to 0 due to left censoring. For data points set to 0 due to left censoring, re-set their MRD values to the lower detection limit of $10^{-5}$ . You might then transform all the MRD values to $\log_{10}(\text{MRD}) +5$ so that the left-censoring value is transformed to 0 and you get log-transformed values above that. The regression coefficient for the binary predictor variable gives an overall estimate of the association of "0 MRD" in the original scale with outcome. The coefficient(s) for the log-transformed data (after resetting the 0 values to $10^{-5}$ ) provide the extra association with outcome as MRD values increase above the detection limit. It's unlikely that there will be an exactly linear association between the log-transformed MRD and outcome. Modeling with a flexible regression spline will let the data tell you the nature of the actual association. With what seem to be many MRD values at or near the left-censoring limit, you might want to specify the knots of those regression splines yourself instead of relying on defaults that simply use quantiles of values. Also, recognize that the MRD values themselves are subject to substantial measurement error particularly near the left-censoring limit. The MRD values in myeloma are typically determined by flow cytometry, with markers to distinguish normal from abnormal cells . The MRD is the fraction of total cells that are deemed abnormal. If $10^5$ cells are analyzed and none are deemed abnormal, there is still a 5% chance that the actual MRD value is $3/10^5$ or higher . A more sophisticated analysis might incorporate that type of uncertainty into a Bayesian model evaluating survival as a function of measured MRD. That's outside my expertise, but this page points the way to that type of analysis with left-censored predictor values.
