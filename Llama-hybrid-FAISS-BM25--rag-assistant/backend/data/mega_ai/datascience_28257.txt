So you would like to play this game using images? If that's the case, I suggest dividing your problem into 2 sub-problems: Image classification (supervised learning) and reinforcement learning. The first sub-problem will detect the right card and the second sub-problem takes that as an input. When it comes to game, it's definitely worth trying reinforcement learning. You will only need to create a reinforcement learning environment for this game and use some off-the-shelf algorithms (like OpenAI baselines).
