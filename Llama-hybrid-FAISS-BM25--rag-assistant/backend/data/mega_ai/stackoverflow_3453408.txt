It seems the WP_Query class always includes all items of hierarchical taxonomies . If you want to counter this, you can use the same trick they use: get all subitems of your taxonomy item, then get all the post id's in those subitems, and then put them in the post__not_in parameter: $unwanted_children = get_term_children($taxonomy_term_id, $taxonomy); $unwanted_post_ids = get_objects_in_term($unwanted_children, $taxonomy); This will result in a query that has AND posts.ID IN (1, 2, 3) AND posts.ID NOT IN (2, 3) , which will return only this post with ID 1. Very unelegant, but it works. Of course, if you go this route, you could also just pass the post id's you want, and tell the query nothing about the taxonomy. How do you do this for categories? The query code seems to include children there too.
