Django - Reversion and South - How to update past revisions while updating a model?

I would like to preserve past revisions of MyModel instances, while updating and migrating MyModel with south. Is it possible to update the past revisions? Is it necessary to update the revisions on all types of changes to the model? What kind of changes, if any, will force me to erase the revision history no matter what? Is there an elegant way to automate the revision updating process?
