Using Central Limit Theorem to determine number of simulations required

I am trying to determine how many simulations are adequate to estimate number of claims in the next twelve months using a homogenous poisson process. What I did is simulate 1000 times, find the mean and standard deviation of those simulations, and used CLT to find N (5% confidence interval), what I found is a really small number ( I simulated 1000 times and I have a vector with 1000 elements. I calculated the average of these elements and the standard deviation, and I used the formula: (0.05*Average)/(standard deviation/sqrt(n))=1.96 for a 5% CI with 95% probability. edit: I followed the formula in the photo, when I calculated the standard deviation, it is very large (around 80).
