Interpreting Categorical Crossentropy Loss

I would like to ask for clarification about the loss values outputted during training using Categorical Crossentropy as the loss function. If I have 11 categories, and my loss is (for the sake of the argument) 2, does this mean that my model is on average 2 categories off the correct category, or is the loss used purely for comparative purposes and cannot be interpreted like I am suggesting ?
