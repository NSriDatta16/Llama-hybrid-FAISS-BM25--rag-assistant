I'm currently working on a touch screen web application myself and keep wondering when I would "have" to put in a soft keyboard. The modules currently being developed deal only with order entry and retrieval/dispatch functionality and the client wants to limit any input by the call center attendant whereever possible. So no data input yet. However, I've been searching for a keyboard for a touch screen myself. Darryl, where would you suggest I should begin if I had to write one? Good luck to both of you!
