There are two possible answers to this. The way you're writing it, this is not a graphical element (arrow) followed by a label ("Back"), but a line of text (inside a paragraph) containing a single character followed by a letter string. So alignment is a purely typographical problem and determined by the font you're choosing. Choose a different font and see if it's more typographically pleasing. What you want is really not a line of text but two independently placeable graphical elements. Put each inside its own span , give it display: inline-block and position: relative and play with vertical paddings, margins and line-heights until you're satisfied.
