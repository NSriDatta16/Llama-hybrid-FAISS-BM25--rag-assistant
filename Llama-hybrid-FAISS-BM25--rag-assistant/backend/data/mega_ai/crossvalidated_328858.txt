Prepare data for previously trained LibSVM classifier

I trained a LibSVM classifier, with scaled features in the interval $[-1;1]$ with this equation: $$x'=2\frac{x-\min x}{\max x - \min x}-1$$ I am happy with the trained model and its accuracy on the testing data, and want to use my model on new data as I receive it. I receive 1 new row of feature data, and want to predict the class of it using my trained model. Is it necessary to scale the new data features to the interval $[-1;1]$? If so, do I need to retrain my model each time I get a new row of features, since the max/min values used for scaling could potentially change with new data?
