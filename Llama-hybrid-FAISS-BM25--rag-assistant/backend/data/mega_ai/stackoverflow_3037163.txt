The only thing I can think of is openMosix or LinuxPMI (the successor of openMosix). If the code uses processes then process "migration" technique makes is possible to put processes at work on different machines (which have the specified linux distribution installed). Check for threads ( grep -i thread ), processes ( grep fork ) in your code. If none of this exists, then check for MPI . MPI requires some extra configuration since I recall (only used it for some homeworks in faculty). As mentioned gcc (and others) implements some ways of parallelism with OpenMP with some pragmas .
