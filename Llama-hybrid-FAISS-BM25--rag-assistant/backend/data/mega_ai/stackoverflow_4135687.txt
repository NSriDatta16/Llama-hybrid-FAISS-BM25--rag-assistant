Con: either you have to test a different build to the one you ship, or you end up with your unit test code (and members) in your shipping code. Sounds like a really bad idea to me in general. I usually go for separate production/test projects, with [InternalsVisibleTo] allowing testing of internal methods (which goes against the dogma of some folks, but seems pragmatic to me).
