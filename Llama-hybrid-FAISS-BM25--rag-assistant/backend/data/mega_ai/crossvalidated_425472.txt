Object distortion after ROI Align in Mask R-CNN

In Mask R-CNN, if there are 2 proposed ROIs which cover 2 objects that looks like below: #1 A square object #2 A rectangular object So my question is: After ROI Align, is the #2 feature map transformed from rectangular shape to square shape? If so the feature map of both objects are very similar, right? So the model will not able to classify 2 classes that are distinguished by their aspect ratio only (for example, Square class and Rectangle class), right? So is there any other model that can solve the problem at 3 ? ROI Align process of rectangle and square
