how to render multiple textures with GLSL

i am about to port all my rendering from "old" opengl to glsl. now i have a mesh with different textures, so in "old" gl i just used bindTexture to change the texture. i guess, i still need to do this, but something is missing, since my everything seems to be rendered with the first texture only. uniform sampler2D tex; void main() { gl_FragColor = tex2D(tex, gl_TexCoord[0].st); } "tex" is the name of the texture which i put to glsl like this: int loc = glGetUniformLocationARB(id, "tex"); glUniform1iARB(loc, 0); note: i am not talking about multitexturing! :-)
