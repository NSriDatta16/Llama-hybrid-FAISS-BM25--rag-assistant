It is strange to use k-means in addition to logistic regression. Usually k-means is reserved for unsupervised learning problems, this is when you do not have labelled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms are not as powerful and it seems here you have labelled data, thus you should stick to supervised learning techniques. If you have additional features for your instances then you should include them in your logistic regression.
