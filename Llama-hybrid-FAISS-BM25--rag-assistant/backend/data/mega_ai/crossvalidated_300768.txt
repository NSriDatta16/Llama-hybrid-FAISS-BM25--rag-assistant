ML problem in dimensions less than or equal to 6

I have a new ML model $F$(in development stage) which I need to test and compare with the state of the art ML models like deep learning. Unfortunately I cannot run my ML model $F$ in higher dimensions, as my computations increase rapidly with number of dimensions. So the highest dimensions I can go is upto $6$. So I cannot really test it on state of the art problems like MNIST etc.,. But I'd like to compare it with other ML models (Neural Nets,etc,) on a problem that is not more than 6 dimensions. So Is there any such ML problem with dimensionality less than or equal to 6?
