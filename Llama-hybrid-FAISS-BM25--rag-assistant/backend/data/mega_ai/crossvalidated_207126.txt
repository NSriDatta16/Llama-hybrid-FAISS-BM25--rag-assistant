Regarding last question ( Lastly, I've read the default average rating in the Elo system is 1500, is this connected to 400 as well? ), the answer is: no . The starting rating is arbitrary (in Elo, as in Glicko, etc. E.g. in rankade , our ranking system, players starts at 2000), it doesn't matter what number you pick. Starting Elo at 1500 leads to serious difficulties to go under 1000 (so nearly all scores are in 4-digits format), a significant quality benchmark at 2000 and an unsurpassed limit at 3000 (Magnus Carlsen peaked at 2882), but none of these seems to be the main reason for choosing it. Even if it's out of your question, probably most debate is on $K$ constant value, indeed.
