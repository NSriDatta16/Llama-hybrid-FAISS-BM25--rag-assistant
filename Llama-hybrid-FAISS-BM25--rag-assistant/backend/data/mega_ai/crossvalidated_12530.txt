The intuitive difference between Hausdorff distance and EMD between sets A and B is: EMD tells you the total work required to move all A's mass onto B, under the optimal scheme for doing so. Hausdorff tells you the worst-case distance between an element of A and the nearest element of B. If you consider each point to have unit mass, then you can think of Hausdorff as telling you the worst-case amount of work required to move a single element of A onto some element of B, under the optimal scheme for doing so. Your modification of Hausdorff would have the characterization: It tells you the average amount of work required to move each element of A onto some element of B, under the optimal scheme for doing so. Of course, which one you want depends on your application...
