Seem to have a problem with returning an order.pk value with Django

(r'^search/(?P \d+)/(?P \d+)/test_items/$', views.test_items), I want a link that can go to this url views.service_order2, Unfortunately, I keep getting a NoReverseMatch error. (r'^quote/service_order/(?P \d+)/(?P \d+)/(?P \d+)/$', views.service_order2), Caught NoReverseMatch while rendering: Reverse for 'tiptop.views.service_order2' with arguments '('', 17L, 1)' and keyword arguments '{}' not found The problem seems that my order does not have a pk value. However I have done the same procedure with test_items view and that worked out fine. Why is that in one of my views I can return an order.pk value, but in another (service_order2 view) I can't is the question. #views.py def service_order2(request, client_id = 0, order_no = 0, request_type = 1): # A lot of code order=request.session['order'] return render_to_response('service_step1__2nd.html', {'contacts':contacts, 'addresses':addresses, 'title':title, 'service_list':service_list, 'date_type':date_type, 'address_type':address_type, 'order':order}, context_instance = RequestContext(request)) def test_items(request, client_id = 0, order_no= 0): client = None items = None try: client = models.Client.objects.get(pk = client_id) items = client.storageitem_set.all() order=request.session['order'] except: return HttpResponse(reverse(return_clients)) return render_to_response('test.html', {'items':items, 'client':client, 'order':order}, context_instance = RequestContext(request)) In my template called test.html, I have this the template tag link written inside.
