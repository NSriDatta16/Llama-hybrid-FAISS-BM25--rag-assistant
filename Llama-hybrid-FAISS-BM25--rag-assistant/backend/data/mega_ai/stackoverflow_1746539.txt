It seems that you may have already found the solution to your problem, but I thought I would just throw in my $.02. What I did was to use a custom "drag avatar" for each drag handle (in the dojo vernacular, the "avatar" is what is displayed while the user is dragging). Here's a direct snippet from the code: for ( var i=0; i createAvatar is a function callback previously defined something like this: var createAvatar = function(item, mode) { var node = dojo.doc.createElement("span"); node.id = dojo.dnd.getUniqueId(); node.itemIndex = parseInt(item.data); dojo.addClass(node, "dojoDndItem"); // Creating the drag avatar or the source node? if ( mode == "avatar" ) { // Create the DOM for the avatar (what is shown while dragging) } else { // Create the DOM for the source node (the handle for drag initiation) } return {node: node, data: item, type: [context.dnd.classes.avatar]}; }; Your method works obviously, but this method frees you from having to worry about toggling styles as Dojo will take care of all of the for you. p.s.: I hate Dojo DND and its documentation. This took me waaay to long to figure out when I had to do it originally.
