Interpreting evaluation metrics with threshold/cutoff

I was doing churn prediction for a company. I've got the following results by applying 3 classifier. Model Accuracy AUC Logistic Regression 0.671 0.736 Decision Tree (pruned) 0.681 0.665 Decision Tree unpruned 0.623 0.627 Now, I want to know two things: which model has a better accuracy for a cutoff of 0.9? As the logistic regression has highest AUC so, in my opinion, Logistic Regression is better Which model is the best in terms of ranking the predictions according to their probability of leaving Can anyone explain how I can interpret them?
