I like your idea, but if you want to avoid reflection you could add instead instances to the HashMap: commandMap = new HashMap(); commandMap.put("START",new StartCommand()); Whenever you need a command, you just clone it: command = ((Command) commandMap.get(cmdName)).clone(); And afterwards, you set the command string: command.setCommandString(cmdName); But using clone() doesn't sound as elegant as using reflection :(
