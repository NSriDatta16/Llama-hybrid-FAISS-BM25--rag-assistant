IMHO, your problem is related to "feature engineering" . Dealing with financial market time series, I use to create one new column (feature) for each set of parameters of each indicator. For example a simple moving average (SMA) is defined by the set = {LookbackPeriod,Frequency,ShortPeriod,LongPeriod} and each combination of these elements forms a new feature/attribute. The instances of your Y values (classes) can be trained separately (in your classifier) for each frequency, like Return(t+period) where period == days, weeks, ... If you want something more general you are trying to predict using "first-order rule learning"
