Statistic to Verify Subsample is Similar to Original Sample?

I have a subsample of data (120 students) that was taken from an original sample of 1,216 students' data. I need to report in my manuscript whether my subsample's key demographics (age, gender distribution, ethnicity, hours of sleep) are still similar to the original sample (the 1,216 students). What test do I run in R Studio to do this? Specifically, I have the information average age in overall sample 14 (.5) and subsample 12.9 (.44). In what ways could I compare compare?
