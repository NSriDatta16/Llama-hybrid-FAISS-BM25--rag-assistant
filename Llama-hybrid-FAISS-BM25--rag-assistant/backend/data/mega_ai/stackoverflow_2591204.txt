Propel-load-data is causing an error

I am trying to load fixtures but myproject is erroring at the CLI and starting the indexer process. I have tried: Rebuilding the schema and model Emptying the database and starting again Clearing the cache Validating the YML file and trying much simpler data-dumps My platform is Symfony 1.0 on Windows Some also seems to have had the same issue in the past .
