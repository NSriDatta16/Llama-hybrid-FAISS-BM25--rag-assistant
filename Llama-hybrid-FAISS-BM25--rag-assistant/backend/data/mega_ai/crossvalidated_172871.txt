Effect of arsenic concentration on the yield of rice

We did an experiment to analyze the effect of arsenic levels in the soil on the yield of rice. We exchanged soil between low arsenic rice fields and high arsenic rice fields, plus we have a field in the area where we did nothing to the soil (control). At the end of harvest, we measured the yield of rice in each field. Then we took four leaf samples from the north, east, west, and south corners of each field and measured arsenic concentrations. We then took three soil samples from around each of these plants. We replicated this experiment in twenty-five areas. At its simplest, this is a basic ANOVA problem: Yield = B 0 + (Avg. Soil As level)*B 1 + (High As field?)*B 2 + (Low As field?)*B 3 My question is, should I take the average soil arsenic levels in each field, or does anyone have a different method to account for the variation of arsenic levels in each field?
