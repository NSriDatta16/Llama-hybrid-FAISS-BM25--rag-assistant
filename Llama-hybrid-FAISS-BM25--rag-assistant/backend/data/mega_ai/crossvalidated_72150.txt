This is phase 1 of my answer. I want first to make sure that I understand the model. Take just one customer, say customer $i$, and denote by $s_{it}$ its monthly savings balance. From what the OP writes, the model appears to be (for one customer and assuming linearity for the moment) $$ s_{it} = g(a_1t,a_2t^2, a_3t^3,..) + X_{i3}\beta + u_{it},\qquad t=4,...,36$$ ...where $g(b_1t,b_2t^2, b_3t^3,..)$ represents various time-variables (that enter additively), and $X_{i3}$ is the matrix including the "initial state data" (of time period $3$). Is this an accurate depiction of the general idea? If it is I have one question and one remark: Question: what happens to data from period 1,2,3? Aren't they used somehow (apart from $X_{i3}$)? Remark: If all regressors in $X_{i3}$ are time-invariant, then their effect on $ s_{it}$ cannot be separated -they form a composite "intercept". Waiting on OP's feedback. PHASE 2 Given the OP's clarifications (although, I must note that it is not "for simplicity" that a time-invariant regressor "does not change with t"), let's explore the possible model $$ s_{it} = \sum_{l=1}^{k}a_lt^l + X_i\beta + u_{it},\qquad t=4,...,36$$ My previous remark stands: whatever is in $X_i$, be it regressors specific to customer $i$, or even products of these regressors etc, or even some collective variables from periods $1,2,3$, to the degree that they are time-invariant for the time period $4,...,36$, then their effects on the dependent variable cannot be separated. Moreover $X_i$ is known , and if they are measured in the same units as the dependent variable, then their sum should be subtracted from the dependent variable, they do not belong in the RHS of the equation. Moreover by a comment of OP in another answer, it appears that an assumption that customers exhibit similar behavior is made: namely, we could use some accounts to estimate the regression, and then use the estimated coefficients to predict the behavior of _other_accounts, presumably of other customers. Taken all the above into account, we are led in a model that can be written $$ s_{it} - \sum_{j=1}^{m}x_{ij} = \sum_{l=0}^{k}a_lt^l + u_{it},\qquad t=4,...,36\qquad i=1,...,n$$ ...where $n$ is the number of customers comprising the training sample. This model could be estimated by one of the many panel data estimators available, given also the constraints imposed by the structure of the specification. But although the panel data would permit a better estimation of the coefficients involved, the main issue remains: we are depending only on the powers of $t$ to capture the variability of the dependent variable. Personally, I don't "trust" that kind of models: they are a classic case where you could obtain a "perfect fit" by adding more and more powers of $t$ -only to find out that this "perfectly fitted" model is the worst when it comes to prediction out-of-sample. What then? I believe that the $VARMA$ modelling (also discussed in another answer) is a better way to go: namely a vector autoregressive-moving average model: $$s_{it} - \sum_{j=1}^{m}x_{ij} = \phi(L)s_{it} + \psi(L)u_{it},\qquad t=4,...,36\qquad i=1,...,n$$ where $\phi(L)$ and $\psi(L)$ are polynomials in the lag operator operating on $t$.
