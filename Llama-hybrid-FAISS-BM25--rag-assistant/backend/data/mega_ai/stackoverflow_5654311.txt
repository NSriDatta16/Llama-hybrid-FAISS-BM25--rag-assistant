How do I keep a touch event keep its focus on the widget it was started in?

Let's say I have a ListView, and one row in it is a custom View of mine. The user touches inside the custom view -> custom View gets to handle this touch event. User continues this touch sequence inside the are of the custom View -> custom View gets to handle those events too. Problem: When the user drags his/her finger outside the area of the custom View (the drag started inside), the custom View losts the touch events. But I need those events too, how can I achieve this? I know that this can be done: if you put a Gallery containing a bunch of images inside a LisView, and I start to drag the Gallery left-right, and drag my finger outside the area of the Gallery while doing so (moving up/downwards too much), I still control the Gallery scrolling, not the ListView. I hope that I was clear enough, does anyone have some tips on this problem?
