While SQL Server has nothing to offer by way of the "cool features" of encapsulation and package state like you are used to , you can organize your stored procedures into schemas. In enterprise manager, these procs are still all listed together which makes for a HUGE treelist if you have hundreds of procs. I too miss the organization and cool features of Oracle packages. However, all platforms have their strengths. NOTE: Writing stored procedures in the .NET language DOES give you encapsulation and state. It still does not however separate them in the EM treeview in any special way.
