The F5.3 format requires the value to be between 0 and 9.999. If the average is more than that, or negative, it splats instead. To find what a reasonable format specification is, temporarily change the formats to F15.3 so you can at least see the values. I don't see why the experiment number fails to increment. Uh oh! Is the scope of i from the main program used in the subroutines?! There are no local declarations of them and implicit none is in effect, so I'm inclined to think this is a problem. An easy experiment to confirm would be to change the name of i in the main program to something totally different, like expidx , and see if there are compilation errors. (There are four places that need changing.)
