I went down a similar path and came across JOpt . The project is probably worth your attention, but one of the maintainers of that project pointed me to a more mature and active project called Choco , which isn't mentioned in the Wikipedia article. More recent versions of Choco create a clear separation between the constraint model specification and the solver. For a quick overview, you may be interested in reviewing Choco's documentation . As a Java programmer interested in constraint-based programming, you might want to check out JSR 331 , a specification for a constraint-based programming API packaged under javax.constraints. (Choco is involved in the coregulation of this JSR.)
