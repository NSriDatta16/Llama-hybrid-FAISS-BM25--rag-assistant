Here is what I could find in study notes from my econometrics class: Average squared error (ASE) is given as: $$ASE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n[\widehat{m}_h(X_j)-{m}_h(X_j)]^2 w(X_j)$$ where $\widehat{m}_h(X_j)$ is the fitted value from the kernel regression, $w(x)= \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{K(\frac{x-X_i}{h})}{\sum_{j=1}^nK(\frac{x-X_j}{h})}$ with K being the chosen kernel function and $h$ is the bandwith. The mean average squared error (MASE) is as follows: $$MASE=E[ASE\vert X_1=x_1,...,X_n=x_n]$$ The suggested approach for finding the optimal (in a minimum MASE sense) bandwith $h$ is cross validation: $$CV(h)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n[Y_i-\widehat{m}_{h,i-1}(X_j)]^2w(X_i)$$ where this must be minimized for $h$. It can be shown that MSE at a given x is a function of both variance and bias, and depends on the number of data points being 'close' and the curvature of the function.
