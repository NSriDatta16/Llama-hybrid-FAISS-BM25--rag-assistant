Java equivalent of .Net Solution file type

I'm new to Java and starting to organize my first project which will be a conversion from a .Net solution with several projects attached (one GUI project and several supporting class projects). I'm using Eclipse and I see project files, but I'm wondering is there a way to organize them into a "solution"? Something that links all the projects together. In .Net there is a solution file and you can use it to open and load all the projects and their files associated with the application. I see package and source folder, but they seem to be project specific (one project). I created a working set, but that just seems to keep the projects together in eclipse's views. Perhaps there is no need for this in Java for some reason, but I want to make sure I set this application up correctly initially
