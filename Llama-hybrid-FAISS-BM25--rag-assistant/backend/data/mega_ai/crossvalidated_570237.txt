What happens to a VAR when I standarize variables?

Suppose you have 6 or 7-time series that are stationary. But my question is what does happen to a VAR when I standardize all the variables of the VAR This makes that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation 1. What implications does the VAR with standardized data have?
