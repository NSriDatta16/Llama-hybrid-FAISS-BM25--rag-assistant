I personally think WPF is much faster to develop in than ASP.Net, however if you are building an estimate make sure you build in plenty of padding for the learning curve. I have worked with both and prefer WPF by far. I find it much faster and easier to work with, and creating the UI I want seems so easy compared to anything in Winforms or Web-based. For example, it is not a problem to do things like create oddly-shaped buttons (starburst, round, etc), create dropdowns w/ checkboxes to filter data, create datagrids which have different UIs for different rows based on the data, popups that make the background semitransparent or blurry, or draggable objects that actually show the object being dragged. These are all things I have played with which are very simple in WPF. When I first started working with WPF there wasn't a lot of support out there for it, but I believe that has changed. Most problems I encounter have a solution somewhere online, or the answer can be obtained quickly by asking on SO The one limitation I see with WPF is that it is tied with the .Net framework
