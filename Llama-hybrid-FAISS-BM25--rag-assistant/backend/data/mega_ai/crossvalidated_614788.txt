From what I understand, you are going to take all possible combinations of two people in group A and take the distribution of the number of metabolites shared by both people in a random pair of people from A, and compare that distribution to the distribution that you would get from the same statistic with group B, and show that a random pair of individuals in group A usually have more metabolites than a random pair of individuals in group B, regardless of how large is the average difference when group A pairs have more metabolites or when group B pairs have more metabolites? You will want the Wilcoxon rank sum test. I caution you in the interpretation of this highly non-parametric test. Just because group A pairs have more metabolites the majority of the time, group B pairs can still have a higher average number of metabolites, if the group B distribution is more skewed right. With that out of the way, I don't think you can specify the power without specifying the underlying distribution of metabolites in the population of people who could end up in sample A and the population of people who could end up in sample B. I could give you the power if you made some simple assumptions about those distributions, but it would require more than the mean and variance, because the nature of non-parametric estimation is we start without assumptions about the distribution. The test statistic is $U=\underset{i=1}{\overset{n_A}{\sum}} \underset{j=1}{\overset{n_B}{\sum}} .5*(x_i \geq y_j)+.5*(x_i>y_j)-\frac{n_A*n_B}{2}$ , where $x_i$ and $y_j$ are random pairs from groups A and B and $n_A$ and $n_B$ are the number of possible pairs from groups A and B, $\frac{20*19}{1*2}=190$ . To get the p-value, take $z=\frac{U}{\sigma_u}$ , $\sigma_u=(\frac{n_1*n_2*(n_1+n_2+1)}{12})^{.5}$ , because z is approximately standard normal.
