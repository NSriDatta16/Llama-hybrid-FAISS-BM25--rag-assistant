Organising a Lunene Directory

I have a set of records. Each record can have multiple skills and a single state. So you might have a record of skills a, b and c and a state of Victoria. I need to be able to search the directory for any records that have say skill a in Victoria or skill a and c in Victoria. I'm having trouble creating an effective directory that will allow me to search in the manner I want. At first i created a directory with skills: a b c state:vic then i tried skills: a,b,c state:vic But searching these is not giving me the correct results. In fact when i have a query; skills:a,b AND state:vic, skills: a OR b AND state:vic, skills: a OR skills:b AND state:vic the above all return a set of records for skills: a AND state:vic . Any thought? EDIT Since posting this I have gotten it to work but am unsure if this is the right approach. I have combined all the skills into a single field and space seperated them. The skills are in GUID format. Then in my search method I do this; queryString = "skills:(skill1 OR skill2 OR skill3) AND state:Vic"; Query query = parser.Parse(queryString); This works fine and it's very quick but is creating a queryString really the way to go with this or is there a better way?
