can i use random forest for feature selection and then use poisson regression for model fitting?

Variables that are important in random forest don't necessarily have any sort of relationship with the outcome. So would it be wise to use random forest to gather the most important features and then plug those features into a poisson regression model?If not, what other approach can be used for feature selection?(independent variables are categorical and dependent variable is count).
