Visual Studio TFS build with code coverage

Essentially what I would like to do is write a visual studio build script that will only build the solution if my code coverage requirements have been met. So essentially, after compiling and running the automated testing of the solution, I want to pass the build (working with Team Foundation server) only if a certain % of the code is covered by testing. Any input is highly valued; resources, a solution, or even "that's impossible" Thank you!
