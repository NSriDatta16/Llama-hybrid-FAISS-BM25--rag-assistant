The method suggested by Jed Smith works, but I was sure there was a simpler way. The req.headers_in variable contains all the header info, and you can easily access the user agent using mod_python by calling: req.headers_in[ 'User-Agent' ] It is not necessary to call req.add_common_vars() when using this method.
