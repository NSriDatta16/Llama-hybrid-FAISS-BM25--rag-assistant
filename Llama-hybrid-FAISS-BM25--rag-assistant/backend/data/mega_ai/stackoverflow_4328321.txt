I recommend Spring Security . It is easy to configure, and very flexible. It can handle everything from simple login, to annotated access controls on methods, to various complicated login schemes. It does have a fairly complicated API, but there is plenty of documentation, and you can be sure others are using it. If you just want simple login, it is really easy to set up. More info here . Per @robbbert suggestion, here is an alternative -- the Shiro plugin. I cannot speak to its reliability/community/expandibility.
