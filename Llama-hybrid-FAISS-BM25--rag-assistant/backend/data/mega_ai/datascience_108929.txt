After a lot of research, I figured out how to replace pronouns with their respective subject. It makes use of neuralcoref which is a pipeline extension for spaCy 2.1+ which annotates and resolves coreference clusters using a neural network. However, it only works with spacy v2 and python3.7 I tested it on conda environment with following tools version python==3.7 spacy==2.1.0 neuralcoref The solution goes like this import spacy import neuralcoref nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm') neuralcoref.add_to_pipe(nlp) doc = nlp("Coffee is good but it wasn't hot enough!") print(f'\n[REPLACED]:\n{doc._.coref_resolved}') # output Coffee is good but Coffee wasn't hot enough! More sample outputs [Enter your text]: Joe was the top performer of last year's dance competition, he is also a good singer [REPLACED]: Joe was the top performer of last year's dance competition, Joe is also a good singer [CONTINUE(Y/N)?]: y [Enter your text]: Paul was amazing and so was our waiter I loved the squash pizza and the dessert he recommended will definitely come back soon. [REPLACED]: Paul was amazing and so was our waiter I loved the squash pizza and the dessert Paul recommended will definitely come back soon. I am still trying to figure out, a better way for splitting the sentence. Will update the answer once I figured this out.
