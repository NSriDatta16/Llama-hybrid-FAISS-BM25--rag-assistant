Packing problem

I want to write a little helper utility to organize my digitized audiobooks collection. I have a set of folders which I need to write to CDs. The folders can not be split: each folder goes onto one disk. I want to fill the disks most efficiently: Minimize the number of disks, and The number of disks being equal, maximize the storage available of the least filled disk ( 80 + 20 remaining space is better than 50 + 50 ). Which algorithm should I use?
