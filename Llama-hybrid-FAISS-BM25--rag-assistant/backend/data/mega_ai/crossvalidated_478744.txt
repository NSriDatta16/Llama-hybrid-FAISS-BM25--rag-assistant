PCA while reducing the number of features does not care about the class labels. The only thing that it cares about is preserving the maximum variance which may not always be optimal for classification task. L1-Reg on the other hand pushes those features towards zero that do not have much correlation with the class labels. Hence, L1-Reg strives to reduce the number of features while also getting good classification performance. To avoid under-fitting, we can always do hyper-parameter tuning to find best lambda.
