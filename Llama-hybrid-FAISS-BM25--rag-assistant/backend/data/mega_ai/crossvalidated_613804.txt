Maximum likelihood of sample mean

It is an easy computation to show that given some data sampled from the binomial, gaussian, Poisson, or exponential distribution, the MLE of the mean of the distribution is the sample mean. However, for the uniform distribution, this is not true (the MLE is the average of the maximum and the minimum of the data). So, the question is: is there any sort of characterization of distributions for which the sample mean is the MLE of the mean?
