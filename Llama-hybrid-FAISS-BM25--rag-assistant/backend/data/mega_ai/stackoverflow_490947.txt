How can I allow a user to always allow my flash app to access the microphone?

We've got a flash application which has started displaying some rather irritating behavior. Every time the user logs into the site, they see a warning dialog from flash asking them if they want to allow our site to access their microphone for recording: http://www.teragon.org/stuff/SO/naggy-flash.png Sorry; I can't get my machine to show that dialog in English, but it basically says, "Should (the server name) be allowed to access your webcam and microphone?". Once the user clicks "Close", everything works as normal. The problem is, when "Remember" (Kom ih√•g) is selected, it only remembers if the user had chosen "allow" or "deny", but the dialog still is shown every time they log in. Is some setting in our flash app preventing this preference from being correctly stored? How do I make it so that when the user clicks "Remember", then it remembers not to be shown at all? Edit : This behavior was recently introduced, meaning that some time ago, "remember" really meant "remember", but now it asks every time. I'm not sure whether this is caused by flash 10, or a newer version of our software.
