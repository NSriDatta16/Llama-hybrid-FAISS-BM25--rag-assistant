Please read the whole referenced Wikipedia article. There is a lot of background. My recommendation is to distinguish assessment of central moments from "bayesian" analysis of the distribution as a whole. The one of main usage of bootstraping nowadays is assessment of confidence intervals, where the assumptions of normality (or some other expected properties) are not valid. Be careful as the bootstrap method is not recommended for fat tailed distribution. Easy to imagine that if you do not have extreme values from such distribution in the sample then the assessment will be broken. Now one of the most important that for very complex use cases we could obtained the confidence intervals without any mathematical understanding of the process. We could simple repeat n times the model with resampled data and get the distribution of results.
