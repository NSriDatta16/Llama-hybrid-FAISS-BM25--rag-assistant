Why are my results for a Chi-Squared-test wildly different from the results of logistic regression

thank you for taking the time to read my question. So, I have the following issue: I am trying to establish whether or not two categorical variables are associated (according to what we know, they really should be). At first, I used a Chi-Squared-test; however, the subjects are clustered and the ICC is 0.15, so I decided to use a mixed logistic regression. However, I did not even get that far, because simply trying to establish the same association as in the Chi-Squared-test produced a completely different result. My data look like this: 'data.frame': 322 obs. of 3 variables: $ V1: Factor w/ 7 levels "A","B","C","D",..: 7 1 2 4 4 3 5 5 7 3 ... $ V2: Factor w/ 3 levels "yes","sometimes",..: 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 2 1 1 ... $ G : Factor w/ 23 levels "13",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... V1 and V2 are the variables of interest, G is the grouping variable, which I'll ignore for now. I then first calculated the Chi-Squared-test: > vdat3a vdat3b chisq.test(vdat3b) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: vdat3b X-squared = 36.29, df = 12, p-value = 0.0002909 Warning message: In chisq.test(vdat3b) : Chi-Quadrat-Approximation kann inkorrekt sein [Chi-Square Approximation may be incorrect, my translation - what does this tell me here?] > library(rcompanion) > cramerV(vdat3b) Cramer V 0.2412 Now, in order to (eventually) account for the clusters, I tried to do the same thing as a logistic regression: > log_model log_model Call: glm(formula = V1 ~ V2, family = binomial, data = vdat3) Coefficients: (Intercept) V2sometimes V2no 1.4104 -0.2934 -0.3988 Degrees of Freedom: 311 Total (i.e. Null); 309 Residual (10 Beobachtungen als fehlend gelÃ¶scht) Null Deviance: 324.6 Residual Deviance: 323.3 AIC: 329.3 > > modelChi $null.deviance - log_model$ deviance > modelChi [1] 1.315789 > chidf $df.null - log_model$ df.residual > chidf [1] 2 > chisq.prob chisq.prob [1] 0.5179407 > R2.hl R2.hl [1] 0.004053713 So no we go from a Chi-Squared-test that was significant with a substantial effect size (p to a log regression model that is not significantly different from a model without a predictor (p = 0.52, R2L and I just can't make sense of it. Anyone able to help?
