The easiest way is to break your data down into eight groups. You can do this by writing an occupation vector $x=(v_1,v_2,\cdots,v_7)$ where $v_i=1$ if you're in category $i$ and 0 otherwise. You need to set a reference category correponding to $v=(0,0,0,\cdots,0)$, say "lawyer". Then a simple logistic regression should do the job. Then you have a linear response: $Y=X\beta$ which you map with a logit function to a probability. This way you can see which categories influence more than others.
