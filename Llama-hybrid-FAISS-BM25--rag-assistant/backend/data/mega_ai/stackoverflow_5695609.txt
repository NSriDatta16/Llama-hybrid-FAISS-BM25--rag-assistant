You .... want to screenshot the login window? Use virtualization to make that easy If you want to do windows-login screens yourself, implement/replace MS GINA If I'm not wrong, I remember using UltraVNC running as a service was able to see the login screen just fine (on XP IIRC). After loggin in, you'd have to reconnect to get a connection with the actual session 0 (console session) of the desktop. YMMV but I'd look into that. There is pre-existing software that leverages the VNC protocol to make (remote or local) screen snapshots or screen casts.
