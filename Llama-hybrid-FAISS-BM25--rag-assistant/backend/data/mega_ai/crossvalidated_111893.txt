After having viewed the loadings in each factor, I use PCA as a tool to propose how to construct a new variable (that could be used elsewhere) that intuitively encompasses a shared attribute that have been outlined by a purely statistical technique. I do not recommend embracing a new factor without understanding why those variables could be possibly associated with the underlying factor. Even then, replication with new data, is needed to verify the new construct.
