Does MS-SQL support in-memory tables?

Recently, I started changing some of our applications to support MS SQL Server as an alternative back end. One of the compatibility issues I ran into is the use of MySQL's CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE to create in-memory tables that hold data for very fast access during a session with no need for permanent storage. What is the equivalent in MS SQL? A requirement is that I need to be able to use the temporary table just like any other, especially JOIN it with the permanent ones.
