The approach popularized by many authors is to judge if to include a random effect or not by using intraclass correlation . To compute it you use variances of all the random effects ($\sigma^2_0$, $\sigma^2_1$, ...) and variance of residuals ($\sigma^2_r$): $$\rho_0 = \frac{\sigma^2_0}{\sigma^2_0 + \sigma^2_1 + ... + \sigma^2_r}$$ However, this approach has its flaws and may give you misleading results so is discouraged by others - check this question . In most cases I know you include random effects because you are interested in estimating their influence - so it is not a question about "if" to include them, but rather "how big" they are. If you re-frame the question like this, then you can decide to drop the random effects if their values are (relatively) very small - that is, including them in the model does not change much in the estimates.
