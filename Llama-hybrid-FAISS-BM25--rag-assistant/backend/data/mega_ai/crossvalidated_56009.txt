The intuition you express in your second paragraph Now, say we stage the experiment n times (where n→∞ and experiments are independent); intuitively (and mathematically, too, I guess), because the probability is constant across "stagings" of the experiment, I have deduced (perhaps erroneously) that the probability (before any staging has taken place) of the event E occurring across n stagings is also given by p. is, indeed, erroneous. That is the probability of the event occurring on any one staging. The probability of it occurring at least once does tend to 1. For probability p with k stagings, the probability is $(1-p)^k$.
