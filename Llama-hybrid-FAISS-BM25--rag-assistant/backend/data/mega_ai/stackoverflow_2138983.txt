LAMP Whitescreen on Magento

First off, sorry if this shouldn't be on Stack Overflow, and instead should be on Server Fault / Super User. I am pretty sure it is a programming issue... I am getting a whitescreen on a Magento install for a PDF generation script. I usually attribute whitescreens to memory issues on Apache, but: I am getting no visible errors (display_errors on and error reporint E_ALL) I am getting no errors in Apache's logs The current memory for PHP is 256M which should be enough for an application like Magento. I am a bit stuck now as to what is happening, and although have Zend Framework experience, don't want to go into the code too much at the moment to try and debug what is happening. If anyone has any suggestions, it would be much appreciated. I have command line access to the server.
