Why do DragOver/Enter events require a background on Canvas?

I have a canvas which I want to accept drags on. I have added a dragOver and dragEnter event listeners to the canvas, but they only work if I drag over something inside the canvas (another child element). I realised that if I set the canvas' background colour to black it works. So I have set it's background transparency to 0, which works... buy is there a better way to work around this apparent need for the canvas to have something inside it to accept dragEvents. Thanks Rob
