The thresholds are on a logit scale, so it's the log-odds (just like in logistic regression, or ordinal logistic regression). The thresholds are just like the intercept in a regular regression model. They give the expected log odds of a value, given that the predictors (including latents) are equal to zero. If in a model with continuous variables, you constrained the intercept of a variable to be some incorrect value, then this will mess up your model fit, but it shouldn't change the rest of the model. Most of the time you can ignore the thresholds. You sometimes need to constrain one of them for identification purposes. For example, to identify the mean of the latent variable, you can either constrain the mean to zero, or constrain a threshold of an indicator (just like constraining one of the loadings to identify the variance). The default in Lavaan is to constrain the mean / intercept of the latent to be equal to zero. You constrain thresholds if you want to make the means/intercepts of latent variables comparable. E.g. if you have a multiple group model and want to compare the means of the latents, the default is to fix both means to zero. that doesn't make sense, so instead you constrain one of the means to zero, and constrain the thresholds to be equal across groups.
