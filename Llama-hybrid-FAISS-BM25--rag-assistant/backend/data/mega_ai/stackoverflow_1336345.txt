Does the sequence schema element guarantee order of child elements?

Given this xml schema (fragment): In this xml fragment: string1 string2 string3 can the elements occur in any order? Thus, are these two fragments of XML semantically equvalent: string1 string2 string3 string3 string2 string1 Or does the sequence element in the schema mean the elements have to occur in the same order to be semantically equivalent? Does the presence of the in the schema require the parser/deserializer to keep the elements in the order they exist in the xml text? If I understand correctly, normally (i.e. without a schema) there is no requirement to do so (even if most parsers usually do).
