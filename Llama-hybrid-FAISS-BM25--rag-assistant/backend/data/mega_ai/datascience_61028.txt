How CNN applies backpropagation to update its weights and biases?

I understand that the 3 main layers for CNN are convolutional layer, ReLU layer and pooling layer. However, I do not understand how CNN updates its weights and biases using backpropagation. I understand that backpropagation uses partial derivatives. But I do not see how they are used in CNN. Any reference is appreciated.
