Magento - Buy it now buttons and checkout process

Hey everyone! I was hoping to start using Magento for a very simple checkout landing page. I have a few questions regarding the capabilities of Magento: 1) I don't actually want to use the 'add to cart' button but rather a 'buy it now' button. So when a user clicks to purchase a product it automatically takes you to the checkout process. Does anyone know if this is possible to configure with Magento? 2) If I purchase an SSL certificate from somewhere like verisign.com can I keep users on my domain through the check out process? I'd also be willing to use something such as Google Checkout if it were possible to customize the look of the Google skin to match my site. 3) Is Google Check out like PayPal in that I transfer money from Google Checkout to a designated bank account? Thanks all. Any help is greatly appreciated.
