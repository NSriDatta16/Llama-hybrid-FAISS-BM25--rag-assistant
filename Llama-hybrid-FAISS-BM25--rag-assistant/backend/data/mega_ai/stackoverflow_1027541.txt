Here is a command line tool for sending SMTP messages. Just place the SMTP server's IP address in the config file and use command line statements to build an output file that is used for sending. Remember: if you write code that actually uses the Notes client, the client will need to be installed everywhere this code runs. http://glob.com.au/sendmail/ As for the SMTP server address, I would suggest contacting anyone in your organization that deals with messaging. Sometimes companies have a separate internal SMTP server set aside for just this purpose. Otherwise, you will need to look into the Configuration \ Servers \ All Server Documents section of the Notes Directory to find the SMTP servers address.
