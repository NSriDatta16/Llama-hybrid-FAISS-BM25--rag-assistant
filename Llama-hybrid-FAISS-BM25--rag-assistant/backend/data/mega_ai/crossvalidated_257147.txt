Yes, a Bayesian approach where you take other schools of the district as an example, could make sense. But the new school is different from the schools that are already there, and maybe it is better to look at new schools in other districts as a comparison. It depends on what kind of information you think is important to incorporate, how much time you have for a detailed analysis, and what kind of data you can get your hands on. For example, you may want to use the number of kids in the neighborhood in a model as well, that could be a very important one. Or from a different angle, you may start with a questionnaire on schools in the region that ask them about transferring, and use that data.
