Consider the definition of cointegration: There exists a linear combination of several time series that is stationary despite the fact that each of the individual series is nonstationary. Hence, per definition, cointegration can only occur if the individual series are nonstationary. To check for a relationship among stationary time series, you can, for example, use a standard t-test (possibly using robust standard errors to account for serial correlation).
