There are a number of issues here are you even certain you are doing a logistic regression? Assuming that is R, you’ve not specified the link function and i don’t know your data types if you are doing correlation, do correlation. If you are doing glm, do glm. Each method has accepted practice of follow up comparisons (regression = regression contrasts, glm = Tukey, Scheffe, etc etc). Mixing and matching is a quagmire. I suspect, but cannot prove, you’ve messed with your actual Alpha rate.
