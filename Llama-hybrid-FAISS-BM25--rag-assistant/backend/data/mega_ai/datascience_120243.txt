Why is my predictor value (continuous) perfectly correlated with my logit value (when testing logistic regression model assumptions)?

Question: Why is my predictor value (continuous) perfectly correlated with my logit value (when testing logistic regression model assumptions)? Code: # linearity in the logit for continuous var: check the linear relationship bw continuous predictor var and the logit of the outcome: inspect scatter plot bw each predictor and logit value # Select only continuous predictors glm_h2_a1 % dplyr::select(c(c_ns2)) predictors % mutate(logit = log(probabilities/(1-probabilities))) %>% gather(key = "predictors", value = "predictor.value", -logit) # create the Scatter Plots: ggplot(glm_h2_a1, aes(logit, predictor.value))+ geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "loess") + theme_bw() + facet_wrap(~predictors, scales = "free_y") Image: Note: More complex model with additional predictors do not all show such linearity:
