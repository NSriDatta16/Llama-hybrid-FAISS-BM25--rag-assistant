How does adding an irrelevant feature affect the accuracy of a model?

My main question is how could irrelevant features decrease the accuracy? Example: Lets say we have a feature and the data can be perfectly classified with 100% accuracy using SVM. How can the addition of a new irrelevant feature decrease the accuracy? Please answer this without example first and then use the example for easy understanding in a 2D plane.
