php URL decode get '+' from URL

So I am trying to encode/decode a url that when decoded will return the encoded + symbols from teh url. For example, I encode website.com/index.php?eq=1+12 which when encoded turns the + into %2B , as it should. When I retrieve the value from $_REQUEST['eq'] and use urldecode() it echo's as "1 12" . I cannot seem to get the decode to bring back the + so to speak. Am I doing something wrong here, or is there a more efficient/better way to go about doing this? Here is the exact encode/decode lines I use. Submit Page '; echo $send; Retrieval page
