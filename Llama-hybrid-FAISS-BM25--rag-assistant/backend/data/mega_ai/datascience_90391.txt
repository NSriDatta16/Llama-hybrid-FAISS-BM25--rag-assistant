Blocked in my project with reinforcement learning.. any help?

I would like advice on a problem I'm trying to solve. I'm stuck... Here's an example: I have continuous data from a person such as what was eaten for a week (calories, carbohydrates, protein and fat) and also the goal such as the desired weight. I want to do an action (without prior training) based on the values and the goal. The actions will consist of decreasing/increasing the number of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins or calories. I have started to use reinforcement training but I really don't know if it is the best approach? The goal of reinforcement learning will be to reach the desired body weight with all of the actions. One action can have a positive impact for a while and maybe a negative impact afterwards. For the decision making algorithm, I created my own... but I would like to use something else that is better... I'm stuck with the choice. Thanks!
