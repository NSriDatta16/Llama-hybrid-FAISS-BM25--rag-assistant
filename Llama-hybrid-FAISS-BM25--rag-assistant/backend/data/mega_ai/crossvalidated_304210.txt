I figured out a workaround, although the residual variance is not parsable in lme4 (as far as I know). One workaround is to create separate numeric dummy variables for white and rem . I made these white_dummy = 1 and another column rem_dummy = 1. Then I ran the following model: model3 and this creates the following random effects output: Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. Corr id white_dummy0 0.19631 0.4431 white_dummy1 0.39760 0.6306 0.06 id.1 rem_dummy0 0.18381 0.4287 rem_dummy1 0.39400 0.6277 0.24 provider_1 white_dummy0 0.06192 0.2488 white_dummy1 0.01334 0.1155 0.11 provider_1.1 rem_dummy0 0.02774 0.1666 rem_dummy1 0.03867 0.1966 0.00 Residual 0.17943 0.4236 Number of obs: 8606, groups: id, 1504; therapist_1, 39 However! The model failed to converge and this is likely due to the reduced number of observations at the therapist/rem level and the variance estimates are near zero. I am going to go the bayesian MCMCglmm route to attempt to fit this model.
