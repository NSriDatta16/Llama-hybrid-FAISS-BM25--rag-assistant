Sounds tricky. I have one suggestion/question for you. Don't know if it will help - but you sound like you're ready to try anything! It sounds like maybe the session manager on the new machine is checking the central session storage provider and, when it finds that the session storage is empty, then it's issuing a new session key. I think a solution may come from: - using Session_Start as you have above in order to insert something into Session storage - plus inserting a persistent Session storage provider of some description into the web.config - e.g. some of the oldest Azure samples provide a table based provider, or some of the newer samples provide an AppFabric caching solution. I know your design is not using the session storage, but maybe you need to put something in (a bit like your Session_Start), plus you need to define something other than in-process session management. Alternatively, you need to redesign your app around something other than ASP.NET sessions. Hope that helps - good luck!
