The wonderful book "Statistics as Principled Argument" by Robert Abelson doesn't discuss this particular question, but it does suggest the approach I take below. (I reviewed the book) I would say "Sure!" The multiple and simple regressions answer different questions. The key is whether the questions are reasonable. Multiple regression asks about the relationship of several variables to a dependent variable, controlling for each other. Simple regression asks about the relationship between one IV and one DV. Whether these questions are legitimate depends, in my view, not on whether some p is less than .05 but on whether the questions are reasonable and interesting. The presence of interactions is a different matter, but even there, it doesn't depend on whether the interaction is significant but whether it is big .
