There is a ton of code out there using MFC. I see these questions all the time is this still used is that still used the answer is yes. I work in a very large organization which still employs hundreds of people who write in cobol. If it has ever been used in the enterprise it will continue to be used until there is no more hardware to support it, then some company will pay someone to write an emulator so that the old code will still work. The navy still uses ships with computers with magnetic cores for memory and I'm sure they have people to work on them. Technology once created can never not be supported. its a bit of the case of Deus ex machina where large organizations aren't completely sure what their system do and have such an overriding sense of fear of brining the enterprise to its knees they have no desire to try out you new fangled technologies(BTW we pay IBM for best effort support on OS2). Also mfc is a perfectly acceptable solution for windows development given it is an object model which wraps the System API which is pretty much all that most people get out of .net. As an addendum and since this question is up for a bounty this is a quote from MS regarding mfc in VS 11 In every release we need to balance our investment across the various areas of the product. However, we still believe that MFC is the most fully-featured library for building native desktop applications. We are fully committed to supporting and maintaining MFC at a high level of quality. Hereâ€™s a short list of some of the issues that we fixed in MFC for Visual Studio 11: Here is the link if you want to read the full post
