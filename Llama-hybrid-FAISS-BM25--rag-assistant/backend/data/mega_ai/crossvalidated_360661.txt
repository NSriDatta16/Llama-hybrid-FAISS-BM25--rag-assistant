You could try these software packages >>> If the pdfs are "Adobe searchable" then you should be able to easily extract using Adobe Acrobat DC; exporting data to Excel. You can also use vba script with the Adobe library to split a large pdf file into individual pdf pages before exporting to Excel. If the pdfs are images / pictures created as pdf documents (not searchable in Adobe), you can use Tesseract-OCR and Ghostscript for alphanumerical-data extract to Excel. Once in Excel, should be easy to identify the "labels" and table structure; clean with vba. Monarch is expensive but might be a solution also...I don't think you need machine learning here - no need for convolutional neural networks, etc. to read data from pdf as image / picture. Hope this helps
