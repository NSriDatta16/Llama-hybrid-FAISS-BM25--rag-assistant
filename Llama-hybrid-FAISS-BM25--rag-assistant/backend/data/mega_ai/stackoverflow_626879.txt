Setting an object nil versus release+realloc

This is not a garbage collected environment I have a class instance variable which at some point in my runtime, I need to re-initialize with a different data set than it was originally constructed with. Hypothetically speaking, what if I have an NSMutableArray or an NSMutableDictionary , would it be more efficient to do something such as: [myArr release]; myArr = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init....]; or just, myArr = nil; Will myArr release the object and leave me without a pointer to the storage in memory so I can re-use myArr?
