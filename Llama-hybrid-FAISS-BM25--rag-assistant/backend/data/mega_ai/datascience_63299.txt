If your goal is solely predicting torque for a given engine, you can ignore hysteresis. A regression model will implicitly model hysteresis in the learned parameters of the model. If your goal is building a model hysteresis for a given motor, then you should systematically measure performance with different recent histories. Then apply a time series model to model the effect of recent history.
