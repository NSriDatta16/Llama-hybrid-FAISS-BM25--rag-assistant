To answer your specific question about why this happens -- on Cocoa we don't consider a drag to have started until the mouse has moved a few pixels. This ensures against 'accidental' drags if you're sloppy with the clicks. On Linux and Win32 the window toolkit can do the drag detection. If you just hold down the button the detection times out and the mouse down is delivered. On Cocoa we have no time out, which is why nothing happens until the drag is detected or a mouse up happens. That's a lot of detail, but the conclusion is that the behavior is inconsistent, and we should always be able to deliver the mouse down immediately, without waiting for the drag detection to complete. I don't see a workaround, since this is happening before the Control sees the event. See this bug which has patches for win32, gtk and cocoa SWT.
