Using Web Services instead of DLLs

I am looking to see what the consensus is for best practices or just plain sanity in writing apps. For this example I have the following: [HttpHandler] ClientRender.ProcessRequest(…) ClientFactory.GetInnerInfo(…) Services.ServiceConnect.GetCampaignService(…) [Web Service] Campaign.GetInnerClient(…) [Web Service] DAL.GetInnerClient(…) EnterpriseLibrary.CreateDatabase(…) EnterpriseLibrary.GetStroedProcCommand(…) EnterpriseLibrary.ExecuteReader(…) DAL.PopulateClientCampaignFromReader(…) DAL.ClientCampaignFromDataReader(…) Return up the call tree… Questions: What type of performance hits am I incurring by calling a Web Service from within a Web Service from within a HttpHandler? Would it not make more sense to rewrite this as an assembly rather than 2 Web Services? (And put the Web Services on top of the assembly for a WSDL publication.) We also have an admin website that leverages these same assemblies and it takes 2-3 days to “correctly” add a simple CRUD operation on one data entity. Would you argue for moving towards a more direct approach? Hope this makes sense and feedback is welcome.
