How to split UNSW-NB15 dataset (full dataset) to training/validating/testing set for training neural network properly?

I'm working on classifying UNSW-NB15 dataset into 2 categories (benign - malware) using neural network. The full dataset include about 2.000.000 benign samples and 300000 malware samples. I'm assuming that is the approximate proportion of real-life samples. So should I just randomly sample training/validating/testing set with the same benign/malware ratio but with different size (e.x 60 %, 20%, 20% respectively) or should I do it another way?
