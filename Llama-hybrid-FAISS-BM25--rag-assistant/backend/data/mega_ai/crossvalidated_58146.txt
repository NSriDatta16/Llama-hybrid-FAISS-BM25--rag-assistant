Decision Trees and Random Forests are actually extremely good classifiers. While SVM's (Support Vector Machines) are seen as more complex it does not actually mean they will perform better. The paper "An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms" by Rich Caruana compared 10 different binary classifiers, SVM, Neural-Networks, KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forests, Decision Trees, Bagged Decision Trees, Boosted Decision trees and Bootstrapped Decision Trees on eleven different data sets and compared the results on 8 different performance metrics. They found that Boosted decision trees came in first with Random Forests second and then Bagged Decision Trees and then SVM The results will also depend on how many classes you are actually classifying for.
