Finding Statistical Relationship

I know this is not a typical statistics question. But still I'm posting it here as I don't want to do data manipulation of this problem. I've the data in the following format: Year Yield Input_1 Input_2 2000 1000 100 22 2001 2001 188 43 2002 1665 150 59 Now, Input_1 affects yield at monthly level and yield of crop is at yearly level. Suppose, Input_1 is rainfall and we are considering how rainfall affects potato yield at that particular year. Suppose rainfall for a particular year is normal, but during potato cultivation season, there's excessive rain. So most of the potato crops died that year. So, I can't roll-up the rainfall data (by taking average or sum) from monthly to yearly level in this case. So, my question is how I can find relationship between monthly input_1 with yearly yield to capture the accurate relationship. I don't want to use dummy variables.
