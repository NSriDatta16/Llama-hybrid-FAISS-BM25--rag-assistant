Do I have to use logistic regression for data that had binary repeated measures?

I have a dataset that consisted of 0s and 1s originally, where I measured movement (yes or no) per time interval in individual tadpoles. They were grown in different conditions (density treatment groups), which is my main fixed predictor, along with body size, temperature etc. I wanted to have one "activity" value per individual so I averaged the 0s and 1s to get one value. Then I used logit transformations, and conducted linear mixed models (I have one random effect variable) on this dataset to determine the effect density (and other fixed predictors) on "activity". Is this method of analysis OK, or must I use logistic regressions on the original binary dataset? Is it bad practice to conduct statistics using these "means"?
