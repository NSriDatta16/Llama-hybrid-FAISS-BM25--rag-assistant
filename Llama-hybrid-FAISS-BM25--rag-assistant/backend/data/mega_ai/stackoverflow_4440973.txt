PHP: Change only a portion of a URL string?

I’m working on a small hoppy project where I want to replace a specific page on a URL. Let me explain: I’ve got the URL http://www.example.com/article/paragraph/low/ I want to keep the URL but replace the last segment /low/ with /high/ so the new URL is: http://www.example.com/article/paragraph/high/ I’ve tried different explode, split and splice but I just can’t seem to wrap my head around it and make it work. I can change the entire URL but not just the last segment and save it in a new variable. I’m pretty confidence that it is a pretty straight forward case but I’ve never worked that much with arrays / string-manipulation in PHP so I’m pretty lost. I guess that I have to first split the URL up in segments, using the "\" to separate it (I tried that but have problems by using explode("\", $string)) and then replace the last \low\ with \high\ Hope someone could help or point me in the right direction to what methods to use for doing this. Sincere Mestika
