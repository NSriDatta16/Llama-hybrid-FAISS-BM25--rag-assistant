Model comparison on different datasets + Non-nested model comparison

I actually have two questions. Similar questions unfortunatelly do not answer mine. 1)I realize that with anova(model1,model2) one can only compare two models if they are based on the same dataset. Are there any methods to compare two models based on different datasets if one dataset is a subset of another one, but there is an extra predictor in the bigger dataset? Smaller dataset contains only two-element items, and bigger one contains both two- and three-element items plus a predictor column to distinguish between two- and three-element items. 2)It looks like one can only compare two models with anova(model1,model2) if they are nested. Firstly, I have a hard time finding an "oficical" confirmation (documentation, paper, some statistics book), do you have anything in mind? Secondly, I want to compare two logistic regression models that differ in one predictor: DV ~ A + B + X vs DV ~ A + B + Y . X and Y measure the same thing (simple difference between two elements), but uses differenet scales for the elements. Is AIC my only option?
