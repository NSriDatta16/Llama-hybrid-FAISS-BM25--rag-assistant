Missing factor levels after logistic regression glm()

I would like to perform a logistic regression on a marketing data set (only categorical variables), of the form [outcome, $X_1$,$X_2$,$X_3$,$X_4$,$X_5$,$X_6$] I split the data set into a training set and a validation set. My problem: Predictor $X_1$ has originally 3 levels. The model using glm retains only 2 of these 3 levels. When I try to run the model on the validation set (where $X_1$ still has 3 levels) I get an error message stating that the factor $X_1$ has now a new level. How can I prevent the glm function from excluding factor levels? I don't mind if their coefficients are set to zero.
