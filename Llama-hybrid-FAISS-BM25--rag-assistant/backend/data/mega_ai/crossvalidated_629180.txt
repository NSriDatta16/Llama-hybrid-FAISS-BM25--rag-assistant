I agree with @rep_ho's "do whatever is commonly done with the data modality you are working with". However, if you are going to quote p-values (for example) you almost certainly need to do something about multiple comparisons correction ; for example, in the "'omics" world (microbiome data, RNAseq, etc.), people almost always use false discovery rate corrections (which are popular both because they actually do what people want — control the fraction of significant results that are false positives, rather than the overall rate of false positives — and because they are much less sever than methods (Holm, Bonferroni, etc.) than methods that control the overall error rate. It would be most elegant to fit a single model to all of your indices at once, with both index and subject as random effects; the reasons not to are it would make the full model very large (and harder to parallelize than fitting every index separately) it would be cool to model the correlation among indices, but that would almost certainly require advanced techniques (reduced-rank/factor-analytic models for the covariance) it might make significance testing of individual indices more difficult
