I'd use UNIVERSAL::require . It allows you to require or use a module from a variable. So your code would change to something like this: use UNIVERSAL::require; $ARGV[0]->use or die $UNIVERSAL::require::ERROR; $ARGV[0]::$ARGV[1](); Disclaimer: I did not test that code and I agree Robert P's comment about there probably being a better solution than passing these as command line arguments.
