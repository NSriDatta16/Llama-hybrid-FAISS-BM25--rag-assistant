There are a couple of good review papers on the topic of deep learning for forecasting: Neural forecasting: Introduction and literature overview Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting: Current Status and Future Directions And a very good presentation by the amazon team A word of warning though: I am a very big fan of LSTM based forecasting and I advocate for it alot in my various roles. But I would be the first to tell you to tread very, very carefully: The number of use cases where LSTM provide an advantage over traditional statistical models is very limited, and Deep Learning is very far from being an established theoretical topic, the way ARIMA or State Space Models are.
