This is not a case for logistic regression, which is what you might use if your dependent variable were binary. Assuming you are willing to make the assumptions underlying ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression , you could model Column 2 as a function of three categorical variables (assuming that Column 1 is categorical... e.g., if we say: $X_1 = 1$ when Column 1 is 1 and zero otherwise, $X_2 = 1$ when Column 1 is 2 and zero otherwise, $X_3 = 1$ when Column 1 is 3 and zero otherwise, then we can use the following model: $$ColumnTwo_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X1_i + \beta_2 X2_i + \beta_3 X3_i +\varepsilon_i$$ Here, our intercept term, $\beta_0$, would estimate the mean of Column 2 when Column 1 $= 4$, $\beta_1$ would estimate the difference between the mean values of Column 2 when Column 1 $= 4$ and $1$, and so on. Note that there are many possible ways you could code your categorical predictors. The above approach is known as dummy coding , but it is not the only option.
