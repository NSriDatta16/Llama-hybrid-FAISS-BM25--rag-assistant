Apple has some really good documentation on this, it is a bit tricky to get going but it does make the whole manifest process way more transparent. In addition, I find Safari (esp. Mobile Safari) shows these event responses more consistently than Firefox; not sure about Chrome though it should be pretty close to Safari. The root of your question though: Empty the manifest or add/remove a file to the manifest load the app re-add the manifest Re-load app. This is dirty way but I recommend taking the time to read though and implement the JS and so you can see for sure the manifest is getting updated. Google has a good post here . Basically you can build a series of if else tests with the window.applicationCache.status for a clear look at what the system is doing. From Apple: For example, you get the DOMApplicationCache object as follows: cache = window.applicationCache; You can check the status of the application cache as follows: if (window.applicationCache.status == window.applicationCache.UPDATEREADY)... If the application cache is in the UPDATEREADY state, then you can update it by sending it the update() message as follows: window.applicationCache.update(); If the update is successful, swap the old and new caches as follows: window.applicationCache.swapCache();
