Is the MCMC simply a probabilistic gradient descent?

I'm learning about Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and to my undifferentiated mind, they basically resemble gradient descent with a stochastic component replacing the gradient computation. Is this a correct understanding. If not what key difference am I missing?
