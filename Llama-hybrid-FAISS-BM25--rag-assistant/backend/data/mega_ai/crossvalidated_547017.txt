The chi-square test can be used for any contingency table where you are comparing observed counts against the counts expected among categories under a null hypothesis. So you could construct a 2 ( planChoice ) x 4 ( age / sex combinations) contingency table and do a chi-square test on that table. Another, more generally applicable approach would be to do a logistic regression with the binary planChoice as the outcome variable. Then you could get around your arbitrary old/young age cutoff and model age as a continuous predictor, including sex as a categorical predictor and an interaction of age with sex to see if the association of planChoice with age differs depending on sex . If you want to include continuous covariates in your model or have a large number of predictors, some form of binomial regression is preferable. Logistic regression is the most familiar such model, but you should know that other "link" functions besides the logit it employs can have their uses. In terms of agreement among tests, even the results of two "chi-square tests" on the same data will differ if one test uses the "continuity correction" (the default in R) and the other test doesn't (perhaps a better choice). The inherently discrete nature to the probability distribution in a contingency table means that nominal p-vales in chi-square tests don't always correspond to actual false-positive rates under the null hypothesis. Results with logistic regression thus will generally agree with those from a chi-square test, but not necessarily exactly.
