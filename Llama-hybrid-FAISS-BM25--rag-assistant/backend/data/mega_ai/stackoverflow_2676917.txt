Easy way to apply Joomla template styling to my own content

I have an application that is mainly a bunch of PHP files included in a Joomla! application by Jumi. I want to make the site look nicer, but I'd rather not reinvent the wheel. There is a RocketTheme template installed on the site, and I'd like to be able to leverage it or some of the other CSS used alongside it. Specifically, I want to decorate tables. Should I search for and include CSS classes directly into my tags by searching through the template's classes, or is there a framework I could use that automatically adds the right classes based on the current theme?
