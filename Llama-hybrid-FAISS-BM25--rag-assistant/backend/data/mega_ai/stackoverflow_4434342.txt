I'm new to CSLA but I understand the concepts and I already understand that it's not an ORM tool so quit beating that damn drum folks. There are features of CSLA I like but using them feels a bit like there is a magician behind the curtain. I guess if you don't mind not knowing about how it works then you can use the objects and they work fine. There is a large learning curve for beginners and I think it would benefit greatly by having 5-15 min. videos like Microsoft has for learning the fundamentals. Or how about releasing a companion book with the code instead of getting the code released and taking months to get the book out? Just sayin Mr Lohtka... We started building our stuff before the book and I struggled the whole time. But like I said, I'm new to it. We used CSLA. We made our objects fit their mold then used 10% of what the framework offered. Object level undo? Didn't use it. NTier flexibility? Didn't use it. We ended up writing enough business rule code that I thought the only thing we were getting out of CSLA was complexity. Some "long in the tooth" developers that know the framework used it as their hammer because they had a nail that needed hitting. CSLA was in their belt and my guess is a lot of proponents of the framework see things from that perspective too. I guess our seasoned developers are happy because it all makes sense to them. I guess if your organization doesn't have newbie programmers and you guys get bored by writing efficient and simple POCO objects with well formed patterns, then go for it. Use CSLA.
