The way I see it this question is more about how to receive video from and control Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) cameras rather than Android specific development. You should definitely see if there are any specific brands of cameras that your clients need to connect to. Generally the implementation for viewing live video is different for each camera manufacturer. If you have the liberty of choosing camera to support you might want to look into Axis . From my observations they make some of the most widely used cameras and they have a wide variety of cameras as far as resolution and features go. They even have a developers program that might be able to help you out. You might also want to check out Zoneminder a free open source Linux dvr application, maybe the source can give you some starting points on how to get video from the various ip cameras. I am sorry that I could not be of any more help but hopefully some of this information will help get you started.
