With recurrent neural networks you don't need to split the data into chunks. RNN processes the sequence sequentially , so the model theoretically can process sequences of any and varying sizes. In some cases you can split the data into chunks to simplify the code and for computational reasons, but not in this case. This can be done in cases where your aim is to predict next value given previous ones, so by processing data in chunks you shorten the history that you take into consideration for making predictions. In your case you seem to be using whole sequence to predict single value, so the only thing you could do is to truncate the series and ignore the beginning (use only the final chunk). So you are right that there's nothing to back-propagate if there is no target variable.
