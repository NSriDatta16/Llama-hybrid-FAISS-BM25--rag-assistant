MacOSX Promised files drag&drop howto?

It's not clear to me how to do drag&drop to Finder with dragPromisedFilesOfTypes:fromRect:source:slideBack:event: (NSCollectionView) I call the above method from mouseDown:, but (NSArray *)namesOfPromisedFilesDroppedAtDestination:(NSURL *)dropDestination isn't called at all. Any ideas how this should work (MacOSX 10.6, project compiled for 10.5, 64bit)? Thanks!
