Normally I do physical layer application as following: UI Presenter BusinessLogic DataAccess Entity But I'm changing my view on this organization. As I have done lot of projects and some of them demands maintenance and improvements. I start to think that this organization is too monolithic. Some authors like Ted Faison, Tomas Erl, Robert C. Martin, Andy Aunt says that this hierarchal approach is kind of naive. Anyway... Put your logic in separated projects and build them as distincted assemblies. Make hierarchal references and you'll have what you want.
