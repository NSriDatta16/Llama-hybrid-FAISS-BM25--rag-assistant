How do I enforce null checking?

I'm working on a large project where, even with 10s of 1000s of automated tests and 100% code coverage, we're getting a ridiculous number of errors. About 95% of errors we get are NullReferenceExceptions. Is there any way to enforce null-checking at compile time? Barring that, is there any way to automagically enforce null-checking in unit tests without having to write the tests for null cases myself?
