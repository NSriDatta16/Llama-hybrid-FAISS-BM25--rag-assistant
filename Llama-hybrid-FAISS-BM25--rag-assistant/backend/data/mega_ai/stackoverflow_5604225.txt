Is ExceptionList a String type? I would avoid this whole string concatenation business and just say Rows(rowNumberToDelete).Delete Shift:=xlUp Also, the whole .Select - Selection. vernacular is unnecessary and inefficient. That's how Excel machine-generates macros, but a thinking human shouldn't write like this.
