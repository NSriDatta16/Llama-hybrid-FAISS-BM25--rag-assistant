Good question. Actually there is a lot of confusion on this subject, mainly because both are quite new jobs. But if we focus on the semantics, the real meaning of the jobs become clear. Beforehand is better to compare apples with apples, talking about a single subject, the Data. Machine Learning and its sub-genre (Deep Learning, etc.) are just one aspect of the Data World, together with the statistic theories, the data acquisition (DAQ), the processing (which can be non-machine learning driven), the interpretation of the results, etc. So, for my explanation, I will broad the Machine Learning Engineer role to the one of Data Engineer. Science is about experiment, trials and fails, theory building, phenomenological understanding. Engineering is about work on what science already knows, perfecting it and carry to the "real world". Think about a proxy: what is the difference between a nuclear scientist and a nuclear engineer? The nuclear scientist is the one which know the science behind the atom, the interaction between them, the one which wrote the recipe which allow to get energy from the atoms. The nuclear engineer is the guy charged to take the recipe of the scientist, and carry it to the real world. So it's knowledge about the atomic physics is quite limited, but he also know about materials, buildings, economics, and whatever else useful to build a proper nuclear plant. Coming back to the Data world, here another example: the guys which developed Convolutional Neural Networks (Yann LeCun) is a Data Scientist, the guy which deploy the model to recognize faces in pictures is a Machine Learning Engineer. The guy responsible of the whole process, from the data acquisition to the registration of the .JPG image, is a Data Engineer. So, basically, 90% of the Data Scientist today are actually Data Engineers or Machine Learning Engineers, and 90% of the positions opened as Data Scientist actually need Engineers. An easy check: in the interview, you will be asked about how many ML models you deployed in production, not on how many papers on new methods you published. Instead, when you see announces about "Machine Learning Engineer", that means that the recruiters are well aware of the difference, and they really need someone able to put some model in production.
