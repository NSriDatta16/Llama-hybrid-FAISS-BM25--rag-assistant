The answer is no. JAGS is not designed for such models. However Stan provides such possibility. Stan provides optimization algorithms which find modes of the density specified by a Stan program. Such modes may be used as parameter estimates or as the basis of approximations to a Bayesian posterior; see Chapter 52 for background on point estimation. Stan provides three different optimizers, a Newton optimizer, and two related quasi-Newton algorithms, BFGS and L-BFGS (...) Notice that if uninformative prior is used then the posterior mode corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the parameters. If the prior is not uniform, the posterior mode is sometimes called the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimate. If parameters (typically hierarchical) have been marginalized out, it’s sometimes called a maximum marginal likelihood (MML) estimate. So with Stan you can use optimization algorithm rather then MCMC sampling and with using flat prior the results obtained are congruent with MLE estimates (see also this ).
