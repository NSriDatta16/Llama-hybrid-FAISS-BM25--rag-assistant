This being Python, the accepted way of doing this is generally to call something in the library that behaves differently depending on the version you have installed, something like: import somelibrary try: somelibrary.this_only_exists_in_11() SOME_LIBRARY_VERSION = 1.1 except AttributeError: SOME_LIBRARY_VERSION = 1.0 A more elegant way might be to create wrapper functions. def call_11_feature(): try: somelibrary.this_only_exists_in_11() except AttributeError: somelibrary.some_convoluted_methods() somelibrary.which_mimic() somelibrary.the_11_feature()
