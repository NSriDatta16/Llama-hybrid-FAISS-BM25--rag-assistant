I managed to bind a date property to a textbox without the validation from an ErrorProvider kicking in. I dragged a Textbox and an ErrorProvider on to a form and entered the following code in the formâ€™s code behind. Public Class Form1 Private _P As Person Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load _P = New Person With {.DOB = Date.Today} Me.TextBox1.DataBindings.Add("Text", _P, "DOB", True, DataSourceUpdateMode.OnPropertyChanged, Nothing) End Sub End Class Public Class Person Private _DOB As Date Public Property DOB() As Date Get Return _DOB End Get Set(ByVal value As Date) _DOB = value End Set End Property End Class I couldn't recreate the problem you were having. Maybe your line that databinds the textbox is different? or a different event on the textbox is setting the ErrorProvider? or a different control is setting the ErrorProvider?
