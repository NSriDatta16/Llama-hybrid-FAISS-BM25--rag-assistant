First you need to understand how WinForms apps work in general. Way down deep in the bowels of the Application.Run call is a piece of code often referred to as a message pump. This is an infinite loop that is calling GetMessage, TranslateMessage and DispatchMessage. Application.DoEvents, in essence, calls for once cycle of that loop. The DoEvents loop you're looking at would simply be doing this operation. Now why, exactly, that call is even needed I can't honestly say. That's pretty bad since I wrote the code , but in my defense, this code is nearly a decade old and I can barely remember what I did last week. If you remove the loop, what happens? I'm not seeing anything that indicates that you'd get drawing artifacts or failures to draw (which is the typical reason for adding the call), but this code was also written aganst CF 1.0, so it may well have been to overcome a runtime limitation. For what it's worth, I revisited and rewrote the code in 2009 and the rewrite doesn't have the loop (or even a Run method for that matter). BTW, there's a bug in Push that I see. The foreach loop has a return without doing a Monitor.Exit. I'd probably rewrite that method to use a lock or a finally block to call Monitor.Exit.
