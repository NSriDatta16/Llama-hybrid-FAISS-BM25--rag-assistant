I really can't see any pros in the second approach if all you want to do is perform statistical inference. First Approach Using the first approach, you will not only test for the existence of discrimination (whether race or gender based) but will also give you an estimate of the size of discrimination. For example, assume: gender = 1 for females race = 1 for non whites. If you get a result looking like this (notice number are fictitious and i added an intercept): salary ~ 2000 + 100*age - 200*gender + 300*industry - 400*race + 500*education where the variables gender and race are statistically significant at some reasonable level (e.g., p all other things being equal : females make on average 200 units (e.g. dollars) less and non-whites make on average 400 units less. You might even consider interactions. Second Approach This is really an indirect way of getting what you want. First build a model and then try to see whether its errors can be explained by gender and race. The estimated coefficient of the second model will only tell you how much of the error of the first model is explained by these variables. Your conclusions would essentially be: We need to include (or not, depending on the p-values) these variables in the first model estimated. So why work in circles and not do it all together in one step. The first approach will allow you to test the hypotheses you are interested in. The second would not do this directly . It would be more useful if you wanted to predict the outcome as closely as possible and thus wanted to focus on the errors and their minimization.
