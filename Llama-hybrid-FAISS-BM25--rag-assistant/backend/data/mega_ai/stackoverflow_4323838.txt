on java.awt.TextField you can add a MouseListener like so TextField field = new TextField(); field.addMouseListener(new MouseListener() { public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) { } public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) { } public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) { } public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) { } public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) { } }); The reason being that java.awt.TextField is a subclass of java.awt.TextComponent (which, in turn, is a subclass of java.awt.Component ). The Component class has a addMouseListener() method. Alternatively, you can replace MouseListener with java.awt.event.MouseAdapter has it encapsulates all of MouseListener , MouseWheelListener and MouseMotionListener methods. From JavaDoc (of MouseAdapter ): An abstract adapter class for receiving mouse events. The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as convenience for creating listener objects. Mouse events let you track when a mouse is pressed, released, clicked, moved, dragged, when it enters a component, when it exits and when a mouse wheel is moved.
