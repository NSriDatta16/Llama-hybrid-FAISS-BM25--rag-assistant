If you don't care some display information, just delete every "mousePosition.setText(...)" in the mouse listeners, they will result the unnecessary repaint() callings. Then, add two fields: "int rx, ry;", add/modify several methods as below: public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent event) { // mousePosition.setText("Dragged at [" + (x = event.getX()) + ", " // + (y = event.getY()) + "]"); // call repaint which calls paint x = event.getX(); y = event.getY(); compRectPos(); repaint(); } private void compRectPos() { rx = x1; ry = y1; w = x - x1; h = y - y1; if ( w The only problem I found is, that the rectangle doesn't appear when first drawn.
