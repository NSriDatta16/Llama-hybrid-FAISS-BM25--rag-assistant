Cookies and localStorage have two different uses, mainly cookies are for reading by the server side, and localStorage is for reading by the client slide. If your client side needs this data, then yes, use localStorage(you'll save bandwidth by not sending the cookies for every HTTP request[in the headers]). However if you are not, then just stick to using cookies. Making additional HTTP requests(via ajax) to send the server the cookies is a little overkill if all you are doing is having the server side access this data.
