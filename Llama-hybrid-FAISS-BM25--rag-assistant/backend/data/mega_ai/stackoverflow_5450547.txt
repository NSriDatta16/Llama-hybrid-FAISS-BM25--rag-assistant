Each step in the computation builds on the result of the previous step. If iterations of the loop run out of order, you will get a different result (the value of num from the previous iteration serves as input to the next iteration). For that reason, any approach (multithreading, massively parallel execution on a GPU) that runs steps in parallel will generally skew the result. Also, I would be surprised if the previously discussed loop unrolling is not already being done internally by the compiler to the extent that it actually makes a difference in execution time (compilers tend to be smarter than the average programmer these days, and loop unrolling has been around for a really long time as a compiler optimization technique).
