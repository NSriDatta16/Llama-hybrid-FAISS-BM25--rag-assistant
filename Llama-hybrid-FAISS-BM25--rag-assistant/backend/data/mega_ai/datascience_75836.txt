How to convert images (.jpg) to vectors for image classification

I'm currently working on a project that involves classifying an image as either that of a dog or that of a cat. The twist is that I want to do this without using Convolutional Neural Networks, mainly because I do not quite understand them yet and I don't just want to copy someone's code off of Github. I know that the classification algorithms on Sci-Kit Learn require the x input data to be in vectorized form for the classifier to fit the data, but I'm unsure of how to do this. It's easy to do with text data (feature_selection.text.CountVectorizer/TfidfVectorizer), but I have no idea how this works with images. How do I convert .jpg image files to vectors/matrices so that the models on SK-Learn understand it? Thanks in advance, and I'm sorry if this is a stupid question.
