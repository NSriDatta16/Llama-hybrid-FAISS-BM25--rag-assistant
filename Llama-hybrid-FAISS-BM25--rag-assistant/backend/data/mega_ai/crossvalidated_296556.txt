Why do we normalize variables in classification, but not regression

I understand that we need to normalize data for classification problems because otherwise the variable with the larger scale will dominate the result. But why don't we normalize for linear regression? Could someone please provide an intuitive explanation or an example to explain the difference between classification algorithms (like logistic regression) and linear regression? Thanks!
