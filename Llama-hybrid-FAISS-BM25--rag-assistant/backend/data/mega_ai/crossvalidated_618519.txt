Monte Carlo simulation to get stationary distribution of a complex system

I was wondering if I could get some help with my problem. I have a complex Markov chain where I cannot track its transition analytically. Instead, I decided to simulate $N$ numbers of particles for $T$ periods to get the particles' stationary distribution. However, given that I have no theoretical benchmark to compare if this $N\times T$ simulation results really give me the stationary distribution, I had two questions in mind. Ideally, $N$ should go to infinity to erase the error from discretization, and $T$ should also go to infinity to erase the error from initial conditions. Since this is impossible, what I do is as follows. I simulate for different $T$ for $N=1,000$ and check from which $T^{*}$ the distribution stays relatively stable. Then I take the average (equal-weighted sum of probability mass) of the distributions of $T^{*}+1$ to $T^{*}+5$ . I thought this was as if I have $N =5,000$ samples. The other way I thought of was to simulate five times of $N=1,000$ and $T=T^{*}$ and average them out. I wondered if any of these two ways is a valid method.
