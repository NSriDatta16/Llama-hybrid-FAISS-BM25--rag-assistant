Why are you passing your private array to another object? It's not so private when you let other objects handle it. As s-bug said, you should implement the accessors and use mutableArrayValueForKey: to mutate the property. I add that you should not be exposing that private array at all â€”your someArray method should return an immutable copy of the array. Furthermore, I call your attention to Jason Coco's comment on s-bug's answer. To paraphrase him, you should probably use an NSArrayController as an additional step of separation between myObservee and myObserver . This is a very good suggestion, and if you don't have a specific reason to directly observe the property, you should take it. (Among the benefits is that you can then use Bindings to connect views to the new array controller.)
