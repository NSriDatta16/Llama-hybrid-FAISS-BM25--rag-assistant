Regression with repeated measures in Matlab

Is there a way to perform multiple logistic regression on repeated measures data using Matlab? I have a data set containing a daily measurement recorded from 20 participants for 60 days. I am calculating 18 features for each participant for each day. I wish to determine if there is a relationship between each of these features and a 8 binary response variables, also recorded for each participant each day. What is the best way to do this in Matlab? My question is related to a previous question
