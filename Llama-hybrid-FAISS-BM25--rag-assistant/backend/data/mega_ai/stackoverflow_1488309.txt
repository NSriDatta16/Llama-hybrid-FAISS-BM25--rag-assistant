I have tried using an agent job to copy to a share. I use net use to make sure the current context has a mapped drive , then i xcopy the files to that share. When i launch the job manually, it says it starts, but never completes. The volume of data is such that 10 minutes should be more than enough. i dont see any progress indicators in the agent log. Any ideas on where i can look to see what is happening. Using timestamps as an indication, I believe that NO files are being copied. Hmmmm.... any thoughts? greg
