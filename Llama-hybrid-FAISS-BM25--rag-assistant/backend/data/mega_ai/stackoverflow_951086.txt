Please refer to the following link obtained doing a Google search (first result returned): http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5b50fdsz.aspx Pay special attention to this part: When this method is invoked on a thread, the system throws a ThreadAbortException in the thread to abort it. ThreadAbortException is a special exception that can be caught by application code, but is re-thrown at the end of the catch block unless ResetAbort is called. ResetAbort cancels the request to abort, and prevents the ThreadAbortException from terminating the thread. Unexecuted finally blocks are executed before the thread is aborted.
