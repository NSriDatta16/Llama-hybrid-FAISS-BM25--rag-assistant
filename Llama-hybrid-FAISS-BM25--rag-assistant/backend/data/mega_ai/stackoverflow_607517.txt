I am not an SQL Server expert, but in general, for database Sizing, the best way to go forward is to understand the schema little bit. For example, are there partitions present in the database ? Are there lot of indexes etc. Now Multiply number of records coming to the database in each transaction with the frequency of transactions per hour. This gives the total number of records coming to the database per hour. Multiply this with the average row size, this provides the size of the database without partition and index space overhead. To calculate partition overhead, need to understand the type of partition like range partition or hash partition etc, number of partitions that will be created per hour or per day and add up the space overhead for partitions. Usually this number needs to be bumped up by 50% to estimate the size of the database. In case of network, there are many ways to do it. I run etheral to capture the network traffic. If you capture network traffic, it becomes interesting - how the seasonality of the data is - like when the peack hours are, what is the max usage of bandwidth at the busy hours etc. Then you need a good tool to do the forecasting - like which will take care of seasonality in the data, understand the trend of the data and forecast approximately what will happen if you increase the load. A simple graph and a line fitting curve using y=mx+c will also help you here.
