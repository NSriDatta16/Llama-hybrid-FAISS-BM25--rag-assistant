rain the model, and deploy it using TensorFlow Serving. TensorFlow provides a stable Python Application Program Interface (API), as well as APIs without backwards compatibility guarantee for Javascript, C++, and Java. Third-party language binding packages are also available for C#, Haskell, Julia, MATLAB, Object Pascal, R, Scala, Rust, OCaml, and Crystal. Bindings that are now archived and unsupported include Go and Swift. TensorFlow.js TensorFlow also has a library for machine learning in JavaScript. Using the provided JavaScript APIs, TensorFlow.js allows users to use either Tensorflow.js models or converted models from TensorFlow or TFLite, retrain the given models, and run on the web. LiteRT LiteRT, formerly known as TensorFlow Lite, has APIs for mobile apps or embedded devices to generate and deploy TensorFlow models. These models are compressed and optimized in order to be more efficient and have a higher performance on smaller capacity devices. LiteRT uses FlatBuffers as the data serialization format for network models, eschewing the Protocol Buffers format used by standard TensorFlow models. TFX TensorFlow Extended (abbrev. TFX) provides numerous components to perform all the operations needed for end-to-end production. Components include loading, validating, and transforming data, tuning, training, and evaluating the machine learning model, and pushing the model itself into production. Integrations Numpy Numpy is one of the most popular Python data libraries, and TensorFlow offers integration and compatibility with its data structures. Numpy NDarrays, the library's native datatype, are automatically converted to TensorFlow Tensors in TF operations; the same is also true vice versa. This allows for the two libraries to work in unison without requiring the user to write explicit data conversions. Moreover, the integration extends to memory optimization by having TF Tensors share the underlying memory representations of Numpy NDarrays whenever possible. Extensions TensorFlow also offers a variety of libraries and extensions to advance and extend the models and methods used. For example, TensorFlow Recommenders and TensorFlow Graphics are libraries for their respective functional. Other add-ons, libraries, and frameworks include TensorFlow Model Optimization, TensorFlow Probability, TensorFlow Quantum, and TensorFlow Decision Forests. Google Colab Google also released Colaboratory, a TensorFlow Jupyter notebook environment that does not require any setup. It runs on Google Cloud and allows users free access to GPUs and the ability to store and share notebooks on Google Drive. Google JAX Google JAX is a machine learning framework for transforming numerical functions. It is described as bringing together a modified version of autograd (automatic obtaining of the gradient function through differentiation of a function) and TensorFlow's XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra). It is designed to follow the structure and workflow of NumPy as closely as possible and works with TensorFlow as well as other frameworks such as PyTorch. The primary functions of JAX are: grad: automatic differentiation jit: compilation vmap: auto-vectorization pmap: SPMD programming Applications Medical GE Healthcare used TensorFlow to increase the speed and accuracy of MRIs in identifying specific body parts. Google used TensorFlow to create DermAssist, a free mobile application that allows users to take pictures of their skin and identify potential health complications. Sinovation Ventures used TensorFlow to identify and classify eye diseases from optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. Social media Twitter implemented TensorFlow to rank tweets by importance for a given user, and changed their platform to show tweets in order of this ranking. Previously, tweets were simply shown in reverse chronological order. The photo sharing app VSCO used TensorFlow to help suggest custom filters for photos. Search Engine Google officially released RankBrain on Octobe
