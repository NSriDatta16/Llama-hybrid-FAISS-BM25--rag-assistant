I have used a style of registering scripts/css I first saw here . You register your scripts in code and they are then minified, mashed, cached and included in one place. I extending this approach to allow grouping of scripts. So you could include "master page" scripts in your "default" group these would be outputed on your master page. Child pages could register your own groups. Done well it's very elegant and your get a noticable performance boost and make YSlow happy. Cheers,
