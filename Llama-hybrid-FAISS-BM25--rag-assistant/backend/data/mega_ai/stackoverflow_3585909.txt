TFS does not currently allow the timestamps to be set when migrating changes. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2008/09/17/migration-toolkit-and-tfs-to-tfs-updates.aspx has more information, with the one of the key parts being: "The core issue is with version control and stems from the fact that we have a single monotonically increasing changeset number that updates anytime any checkin in performed. There is a direct correlation between the changeset number and the time that an operation occurred. An invariant of the system is that if one changeset number is greater than another, then its date/time is also greater." This discourages going into the TFS database and manually changing timestamps because there may be adverse side effects.
