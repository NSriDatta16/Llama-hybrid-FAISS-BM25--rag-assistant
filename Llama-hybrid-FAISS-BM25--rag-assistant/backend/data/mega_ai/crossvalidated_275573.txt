Machine Learning a Bijective Function

Is there any research on learning a bijective function from data? For example, let's imagine that we're trying to learn to assign four random musicians to instruments in a band. We have: lead guitar rhythm guitar drums bass We can rate any musician on say 5 quantifiable skills (timing, creativity, guitar, drums, bass). For training, we have a corpus of previous bands, each one mapping four musicians to the four instruments. How do we learn a function to map a new band to the four instruments?
