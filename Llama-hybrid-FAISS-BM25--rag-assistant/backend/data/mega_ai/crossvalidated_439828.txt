Although regression trees with constant fits in the terminal nodes are still much more widely used in practice, there is a long history of literature on regression trees that fit regression models (or other kinds of statistical models) in the nodes of the tree. RECPAM by Ciampi et al. (1988) is pioneering work in the statistical literature, already focusing on survival models in the nodes. M5 by Quinlan (1992) is the first algorithm published in Machine Learning. Other algorithms include GUIDE (Loh 2002), FT (Gama 2004), RD and RA trees (Potts & Sammut 2005), and MOB (Zeileis et al. 2008). An overview of several of these, focusing on MOB in the illustrations, is given by Rusch & Zeileis (2013). The algorithms differ somewhat in the degree to which you have to explicitly specify the regression model considered for the nodes (e.g., as in MOB) vs. using all variable in both the regression and the partitioning (e.g., in M5). R packages lmtree() in the partykit package (based on MOB) M5P() in the RWeka package (approximating M5) Previous answers (by @Momo) Advantage of GLMs in terminal nodes of a regression tree?
