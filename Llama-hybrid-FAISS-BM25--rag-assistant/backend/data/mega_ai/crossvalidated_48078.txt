Well, support vector machines (SVM) are probably, what you are looking for. For example, SVM with a linear RBF kernel, maps feature to a higher dimenional space and tries to separet the classes by a linear hyperplane. This is a nice short SVM video illustrating the idea. You may wrap SVM with a search method for feature selection (wrapper model) and try to see if any of your features can linearly sparate the classes you have. There are many interesting tools for using SVM including LIBSVM , MSVMPack and Scikit-learn SVM .
