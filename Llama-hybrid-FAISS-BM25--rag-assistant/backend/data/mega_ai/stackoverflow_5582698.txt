Yes it is possible but you will have to post a bit of source code, to see what you have done so far. I found this link that maybe is interesting to you: http://java-swing-tips.blogspot.com/2008/04/drag-and-drop-tabs-in-jtabbedpane.html It explain how to drag and drop tabs, maybe you can apply the same principle to your idea. Also in this forum there is a similar question, maybe you wanna have a look: How to implement draggable tab using Java Swing?
