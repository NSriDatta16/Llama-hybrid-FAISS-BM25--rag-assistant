What are the indexes on employees? You better have an index on employeeid. And you likely do have one as a consequence of declaring employeeid as the primary key. You might get better performance with an index on managerid as well. Try it. This has to be balanced against slower performance when inserting new employees or reorganizing managing relationships.
