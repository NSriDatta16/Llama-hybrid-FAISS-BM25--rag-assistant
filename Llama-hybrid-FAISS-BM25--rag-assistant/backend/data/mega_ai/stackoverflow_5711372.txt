Zend Framework Invalid controller specified excepection

Hi I have a problem trying to configure Zend Frame work in test server, I have the project working fine in my local mac computer, I upload all the file to my root html docs in my test server, exactly like I have it in my local, but for some reason I can't found my controllers, the error I have is this An error occurred Page not found Exception information: Message: Invalid controller specified (MessageBroker) Stack trace: #0 /var/www/html/magentoreviewsZF/library/Zend/Controller/Front.php(954): Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Standard->dispatch(Object(Zend_Controller_Request_Http), Object(Zend_Controller_Response_Http)) #1 /var/www/html/magentoreviewsZF/library/Zend/Application/Bootstrap/Bootstrap.php(97): Zend_Controller_Front->dispatch() #2 /var/www/html/magentoreviewsZF/library/Zend/Application.php(366): Zend_Application_Bootstrap_Bootstrap->run() #3 /var/www/html/magentoreviewsZF/public/index.php(26): Zend_Application->run() #4 {main} Request Parameters: array ( 'controller' => 'MessageBroker', 'action' => 'index', 'module' => 'default', ) I have see in other post that changing the RewriteBase in the htaccess do the trick, but don't work for me, also I have the default structure, also the index controller and the error controller works, if I go directly to their path. so is working is just my MessageBroker controller is not been found, why!, please anybody can point me to the right direction, I really don't know what else to do, thanks!!!
