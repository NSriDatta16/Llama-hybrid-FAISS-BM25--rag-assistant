Calling a remote COM+ ServicedComponent from a C# client

I have a serviced component installed in a COM+ server application. I want to create an instance from a remote client. The client needs to be able to specify the server machine's name dynamically. How do I do this? I tried using Activator: (XSLTransComponent.XSLTransformer)Activator.GetObject( typeof(XSLTransComponent.XSLTransformer), serverName ); But I get this: System.Runtime.Remoting.RemotingException: Cannot create channel sink to connect to URL 'server'. An appropriate channel has probably not been registered. at System.Runtime.Remoting.RemotingServices.Unmarshal(Type classToProxy, String url, Object data) Do I need to register a channel? If so, how? Another idea is to use Marshall.BindToMoniker, but how do I specify a moniker for a remote object hosted on COM+ on server x?
