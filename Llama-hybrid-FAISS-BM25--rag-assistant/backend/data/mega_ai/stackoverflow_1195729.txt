I would recommend creating a new item, that persists and contains only the pieces you are concerned with. This seems like it might be easiest, and would allow you to separate the concerns of gathering/manipulating the data and the final storage and display of the data. You could even have the persistent objects be created by passing in the other object during construction, and then use annotations/xml configurations to persist the object into the RDBMS. Just my 2 cents.
