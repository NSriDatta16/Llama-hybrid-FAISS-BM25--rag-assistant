I disagree with this question as it suggests that machine learning and statistics are different or conflicting sciences.... when the opposite is true! machine learning makes extensive use of statistics... a quick survey of any Machine learning or data mining software package will reveal Clustering techniques such as k-means also found in statistics.... will also show dimension reduction techniques such as Principal components analysis also a statistical technique... even logistic regression yet another. In my view the main difference is that traditionally statistics was used to proove a pre conceived theory and usually the analysis was design around that principal theory. Where with data mining or machine learning the opposite approach is usually the norm in that we have the outcome we just want to find a way to predict it rather than ask the question or form the theory is this the outcome!
