Volume of the 95% confidence ellipsoid

I'm dealing with 3D data that are the trajectory of a point over time. I would like to have an indication of how much it is "spread" in space and I thought about using the volume of the 95% confidence ellipsoid as they do for stabilometric measures in 2D with the displacement of the Center of Pressure . So I have $x,y,z$ over time and with PCA I find the three eigenvalues and eigenvectors and I can plot the ellipsoid. But then I get stuck with the confidence region...I know that probably it is trivial but I don't understand which is the coefficient that I have to multiply the axis lengths for in order to obtain the volume that I need. Can I treat my data as a trivariate distribution? I know that in the errorellipse function for MATLAB, for example, they use the chi-squared distribution to calculate the coefficient, but I don't understand why.
