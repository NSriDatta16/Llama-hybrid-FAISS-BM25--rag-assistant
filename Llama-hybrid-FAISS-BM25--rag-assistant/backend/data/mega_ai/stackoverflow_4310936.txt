How do you make drag and drop always copy (never remove) in a Flex 4 Spark List?

Using the built in drag and drop features in Flex I can drag an item from one list and drop it into another list. But this removes the item from the first list. In my case I need to keep the items in the original list. So I need to always create a copy behavior for my users.
