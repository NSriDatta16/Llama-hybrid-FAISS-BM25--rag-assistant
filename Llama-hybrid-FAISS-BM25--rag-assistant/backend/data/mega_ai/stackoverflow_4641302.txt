Project management software, available options

Hey, sorry for posting this here, I know that this question better suites into SuperUser, but I would like to know answers from developers point of view. I have been using Indefero for project management etc. for some time, but I found that Indefero limitations are too big for my team. I'm searching project-management software that best suites this needs: Open-Source, but I can consider commercial apps GIT integration is mandatory, best if it can support multiple repos per project Time-tracking, good if it can have Gannt chart connected with issues etc. Issue, milestone, task tracking Good if it can be integrated with Gitosis, or have similar repository access control It must have an option, to setup on our own server Markdown syntax support is mandatory (or easy way to install plugin for this etc.) Issue tagging will be and advantage It will be used by developers team by 99% of time, but it has to have some simple interface, that clients can fill up bug reports etc. per project. It does not have to fill all this needs, but good if it can :) What options do You know, and can recommend?
