"Generalizes" in this context means that you can write one function or one small piece of code that implements all of your cases rather than writing each case separately. I don't have that book, but it looks like it replaces something like: String attr1; String attr2; String attr3; with Hashtable attributes; That's generalizing the storage -- the code is meant to show a generic hashtable that maps strings to strings -- you would use something like this attributes["attr1"] = "value"; The other code would be used something like this: attr1 = "value";
