What approach for creating a multi-classification model based on all categorical features (1 with 5,000 levels)?

I have a data set I'm trying to create a predictor model for. The 5 features and outcome are all categorical data. One of the features contains 5,000 unique levels. While the other 4 are all under 100 levels. The output variable in my dataset contains 400 unique levels. How do I handle this scenario for modeling? My approach was going to be: Convert the 5,000 level feature to a sequential number list via a lookup table. Convert the remaining 4 features using One Hot Encoding. Convert the output variable to a sequential number list via a lookup table. Use xgboost algorithm. I don't think I can bin the 5,000 level feature because they are user id's. So to me, there is no way to bin them.
