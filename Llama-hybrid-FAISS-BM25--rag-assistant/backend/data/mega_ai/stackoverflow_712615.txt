When you're using varchars (or strings in most languages), you'll find that "10:00" just because of character sequencing rules (since "1" ). You should be storing date and time values in date and time columns. If you must use varchars, you'll need to convert them to fixed-size 24-hour format to do it properly (e.g., "01:30", "12:15", "18:25"). But my advice is to store them as proper DB date and time values. Your queries will be easier and faster. The following solution may get you what you want if I understand your data storage (one entry per quarter hour) but my professional opinion is to fix the column types, since that will allow for far more expressive conditions in your select statements: select * from TimeList1 where left(StartTime,1) = '8' and right(StartTime,2) = 'AM'
