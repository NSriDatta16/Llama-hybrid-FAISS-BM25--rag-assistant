The easiest route to go is to load up the Magento environment in your PHP script, and use the native Magento calls. You can load up the environment with the following code: require_once("path_to_magento/app/Mage.php"); Mage::app(); After that, you can use all of the native methods, just like you would in a Magento .php or .phtml file. For example, to get a product collection and filter it to only active products: $products = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->getCollection(); $products->addAttributeToFilter('status', 1); Reference for the Magento code base is at: http://docs.magentocommerce.com/
