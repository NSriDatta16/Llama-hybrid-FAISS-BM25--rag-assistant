It has to depend on where the html that the scripts are embedding in is coming from. If it's in a context where the code's controlling the local scripts will be aware of what the other is doing, then I suppose there's no need for a namepace. If on the other hand, the scripts will be running in the context of something like a CMS then there could be various server side plugins emmitting local javascript without the client side coder necessarily understanding the intricacies of the code. Even there, if that code is all namespaced, then you should be fine. Accidentally forgetting one var keyword can break a namespace though. All in all, a namespace doesn't hurt things and isn't that hard. It's a lot easier to maintain and think about javascript when it's not all mixed in with html.
