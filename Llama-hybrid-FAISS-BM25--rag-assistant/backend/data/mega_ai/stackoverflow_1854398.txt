How to garbage collect a direct buffer in Java

I have a memory leak that I have isolated to incorrectly disposed direct byte buffers. ByteBuffer buff = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(7777777); The GC collects the objects that harbor these buffers but does not dispose of the buffer itself. If I instantiate enough of the transient objects containing buffers, I get this encouraging message: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory I have been searching up this problem and apparently buff.clear(); and System.gc(); do not work.
