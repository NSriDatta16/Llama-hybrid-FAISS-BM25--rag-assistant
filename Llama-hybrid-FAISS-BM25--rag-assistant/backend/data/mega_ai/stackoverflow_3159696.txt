It doesn't work the way you think it does. By assigning the SelectedIndex property, you don't select the dropdown list item, you set the text in the text box portion of the combo box. The drop down list responds to that by selecting the list item that matches the text box text. Problem is: it does so in a case-insensitive way. You can easily see this for yourself by setting the 2nd item to, say, "D". That fixes it. Or set the first item to "b", now the first item gets selected. No, there's no easy fix for that. The hard one is to obtain the handle to the listbox control in the dropdown event with CB_GETCOMBOBOXINFO, then sending it the LB_SETSEL message. The pragmatic fix is to not make the list items differ only by case. Tends to confuse the user anyway.
