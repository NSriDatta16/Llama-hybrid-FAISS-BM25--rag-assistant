When you create a database in Microsoft SQL Server you can have multiple file groups, where storage is created in multiple places, directories or disks. Each file group can be named. The PRIMARY file group is the default one, which is always created, and so the SQL you've given creates your table ON the PRIMARY file group. See MSDN for the full syntax.
