The Laplace distribution is also related to median linear regression models. For a model: $$y_i=x_i^T\beta + \epsilon_i,$$ where $\epsilon_i$ are iid Laplace with location $0$ and scale $\sigma$, the maximum likelihood estimators of $\beta$ coincide with the median regression estimators $$\hat{\beta} =\text{argmin} \sum_i\vert y_i-x_i^t\beta\vert.$$ See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_regression The half-Cauchy prior is very popular in Bayesian hierarchical models: Nicholas G. Polson and James G. Scott (2012). On the Half-Cauchy Prior for a Global Scale Parameter . Bayesian Analysis.
