From a Bayesian perspective, the question does not make sense as there is no "better" or "worse" (or "correct" versus "incorrect") prior. The entire statistical analysis is based on and hence conditional on the choice of the prior as a reference measure. Provided the posterior is proper, both analyses are coherent. If one wants to check which prior is most compatible with the data, one can use a Bayes factor to this effect, but the resulting "prior" is data-dependent and therefore not a "prior" any longer.
