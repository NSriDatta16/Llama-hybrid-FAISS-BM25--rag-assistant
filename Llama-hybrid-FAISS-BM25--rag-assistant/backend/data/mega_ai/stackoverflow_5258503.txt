Magento Indexing of Catalog Products & its Attributes

I have some queries for Magento Indexing Process: First of all, why Magento does not perform the indexing process programmatically, after each Product or any of its Attribute(s) are newly added / modified? Why Admin(s) require to do the indexing, when the indexing processes are very much important & can be done programmatically? In each indexing process, are all the products indexed (including those which have been indexed already), when the "Reindex Data" link is clicked, or only the non-indexed products are indexed? If I want to view / debug the time taken for each indexing process, then what & how will I need to do?
