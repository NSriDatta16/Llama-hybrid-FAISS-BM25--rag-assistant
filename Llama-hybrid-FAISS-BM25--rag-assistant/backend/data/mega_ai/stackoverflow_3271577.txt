Smartphone Memory Configuration

Smart-phones have built in ROM and RAM separately. Also a few phones has virtual memory support too. I would like to know what these memories are basically used for. I understand that RAM is available to user processes. But why do they have a big chunk of ROM? E.g. The wiki page for Droid Incredible says 512 MB DDR RAM 1 GB ROM (748 MB free to user) - what's this free to user? plus 8 GB moviNAND - typically used for data storage
