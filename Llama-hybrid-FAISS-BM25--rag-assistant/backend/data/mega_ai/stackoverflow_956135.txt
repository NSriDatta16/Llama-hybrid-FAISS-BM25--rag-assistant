How can I change the paragraph formatting in the SharePoint RichHtmlField

In SharePoint we have the the richhtmlfield that allows the user to edit the html content of the page. How can I change the css that is applied when they select H1, H2, Normal etc. from the paragraph formatting button? I would also like to change the css applied to the tables added to the richhtmlfield, is this possible? All the best
