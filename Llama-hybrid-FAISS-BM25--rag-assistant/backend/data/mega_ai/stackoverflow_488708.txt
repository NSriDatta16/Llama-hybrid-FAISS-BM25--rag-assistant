I do the data storage myself using a custom design - All displayed text is stored in the DB. I have two tables. The first table has an identity value, a 32 character varchar field (indexed on this field) and a 200 character english description of the phrase. My second table has the identity value from the first table, a language code (EN_UK,EN_US,etc) and an NVARCHAR column for the text. I use an nvarchar for the text because it supports other character sets which I don't yet use. The 32 character varchar in the first table stores something like 'pleaselogin' while the second table actually stores the full "Please enter your login and password below". I have created a huge list of dynamic values which I replace at runtime. An example would be "You have {[dynamic:passworddaysremain]} days to change your password." - this allows me to work around the word ordering in different languages. I have only had to deal with Arabic numerals so far but will have to work something out for the first user who requires non arabic numbers. I actually pull this information out of the database on a 2 hourly interval and cache it to the disk in a file for each language in XML. Extensive use of the CDATA is used. There are many options available, for performance you could use html templates for each language - My method works well but does use the XML DOM a lot at runtime to create the pages.
