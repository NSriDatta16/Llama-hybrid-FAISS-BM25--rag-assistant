Question regarding weight initialization of an artificial neural network

This is what i'm trying to implement in Python. w0,...,w8 = vector w1 of shape (9,1) w9,...,w11 = vector w2 of shape (3,1) b0 (first bias) is of shape (3,1) b1 is of shape (1,1) vector X is of shape (99, 3) I don't know where the problem resides because when I try to forward propagate, I get the not aligned error when doing the dot product since the multiplication is not possible... Is my neural network wrong ?
