This was meant to be a comment, but it is too long. I'm not entirely sure what you want to accomplish but maybe a multivariate normal distribution $y \sim N(X\beta, \Sigma)$ can be helpful. Here $y$ is a vector of observations ($y(s_1), y(s_2), y(s_3),..., y(s_n)$) where $s_i$ represents a spatial location. $X$ are independent variables and $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix that describes the spatial relationship between points. This is closely related to Gaussian Processes with the following predictive distribution: $y_*|X_*, X, y \sim N(K(X_*, X)K(X,X)^{-1}y, K(X_*,X_*)-K(X_*,X)K(X,X)^{-1}K(X,X_*))$ where $y_*$ are predictions to be sampled, $K$ is a covariance function and $X$ are covariates for your predictions. This gives you confidence intervals for free due to the covariance matrix of this multivariate normal distribution. The canonical reference for Gaussian Processes is Rasmussen - Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning .
