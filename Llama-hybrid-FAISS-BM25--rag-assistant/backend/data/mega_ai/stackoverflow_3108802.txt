How to calculate Mahalanobis distance between two time series of equal dimensions?

I am doing some data-mining on time series data. I need to calculate the distance or similarity between two series of equal dimensions. I was suggested to use Euclidean distance, Cos Similarity or Mahalanobis distance. The first two didn't give any useful information. I cannot seem to understand the various tutorials on the web. So, Given two vectors A(a1, a2, a3,...,an) and B(b1, b2, b3,...,bn) how do you find the Mahalanobis distance between them? (I received advice on using these distance measures on SO itself, and there is a question on how to calculate Cos similarity; so please consider before closing this question)
