RoR Upload File Security Question

I have a question regarding Ruby on Rails. I'm currently use a gem called Paperclip to allow me to upload files. My question is the files uploaded go into the /public which is easily accessed from anyone. How do I go about hiding the files uploaded? And only allowing the correct user to download the file? I'm not interested in hiding a link from someone. But am interested in the fact that someone must be logged in, to download the file. Thanks. Edit -- http://rdoc.info/github/thoughtbot/paperclip/master/Paperclip/Storage/Filesystem I still don't get how I'm to secure the files in the backend?
