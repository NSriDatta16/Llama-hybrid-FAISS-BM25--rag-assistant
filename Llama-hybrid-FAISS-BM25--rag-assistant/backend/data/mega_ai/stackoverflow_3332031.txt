You could use this: http://code.google.com/p/java2word I implemented this API called Java2Word. with a few lines of code, you can generate one Microsoft Word Document. Eg.: IDocument myDoc = new Document2004(); myDoc.getBody().addEle(new Heading1("Heading01")); myDoc.getBody().addEle(new Paragraph("This is a paragraph...") There is some examples how to use. Basically you will need one jar file. Let me know if you need any further information how to set it up. *I wrote this because we had one real necessity in a project.
