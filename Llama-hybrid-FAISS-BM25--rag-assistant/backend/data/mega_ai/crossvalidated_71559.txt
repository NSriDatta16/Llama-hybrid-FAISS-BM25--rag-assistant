I guess there are many possible methods that you can use. My background is in machine learning so my biased answer would be: Use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). You need to train the HMM based on your observations ( available slots ) to learn the model's emission probability (B), transition probability (A) and prior probability (pi) matrices. Once you know your model parameters, you can run the Viterbi algorithm on your time series to find the best (hidden) state sequence that fits your observations. This would in effect reveal the patterns in your data. If I were you, I would initially start with an HMM with 2 hidden states, one corresponding to office hours and the other to out of office hours , and see what results you get. The bible of HMMs, which every paper in the field references, is this tutorial by Rabiner. It is easy to follow and should give you an idea about how to implement it. Many languages have HMM libraries so you don't have to code anything from scratch. Just google 'Language + Hidden Markov Model' and you will find a library or toolbox. Hth.
