Naming the Namespace

I am having an issue trying to figure out how to appropriately name my namespace. My namespace is currently: . .Configuration However, using "Configuration" conflicts with: System.Configuration To make matters worse, I also have a class called ConfigurationManager. I know I could change it to something like: . . Configuration but that seems redundant. Any ideas? EDIT: Also, I'm aware when calling either class I can fully qualify the calling code but the frequency that the classes in the System.Configuration namespace and . .Configuration namespace will be used would make for ugly code. EDIT2: Providing specifics: Using statements: using System.Configuration; using SummitConfiguration = SST.Summit.Configuration; Problem Line Configuration config = ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(ConfigurationUserLevel.PerUserRoamingAndLocal); Error Message 'SST.Summit.Configuration' is a 'namespace' but it is used like a 'type' (for problem line above)
