I moved an entire project with a firebird database in unicode. About udfs, if you want to keep the encoding of your database as is, you can use AnsiString/PAnsiChar instead of string/PChar. But if you want to use UTF8 to encode your database and take advantage of Unicode in Delphi, you should use the type UTF8String instead. Be careful, the encoding of the database connection is different from the encoding of the database itself. You should also pay attention to the length of strings in UTF8. To convert a database to UTF8, this tool will be useful to you: http://code.google.com/p/fbclone/
