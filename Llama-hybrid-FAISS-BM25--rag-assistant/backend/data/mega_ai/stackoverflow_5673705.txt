Creating teams based on two groups

I'm quite new to Python, and I have a problem that I would like to solve (elegantly). I'm going to create teams for soccer matches this coming season. We have 24 players and would like to put them in two groups, 12 in each, based on skills. For each match, we want to select 8 players, 4 from each group. Ideally, everyone gets to play the same number of matches over the whole season. Does anyone know a simple way to do this? Thanks in advance for your help.
