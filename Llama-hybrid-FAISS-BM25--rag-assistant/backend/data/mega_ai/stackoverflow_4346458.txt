You can try out the Agile Platform by OutSystems. You can model your web applications visually (including all database details, web pages, logic, ...) and then generate a standard .Net application using a SQL server database. Once you define the database structure, you can drag&drop tables into the pages to automatically create CRUDs. This greatly simplifies the implementation of web pages that manipulate data. These " wizards" will also create all the pagination and column sorting (when you're listing data from a table), as well as the pop-up forms (with field input validations) needed for users to input data. Last, but not least, if you make changes to the database structure, the platform will automatically update all pages and logic (like queries) that you are using, and will pin-point all the elements you need to manually change to ensure the app is consistent. You can download the Agile Platform for free at http://www.outsystems.com/download/ and give it a try. Cheers Michel PS: I work at OutSystems
