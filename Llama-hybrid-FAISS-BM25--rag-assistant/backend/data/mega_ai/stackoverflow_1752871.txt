Rails - Too much logic in views?

I have an application used by several organizations and I want to check that users of one domain (a.domain.com) cannot edit users of another domain (b.domain.com). My question is where to put the logic, in a before filter or in the view? View: render :partial => 'form' render :partial => 'no_access' Or, in the controller: before_filter :verify_editable_user, :only => ['edit', 'update', 'delete'] protected def verify_editable_user @user = User.find(params[:id], :include => 'websites') unless @user.websites.detect {|website| website.url == request.host} render 'no_access' end end In this scenario, the first version feels cleaner to me. However, the second seems more along the MVC scenario. What do you think? Am I way off base? Thanks in advance.
