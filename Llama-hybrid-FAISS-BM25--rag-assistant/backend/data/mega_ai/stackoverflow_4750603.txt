By using the user's unique device ID, you potentially limit the user to a single mobile device. (What happens when the user gets a new phone/tablet?) If you are providing a service across multiple platforms, (e.g. mobile, desktop, and web,) I don't think it would be outlandish to require a username and password. Another option would be to leverage another platform that already does authentication, such as Facebook Connect, or OpenFeint. Of course, it should simply be an option: users shouldn't be required to have such an account to use your service.
