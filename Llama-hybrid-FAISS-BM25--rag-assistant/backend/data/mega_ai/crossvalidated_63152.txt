What does the hidden layer in a neural network compute?

I'm sure many people will respond with links to 'let me google that for you', so I want to say that I've tried to figure this out so please forgive my lack of understanding here, but I cannot figure out how the practical implementation of a neural network actually works. I understand the input layer and how to normalize the data, I also understand the bias unit, but when it comes to the hidden layer, what the actual computation is in that layer, and how it maps to the output is just a little foggy. I've seen diagrams with question marks in the hidden layer, boolean functions like AND/OR/XOR, activation functions, and input nodes that map to all of the hidden units and input nodes that map to only a few hidden units each and so I just have a few questions on the practical aspect. Of course, a simple explanation of the entire neural network process like you would explain to a child, would be awesome. What computations are done in the hidden layer? How are those computations mapped to the output layer? How does the ouput layer work? De-normalizing the data from the hidden layer? Why are some layers in the input layer connected to the hidden layer and some are not?
