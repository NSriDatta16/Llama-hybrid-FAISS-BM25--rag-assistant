Each request has some overhead, so the performance of your page will suffer the more elements you have to load. The best solution would be to reduce the number of loads which is necessary, you might want to consider using css sprites to reduce the actual number of images which have to be loaded. Turning keep-alive connections on in your web server may help, as it would reduce the number of connections which have to be negotiated. Also keep in mind that many systems impose a limit on the number of simultaneous connections which may be made to one host, so you may only be downloading two of these images at a time. It may also be possible to re-engineer your application so this many images are not required, but we'd need to know more about the application. In general however, I would encourage you to cache these images, as trying to generate that many images on each page load is going to kill your server(s). I would also encourage you to use Firebug (the interface is a little easier than that of Chrome's tool [IMHO]), to get a better understanding of how much of the time is spent at each stage of the loading process.
