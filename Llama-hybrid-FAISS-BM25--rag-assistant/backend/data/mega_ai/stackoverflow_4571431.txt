in a desktop pc, be shure every resource is boundled with the html file, css inlines, js inlines, images encoded in css via url('data:image') @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme and associate a browser to html files, doubleclick on the page will open your page. also chrome has a "create application shortcut" that will make an even more "native" frame around your html5 app. prism https://wiki.mozilla.org/Prism is the same concept implemented with mozilla engine. in mobile browsers based on webkit there are similar means to exploit, i.e. for iPad you can create shortcuts in the home screen that will look exactly like a native application and access a 5Mb of file cache(http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/appcache/beginner/).
