(non) linear regression on graphs with multiple y per x values

I have a data set with multiple y values per x value. Using Excel the scatter plot and the regression line tools, I wish to apply regression on the data to determine if there is any connection between the data points. If I just pick the regression trend line (Layout 3) in Excel, it gives me a line with an R² value of 0.02, but if I pick the average y-values for each x-value, and use the trend line on them, I get a trend line with an R² value of 0,963 which, pardon my phrasing, looks correct. My question is; Is it safe to use a set of averaged y-values in order to limit it to a single y-value per x-value?
