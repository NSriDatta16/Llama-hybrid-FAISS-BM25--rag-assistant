jquery conditional visibility

I have a scenario where I need to show a bunch of buttons only when ANY of a group of input fields contains a value and hide the buttons when ALL of the input fields are empty. Can't come up with an elegant way to do that other than by attaching some code to the focus event of the input fields to check their content and show/hide accordingly. Is there a better way to do this? thanks
