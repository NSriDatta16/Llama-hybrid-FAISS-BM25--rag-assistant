Way to storage object without rdbms or plain file with Java

first of all sorry for my English is not my native language. I have a web form input field and a servlet ( Clustered Weblogic AS) which receives the contents of this input. I would like to limit the attempts given the same value without using rdbms or plain text file , eg // Getting value of form String input = request.getParameter ("input"); // Attempts object saves the previously set values if (attempts.check (input)> 3) ( throw new Exception (); Else () attempts.setValue (input); ) And I do not decide which is the most efficient way of doing it without using db or plain file. Java Cache System Static Variable Another way?
