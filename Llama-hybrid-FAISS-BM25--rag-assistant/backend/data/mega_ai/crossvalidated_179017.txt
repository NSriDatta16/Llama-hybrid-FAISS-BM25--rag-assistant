When you look at your normalized eigenvectors $\hat{\beta}_{i}^{\prime}$ then the variable you normalized on should be one and the rest of the variables should appear in whatever sign they have divided by the normalized variable, e.g.: $$\hat{\beta}_{1}^{\prime}=\left(0.07\,:\,-0.03\,:\,1.00\,:\,-0.29\,:\,0.57\right)$$ $$\hat{\beta}_{2}^{\prime}=\left(1.00\,:\,-1.02\,:\,-3.45\,:\,-8.51\,:\,8.00\right)$$ $$\vdots$$ $$\hat{\beta}_{i}^{\prime}=\cdots$$ here the vecotor of variables is given as: $$X_{t}=\left(m_{t}^{r}\,:\, y_{t}^{r}\,:\,\Delta p_{t}\,:\, R_{m,t}\,:\, R_{b,t}\right)^{\prime}$$. In the above example it should be clear that we have normalized on $\Delta p_{t}$ in the first vector and $m_{t}^{r}$ in the second vector. When we want to interpret the relationship we can treat the normalized variables as the dependent variables in a linear regression so the signs of the other variables will change as we now interpret each vector as a relationship explaining the normalized variable (dependent variable if you want a comparison to linear regression), i.e. we move the variables to the other side. Using this, the first vector above can be interpreted as a relationship explaining the inflation rate: $$\Delta p=0.29R_{m}-0.57R_{b}-0.07m^{r}+0.03y^{r}$$ and the second relationship can be interpreted as a money demand relationship: $$m^{r}=1.02y^{r}+3.45\Delta p+8.51R_{m}-8.00R_{b}$$ We use the normalization so we are able to uniquely identify the $\beta$ vectors and by choosing to normalize on variables which lead to a meaningful economic relationship its a convenient way to let us interpret the cointegrating vectors as economic equilibrium relationships. See the " The Cointegrated VAR Model: Methodology and Applications " by Katarina Juselius sections 7.5 and 7.6 which discusses exactly this and where the above has been adapted from. Alternatively you cant take a look Eric Zivot's lecture notes on cointegration , section 12.2.2 or " New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis " by LÃ¼tkepohl.
