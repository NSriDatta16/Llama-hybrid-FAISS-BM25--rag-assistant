Keyed ObservableCollection in Silverlight

I want to implement a keyed observable collection in Silverlight, that will store unique objects based on a property called Name. One way of doing it is to use the ObservableCollectionEx (samples in another stackoverflow post) class which subscribes to all PropertyChanged events on the contained elemens and check to see if the name property changes. Better yet, create my own event that will tell me the name attribute changed and throw a ValidationException if item already exists. I don't necessarily want to retrive the object with an indexer this[Name]. somthing like this: private string name; public string Name { get { return name; } set { if (value != name) { OnNameChanged(); name = value; OnPropertyChanged("Name"); } } } Is there another solution more elegant? Much simpler? Thanks, Adrian P.S. I know there is also an ObservableDictionary that Dr Wpf put together and it's easy to move it to Silvelight, but I don't know how to use it with DataForm and such.
