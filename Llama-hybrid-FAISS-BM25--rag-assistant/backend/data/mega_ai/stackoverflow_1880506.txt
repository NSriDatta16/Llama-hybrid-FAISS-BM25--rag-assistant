BorderThickness of 1 renders with a 2-pixel thickness - what am I missing here?

I've got a Border in XAML/WPF that I'm using to give a full-paragraph-width underline to text headings in a dialog. I set its BorderThickness property to "0,0,0,1". In some places, it ends up being rendered with a 2-pixel thick underline while in others it appears correctly as a single-pixel underline. What am I doing wrong? Here's the control template I'm using to replace my label's visual tree (the use of a template is inconsequential, I would've thought): I'm pretty new to WPF, so I suspect I'm missing something fundamental about its rendering model. Is the border rendering over a pixel boundary? Doesn't seem that way, as I would've thought it would be partially transparent if so. Is there a way to guarantee that I get what I'm asking for in terms of thickness? Have I even made a howling error? And for reference, I'm not applying a scaling transform (or any other sort of transform for that matter). Any help would be appreciated. :)
