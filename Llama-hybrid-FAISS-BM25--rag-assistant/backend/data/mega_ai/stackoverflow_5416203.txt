None that I'm aware of, but it should't be too hard to roll your own. In the simplest case you can just require 'open-uri' and then use the open method to retrieve the contents of the site, or go for one of the HTTP libraries. Once you got the document, all you have to do is use something like Nokogori or Hpricot to get the title, first paragraph of text and an image and you are done.
