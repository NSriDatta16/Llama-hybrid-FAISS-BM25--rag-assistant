Starting configurations for RNN and MLPs

How do you go about choosing initial hyperparameters (layer size, # of hidden units in RNN and dense layers, etc.) when training RNNs and MLPs? How do you iteratively tweak these settings -- do you generally start with changing the number of layers, units, or optimizer?
