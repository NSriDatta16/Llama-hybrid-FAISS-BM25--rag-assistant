Time Series: Normality

I have a time serie, and I want a stationary process for search posible models. One of the requirments is normality. shapiro.test(serie) p-value = 0.0002322 How can I normalize my time serie? (I try with Logaritimic transformation, regular differences, stationary differences, but doesn't work) It's necesary normalize the serie? When I look the p values for Ljung Box they are not normals. This is because the not notmality of the serie? shapiro.test(model1$residuals) p-value EDIT: model$residuals and p values
