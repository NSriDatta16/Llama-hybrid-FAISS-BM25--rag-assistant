How to test if two time series are correlated?

If I have two time series, say ice cream sales and temperature. What is the best method to determine if temperature drives ice cream sales so that it can be used as a predictor? I've been reading that Peasrson correlation is not appropriate since it ignores the time factor which is assumed to be driving both series.
