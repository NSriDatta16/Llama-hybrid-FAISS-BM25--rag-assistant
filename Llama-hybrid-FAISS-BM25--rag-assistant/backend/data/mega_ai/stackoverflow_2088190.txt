The same problem. Notification arrived on phone and user pressed Close instead of View on message box. A badge appear on app icon. Well done. Now, open the app and as Apple's documentation says: "use didFinishLaunchingWithOptions when you want launchOptions filled with notification and bla, bla..." The problem is, that when didFinishLaunchingWithOptions is fired launchOptions is still empty. Tried many combinations of solution: no result. SDK's bug? UPDATE ===================================== In Apple's documentation is in didFinishLaunchingWithOptions written: "The dictionary is nil if the user launched the application by tapping the application icon." So, I have no idea if it even possible to retrieve body of notification when app is launched after user closed notification messagebox (and there's badge on app icon). Is notification body lost in space when user closes notification messagebox? UPDATE======================================= After further investigation I found answer. Yes, non-delivered data are lost. No waiting for user to be online, no storage, no info of notification delivering. APNS in not payed service and Apple has no responsibility for 100% delivering of data.
