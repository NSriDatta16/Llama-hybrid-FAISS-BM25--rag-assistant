Overfitting of a model in deep learning is very highly related to number of training samples you have. Given that you use VGG16 which has 138 million parameters it requires a lot of data for training properly. If you use 600 images only for training it will overfit on training data. Its difficult to control overfitting on these small data by adjusting any other hyperparameter or resizing the image. Please collect more data or use data augmentation techniques to increase the samples of training data
