Can an iPhone App Be Run as Root?

I am thinking about the design of an iPhone app I'd like to create. One possible problem is that this application will have to run as root (to access certain network ports). In a typical UNIX app, I'd just get the app to run with setuid, but I'm wondering if that is possible with an iPhone app. I've read this question in Apple's forum, which is discouraging: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1664575 I understand that Apple wants to limit what a program can do, but there are plenty of good, legitimate reasons for a user to run a program with elevated privileges. I'm not trying to create a hacker tool here. I'm sure I could get around this on a jail-broken iPhone, but that's not what I'm after. Is there any way to run an app with elevated privileges on an unbroken iPhone? (BTW, there is no need to warn me about the NDA.)
