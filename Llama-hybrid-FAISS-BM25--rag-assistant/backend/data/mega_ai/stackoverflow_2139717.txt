You may have a look at Tigermouse Framework I developed years ago. It seems to be exactly what you are looking for. It has this web-form approach, where you define views and forms, put other controls on it and assign events which then are handled on server side. Have a look a this simple Drag-n-drop shopping cart app and see the source code .
