Can VAEs be used to generate multivariate data?

Most of the tutorials online seem to use VAEs to generate images and use CNNs to generate data. I am working on a game with multivariate data consisting of character position and the character attributes to train a VAE. I was wondering if it was possible because I have tried training the network with pytorch but I continue to get poor results with KL Divergence term decreasing to 0. Any help would be really appreciated.
