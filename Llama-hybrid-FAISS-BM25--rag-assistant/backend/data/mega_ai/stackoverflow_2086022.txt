This is bad. This is unmaintainable. Short variables have their place. There is really no reason to write for(int iterator; iterator The rule of thumb is: One letter per screen of reach. With standarized 24 lines screen. The exception is picking one-two extremely frequently used globals or semi-globals like pointer to the data storage or THE input data pointer, and make them 1-3 letters long. But anything else - use reason. Short loops - one letter. Locals of a function - 3-5 letters. Class variables - full word. Library class/function names - two words.
