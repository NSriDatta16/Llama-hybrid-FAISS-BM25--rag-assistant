Gaussian process classifier (not using the Laplace approximation), preferably with marginalisation rather than optimisation of the hyper-parameters. Why? because they give a probabilistic classification you can use a kernel function that allows you to operate directly on non-vectorial data and/or incorporate expert knowledge they deal with the uncertainty in fitting the model properly, and you can propagate that uncertainty through to the decision making process generally very good predictive performance. Downsides slow requires a lot of memory impractical for large scale problems. First choice though would be regularised logistic regression or ridge regression [without feature selection] - for most problems, very simple algorithms work rather well and are more difficult to get wrong (in practice the differences in performance between algorithms is smaller than the differences in performance between the operator driving them).
