The modal camera view already supports touch-to-focus. You need to make your overlay view "transparent" to touches. Subclass a UIView as OverlayView and add something like this. In my overlay view I have two buttons, which should of course not be transparent for touching. - (BOOL)pointInside:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (CGRectContainsPoint(infoButton.frame, point) || CGRectContainsPoint(snapButton.frame, point)) { // touched button return YES; } return NO; } There are probably other and more elegant ways to do this. I think you would also have to add the little "focus rectangle" on your view programmatically.
