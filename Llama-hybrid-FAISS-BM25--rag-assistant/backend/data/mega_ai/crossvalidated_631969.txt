In this specific scenario, you can extend a paired t -test approach to a multivariate (in the sense of multiple outcomes) analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). That's just a name for a particular type of multivariate multiple-regression model. The trick is to use, for each individual, the treatment - control difference as the outcome variable for each of the 4 dependent variables (DV) that you measured after each treatment or control period. That's what paired t -tests would do, anyway, comparing the differences for each DV against a value of 0. Include as a covariate a binary indicator of the presentation order, for example taking the value of 0 for control first or 1 for treatment first. That will evaluate whether the treatment - control difference is affected by the order of presentation. Then include whatever additional covariates that you would like to control for, and perform MANCOVA. The regression coefficient estmates will be the same as you would get for doing separate regressions for each of the DV differences, but the covariances of the estimates will take into account correlations among outcomes. You will have to be a bit careful in evaluating the results. If you use standard treatment coding for covariates and handle the treatment order as above, the intercepts will be the treatment - control differences for the control-first group, at reference or 0 values for all of the covariates. The coefficients for the binary indicator of presentation order will be the differences of those differences between the treatment-first and control-first groups. One hopes that those coefficients for presentation order will be close to 0, supporting a lack of treatment-order effect. In that case you should be able to get a combined estimate of each of the 4 treatment - control differences by pooling the results (both coefficient estimates and their covariances) from the two presentation orders. The coefficients for the other covariates will indicate how much each affects each of the treatment - control differences. That will be a better approach than looking at pairwise correlations of differences against each of the covariates. Unlike the pairwise correlations, the multiple regression underlying MANCOVA takes all of the covariates into account simultaneously. A few notes about your concern over normal distributions You don't need to worry about normal distributions of each of the DV at all in the above approach, or even about normal distributions of the treatment - control differences. What might be of concern is a reasonably normal distribution of residuals between observations and the predictions from the MANCOVA model, which take the covariates into account. Even that isn't absolutely required for a valid model, but a reasonably normal distribution of residuals is very reassuring. If you ever need to include multiple covariates or continuous predictors in a Wilcoxon-type analysis, consider ordinal regression. Frank Harrell provides resources for ordinal regression models that only evaluate the rank-ordering of outcomes. Wilcoxon tests can be considered simple, special cases of more general ordinal regression models. In response to comments A mixed model is one way to analyze your data while taking the paired observations among individuals and covariates into account, but lmer() works only for one DV at a time. It's not a true "multivariate" model, which would assess correlations among the multiple 4 DV. There are ways to do true multivariate mixed models, as described on this page , but they require extra care. That said, a set fo 4 separate mixed models (one for each DV) might accomplish your goals. The way that you attempted to fit a multivariate model man_cov_model did NOT take the pairing of observations within individuals into account. I suspect that's why you didn't find "significant" results with it. With paired treatment and control values for each DV and each individual in your case, you could get around that by pre-calculating the treatment-control differences for each DV and individual. Use those differences at the outcomes in the multivariate model. Then you no longer need independent_variable as a predictor in your model; the intercept is the estimated treatment-control difference after accounting for covariates. Re-read the answer starting with the second paragraph. If you take that true multivariate approach, I'd recommend avoiding the manova() function and instead following the approach suggested by Fox and Weisberg in the appendix to their book on regression models. Use lm() to get the model, then analyze results with the Anova() function (capital "A") in the R car package . If you have a perfectly balanced design manova() might work OK, but otherwise the results from its Type I tests can be misleading . Finally, your mixed models and your attempt at a multivariate model don't seem to account for the order of presentation ( treatment versus control first). If you have complete balance in the order of presentation that's probably OK, but otherwise you should include the order of presentation as a covariate.
