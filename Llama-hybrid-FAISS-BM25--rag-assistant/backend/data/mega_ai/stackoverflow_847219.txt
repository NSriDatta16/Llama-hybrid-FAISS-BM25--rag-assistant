MyEclipse: Is still worth to use it?

Since 2005 we are using MyEclipse as our standard development tool. We use it mainly for for Java applications, but from time to time we use it also for Groovy and may be other stuff, like DB navigator, etc. Our licences should be renewed in a couple of months and I am rethinking the decision of using it. A nice feature of MyEclipse was the debugger which allows us to debug client/server applications. Also the hot deployment was a nice feature. All this stuff can be done without MyEclipse and comparing the memory footprint of MyEclipse 7.1 woth Eclipse Ganymede the last one wins for far. The licence price doesn't matter. Then the question is what I do loose not using MyEclipse anymore? opinions are welcome. Luis
