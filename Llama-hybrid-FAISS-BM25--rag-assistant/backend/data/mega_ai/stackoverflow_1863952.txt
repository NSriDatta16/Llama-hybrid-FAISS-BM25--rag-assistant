This is a difficult design. If reaching the "end" wraps around to the "beginning", how do you represent an empty container? The wraparound idea models an infinite sequence or a ring, but without a means to detect whether the iterator is still pointing to a valid position. This problem is reminiscent of attempts to write a variable-sized ring buffer (such as a queue) without using a "dummy entry": How does one distinguish an empty ring from a full ring? Storing a base position and a size is only appropriate for random-access storage (as opposed to linked nodes), and is less amenable to locking optimization than pointer or index pairs.
