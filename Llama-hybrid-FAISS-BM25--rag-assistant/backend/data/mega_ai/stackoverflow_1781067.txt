How to code startup tips to be easily localized

I'm writing a new Java 6 Swing application and want to have a "Show tips at start-up" feature. I've done this before, but never with localization in mind. In the past, my tips dialog used an XML file to hold the tips, but I'm afraid this will make things difficult when it comes time to translate these tips into different languages. I've thought about using a .properties file like with other strings in the application, but wonder if this is a maintainable approach. I would like to give the user the ability to add their own tips which will also display in the same dialog. Is the properties approach the way to go? If I allow users to add their own tips, I'll need some way to make sure the keys (for text retrieval) are unique.
