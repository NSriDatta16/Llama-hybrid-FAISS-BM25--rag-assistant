A good usecase is making data more reusable and repurposeful. Initially itenables organisations to homegenised their data in a manner that is reusable across domains and in situations where people don't agree on a homegenised model, it provides mechanisms to repurpose that data in a specific domain's context. This is also true to an extent of RDFs and SWRL, at slightly different levels.
