Magento Backorder Availability Message

In my Magento store I have it set up to allow backorders on some products. When these items are out of stock they still show as 'In Stock' on the product page but the user gets notified when they visit the cart that the item is on backorder. I would like to change the product page so it also shows there that the item is on backorder in place of the 'In Stock' text.
