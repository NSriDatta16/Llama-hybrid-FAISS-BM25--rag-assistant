First, Windows 7 has goodies to offer you. I am more productive on Windows 7. And Visual Studio 2010 (unlike 2008 and earlier) is Windows 7 aware. I get nice jumplists to make it easier to get to recent projects, for example. It also makes it possible to install Visual Studio extensions like the one I blogged that adds a compiler progress bar as an overlay on your taskbar icon, so you can minimize VS during a slow build and know how it's doing. Second, moving your prime machine to 7 is likely to help your users. Many developers have been caught off balance the first time their application is deployed to a machine on which they are not an admin. Developing on Windows 7 is one way to be sure your application works with UAC, and works on an XP machine being run by a non-admin (if you ever meet one.) Getting in the habit of using Windows 7 features yourself will encourage you to hook them into your application. Staying on XP yourself increases the tendency that you will deliver an XP application people can kinda sorta mostly use on Windows 7, rather than a Windows 7 application.
