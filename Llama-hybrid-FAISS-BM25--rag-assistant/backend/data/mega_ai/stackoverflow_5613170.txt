Question about Javascript onmouseover

I am very new to Javascript and was wondering why the following code will not work. var p = document.createElement("p"); p.onmouseover = (function() { this.style.cursor='pointer'; })(); Basically, I just want the cursor to change to pointer when the user hovers over this dynamically create paragraph element. Thank you.
