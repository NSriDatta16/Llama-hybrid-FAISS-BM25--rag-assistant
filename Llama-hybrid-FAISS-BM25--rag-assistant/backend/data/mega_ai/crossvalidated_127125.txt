This is explained in section 2.2.4 of the paper Decision Forests for Classification, Regression, Density Estimation, Manifold Learning and Semi-Supervised Learning . In the case of classification each leaf may store the empirical distribution over the classes associated to the subset of training data that has reached that leaf. During testing, each tree leaf yields a distribution over classes and the forest output is the average of these leaf distributions.
