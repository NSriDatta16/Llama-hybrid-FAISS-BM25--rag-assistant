Is it possible to reverse the layers of a convolutional neural network?

From my understanding typically a convolutional neural network has a matrix (e.g. an image) as input and output is either an integer or a vector of integers in regression and in classification a number of different classes. My question is, is it possible to reverse the layers of a CNN, e.g. first you have a class like “dog” and then the same layers, but reversed, and output is a matrix (e.g. an image)?
