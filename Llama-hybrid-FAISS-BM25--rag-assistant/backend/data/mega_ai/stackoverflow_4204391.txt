WE are using Xceed and Infragistics Both of them are actively developed. Xceed has a very active community and well documented products. Edit: Before selecting one lib ensure what you need. Research forums on each lib and check how other users were/weren't able to solve their issues. Control libraries are nice in use in standard scenarios, but if you want some more sophisticated solution you will need to dig into forums/blogs about the lib you have taken. That's why community is so important.
