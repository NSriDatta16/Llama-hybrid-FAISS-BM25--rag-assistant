Causes of inconsistent results with neural network?

I've created my own neural network in python. I am tracking the performance of each run. What are some things I can investigate when my performance results are inconsistent? When I compare my network results against my expect results (during cross-validation) I can get everything from 0.46 to 0.51 all the way up to 0.56 and various numbers in between. Is this a sign of bad data? Not enough training epochs? Need for a different learning rate?
