Examples of the performance of a machine learning model to be more sensitive to a small subset of hyperparameters than others?

Someone told me that the performance of a machine learning model tends to be more sensitive to changes in a small subset of hyperparameters than other. Is this true? Can someone give me an example of this? Thank you,
