Is my understanding of Random Forest algorithm with bootstrapping correct?

I want to know whether my understanding of RF algorithm is correct when using bootstrapping. So, let's say I have a dataset of 100 observations. That dataset is then split into a 75/25 split of train and test observations. Then the bootstrapping gets done and I "extract" 1000 different bootstrap samples of that same split (now I have 1000 different 75/25 splits in theory). After that, a RF model gets trained on those bootstrap samples. Each RF has 1000 decision trees. This is where I'm not quite sure if I understood the algorithm correctly; Essentially we now have 1000 different forests, and they all get aggregated to make a final decision? If it's a classification the most common class is selected and if it's regression the mean of the decisions is used? I'm aware different metrics can be used but this is a basic example. Thanks!
