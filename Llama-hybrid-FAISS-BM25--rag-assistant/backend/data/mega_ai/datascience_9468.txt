Please let me know if you have used any good tutorials or libraries to help build something similar. I would highly recommend the online book of Michael Nielsen: Neural Networks and Deep Learning . Coming to the libraries suggestion, I found Keras extremely useful and easy when I was learning neural networks. However, Lasagna is also a nice choice. You can learn about more libraries from this question . What is the error I am to calculate when building an algorithm using training data? The most commonly used error function is the squared error function, which is also used in the BackPropogation algorithm, which is used for optimizing the error function. How many layers do I need and what does each layer signify? Layers add sophistication, and help in finding subtle patterns in the data. However, you have to make sure that the network don't overfit . So, as long as the number of layers don't overfit the model, you are good to go. For ensuring that, you need to know what is cross-validation .
