firs add a new user control to your project after coding has finished, then Build your project. so you'll see the your created control appears in the toolbox(at the top), then just drag & drop it on your form or any ui and if you want to load a control from a DLL just add a new tab in your tool box then right click on it and select "choose items..." and then in the .Net Framework Components tab click "browse" and navigate to your dll , and then open the dll file and confirm the choose items dialog and you see the user control is now ready for drag & drop in your tool box :)
