SVM can output distance to the separating hyperplane, which is not an probability but other metric. It can also ouput class probability via Platts methods. Basic output from the logistic regression is of course logit, which can be transformed into probability and when used with loss function L(T(c,b)) can be used as a basis for decision. In loss function threshold T is a function of costs and benefits associated with various misclassifications/correct classifications.
