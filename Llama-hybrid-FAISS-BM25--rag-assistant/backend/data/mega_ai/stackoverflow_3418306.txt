I found out that there is away to get information about whether an object has reverted or not. It's built into jQuery but not that well documented apparently. Essentially it's done via using a callback function for the revert option of a draggable object. Something like the following: $(".myselector").draggable( { revert: function(droppableObj) { //if false then no socket object drop occurred. if(droppableObj === false) { //revert the .myselector object by returning true return true; } else { //droppableObj was returned, //we can perform additional checks here if we like //alert(droppableObj.attr('id')); would work fine //return false so that the .myselector object does not revert return false; } } }); See http://www.agilepro.com/blog/2009/12/while-this-functionality-is-built-into.html for more details.
