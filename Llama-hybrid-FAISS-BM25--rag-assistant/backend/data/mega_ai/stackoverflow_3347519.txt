Just drag and drop the column names from the object browser. You can do it one step it takes about 1 second longer than writing select * and you should never use select * in production code anyway. It is a poor practice. I am concerned about you inserting Identity columns though, this is something that should almost never be done. What if the original table had some identity columns that are the same as existing ids in the new table? Make sure to check for this before deciding to insert id values from another table. I prefer to do the insert to the parent table and get a new id and match it to the old id (output is good for this in 2008) and then use the new id for any child tables but join on the old id.
