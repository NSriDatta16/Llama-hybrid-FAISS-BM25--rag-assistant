Binary outcome in randomized controlled trials -- OLS or logistic?

I'm running a randomized controlled trial which has good balance in the co-variates. I'm unsure whether to use: OLS: $P(Y_i=1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Treat} + \epsilon_i$. This is problematic because the variance of binary $Y$ is not homoskedastic, thus invalidating the OLS assumption. Note that the right-hand side (RHS) only has the 0-1 indicator $\text{Treat}$, so I don't have the problem of the RHS going beyond the 0-1 range. $\beta_1$ in this case is simply the difference in sample mean between the control and the treatment group. Logistic: $\text{logit}(P(Y_i=1)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Treat}$ This is problematic because the correct model needs to include other co-variates (despite balance) and not just the $\text{Treat}$ indicator. The substantive effect of $\beta_1$ on $P$ then depends on the value of these other co-variates. However, then I no longer see the benefit of my experimental design, which allows me to not control for any other co-variates in the OLS case. SUMMARY of the answers I've got so far: @glen_b suggests that I should include predictors in both OLS and logistic despite experimental design in order to improve precision. In this case of binary outcome, including other predictors means that OLS is not an option anymore (because the RHS now can go outside the 0-1 range) @AMD suggests how to interpret the treatment effect in logistic regression, regardless of whether other predictors are included: $$ \frac{p}{1-p} = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Treat} + \beta_2 X) $$ When $\text{Treat} = 0: \frac{p}{1-p} = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_2 X)$ When $\text{Treat} = 1: \frac{p}{1-p} = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_2 X) \times \exp(\beta_1)$ Therefore, the treatment effect is that it multiplies the odd-ratio ($\frac{p}{1-p}$) by $\exp(\beta_1)$. Pro: the size of this effect does not depend on other $X$. Con: This is not directly about $p$, which some may be interested in. REMAINING QUESTION due to several conflicting advices: If I don't care so much about precision and just want to prove the causal effect of my treatment, is it okay to not include other predictors in the logistic given the experimental design? If I fail to include some interactions (with observable and/or unobservable), is $\beta_1$ of $\text{Treat}$ still a consistent estimate of the causal effect?
