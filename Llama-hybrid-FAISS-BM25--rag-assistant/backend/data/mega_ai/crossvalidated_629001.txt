Is it reasonable to subset a survey design object by dependent (outcome) variable and fit a weighted logistic regression model?

I would like to study which factors are associated with an outcome which has more than two categories. After considering multinomial logistic regression model (which I find is very challenging to interpret the effect measure "RRR"), I decided to use pairwise binary logistic regression models (weighted), using survey package. However, I am quite concerned if I can subset the survey design object by outcome, because I haven't found people reporting doing this. Here is an hypothetical example using an existing dataset in survey package: library(survey) data(api) # a *hypothetical* example # create a three-level factor variable as outcome variable apistrat $outcome api00 $api00 >= 600 & apistrat$ api00 Thank you very much in advance for your help! Any comments or thoughts would be highly appreciated!
