How to correct for non-linearity of response in linear regression

I want to train a linear regression model to predict a non-linear variable. This how the two independent variables correlated against the response (points are jittered): And the residuals against the fitted values: Most of the values for the response are zero. The effect is a very strong heteroscedasticity studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: model BP = 55483.84, df = 2, p-value event though the the predictors are strongly correlated with the response Call: lm(formula = response ~ predictor1 + predictor2, data = train_predictors) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -7.6996 -0.0268 -0.0238 -0.0182 4.8785 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 2.748e-02 2.825e-04 97.28 Should I consider more adopting non-linear models or could I first try correcting the non-linearity of the response?
