Don't forget to consider disk space. Unless you have a SAN, it can be tough to keep up with direct attached storage requirements (space and speed) of a handful of VMs. When you've got 6-8 machines all using the same disk controller, it can get a bit contentious. With that said, I almost always look to expand a virtual server before going out to purchase a new physical server. ascalonx and Jay Bazuzi make good points though, having somewhat redundant virtual host can be essential to keeping downtime brief if the first server ever goes down. I always like to know that I have another virtual server that can take the load of any failed VM host that might go down. If you don't have that, you may want to consider getting a bit more hardware.
