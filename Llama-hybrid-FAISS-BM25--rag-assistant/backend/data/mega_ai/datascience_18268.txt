acf function shows error while fiiting time series

I am fitting a time series model in R. I plotted the time series to check for the pattern of it. It has 30625 observations. The observations are half hourly plot.ts(ts) I was checking acf plot to see for auto correlation. acf(ts) If ACF plot decreases slowly i.e. it has auto correlation out to higher number of lags, then it probably needs higher order of differencing. I took the logarithm of the series and then checked its acf plot. acf(log(ts)) I am getting an error Error in plot.window(...) : need finite 'ylim' values In addition: Warning messages: 1: In min(x) : no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf 2: In max(x) : no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf What does this error means? What should I do remove this error. I also think the significance bounds given by dotted line are not correctly calculated. What should I do in these two cases?
