Keep sizes proportion between image views for different screens

In my application I have a layout with 3 image views with different heights (apple, wine, fish), bottom aligned. The layout height is constant. This layout looks good on hdpi screens, but I want to use the same images on mdpi. The problem is that on mdpi some of the image views might be down scaled and the proportion between the image views won't be the same. So, if the wine is down scaled, the apple might be tall as the wine bottle. What is the best way to avoid this? I thought about setting the same height for the images (the largest height), at run time. Then, they will all be scaled, and the proportion will be kept. Is this posible. I hope this is clear. Thank you.
