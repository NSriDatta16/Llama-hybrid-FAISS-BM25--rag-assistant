Is data scaling necessary in mars regression?

I am very new to data science. Something struck me about Mars regression. The dataset is not on the same scale, so some columns are %, others are integers. I want to do clustering before doing Mars regression. I know I need to scale the data for this. But I don't know if I should apply the Mars regression to the scaled data or the original data? Thanks in advance for the answers.
