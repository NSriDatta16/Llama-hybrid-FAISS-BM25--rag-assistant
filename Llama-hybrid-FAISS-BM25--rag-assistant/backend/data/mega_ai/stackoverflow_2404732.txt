You could use a schema comparison tool like Red-Gate's SQL Compare . You can synchronize the changes and not lose any data. I wrote about this and many alternative tools ranging widely in price here: http://bertrandaaron.wordpress.com/2012/04/20/re-blog-the-cost-of-reinventing-the-wheel/ The nice thing is that most tools have trial versions. So, you can try them our for 14 days (fully functional) and only buy it if it meets your expectations. I can't speak for the other tools, but I've been using RG for years and it is a very capable and reliable tool. (Updated 2012-06-23 to help prevent link-rot.)
