If you're getting an exception inside your touchesBegan: function, then your code there has a bug in it. If you run your app with the debugger, it should tell you on exactly what line of code the problem is occurring. If I had to guess, I would say that you're trying to send a message to an object which doesn't handle that message, which throws an exception. Make sure your code is compiling without any warnings -- it's possible you have a typo in a function name somewhere. If you misspell the message name, it will still compile correctly, but it will throw an exception at runtime when you try to send that message.
