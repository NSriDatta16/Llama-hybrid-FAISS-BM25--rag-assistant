Predict function tuning for random forest

I have created a random forest object in R (using the randomForest package) with ntree = N . Now I would like to predict some new data on it using a subset of N , that is using only n trees for the prediction. Is this possible? For the random forest object the forest is located at fit$forest , but I don't know how to extract them (if possible).
