You should not be listening for the drag on "sprite". You need separate listeners and handlers for each child that you want draggable. So instead you need to listen on the child of "sprite": sprite.loader.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN,pickUp); sprite.loader.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP,dropIt); Also you should be dragging the child, not your "sprite" container: function dropIt(event:MouseEvent):void { sprite.loader.stopDrag(); } Im not sure what you are trying to accomplish with the for while loop, but here is an example of a basic for loop that creates a bunch of loader variables: var loaderArray:Array = []; for(var increment = 0; increment I hope that is helpful. It would be better if we could see more of your code.
