Whenever you use a for loop over the count() of an array where the only use of the loop variable is to pull the next value out of the array like this for ($i = 0; $i You can simplify the code and improve its performance ever so slightly with this foreach ($regsMonths as $regMonth) { // ... } If you need the index $i elsewhere in the loop, use foreach ($regsMonths as $i => $regMonth) { // ... } This will improve code readability more than performance. When optimizing code, measure first, and attack the algorithm. It always helps to clearly state the purpose of the code. Comments like // A datelooper $dateLoop = $dateFrom; mean little. You would be better served by documenting the intent of the method in a paragraph or two.
