Actually the logistic regression and the Naive Bayesian Network are closely related. If we converse the two arrows in the following graph we get the Bayesian Network for the discriminative model. Since these two(Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression) function for different tasks, that's the NB with all given parameters can be responsible for all queries but for the LR we just need to infer $P(Z|X,Y)$ . Both X and Y are given in any particular related tasks. Knowing the difference of their responsibilities we can get to know easily the difference of their requirements. To construct a NB we need to weight all the possibilities of the combinations by the joint probabilities. Independences can reduce much of the possible unwarranted combinations but there are still a lot of possibilities we should consider. Since the global joint distribution depends on the local conditional distributions, we only need to set all the conditional probabilities in all of the conditional probability tables(CPT). Probabilistic parameters are encoded in a set of tables, one for each variable, in the form of local conditional distributions of a variable given its parents. Using the independence statements encoded in the network, the joint distribution is uniquely determined by these local conditional distributions. Source: Bayesian Network Classifiers Then we can just check how many numbers we should fill in the conditional probability tables. For the first one we need 1(since the conditional distributin should be valid the sum of the two should be 1); and the second table needs 2 parameters one for each row and the same for the third table. It is not only how many rows the CPTs have but also how many parameters each row needs that determine the necessary number of parameters. Such parameters can be human manipunated or learned from data using the global maximum likelihood. EDIT: That is a pretty easy question, and it would be very obvious had I differentiated these three concepts: variables, events and parameters .
