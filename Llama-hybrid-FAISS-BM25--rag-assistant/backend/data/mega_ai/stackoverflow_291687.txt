Except for manwood nobody mentioned ViewState and it's quite surprising. I would vote ViewState Management as the single most important considerations for performance improvment. My list: Manage View State aggressively UpdatePanel is evil ;) Make Juridicious use Leverage JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery Watch your server roundtrips Use Async pages for IO bound operations Caching at various level is equally important (Page level, data etc.) Using Ajax to fetch data "on demand" and cache locally as XML (XML data islands etc.) Consider async processing for long running operations (you can either use database based job queues and have them processed through a windows service. An ajax request could monitor the row for completion and update UI using balloons) Edit: [added 6-8]
