The approach you described is called the n-gram model, where n represents the window size, and the model is trained to predict the next word based on the previous n-1 words. However, n-gram models have several limitations, including: Sparsity: As the length of the n-gram increases, the number of distinct n-grams in the corpus tends to increase exponentially, resulting in many n-grams having very few occurrences. Inability to capture long-range dependencies: N-gram models can only model the dependencies between adjacent words and are unable to capture long-range dependencies. Difficulty handling out-of-vocabulary words: N-gram models cannot handle words that are not present in the training corpus. One alternative you can use a transformer model for mask prediction, in this approach, you randomly mask out a certain percentage of the input tokens at a variable length and then train the model to predict the original values of those masked tokens. For example, if the input sequence is "The quick brown fox" , the masked training sequence would be "The quick [MASK] fox" . Here, "[MASK]" represents a special token indicating the target token to be predicted.
