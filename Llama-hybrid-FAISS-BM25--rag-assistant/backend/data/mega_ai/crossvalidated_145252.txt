You could decrease dimensionality of the gene data using an ordination (eg PCA, NMDS). If you can extract a reasonable reduced-dimensionality structure, a few primary-axes loadings can be used for further testing (eg PC loadings in MR, beware of cross-correlations in demographic data). Or, could use direct ordination approaches such as CCA to relate the primary (gene) and the secondary (clinical parameters) matrices. It all depends on how exactly you formulate your question. Alternatively, you can do eg Random Forest analyses to choose the best gene predictors for each of the clinical parameters, if that's what you are interested in, or even feed your covariates in with the gene data to select the best model for metal predictors. In any case, this would be way too many repeated univariate analyses.
