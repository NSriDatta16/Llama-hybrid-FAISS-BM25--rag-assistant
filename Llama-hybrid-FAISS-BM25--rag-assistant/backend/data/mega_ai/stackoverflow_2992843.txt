I would use an iFrame to embed that website in within your existing application. Just set the "src" attribute and pass in any query string parameters the other site needs to render correctly. You can still pass in sensitive data in the query string, however it would make sure to encrypt it before sending it in. I know it is not the most elegant solution, but it gets the job done. And from the description of the existing app, it doesn't seem like your customer cares for "elegance" :) Hope this helps
