Trigger Mouse Dragging in jQuery UI

Using jQuery 1.2.x and jQuery UI 1.5.x, one was able to trigger dragging manually like so: jQuery("#myDiv").mousedown(function(ev) { target = jQuery(ev.target); if (target.hasClass("drag-me")) { target.draggable({ helper: "clone", start: function() { console.log("drag start"); }, stop: function() { jQuery(this).draggable("destroy"); } }).trigger("mousedown.draggable", [ev]); } }); It is applied to the following HTML: It was a handy way to apply dragging to elements inside a container that has its children changed dynamically. I like to call it "drag delegation". However with the release of jQuery 1.3.x & jQuery 1.6+, the script above stopped working. Using jQuery 1.3.2 & jQuery UI 1.7.1 returns an error "too much recursion". How can I trigger dragging manually? Any suggestions?
