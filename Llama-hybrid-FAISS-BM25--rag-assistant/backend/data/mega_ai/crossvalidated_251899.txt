MANOVA shows no significance but univariables have large differences

I conducted a MANOVA with 3 dependents and 1 independent (with only 2 groups). The MANOVA test shows no significance. But the average value over the 3 dependents are very different for the two groups. I am wondering if this possible? I think normally, if MANOVA shows no significance, the average value of the 3 dependents will be close for the two groups. Do I misunderstand the MANOVA? Since there are only 2 groups, should I use a multivarate t-test instead of MANOVA?
