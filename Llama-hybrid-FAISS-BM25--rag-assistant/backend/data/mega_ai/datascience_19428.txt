The type of neural networks you are looking for to predicting timeseries are called recurrent networks; the previous neuron states in the network affect the new neuron states. Examples of such recurrent networks are LSTM , GRU and NARX . If you have the data from t 0 to t 10 , and you want to predict t 11 , then you need to input the values from t 0 - t 10 one by one into the network. You have to train the network so that the output of t n is t n+1 . So after you have inputted t 10 , the output will be the values predicted for t 11 . Real life example: I want a network to keep on decreasing it's output until it has reached 1, and then make it output 0 to start over again: in: 0.0, out: 0.2 in: 0.2, out: 0.4 in: 0.4, out: 0.6 in: 0.6, out: 0.8 in: 0.8, out: 1.0 in: 1.0, out: 0.0 And that is what your training data should look like If it is still to complicated, I recommend you to play around with this front-end neural network library for the browser: Neataptic . It is very easy to fiddle around with. Example
