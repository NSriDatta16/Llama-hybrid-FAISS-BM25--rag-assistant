Check the data pre-processing and augmentation . I just learned this lesson recently and I think it is interesting to share. Nowadays, many frameworks have built in data pre-processing pipeline and augmentation. And these elements may completely destroy the data . For example, suppose we are building a classifier to classify 6 and 9, and we use random rotation augmentation ... A toy example can be found here Why can't scikit-learn SVM solve two concentric circles? My recent lesson is trying to detect if an image contains some hidden information, by stenography tools. And struggled for a long time that the model does not learn. The reason is many packages are rescaling images to certain size and this operation completely destroys the hidden information inside.
