Hibernate and Jboss 6.0

I'm having problems when I'm trying to deploy on JBoss 6.0 a roo spring application. The exception I'm getting is: "Deployment " here goes my war file /" is in error due to the following reason(s): java.lang.VerifyError: (class: org/hibernate/bytecode/cglib/CglibClassTransformer, method: doTransform signature: (Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/Class;Ljava/security/ProtectionDomain;[B)[B) Incompatible object argument for function call" Please if anybody can help me. I'm new into JBoss and can't find the answer for it. Probably it is wrong version of classes but which? Many thanks for any help! Agata
