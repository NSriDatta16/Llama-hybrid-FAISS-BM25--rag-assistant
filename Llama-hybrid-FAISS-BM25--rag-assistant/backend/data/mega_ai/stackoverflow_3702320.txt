The best way to check if a word is English is to look it up in a dictionary. If it's in an a dictionary of English words, than it is an english word. It is possible that a word could be in an English dictionary and a French dictionary also. For example 'me' is both a French and English word. I'm sure you can find lots of downloadable dictionaries online. You can also make your own. For example, you could download the English version of Wikipedia and assume that all words found there are English words. You may or may not to filter out numbers. A regular expression will not tell you whether a word is English. For instance xyvfg matches your pattern \w' but is certainly not an English word. Edit: In theory, using English Phonology, it could be possible to tell whether a phonetic transcription of a word is pronounceable by an english speaker. There are lots of words pronounceable to english speakers which are not actually english words. This could take into account words that may appear in the english language in the future. However, translating between a phonetic transcription and text is quite a challenging problem as there can be many different spellings of the same phonetic transcription. I don't know if anyone has done anything like this. It could be an interesting theoretic excercise. I'm not sure this would be very useful in real world NLP though.
