What is the definition of one-sample Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test?

I have a time series data set of photon arrival times from a detector and need to know whether the arrival time is uniform.It is a continuous distribution? I have calculated the maximum $D$ between the normalized CDF of the photon arrival times. Then what should I do? There is a "$Pr(k\le x)$" in the Wiki link . What does it stand for in my question? Could somebody tell me the basic definition of ks-test? In fact, I can calculate ks-test probability via scipy.stats.kstest . Does anybody know the meaning of args for a uniform distribution? And the two output values? >>> stats.kstest(sample, 'uniform',args=(1,2,3,4,5,6)) (1.0, 0.0) >>> stats.kstest(sample, 'uniform',args=(0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6)) (1.0, 0.0) >>> stats.kstest(sample, 'uniform',args=(0.1,0.2)) (1.0, 0.0) >>> stats.kstest(sample, 'uniform',args=(1,2)) (0.98999999999999999, 0.0) >>> stats.kstest(sample, 'uniform',args=(1.1,2.1)) (0.98499999999999999, 0.0) about uniform I think I should compare two cdf:the normalised real data and the cdf of a uniform distribution that the photons arrive uniformly. Please take a look at my plot.The green points are from real data.There are hundreds of green points.Every green point means an arrival of a new photon.x-axis is time and y-axis is normalised,in fact,it is the percent(cumulative arrival photons/total photon number).The red straight line stands for the cdf of uniform distribution. stats.uniform picks random values every time.Is stats.uniform appropriate? about ks-test I took an image of the 2rd version Numerical Recipes in C. What is the relation between 14.3.9 and wikipedia's Pr(k The significance should be decided only by two values max(D) and sample size,right? Pr(k I can not get a consistent result with stats.kstest(). You mean if I use the real time data which is not normalised,I should use two-sample ks-test,right?
