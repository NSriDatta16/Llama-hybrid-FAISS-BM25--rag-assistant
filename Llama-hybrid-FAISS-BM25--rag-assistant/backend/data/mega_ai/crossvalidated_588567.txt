It is because when $\phi > 1$ it's clearly non-stationary, as it has trend. In this case, the failure of stationarity can be detected by eye, so the ADF test is not necessary. More importantly, the ADF test is really testing whether or not there's a unit root. So the null hypothesis is "yes, there's a unit root" and $\phi > 1$ does not fit into that camp. Note that a time series can pass the ADF test, meaning there's no unit root, and still fail to be stationary. It's a unit root test, not an "if and only if" test for stationarity.
