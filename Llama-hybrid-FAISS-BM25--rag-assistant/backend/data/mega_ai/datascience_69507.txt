You created the labels using the data. If you are able to label them with the data, then why do you need a machine learning model? It simply becomes a rule based classifier. What you would like to do, is to find a function that fits your data points. For example, if you run a decision tree classifier, then it's going to find perfect splits based on your labelling rules. Hence, you're feeding the model a bit about the labelling technique. This is called data leakage. The model sees something really obvious and will have accuracy of 1 usually.
