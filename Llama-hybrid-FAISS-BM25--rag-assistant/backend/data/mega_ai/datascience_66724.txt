None. What you do in business is program algorithms to solve biz problems. Most all common problems have algorithms and processes already. So what you would do is adopt and apply it to your particular situation. Data science being the buzzword du jour, and very poorly understood by almost everyone as to what it is and how to use it, is more a fancy word to get you to apply your programming skills to databases in some fashion. Often this will be some sort of data 'mining' that looks for patterns so that management can ASSume that correlation means causation and then use that as a rule to make decisions. This is how the last wall street meltdown occurred. They made BAD ASSumptions that were close enough for most cases to ignore the errors in it but when that black swan hit they went bankrupt and the government had to bail them out with our tax money.
