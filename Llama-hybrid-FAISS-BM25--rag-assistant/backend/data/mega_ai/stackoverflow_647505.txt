First of all, it's worth remembering that all Java archive files ( .jar / .war /etc...) are all basically just fancy .zip files , with a few added manifests and metadata. Second, to tackle this problem I personally use several tools which handle this problem on all levels: Jad + Jadclipse while working in IDE for decompiling .class files WinRAR , my favorite compression tool natively supports Java archives (again, see first paragraph). Beyond Compare , my favorite diff tool, when configured correctly can do on-the-fly comparisons between any archive file, including jar s. Well worth a try. The advantage of all the aforementioned, is that I do not need to hold any other external tool which clutters my work environment. Everything I will ever need from one of those files can be handled inside my IDE or diffed with other files natively.
