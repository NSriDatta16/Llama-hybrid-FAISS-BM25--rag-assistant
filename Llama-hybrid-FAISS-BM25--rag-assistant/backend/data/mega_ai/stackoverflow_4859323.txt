Automate download logs from server via ssh file transfer to local machine

I need help regarding how to Automate download logs from server via ssh file transfer to local machine.Currently I am downloading logs via login to ssh tool and select the path of the logs and select all the logs and then drag and drop them to local drive but this takes time on VPN. Is there any way to create batch file or run any Java program to downloads all logs just in one line command or single execution automatically.I have tried to check this google but with scp and ftp command I am not able to proceed further.Please suggest.
