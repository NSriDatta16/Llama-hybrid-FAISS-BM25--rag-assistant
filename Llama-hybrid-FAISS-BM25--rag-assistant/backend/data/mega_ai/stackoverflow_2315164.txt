The answer to this question is to implement the ScrollView delegate method willBeginDragging. UITableView inherits from UIScrollView. - (void)scrollViewWillBeginDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView; [textField resignFirstResponder]; } This dismisses the keyboard as soon as the tableView begins scrolling By this inheritance, it is also possible to keep the tableView from scrolling, period. Set the scrollEnabled property to NO, a la self.tableView.scrollEnabled = NO;
