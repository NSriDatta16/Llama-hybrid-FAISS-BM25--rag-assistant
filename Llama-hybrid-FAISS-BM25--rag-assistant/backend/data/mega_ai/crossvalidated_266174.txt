Techniques to detect overfitting

I had a job interview for a data science position. During the interview, I was asked what do I do to make sure the model is not overfitting. My first answer was to use cross-validation to assess the performance of the model. However, the interviewer said that even cross-validation cannot identify completely overfitting. Then I mentioned regularization, but the interviewer said that this could help to reduce overfitting (which I agree), but not to detect it. Are there other techniques that can be used to make sure a model is not overfitting?
