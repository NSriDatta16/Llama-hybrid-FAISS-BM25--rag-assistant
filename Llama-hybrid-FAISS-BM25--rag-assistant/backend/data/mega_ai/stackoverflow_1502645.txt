Timesheets will measure the amount of work in one sense (you can see how their day breaks down and so on) but not I think in the sense you want. Ultimately I don't believe there is a useful metric for Project Managers in this sense, but I don't think that's an issue. I think ultimately you should measure project success rather than "busy-ness". After all, why do you care how busy the PM is if they deliver successful projects? One PM may spend half a day putting together a risk log and mitigation plan which contains 20 risks, another may spend 2 days putting together one which only has 5 risks but none of those numbers are any more useful as a metric than lines of code. The key thing is not how long you spent doing it, how many risks you identified, how big your mitigation plans are, but whether you actually managed risk on the project successfully . You're better off looking at what a Project Manager is meant to do, which is to deliver projects on-time, to budget and to customer satisfaction (which I'd use as the ultimate measure of quality rather than defects). After all, do you measure how "busy" the CEO is? Or is he just judged on the profit the company makes? To do this: Time - The only way it can really be gamed is by massively padding estimates and plans and this can be minimised by reviewing the plans and estimates and having all relevant parties agree them (developers, PM, client). The other side of this is that the PM must agree to the plan rather than have the implementation date foisted on him or her. You might want to measure this on either the overall implementation or each milestone. Budget - Measurable but gameble. For most development projects the key thing her is honest timesheets from the developers and the best way to ensure this is to make it so the PM is the PM but not their line manager. That way the developers have someone to fight their corner (a technical director for instance) if they're being pressured to fill in timesheets to keep the budget down. Again the PM should agree the budget, it's not reasonable to expect him to deliver on something he's told you is unreasonable. Customer satisfaction - Hard to measure so I'd suggest that you keep it simple and go with a straight forward post project review with the account manager and marks out of 10 for communication, delivery and whatever else is important. It is subjective but ultimately so is customer satisfaction. But a lot of it depends on the company culture. For some organisations the key thing will be billable hours, others developer satisfaction will be part of the mix.
