Firebug-like debug tool for flash applications that run in a browser?

Is there a tool/setting with the help of which I can track or debug flash applications running in a browser? Example apps: A multiple file uploader, or a .flv video player. Updated : Just found out that flash apps may be using protocols other than http, for eg. rtmp. The feature I require is to keep track of all communication with any remote server. (Remember the net tab of Firebug?) Any suggestions? UPDATE: Flash is essentially a different user agent, so firebug and tamperdata both cannot track the http communication. UPDATE 2: Fiddler looks perfect for Windows. Any *nix alternative? Thanks! UPDATE 3: Considering debugger version of flash player at http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html
