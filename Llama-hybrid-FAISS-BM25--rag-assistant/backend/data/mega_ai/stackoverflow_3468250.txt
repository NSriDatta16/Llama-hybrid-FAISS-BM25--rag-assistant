C# elegant way to check if a property's property is null

In C#, say that you want to pull a value off of PropertyC in this example and ObjectA , PropertyA and PropertyB can all be null. ObjectA.PropertyA.PropertyB.PropertyC How can I get PropertyC safely with the least amount of code? Right now I would check: if(ObjectA != null && ObjectA.PropertyA !=null && ObjectA.PropertyA.PropertyB != null) { // safely pull off the value int value = objectA.PropertyA.PropertyB.PropertyC; } It would be nice to do something more like this (pseudo-code). int value = ObjectA.PropertyA.PropertyB ? ObjectA.PropertyA.PropertyB : defaultVal; Possibly even further collapsed with a null-coalescing operator. EDIT Originally I said my second example was like js, but I changed it to psuedo-code since it was correctly pointed out that it would not work in js.
