Is this description of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) correct?

Hang Nguyen writes the following in "Machine learning basics (part 14): Linear Discriminant Analysis" : If there are two classes then the LDA draws one hyperplane and projects the data onto this hyperplane in such a way as to maximize the separation of the two categories. This hyperplane is created according to the two criteria considered simultaneously: Maximizing the distance between the means of two classes; Minimizing the variation between each category. Is that correct?
