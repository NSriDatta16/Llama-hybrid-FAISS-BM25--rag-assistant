I would like to add one more dimension to the answers given above. Usually we use cosine similarity with large text, because using distance matrix on paragraphs of data is not recommended. And also if you intend your cluster to be broad you tend to go with cosine similarity as it captures similarity overall. For example if you have texts which are two or three words long at max I feel using cosine similarity does not achieve the precision as achieved by distance metric.
