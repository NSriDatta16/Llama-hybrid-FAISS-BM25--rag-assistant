Bootstrap is used for estimating the uncertainty of some estimator. In your case, you seem to have calculated the mean of means and used bootstrap to find the distribution of the mean of means. This is not the distribution of the means, you already approximated this distribution by using the histogram. This is why the uncertainty does not range over the whole range of the means. Recall that if the standard deviation of the means is $\sigma^2$ , then the standard error would be $\sqrt n$ times smaller and this is what you observed. Bootstrap is not a method for estimating the true distribution or true mean of the data. If you want to estimate the raw data given the sample means $m_i$ , you additionally need to know the sample sizes for each sample, in such a case, the mean of the raw data can be obtained using weighted mean of means, where the sample sizes $n_i$ are used as weights $$ \tilde m = \frac{\sum_i m_i n_i}{\sum_i n_i} $$ if the sample sizes are the same, $n_1 = n_2 = \dots$ , this is the same as using the arithmetic average of the means. If the sample sizes are not the same, the larger samples would have less impact on the final estimate than they need to, leading to a biased estimate. See also a similar thread that we had recently: Can any quantity be bootstrapped?
