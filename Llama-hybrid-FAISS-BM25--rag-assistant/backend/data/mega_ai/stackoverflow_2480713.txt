MySQL: averaging with nulls

Is there a simple way I can exclude nulls from affecting the avg? They appear to count as 0, which is not what I want. I simply don't want to take their average into account, yet here is the catch, I can't drop them from the result set, as that record has data on it that I do need. Update: example: select avg(col1+col2), count(col3) from table1 where group by SomeArbitraryCol having avg(col1+col2) 3 order by avgcol1+col2) asc; This would be working for me, but the averages aren't accurate as they are counting null values as 0, which is really throwing off the whole average.
