You can use various pseudo-R statistics, which are based on deviance produced by the likelihood of full and restricted models. Deviance is produced by the glm function so you do not need any extra packages. Hosmer-Lemeshow test can also be used to test global fit for logistic regression. It can produce result that link function used might not be right one. http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/r-help/library/ResourceSelection/html/hoslem.test.html
