In some setups, not only they can , they need to. An idealized Denoising Autoencoder with a weak decoder would map any input+noise, as well as just input, to the same eventual latent code - its encoder would be just a lossless compression of the noiseless data, plus noise filters. For a negative case, in a pathological scenario the latent encoding could collapse into a single vector, producing a single underfitted reconstruction with a local minimum of reconstruction cost. That's just classical AEs. A VAE should produce overlapping codes, if you consider the code to be the sample rather than the distribution parameter, being N-dimensional bubbles in a compact and (approximately) continuous latent space.
