You could make AJAX GET requests (appending the data to the URL) and execute them with a certain time interval. I would recommend jQuery, but it may not be ideal in a .NET environment. jQuery.ajax() - http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ jQuery.get() - http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ NOTE : I wish to post data to this external website without having to go through the form and pressing submit. I took this as meaning you didn't want to actually submit the form, do you want to submit the form but simply not by pressing the submit button? If you actually want the form to submit, then you should indeed just change the form's method attribute to get instead of post . If however you do wish to stay on the form page and need to post the data to some other resource with the data in the URL string (there are reasons for and aganist doing this that you should look into -- scroll down to 9.3 GET ), then just make an AJAX GET request, otherwise just POST the data using AJAX. Either way, you'll have to make some sort of an asynchronous call.
