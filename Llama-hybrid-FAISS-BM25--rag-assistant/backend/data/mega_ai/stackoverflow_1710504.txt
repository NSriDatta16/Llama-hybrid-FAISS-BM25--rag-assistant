There should be no problem to using different database vendors in different environments (pay attention to ChssPly76's answer that TEST and PROD should be the same). Although I haven't tried Derby (yet). Personally I like to use HSQLDB for the DEV environment. It's small, flexible, and easily portable, requiring little-to-no setup. Using a tool like Unitils to glue together Hibernate, DbUnit, and JUnit has worked exceedingly well for me. Before the JUnit tests are executed the HSQLDB is loaded with static test data. This allows for the data access layer JUnit tests to have assertions based on real data (it's loaded from some xml files sitting near the tests). (One word of caution with Unitils is that the default "loadStrategy" is to drop all existing data before loading, so be careful where you point that thing).
