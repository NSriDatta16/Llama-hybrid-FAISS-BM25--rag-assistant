Consider Ruby as an alternative to Perl. It stole most of Perl's one-liner commandline args ( -i , -p , -l , -e , -n ) and auto-sets $_ for you like Perl does and has plenty of regex goodness. Additionally Ruby's syntax may be more comfortable and easier to read or write than Perl's or sed's. (Or not, depending on your tastes.) ruby -pi.bak -e '$_.gsub!(/foo|bar/){|x| x.upcase}' *.txt vs. perl -pi.bak -e 's/(foo|bar)/\U\1/g' *.txt In many cases when dealing with one-liners, performance isn't enough of an issue to care whether you use lightweight sed or heavyweight Perl or heaveier-weight Ruby. Use whatever is easiest to write.
