Technically, both will work. However, creating dummies is rarely a good idea in random forests as it weights down the chance of other variables to be picked for splitting. Integer coding often does the job pretty well. The more levels, the more it helps to use a meaningful order. Some implementations - e.g. ranger in R - do smart ordering, internally. Avoiding dummy coding also greatly helps to interprete the models by the usual suspects (variable importance, partial dependence plots).
