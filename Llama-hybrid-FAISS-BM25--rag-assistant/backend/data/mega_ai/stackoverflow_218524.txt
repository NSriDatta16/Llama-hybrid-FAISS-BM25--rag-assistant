The dragProxy is a static getter on the DragManager and is scoped to mx_internal. So to reference it, you'd have to do something like this: import mx_internal; And in a drag event handler: var p:* = DragManager.mx_internal::dragProxy; I'm not sure how you could prevent the animation. If I find out, I'll let you know.
