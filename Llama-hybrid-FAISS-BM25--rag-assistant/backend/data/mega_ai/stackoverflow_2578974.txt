ASP.NET will render TextBox es as textarea s (in your case, because it's multiline) or input s. These are standard HTML fragments which are just plain text containers. You can style them, but you can't really linkify the contents of them. If you really just want to put the text of a link into a box, do this: // either from the server: txtOtherApps.Text = YourLinkString; // or from the client: document.getElementById(' ').value = YourJsLinkValue; If you want something to happen with the user clicks on the text area, you can add an onclick handler to it...but this would be weird.
