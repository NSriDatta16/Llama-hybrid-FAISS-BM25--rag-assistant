Feature selection for string columns

I tried sklearn SelectKBest for feature selection (feature scores) of supervised machine learning before. It looks good, but can only take numbers as inputs. Although I can present some string columns into numbers, for examples: Max/min length of strings nunique of different strings, etc. I still hope there's a feature selection method to read strings as input. Please recommend some feature selection that be able to analyze string (*remark) columns. Or Python import xxx. remark: Or maybe some special kinds of strings, e.g., IP addresses, web URL.
