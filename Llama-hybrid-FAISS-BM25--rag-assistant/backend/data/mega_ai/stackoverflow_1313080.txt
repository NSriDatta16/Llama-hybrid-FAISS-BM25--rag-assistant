call action method for a uibutton without using interface builder in cocoa

I'm currently calling an action method in an object by dragging a button to the view in interface builder. I then drag an object to the panel and specify my object with the action method. I shift drag my button to the object and choose my action method. This works in calling my method. I would like to instead call my action method without interface builder from uiview class that the current nib is derived from. Does anyone know how I can accomplish this?
