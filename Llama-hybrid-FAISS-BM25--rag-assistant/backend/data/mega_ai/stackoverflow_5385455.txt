Find out why your company was interested in adopting Scrum in the first place. If it was to produce better quality code, then you could focus on things like test coverage, bug count, etc. I like the CRAP index . Many companies adopt Scrum because most of their problems - including low quality code, tight deadlines and rework - are caused because they produce the wrong code in the first place. Either requirements are misunderstood, or the stakeholders don't quite know what they want. If that's your problem, you might want to measure throughput (how long it takes a story, on average, to go from analysis through to release) or feedback (how long it takes you to know whether the work you did is actually usable, or not - bearing in mind that when it's not usable, you want to know as soon as possible). I try to avoid measuring things like productivity. It's very easy to be productive without being effective . Focus on the Goal . Most of the metrics in Kanban can be used alongside Scrum and will help here. I very much like Cumulative Flow Diagrams, because they show all kinds of feedback loops and constraints in the system. Oh, whatever you do - measure the team , not individuals. As soon as people think they are being measured as individuals, they'll stop playing nice with the team.
