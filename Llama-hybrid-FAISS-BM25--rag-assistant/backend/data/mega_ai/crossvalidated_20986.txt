probability It seems to me that most of the problems associated with interpreting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals stem from the application of a Bayesian definition of "probability" when the procedure is based on a frequentist one. For example the p-value being the probability the null hypothesis is true, when AFAICS no probability can be associated with the truth of a particular hypothesis in a frequentist setting.
