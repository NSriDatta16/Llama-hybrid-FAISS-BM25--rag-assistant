WiX: Utilizing multiple cabs in a very large application

I've recently started learning and utilizing WiX, and my first true project with WiX is repackaging a custom configuration of Qt. It's been quite a challenge, as the Qt project is massive. I've managed to smash my way very inelegantly through the process, but have recently reached a snag during linking. I've been receiving Light.exe error "LGHT0296", most likely because I was creating a CAB that was much greater than 2 GB. After trying for the highest compression level, and having that not make a difference, the only option left to me is to split the installation package into more than one CAB file (Side note: The error returned was extraordinarily helpful in telling me what courses of action to try). Anyway, I've found myself a bit lost when it comes to creating multiple CAB files. I'm not entirely sure what I should do in this case, and I haven't been able to find any helpful documentation or examples where this splitting is done. What's the best way for me to go about doing this? Thanks.
