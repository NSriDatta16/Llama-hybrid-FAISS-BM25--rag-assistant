Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals on non-linear regression models are based on asymptotic theory. To construct a test, you may extract the diagonal element of the covariance matrix that corresponds to your estimate and as usual form the t-ratio. You can then use the critical values of the standard normal distribution to reach a decision. One warning is in order though. As these tests are based on large sample theory, it's not prudent to pay much attention to them when your sample is quite small. There is no clear guideline as to "how large is sufficiently large" but personally if it's less than 50-60 observations, I would be very suspicious. Hope this helps.
