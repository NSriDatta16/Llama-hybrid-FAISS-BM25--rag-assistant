Does CNN need to have training data and validation data?

I am using a simple CNN model, and I want to run a test, input is an image of Bird, the output is either "0" or "1", where "1" means the output is correct, is a bird. Do I need to set my training data and validation image data? If yes, can I weigh it as 90% training data and 10% validation data? Thank you.
