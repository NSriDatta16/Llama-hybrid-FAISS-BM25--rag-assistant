It will almost never be meaningful to use the no intercept model in logistic regression. The intercept parameter $\beta_0$ is modelling the marginal distribution of the response $Y$, so using $\beta_0=0$ is tantamont to assuming that $P(Y=1)=0.5$, marginally. Do you really know that? If that is untrue, you cannot trust any inference from the no intercept model.
