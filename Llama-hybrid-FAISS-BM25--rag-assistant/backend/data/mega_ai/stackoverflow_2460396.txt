The better solution would be a switch statement. This will allow you to check the value of x.GetId() just once, rather than (on average) 25 times as your code is doing now. If you want to get fancy, you can use a data structure containing pointers to functions that handle whatever it is that's in the braces. If your ID values are consecutive (i.e. numbers between 1 and 50) then an array of function pointers would be best. If they are spread out, then a map would be more appropriate.
