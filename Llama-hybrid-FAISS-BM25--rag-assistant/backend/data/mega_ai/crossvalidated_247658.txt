What's a simple data set to to try clustering algorithms on?

I'm very new to Machine Learning and programming. I'm trying to run clustering algorithms on data sets but all examples I find contains lot of data and it confuses me. Can you give me a simple sample data, maybe a set of 2d-vectors, which I can prove the algorithms with and see how they work? Update: It would be very helpful if the examples are in python
