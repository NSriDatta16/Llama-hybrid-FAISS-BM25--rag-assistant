Here are some actual measurements. (Using SQLite; may try it with MySQL later.) Data = All 1,000,000 combinations of w, h ∈ {1...1000}, in randomized order. CREATE TABLE items (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, w INTEGER, h INTEGER) Average time (of 20 runs) to execute SELECT * FROM items WHERE w = 320 and h = 200 was 5.39±0.29 µs. CREATE TABLE items (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, dimensions TEXT) Average time to execute SELECT * FROM items WHERE dimensions = '320x200' was 5.69±0.23 µs. There is no significant difference, efficiency-wise. But There is a huge difference in terms of usability. For example, if you want to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangles, the two-column approach is easy: SELECT w * h, 2 * (w + h) FROM items Try to write the corresponding query for the other way.
