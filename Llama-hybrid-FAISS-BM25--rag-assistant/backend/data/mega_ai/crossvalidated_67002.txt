Interpreting of hypothesis prediction after reversed relationship

I am currently facing a big issue with regard to my master thesis. I developed following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Managers’ investment in innovation increases when the organization is judged in decline state ( positive relationship between organizational decline and investments in innovation) Hypothesis 2: The relationship between organizational decline and investments in innovation is positively moderated by managerial ownership: Managers’ with higher company ownership will invest more in innovation when the organization is judged in a decline state Hypothesis 3: The relationship between organizational decline and investments in innovation is positively moderated by institutional ownership: Firms with higher institutional ownership will invest more in innovation when the organization is judged in a decline state Here you can find my conceptual model: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/29/kvji.png/ This is the outcome of the regression: $log(Investments in Innovation) = 6.984 - 0.852Decline - 4.703Managerialown + 3.030ManagerialownDecline-1.870Institionalown + 1.14 Institionalown x Decline $ My issue is now at the beginning I predicted a positive moderation in Hypothesis 2 and 3 based on a positive relationship in Hypothesis 1. Now the return shows that there is a negative relationship in Hypothesis 1 (so managers invest less), yet both moderators Managerialown and Institutionalown mitigate this relationship (so managers invest less at a slower rater with increasing ownership) Do I confirm my Hypothesis 2 and 3 or reject them? As I understand, a positive moderation intensifies the main effect. However, now the moderator lessens the main effect of Hypothesis 1, yet my second description of the hypotheses is still somehow valid ( Managers’ with higher company ownership will invest more in innovation when the organization is judged in a decline state ) Thank you very much for your help.
