Do I need to html-encode title attributes (tooltips)?

In my markup I am using HTML title attributes which I set by the Tooltip property of various ASP.NET controls like an asp:Label . The content of those titles come from a database and I use data binding syntax, for instance: ' ToolTip=' ' /> Now, tooltips seem to be displayed as plain text on Windows and in the browsers I have tested. So the HTML-encoding is not what I really want and I am inclined to remove the encoding. Can this be dangerous in any way if the database fields may contain script tags for example? My question is basically: Is it always guaranteed that HTML-title attributes are displayed as plain text ? Are they always displayed as tooltips at all, or is it possible that some browsers (or OSs) display them in another way and allow and render HTML content in the title attributes? Edit: Looking at some of the answers it seems I didn't phrase my question well, so here are some additions: If I have in the code snippet above a PersonShortName of "PM" in my database and as the PersonFullName a name with non-ASCII characters in it like Umlauts in "Peter MÃ¼ller" the browser displays in the tooltip Peter M&#252;ller when I apply HttpUtility.HtmlEncode like in the code example - which is ugly. I've also tested a simple HTML fragment like: alert('Evil script') " >Hello The script in the title attribute didn't run in a browser with enabled Javascript (tested with Firefox), instead it was displayed in the tooltip as plain text. Therefore my guess was that title attributes are always rendered as plain text. But as Felipe Alsacreations answered below there exist "rich tooltip plugins" which may render the title attribute as HTML. So in this case encoding is a good thing. But how can I know that? Perhaps HttpUtility.HtmlEncode isn't the right solution and I have to filter only HTML tags but not encode simple special characters to make sure that the plain text is displayed correctly and to protect "rich HTML tooltips" at the same time. But it looks like a costly work - only for a simple tooltip.
