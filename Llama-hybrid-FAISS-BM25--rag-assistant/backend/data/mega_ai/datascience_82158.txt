How do I model time series data that contains a unique ID and a constant time step?

My data currently looks like this (after processing, 15 mins timesteps): date ID count 2017-06-01 00:00:00 1 4208 2017-06-01 00:00:00 2 3993 2017-06-01 00:15:00 1 3740 2017-06-01 00:15:00 2 3482 ... I want to predict the count for a given ID in a given timestep (eg: count for ID 1 at 20:00:00-20:15:00 interval) using the past data. I believe that it can be modelled using LSTM since we are using a time sequence, but I'm unsure on how to format the inputs/outputs for it. I would appreciate if someone could share any related work or an overview of how to model such a problem.
