You can convert this into a logistic regression without having to blow the data set up to the size of the groups, you just have to use weights. For that first group, you would split that into [1,0,1,0,1] (last column is the response) and the weight would be [(# in that group) * 0.23], and [1,0,1,0,0] with a weight of [(# in that group) * 0.77]. See the R documentation for GLM with the parameter "weights" for how to execute that in R. T After that, it's a straightforward logistic regression. This is equivalent to the binomial regression that someone else has suggested.
