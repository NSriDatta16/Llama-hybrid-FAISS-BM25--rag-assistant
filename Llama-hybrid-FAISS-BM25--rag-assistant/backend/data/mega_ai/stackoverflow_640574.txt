If you're adamant that you want to test your code in this way, you could use reflections to create a DragEventArgs. However, the real question, I think, is if you're going in the right direction with your unit testing. I usually avoid doing any testing directly on my Views and stick with testing the more easily testable viewmodels (if indeed you're using MVVM) because of exactly the issue you're having right now.
