Whats is efficient database design in sqlite when I only need to insert and retrieve smallest entry in an integer column?

Basically I need a min-heap functionality with sqlite as my data storage. Lets say I need a table with 2 columns. 1st is unique ids and 2nd is integer value. I always need the the id with smallest integer value. Any suggestions ??
