Why is the residual independence assumption important in OLS regression and how may it be violated?

I haven't found a clear answer to this question yet. What parts of the equation does it affect exactly, and how can b weights still be unbiased? Does it bias your results? I know the answer to the last question is yes, but how and in what ways? People say time series designs and clusters violate this assumption, but what other ways can it be violated?
