I suspect a problem with serialising (and deserializing) your ServerCollection object. Internally, objects passed to IsolatedStorageSettings are serialized as XML (using DataContractSerializer - which is probably part of the performance hit of using IsolatedStorageSettings ). If your object can't be deserialized correctly you could see this problem. As an alternative I'd recommend handling the [de]serialization yourself and then storing the serialized version in IsolatedStorageSettings .
