how to save deep learning model and test it after training?

I have a CNN model written using tensorflow for python, the model is for classifying lung CT images (cancer/no-cancer), after training the model with training and validation data and get a reasonable accuracy, after all, that I need to test the model with test data, but I don't know how to do that? how to save the model and using it for testing?
