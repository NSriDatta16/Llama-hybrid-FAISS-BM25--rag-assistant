To determine whether a time series is additive or multiplicative, we can use seasonal_decompose which provides us three separate components (trend, seasonality, and residual). We can check the variance of seasonality and residual components for additive and multiplicative decompose. The seasonality and residual components with constant variance represent the time series well. from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose # Multiplicative Decomposition mul_decompose = seasonal_decompose(df['value'], model='multiplicative', extrapolate_trend='freq') # Additive Decomposition add_decompose = seasonal_decompose(df['value'], model='additive', extrapolate_trend='freq') Using this image we can very clearly observe variance of seasonality, and the residual component is constant for multiplicative decompose. So the time series is a multiplicative time series.
