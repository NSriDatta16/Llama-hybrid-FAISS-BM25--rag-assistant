What is Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)?

I'm looking to do an optical character recognition (OCR) project. After doing some research I've come across an architecture that seems interesting: CNN+RNN+CTC. I'm familiar with convoluted neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), but what is Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)? I'd like an explanation in layman's terms.
