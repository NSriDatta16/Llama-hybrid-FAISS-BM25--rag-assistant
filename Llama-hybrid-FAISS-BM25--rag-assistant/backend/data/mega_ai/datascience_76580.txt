Find causal relations between multiple branches of science

I have no basic understanding of data science. I got this idea of comparing data and finding causal relationships from different branches of science. For example, find out if there are any relations between astronomy and the economy, or if I choose to drink soda or water for lunch, and does that relate to the fly pattern of an insect. I want to act on this idea and try to manifest it, but I have no idea if it is possible or how it works. My question is basically, is it possible to create such a software. If yes, how can I create such a software. I am a professional developer, so I have experience in programming.
