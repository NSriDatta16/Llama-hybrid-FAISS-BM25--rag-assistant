seems questionable as far as security to embed an email in the source. Retrieving the email via ajax vs embedding it directly in the source suffer from the same security problem: someone sniffing traffic could get the email. To avoid this you would need to either Figure out a way to not send the email to the client in the first place. Only send the email address to the client over https I imagine lots of websites just punt on this issue and send the email to the client unencrypted.
