Does multiplying the likelihood by a constant change the Bayesian inference using MCMC?

For numerical Bayesian inference we have Posterior~Prior*Likelihood. In MCMC we do not need to calculate the denominator in Bayes rule. My question is that can I multiply the Likelihood by a large constant while making sure that the posterior is still the same?
