Meaning of "or 1 in p" in Wikipedia article on Normal Distribution

I was taking a closer look at this table in the Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Standard_deviation_and_coverage . It is the 4th column labeled or 1 in p that I'm having trouble with. It seems to be the inverse of the 3rd column, 1-p . What is the meaning of or 1 in p ?
