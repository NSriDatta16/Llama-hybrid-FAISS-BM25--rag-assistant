How the multiplication of observations numbers contributes to Bayesian assumption in BIC calculation?

The model selection process applies both AIC and BIC in various situations: $$\operatorname{AIC} = -2\operatorname{ln}(\operatorname{likelihood}) + 2k$$ and $$\operatorname{BIC} = -2\operatorname{ln}(\operatorname{likelihood}) + \operatorname{ln}(N)k$$ $k$ = model degrees of freedom $N$ = number of observations The only difference I could see in the estimations of AIC and BIC is $\operatorname{ln}(N)$ . Could anyone please clarify how a multiplication of $(\operatorname{ln}(N))$ contributes to Bayesian assumption? If not, why this is called as Bayesian IC? Many Thanks
