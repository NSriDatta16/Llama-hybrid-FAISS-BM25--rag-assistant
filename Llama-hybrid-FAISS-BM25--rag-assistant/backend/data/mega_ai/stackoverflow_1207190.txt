Embedding Base64 Images

Purely out of curiosity, which browsers does Base64 image embedding work in? What I'm referring to is this . I realize it's not usually a good solution for most things, as it increases the page size quite a bit - I'm just curious. Some examples: HTML: CSS: div.image { width:100px; height:100px; background-image:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAADIA...); }
