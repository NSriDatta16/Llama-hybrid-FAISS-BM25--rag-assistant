By the time that line is complete var will hold the value returned by fun() and any memory on the stack used by fun will be gone: "push", "pop" all tidy. Calling conventions: everything that the compiler organises so that fun can do its work. Consider those parameters x, y, z. What order do they get pushed onto the stack (indeed do they get passed via the stack)? Doesn't matter so long as the caller and callee agree! It's a convention.
