I don't believe that the EAFP encourages the use of exceptions for flow control. Rather, it tells us that we needn't bother checking for the existence of a particular key in a dictionary or property of an object before we reference it. Throwing exceptions as an alternative to if statements or having correct while statements or instead of using break or continue inside of a loop does not fall under that category. That's lazy, error-prone progamming and it should be avoided.
