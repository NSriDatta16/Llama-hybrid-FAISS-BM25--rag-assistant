It is possible to send a multipart response in HTTP : In general, HTTP treats a multipart message-body no differently than any other media type: strictly as payload. […] an HTTP user agent SHOULD follow the same or similar behavior as a MIME user agent would upon receipt of a multipart type. […] If an application receives an unrecognized multipart subtype, the application MUST treat it as being equivalent to "multipart/mixed". But since Firefox is the only browser that I know about to support such multipart responses (apart from multipart/byterange ), you should use some archive file format for this purpose.
