Correction variance estimation from the posterior in a Bayesian framework

My question is quite basic, I have posterior distributions for some parameters derived from an arbitrary Bayesian framework. Since I know that the posterior variance under-estimates the true variance, what types of correction are available in order to have better inferences ? I more interested in general methods/frameworks than problem specific solutions. Any insight will be appreciated.
