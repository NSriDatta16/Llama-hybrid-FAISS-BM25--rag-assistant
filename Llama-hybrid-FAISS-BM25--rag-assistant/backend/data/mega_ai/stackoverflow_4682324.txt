I'm not an expert in this but this is the way I understand it. RDF is a generic way to store pretty much any information that you want and define how you want to store it. XMP uses a subset of RDF and comes with a bunch of pre-built templates for data storage such as IPTC and Dublin Core. You can still store arbitrary data, too, but are encouraged to use the templates defined. In other words, don't redefine "image description" if its already somewhere else. What I'd say to do is look at Dublin Core and IPTC and see if that works for you. If so, go down the XMP route. If everything's custom, RDF might be the better way.
