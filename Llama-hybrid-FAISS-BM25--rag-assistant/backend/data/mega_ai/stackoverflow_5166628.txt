It is straightforward to do exactly as you want. First, use po::value > instead of po::value as program-options provides special support of vectors. Then, reference your two vectors directly as typedef std::vector vec_string; cfig_file_options.add_options() ((heading+".mac").c_str(), po::value (&mac), "ENDPT MAC") ((heading+".ip").c_str(), po::value ( &ip), "ENDPT IP") ; The key here is that all mac and ip addresses use common vectors for storage. I should point out that this won't necessarily associate the endpt number in the ini file with the correct index in the vector, unless a strict order is maintained in the file.
