I'm not completly sure, but I think that what you are doing is wrong, since you are only considering the mantissa and forgetting the exponent completely. You need to use the exponent to shift the value in the mantissa to find the actual integer part. For a description of the storage mechanism of 32bit floats, take a look here .
