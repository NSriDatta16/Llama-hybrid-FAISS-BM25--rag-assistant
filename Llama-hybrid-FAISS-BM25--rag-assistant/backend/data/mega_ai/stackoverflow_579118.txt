Game messaging on mobile platforms?

Does anyone have recommendations on messaging for multi player games on mobile platforms? I assume SMS would be too expensive for the average player. I'm not talking about lots of real-time messages, but simply one message per player per round to all other players. Is there any available messaging that is cross platform (say, windows mobile to/from iphone, android, etc.)? add'l info: the constraint I have (may not be solid) is that it should be peer-to-peer -- no server needed.
