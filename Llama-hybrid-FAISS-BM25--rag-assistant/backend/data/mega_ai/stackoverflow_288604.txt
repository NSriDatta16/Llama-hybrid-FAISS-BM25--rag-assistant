All public functions must be clearly understandable by someone who has a passing familiarity with your code base, but NOT in your specific section without having to delve into the code. If you need to write a short line to explain what a function does, chances are you named your function/classes poorly. The name should be self explanatory in that case If it requires more than 1 brief sentence to explain, that's probably a good comment If it takes a paragraph, your function is probably doing too much besides likely unclear names. It's usually better to err on the side of comments IF YOU MAKE SURE THEY ARE ACCURATE . Inaccurate and/or unmaintainable comments are worse than no comments So applying these rules: In your first example: "// create new customer instance" is redundant. The code is crystal clear. THe other comments are perfect. They clarify what the code is operating upon/what it's resuls are In your second example the comments are wasted effort and make it hard to read. All you need to do is give the function a proper name. Not that vague "count". That is poor naming.
