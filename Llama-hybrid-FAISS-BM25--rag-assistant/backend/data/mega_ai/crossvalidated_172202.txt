Does it make sense to purposefully run multiple regression with missing values for certain dummy variables?

Let me explain. You have a multiple regression using time series data within an econometrics model. And, some of your variables are either dummy variables or interaction variables. So, they take a value of 0 or a continuous value. As an example, let's say one of your variable is the quarterly change in 5 year Treasury rate. And, you disaggregate that variable into two. One would cover the pre-Greenspan era from 1951 to 1986. And, the other one would cover the Greenspan era to the present. The first variable will show the quarterly change in such Treasury rates until mid 1986. Thereafter, it will have a value of 0 or 0%. Someone suggested that instead such a variable in the Greenspan era to the present should not have a zero value, but instead be blank. In essence, creating purposefully missing values. The argument is that this variable does not have a true value of 0% in the specified time frame. Instead, it is truly absent. And, this could affect the magnitude of its regression coefficient or impact on Y. I question this rational on two counts. First, I am not sure that any software could calculate such a regression with variables with different numbers of observations. And, I think there is a very specific reason for that as outlined in my second argument. Second, multiple regressions are resolved through matrix algebra including the use of covariance matrices and the inverting and transposing of such matrices. And, those calculations are impossible with missing values on some of the variables. In my mind, I believe I have already answered this question. Can you tell me if this answer is correct. Or am I missing something.
