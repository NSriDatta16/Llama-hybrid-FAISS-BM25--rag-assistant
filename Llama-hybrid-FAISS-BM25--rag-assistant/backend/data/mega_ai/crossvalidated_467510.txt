As you said, MCMC estimates the posterior distribution. To get a point estimate for $\theta$ , it's your decision to use MAP, posterior expectation or something else. MCMC creates samples from the unnormalized version on the RHS, i.e. $p(\theta)p(y|\theta)$ . You'll need to choose a prior for $\theta$ and also express the likelihood of the data, i.e. $p(y|\theta)$ . For example, $y_i$ can be Bernoulli RVs and can be assumed iid, where $\theta$ is the probability of having $y=1$ . Then, we can write the likelihood as follows: $$p(y|\theta)=\prod_{i=1}^N\theta^{y_i}(1-\theta)^{y_i}$$
