Is any drag and drop facility in BlackBerry?

I am new to BlackBerry. I have experience on Android. Now I want to learn BlackBerry. In Android an application contains res folder in that we add the layout in XML form and we can create the forms easily using views and layouts. In the same way, is there any facility in BlackBerry? How do I prepare forms in BlackBerry?
