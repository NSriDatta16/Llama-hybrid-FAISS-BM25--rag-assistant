Factory per DTO

We had a debate - cons and pros of having a factory per dto in order to test some service. The idea is that the service is being invoked with primitive types parameters (username, password, etc), but the service dependency should be leveraged using those primitives. The only way to test it was to inject into service an additional dependency, DtoFactory, and that way to ensure that primitive parameters are utilized the way we wanted. What worries me is the idea of "FactoryX per DtoX". What would be an alternative? Thanks
