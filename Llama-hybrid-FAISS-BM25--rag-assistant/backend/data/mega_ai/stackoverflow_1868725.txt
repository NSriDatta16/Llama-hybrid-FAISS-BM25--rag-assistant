This is a solution, but is not an elegant way (IMHO): Create a virtual directory Have it point to the folder with the files (in this case, a PHP plugin) Give it the proper permissions Change the config options for the virtual directory in IIS and make sure the wildcard mapping for that directory is removed. This works like a charm for my situation. However, is there any way to not have to deal with virtual directories?
