Time series with SARIMA, how to understand the right seasonality parameter

I'm on my way learning the Time series forecast, but have some doubts. As for the ARIMA model, parameters like the p, q can be inferred from the ACF and PACF plotting. As for d, this work in combination with the degree of differencing. And, unless I misunderstand, can be left to 0 if the dataserie is already differenced before (e.g. data.diff()) More or less, with the approach above, I am getting decent outputs, but still not very close. The best I was able to get using the SARIMA model, but I couldn't really find any decent explanation on how to seek for the parameters. So the logic I used (whether correct or wrong, please tell me) is to use the p parameter as usual, but move the q to Q. Then, there is the s parameter, which more or less I pick in relation of the data. With daily data, I normally look at the peaks and then use a multiple of 7 according to the best performance. But what for the weekly aggregated data? I had an instance of a dataset where the resulting RSME was getting better only with parameter like p=46 that doesn't sound normal. Can you please feed me in with some explanation or guide(s) I can use to fill the gaps? Below there are the initial ACF and PACF plots, for which a p=46 and q=8 demonstrate better prediction than a p=1 and q=8. Thanks
