We are currently using an automated build process for our asp.net mvc application. We use the following tools: TeamCity SVN nUnit Selenium We use an msbuild script that runs on a build agent which can be any amount of machines. The msbuild script gets the latest version of code from svn and builds it. On success it then deploys the artifacts to a given machine/folder and creates the virtual site in IIS. We then use MSBuild contrib tasks to run sql scripts to install the database and load data, you could also do a restore. On success we kick off the nUnit tests. The test setup ensures that selenium is up and running and then drives the selenium tests much in the same way that Watin does. Selenium has a good recorder for tests which can be exported to c#. The good thing about Selenium is that you can drive FF, Chorme and IE rather than being restricted to IE which was the case with Watin the last time i looked at it. You can also use Selenium to do load testing with the Selenium Grid therefore you can reuse the same tests. On success msbuild then tags the build in svn. TeamCity has a job that runs overnight that will deploy the latest tag to a staging environment ready for the business users to check the project status the following morning. In a previous life we had nant & msbuild scripts to fully manage the environment (installing java, selenium etc) however this does take a lot of time so as a pre req we assume each build agent has these installed. In time we will include these tasks.
