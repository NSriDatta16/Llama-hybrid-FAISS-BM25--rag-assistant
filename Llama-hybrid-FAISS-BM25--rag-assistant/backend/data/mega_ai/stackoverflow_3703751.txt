How do I find out how macPorts stole my port:80?

I had MAMP installed (and working fine) then I tried to install mongoDB through macPorts. macports then began installing a bunch of dependencies. after that, http://localhost started giving an "It Works!" screen. after rebooting to see if it might fix it, I found that I could not start my MAMP server. console said this: 9/13/10 1:20:54 PM [0x0-0x12012].de.appsolute.MAMP[133] (48)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:80 I know that macPorts did something stupid to mess with me. how can I find out what it installed thats stealing port:80? here's some command I've tried: (:80 didn't work, so I just used 80) $ sudo netstat -an | grep 80 Password: tcp46 0 0 *.80 *.* LISTEN udp6 0 0 fe80::21e:52ff:f.123 *.* udp6 0 0 fe80::1%lo0.123 *.* and: $ lsof -i :80 COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME firefox-b 451 biting_duck 39u IPv4 0x0ab806b0 0t0 TCP 192.168.0.198:49515->stackoverflow.com:http (ESTABLISHED) firefox-b 451 biting_duck 40u IPv4 0x0ab87ec8 0t0 TCP 192.168.0.198:49517->sstatic.net:http (ESTABLISHED) firefox-b 451 biting_duck 41u IPv4 0x0ab88aec 0t0 TCP 192.168.0.198:49516->pz-in-f95.1e100.net:http (ESTABLISHED) firefox-b 451 biting_duck 42u IPv4 0x0ab97334 0t0 TCP 192.168.0.198:49518->sstatic.net:http (ESTABLISHED) firefox-b 451 biting_duck 47u IPv4 0x0ab87abc 0t0 TCP 192.168.0.198:49519->sstatic.net:http (ESTABLISHED) firefox-b 451 biting_duck 48u IPv4 0x0ab886e0 0t0 TCP 192.168.0.198:49520->sstatic.net:http (ESTABLISHED) firefox-b 451 biting_duck 50u IPv4 0x0ab89b1c 0t0 TCP 192.168.0.198:49521->sstatic.net:http (ESTABLISHED) firefox-b 451 biting_duck 51u IPv4 0x0ab86680 0t0 TCP 192.168.0.198:49522->peak-colo-196-216.peak.org:http (ESTABLISHED) firefox-b 451 biting_duck 54u IPv4 0x0ab81ef8 0t0 TCP 192.168.0.198:49523->gravatar.com:http (ESTABLISHED) firefox-b 451 biting_duck 55u IPv4 0x0ab82710 0t0 TCP 192.168.0.198:49524->gravatar.com:http (ESTABLISHED) firefox-b 451 biting_duck 56u IPv4 0x0ab8a334 0t0 TCP 192.168.0.198:49526->64.34.80.176:http (ESTABLISHED) firefox-b 451 biting_duck 57u IPv4 0x0ab812d4 0t0 TCP 192.168.0.198:49525->pv-in-f101.1e100.net:http (ESTABLISHED)
