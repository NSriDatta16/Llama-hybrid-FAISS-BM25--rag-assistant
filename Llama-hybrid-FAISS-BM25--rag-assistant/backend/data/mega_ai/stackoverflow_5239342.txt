using emacs-mode.el to execute with arguments

I'm writing a script that takes arguments, and I'd like to use emacs-model.el's C-c C-c to execute it while I'm writing it. But this merely runs the script without arguments, which then causes my script to complain. Is there an elegant way around this? My current solution is to hardcode the arguments.
