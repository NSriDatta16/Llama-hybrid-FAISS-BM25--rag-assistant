correct update of bayesian posteriors

the question looks a bit artificial but I simply tried to get rid of useless details. There are two persons, A, and B. they each got a number, i and b , correspondingly. and their task is to guess the right number c=(a+b)/2. Each of them knows his/her own number but not the number of the other. If the B's prior beliefs were distributed normally (or by any distribution that is know to us and to B), how B should update his posterior probabilities if we informed B that a In other words, we just tell B, that c . I guess he should 'cut' the tail of his distribution right to K , and then redistribute the probabilities to the left of the K . Is that correct?
