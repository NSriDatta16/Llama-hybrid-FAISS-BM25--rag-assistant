Which Machine Learning methods would be good for a beginner-level Data Science project for described dataset?

I want to do my first beginner-level project regarding Data Science. I picked my data set which is described below. I want to make a Python script which will make some predictions on our data set using training and test data. That could be for example a prediction which countries will see rise in number of customers and which ones will see a decline, but that's just the first idea that popped in my head. I want to implement a few Machine Learning methods to do the same prediction on our data set and compare their results. Finally comes my question - which Machine Learning methods would you suggest for a beginner Data Science project with this data set which is described below? Thank you in advance for any suggestions. I don't want to pick something very hard as the beginner and I also don't want to pick a method that just doesn't "fit" my data set (because it's rather simple). EDIT: To specify this project will concern business predictions based probably on time-series. I'm looking for recommendations for which ML methods are easy to implement use and understand for the beginner. Project will be written in Python. Data Set Description: Number of Attributes : 8 Invoice : Integer StockCode : String Description: String Quantity : Integer InvoiceDate : Timestamp Price : Decimal CustomerID : Integer Country : String Number of records: 541910 Date ranges: 01/12/2010 08:26 - 09/12/2011 12:50 Price ranges: -11062.06 - 38970.00 Number of distinct Countries: 38
