How would a "non-naive" Bayesian classification work? Each record is classified as : Find all records that have exactly the same features Determine what class of those records is most common Assign the most common class to the record Problem : if there are many features, it is unlikely to find records that match exactly the same features. Solution : Naive Bayes classifiers compute therefore the probabilities of each feature occurring in a class independently.
