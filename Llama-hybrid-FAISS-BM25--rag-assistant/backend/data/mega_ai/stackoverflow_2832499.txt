FLEX, Tile container: how to better organize the children

I'm using as container for my LinkButtons. I would like to know 1) how can I remove the space between the items in my Tile container. 2) how can I set dynamic width for my items (at the moment they all have the same width regardless the width of the included component) 3) how can I avoid to display scrollbars if the items are not included in the container Thanks
