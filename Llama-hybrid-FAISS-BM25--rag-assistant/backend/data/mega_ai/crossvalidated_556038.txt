Meaning of "Stochastic Data Models"

I was reading the famous "Statistical Modelling: The Two Cultures" paper by Leo Breiman (researcher who invented the Random Forest algorithm) - and he presents the following argument: My Question: Does anyone know what is meant by "stochastic data models"? What is an example of a "stochastic data model"? If I were to make general comments, I would have guessed that "stochastic data models" are predictive models that contain a "stochastic component". I have seen the term "stochastic" often used to describe the "Markov Property", e.g. the n + 1 th value depends on some function of only the n th value - as well as "stochastic" being used to describe something "completely random" (e.g. using the R programming language, the output of the command rnorm(100,100,100) ). There are many such examples within the domain of time series (e.g. ARMA/ARIMA, GARCH, Brownian Motion). Some can even argue that standard linear regression models also contain a "stochastic component", seeing as the "error term" within regression models is considered to be "random realizations" from a probability distribution function (e.g. normal distribution). However, my guess is that Breiman is not exactly referring to what I have described above. I think he might be referring to fitting entire probability distributions to the data and calculating the conditional probability of observing a certain series of realizations from this probability distribution (provided the probability distribution fits the data well)? Can someone please comment on this? What is meant here by "stochastic data models"? Thanks!
