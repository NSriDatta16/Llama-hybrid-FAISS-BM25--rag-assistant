Usually, not very much, as long as your application is not using all the memory in the hardware. But memory leaks can stack up, and next thing you know you are out of physical RAM. You may see a sudden performance dip as virtual memory kicks in and parts of your app starting paging to the much slower flash disk storage. This is when your controller will likely get a low memory warning, and UIKit may remove some things it thinks you don't need (like views without superviews, possibly other thigns). Soon after that, the entire app will crash as the iPhone OS forces it to quit because it is using too much memory. The short version: memory leaks lead to crashes. But the removal of object it thinks you dont need may cause some odd behavior as well.
