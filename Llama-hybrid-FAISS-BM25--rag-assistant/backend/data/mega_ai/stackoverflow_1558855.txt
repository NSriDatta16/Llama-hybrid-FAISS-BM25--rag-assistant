Instanciate an injector with multiple AbstractGinModule

In google Guice, I can create an injector based on multiple module with the function createInjector . Because I use GWT.create to instanciate the injector in GoogleGin, is it possible to create a Ginjector based on multiple AbstractGinModule . If we can't, how do you organize your code to avoid having all your binding in the same Module ?
