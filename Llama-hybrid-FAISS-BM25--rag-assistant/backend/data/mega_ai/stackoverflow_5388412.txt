Create a statically typed variant in C++0x

I am wondering, if it's possible in C++0x to create a statically typed variant, (that behaves like auto) : variant v = 45; When we assign v to a value other than int, it doesn't compile: v = true; //Compile error So far I haven't found any elegant solution.
