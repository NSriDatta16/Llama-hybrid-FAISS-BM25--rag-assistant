I expect that based on the wikipedia code for a Hilbert curve you could keep track of your current position (as an (x, y) coordinate) and return that position after n cells had been visited. Then the position scaled onto [0..1] would depend on how high and wide the Hilbert curve was going to be at completion. from turtle import left, right, forward size = 10 def hilbert(level, angle): if level: right(angle) hilbert(level - 1, -angle) forward(size) left(angle) hilbert(level - 1, angle) forward(size) hilbert(level - 1, angle) left(angle) forward(size) hilbert(level - 1, -angle) right(angle) Admittedly, this would be a brute force solution rather than a closed form solution.
