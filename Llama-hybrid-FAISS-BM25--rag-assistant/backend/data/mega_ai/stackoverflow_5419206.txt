Accessify.com has a plethora of accessibility testing tools as bookmarklets (or "favelets"). One of them does what I think you are looking for. Look on that page for "Alt attributes - show all". Drag that link to your bookmarks and then use it on the page you want to test. Also, the Web Accessibilty Toolbar (available for Internet Explorer and Opera) has a "List Images" option under "Images" that will do the same thing - list images and the code associated with each. As for checking whole sites, there are free accessibility checkers available that should have a feature like this, like aDesigner .
