A function of Bernoulli variables?

Let $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ be a fixed number of Bernoulli random variables. My problem is to find a distribution for $Y$ such that for some function $f$, we have $Y=f(X_1,X_2,...,X_n)$. There are two candidate functions to use, $max$ or $avg$. I have no idea if an average function would work here or not but I think it'd give me a meaningful result. I have looked into similar problems and mostly found the cases where $X_i$ are continuous random variables. Any hint on this problem is highly appreciated. Thanks!
