StructureMap Plugins, calling init method when registered

I am exploring the possibility of using StructureMap to load all instances of my plugin type IPlugin from a specific directory using the Scan feature. When a plugin is registered with StructureMap I would like to call an Init method that would register the plugin in the database if it was the first time it had been seen. Is there a way to "foreach" through the registered IPlugins, obtain a reference and call Init on each one? I am aiming for drag and drop plugin installation. Thanks, Ian
