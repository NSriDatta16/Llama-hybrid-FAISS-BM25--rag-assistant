Tables are not for layouting. They are for displaying something as a table. The Div-layouts just give you one thing: Freedom. Freedom of organizing by CSS. A table is never as flexible as a Div-based-layout. Think of displaying a webpage on a smartphone. By giving it a new css-style you can rearrange your content whereas with tables your content will be stuck in one view. The more-effort for customzing the layouts for cross-browser-compatibility is definetly worth it.
