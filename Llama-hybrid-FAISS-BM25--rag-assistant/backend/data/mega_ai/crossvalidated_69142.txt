Thanks to @Momo, I have came to the conclusion that making use of L2 regularization to handle collinearity that likely exists among potential predictor variables and L1 regularization to allow me to select the desired number of variables to create my logistic regression models is a better approach than combining EFA and Random Forest . Thanks @Momo for the nudge over to elastic net and the documents you provided to start me on the right track!
