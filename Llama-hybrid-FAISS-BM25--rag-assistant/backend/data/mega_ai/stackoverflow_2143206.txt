Convert google search results into json in python 3.1

I am writing a Python program that feeds a search term to google using the google search API and downloads the first 10 results. I was able to do this in Python 2.6 as follows: query = urllib.parse.urlencode({'q' : 'searchterm','start' : k},doseq=false) url = 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web?v=1.0&%s' \ % (query) results = urllib.urlopen(url) resultsjson = json.loads(results.read()) betterResults += resultsjson["responseData"]["results"] Google's search API returns the results as a json, so I used the above code to download the results into a json of my and parse them into a list (betterResults). When I switched over to Python 3, my program began throwing exceptions. Apparently, in Python 2.6 the object returned by urlopen() is a file-like object that can be loaded into a json. In Python 3.1, the object returned is an HTTPResponse object, which does contain a read() method, as required by the json specifications, but is a byte object. I was therefore unable to access the information as I had in 2.6. Is there any way to access the json returned by google? How can I get the results in Python 3 and be able to select which fields I want, as I was able to do with the json? Thank you very much, bsg
