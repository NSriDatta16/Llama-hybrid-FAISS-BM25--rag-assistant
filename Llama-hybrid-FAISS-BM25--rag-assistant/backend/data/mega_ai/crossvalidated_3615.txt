Approximate Solution I explained the exact solution earlier (see below). I will now offer an approximate solution which may suit your needs better. Let: $X_i$ be the outcome of a roll of a $s$ faced dice where $i=1, ... n$. $S$ be the total of all $n$ dice. $\bar{X}$ be the sample average. By definition, we have: $\bar{X} = \frac{\sum_iX_i}{n}$ In other words, $\bar{X} = \frac{S}{n}$ The idea now is to visualize the process of observing ${X_i}$ as the outcome of throwing the same dice $n$ times instead of as outcome of throwing $n$ dice. Thus, we can invoke the central limit theorem (ignoring technicalities associated with going from discrete distribution to continuous), we have as $n \rightarrow \infty$: $\bar{X} \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$ where, $\mu = (s+1)/2$ is the mean of the roll of a single dice and $\sigma^2 = (s^2-1)/12$ is the associated variance. The above is obviously an approximation as the underlying distribution $X_i$ has discrete support. But, $S = n \bar{X}$. Thus, we have: $S \sim N(n \mu, n \sigma^2)$. Exact Solution Wikipedia has a brief explanation as how to calculate the required probabilities. I will elaborate a bit more as to why the explanation there makes sense. To the extent possible I have used similar notation to the Wikipedia article. Suppose that you have $n$ dice each with $s$ faces and you want to compute the probability that a single roll of all $n$ dice the total adds up to $k$. The approach is as follows: Define: $F_{s,n}(k)$: Probability that you get a total of $k$ on a single roll of $n$ dices with $s$ faces. By definition, we have: $F_{s,1}(k) = \frac{1}{s}$ The above states that if you just have one dice with $s$ faces the probability of obtaining a total $k$ between 1 and s is the familiar $\frac{1}{s}$. Consider the situation when you roll two dice: You can obtain a sum of $k$ as follows: The first roll is between 1 to $k-1$ and the corresponding roll for the second one is between $k-1$ to $1$. Thus, we have: $F_{s,2}(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{i=k-1}{F_{s,1}(i) F_{s,1}(k-i)}$ Now consider a roll of three dice: You can get a sum of $k$ if you roll a 1 to $k-2$ on the first dice and the sum on the remaining two dice is between $k-1$ to $2$. Thus, $F_{s,3}(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{i=k-2}{F_{s,1}(i) F_{s,2}(k-i)}$ Continuing the above logic, we get the recursion equation: $F_{s,n}(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{i=k-n+1}{F_{s,1}(i) F_{s,n-1}(k-i)}$ See the Wikipedia link for more details.
