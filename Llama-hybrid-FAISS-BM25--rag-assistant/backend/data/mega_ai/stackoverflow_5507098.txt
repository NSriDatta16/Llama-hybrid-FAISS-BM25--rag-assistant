Controlling JTree expansion delay on drag & drop

Our system currently allows users to drag & drop on a JTree. When the user hovers over a node in the tree we have written code to expand the tree node. However, the speed of java and modern computers being what they are the nodes tend to expand extremely fast. If a user drags over many nodes in the tree very quickly all the nodes expand. What we need is some delay before the tree node expansion occurs, maybe a second or two. To complicate matters if the user does not stay hovered over a node for the allotted delay the node should not expand. What would be the best way of implementing this behavior.
