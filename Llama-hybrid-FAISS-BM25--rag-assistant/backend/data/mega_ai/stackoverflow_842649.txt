const and static really do mean different things, different storage mechanism, different initialisation. static is read/write, therefore must have memory allocated for storage and must be initialised at runtime. A static can be initialised with a literal value or an expression. In contrast, a const is immutable and must be initialised with a compile time constant (typically a literal value, or an expression that can be fully evaluated at compile time). The value is known at compile time so it can be embedded directly in the generated code, therefore requires no storage to be allocated at runtime.
