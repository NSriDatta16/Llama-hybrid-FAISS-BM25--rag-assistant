A very simple way is to standardize the value based on a moving average. For example, calculate the average avg number of "listens" in the past 6 months for every podcast, i.e depending on the date of the podcast. Then replace the raw number of listens with the relative rate compared to avg , i.e. rate = (listens - avg) / avg . Example: An old podcast which had 80 listens when the average was 70 is represented as a positive score: {90-70)/70=0.28 A recent one which has 150 listens when the average is 200 is represented as a negative score: (150-200)/200=-0.25 Of course you can adjust the calculation of the moving average depending on what makes sense for your data. In case the podcasts are not very regular, you could use the last N podcasts instead of the last N months.
