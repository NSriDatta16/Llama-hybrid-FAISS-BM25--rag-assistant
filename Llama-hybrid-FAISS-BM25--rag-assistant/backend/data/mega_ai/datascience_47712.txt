Scaling neural networks

While using Neural Networks (TensorFlow: Deep Neural Regressor), when increasing your training data size from a sample to the whole data (say a 10x larger dataset), what changes should you make to the model architecture (deeper/wider), learning rate and hyper parameters in general? How much of trial and error how much of heuristic logic is involved in making these changes?
