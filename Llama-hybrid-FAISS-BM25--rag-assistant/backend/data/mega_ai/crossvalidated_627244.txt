Detecting and Forecasting Intermittent Time Series

I am building a model to forecast some metrics. Those metrics are quite seasonal giving me good forecasts as shown below: However, some new requirements dictate that I target those forecasts per groups. Those group can be per country, per company, etc. As you guessed, not all subgroups are able to be forecasted. Some look like the follow: How can I identify those cases (I know there are tests, autocorrelation coefficient, etc) and most importantly how can I handle them? For my usecase I am only interested to check the actual values against the limits (so anomaly detection). If there are cases that modeling makes no sense, it is ok to say 'This subgroup cannot be modeled'
