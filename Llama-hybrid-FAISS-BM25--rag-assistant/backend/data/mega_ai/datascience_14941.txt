After the training phase, is it better to run neural networks on a GPU or CPU?

My understanding is that GPUs are more efficient for running neural nets, but someone recently suggested to me that GPUs are only needed for the training phase. Once trained, it's actually more efficient to run them on CPUs. Is this true?
