Gutenberg-Richter Recurrence Law: why is rate defined as probability of being exceeded?

According to Kramer (1996): Guttenberg and Richter gathered data for Southern California earthquakes over a period of many years and organized data according to the number of earthquakes that exceeded different magnitudes during that time of period. Then, t hey divided the number of exceedances of each magnitude by the length of time period to define a mean annual rate of exceedance, $\lambda_m$ of an earthquake of magnitude m. When the logarithm of the mean annual rate was plotted against earthquake magnitude, a linear relationship was observed $log \lambda_m =a-bm$ The equation may also be expressed as $\lambda_m = e^{\alpha - \beta m}$ where $\alpha=2.303a$ and $\beta=2.303b$ . It implies that earthquake magnitudes are exponentially distributed. Refference: Kramer, S. L. (1996). Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering. Chapter 4 Page 121-123 Question: The right hand side of the last equation can be expressed as $e^{\alpha - \beta m}=e^{-\beta(m-\alpha/\beta)}$ So I guess the right hand side is actually the exceedance probability of exponential distribution $X$ , where $X=m-\alpha/\beta$ . But I'm a bit confused with the left hand side, since $\lambda$ is rate (not a probability) . Anything I missed?
