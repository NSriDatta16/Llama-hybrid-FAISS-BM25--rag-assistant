You can't sell an old methodology, because too many projects failed and too many people know the old methodology anyway. There has to be a new one to market. If you're doing fine with the old way then use what works. Do pay attention to new stuff, as some really nice ideas come along. But that doesn't mean everything old is bad and stupid. Usually you can incorporate new ideas into the old models to a large degree. There does come a time to make a move. Like I wouldn't do OOP with structures and function pointers. ;-)
