Logistic sample and case numbers

I have some questions about binary logistic regression. For my research, I am planning to use 12 predictors, and my sample consists of 129 cases. However, I know of a 1 to 10 rule. Additionally, my DV is divided into 2 groups (it is a binary variable). It has an unbalanced distribution, and one group has less than 30 cases ( A group: 104; B group: 25). In this situation, can I run logistic regression?
