Yes, that is indeed a good idea. I have used it in my own code to update UI elements when the streaming data changes. Only thing you need to be careful of is that, the watchers are called synchronously in the agent 's thread or the main thread if atom , ref or var . So to avoid blocking the thread, don't do too much processing in the watchers. If you need to do so then create a future .
