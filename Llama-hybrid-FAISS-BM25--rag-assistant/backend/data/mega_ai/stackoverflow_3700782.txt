First of all you should not have private static string _xmlFileUrl; it should be private string _xmlFileUrl; This static variable will be lost on IISRESET - won't work in a farm and has the potential to cause all sort of 'thread safe' issues if used multi-threaded environment (like a web server) so only use them if they are really needed . When SharePoint loads a web part (or after you click Save/Apply in the toolpart) it uses reflection to find your properties (the [Browsable... attribute) and then serialization to load/save the value of the property to the database. One of these two is failing. I would suspect that is some problem with the attribute - try this one and work backwards until it stops working ;) [Browsable(true), Category("Miscellaneous"), DefaultValue(defaultText), WebPartStorage(Storage.Personal), FriendlyName("Text"), Description("Text Property")]
