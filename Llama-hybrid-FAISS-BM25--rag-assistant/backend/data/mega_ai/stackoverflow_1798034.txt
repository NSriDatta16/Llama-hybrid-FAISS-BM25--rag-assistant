Nitrogen has a very slick Comet feature built-in. It will work with the three most popular Erlang web servers, including the one you're already considering, YAWS. Nitrogen doesn't do anything in particular about data storage. It's not one of those web frameworks that insists on managing the DB for you. You're free to use Mnesia or whatever else you like. If this bothers you, you might consider Erlyweb instead. It doesn't do Comet for you like Nitrogen does, but it's more of the manage-everything-for-me sort of web framework.
