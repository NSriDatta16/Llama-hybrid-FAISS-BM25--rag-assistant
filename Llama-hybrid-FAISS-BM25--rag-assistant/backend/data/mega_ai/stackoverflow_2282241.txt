You touch two topics, one is described as "Cloaking", the other as "Duplicate Content". With "cloaking", you present different (optimized-with-bad-intention) content based upon identification of the client that accesses it, e.g. by inspecting the User-agent header (google-bot versus Browser). You are not doing this, you just want to present content in a way that suits your client best, like a redirect on a page optimized for mobile clients ("m.example.com"). The other thing is how to avoid duplicate content. There's a way by indicating the original content source with a canonical tag, see here: http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html
