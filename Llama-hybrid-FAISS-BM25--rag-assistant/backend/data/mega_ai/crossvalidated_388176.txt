In your example, you have less than three observations per month, i.e. you only have one value for January, one for February, etc. In a case with less than three per month, you cannot perform established seasonal adjustment methods such as X-13ARIMA-SEATS by the US Census Bureau. In order to apply X-13ARIMA-SEATS you need at least three observations per month, i.e. you need a time series that is at least three years long. In case you do not have three years of data, you could do year over year comparison. In your case, you should have more than three years of data by now. Hence, you could perform X-13ARIMA-SEATS. The following site introduces seasonal adjustment: https://economictheoryblog.com/2017/05/02/seasonal-adjustment Furthermore, and relevant for your case, I guess, the site provides a hands-on example of how to perform seasonal adjustment in R: https://economictheoryblog.com/2017/05/16/seasonal-adjustment-in-r
