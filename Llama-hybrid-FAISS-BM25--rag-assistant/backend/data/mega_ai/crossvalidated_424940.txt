How to test accuracy manually

I am programing a neural network from scratch in C++ (purely for fun). My dataset is cut in 3 : 1 train, 1 validation for early stopping and 1 test to measure model accuracy. I measure accuracy output by output by checking if the obtained result is between a relative range around the expected output. Is that the right way to do ? If the expected value is 0, then the range between 0 is always 0. I dont want to use absolute range because it is scale dependant. How could i do ? Thanks.
