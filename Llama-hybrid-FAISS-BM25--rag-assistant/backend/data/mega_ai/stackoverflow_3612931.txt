The question is a little vague, but I'll try anyways: Technically, daemons are just processes like any other. They usually, but are not required to, have misc file descriptors closed and other behavior suited for processes that live a long time. For a high level look at how most daemon processes are set up (in Python), check out: http://www.noah.org/wiki/Daemonize_Python So the differences really come down to lifecycle and users. Daemon processes live for long periods of time, usually as long as a given runlevel. They also usually provide services to other system-wide processes, or processes higher up than the average user run process..
