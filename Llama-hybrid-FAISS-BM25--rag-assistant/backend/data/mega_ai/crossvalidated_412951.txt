Does it make sense to select SARIMAX parameters independently of covariates?

I have a vector of time series observations $y$ and a matrix of covariates $X$ . I want to choose the best (in the sense of minimizing loss function, e.g. RMSE) $SARIMAX(p,d,q)Ã—(P,D,Q)_{s}$ model specification by performing both grid search on parameters and exhaustive feature selection on covariates. However, it is very computationally costly to do simultaneously (i.e. going through every possible covariates combination and performing grid search for parameters for each). Question is: does it make sense to first choose $SARIMAX$ parameters and then perform feature selection on covariates? Can one miss the best (in a sense described earlier) model by a large margin this way?
