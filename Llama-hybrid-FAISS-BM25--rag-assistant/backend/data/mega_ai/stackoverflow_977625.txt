.NET - ClickOnce Install - Company Name and Application Name

What is the proper way to set the Company Name and Application Name in a ClickOnce application? I have a set of projects in a solution called RecordNavigator. The GUI project is called RecordNavigator.Gui. When I publish the application - I want the Start menu to have a folder called Tyndall Software and the application shortcut to be called Record Navigator . Right now the folder says Organization and the shortcut says RecordNavigator.Gui . The AssemblyInfo.cs file seems to have no effect. Is that normal?
