OOP, MVC - Models and Objects

I'm building a site with CodeIgniter, and my I have a model called Blog_model . Within Blog_model , there are methods to pull a list of posts for a specific topic, for example, getPopularPosts() . getPopularPosts() queries the posts table for a list of posts with a topic_id matching the one specified and sorts them by popularity. So, that's one query against the entire table of posts (let's assume this will be very large eventually) to find all posts with topic_id x . Then, foreach result as an individual post id, it creates a new Post object. The Post class constructs a post by setting the field id . To return the contents of a Post , I assign $post->getPost(); , which queries the posts table again to return the entire row for the given id . This organization (AFAIK) follows a nice object oriented principle. But now, for every posts (again, let's assume thousands, millions, whatever...), I have to first query for a list of id s and then again to get each post's content. If I'm returning 30 posts, that means 31 separate queries. Alternatively, I could break the object oriented pattern and pull * for each post in posts where topic_id = x . Then, I have one query that returns all 30 posts, but now I don't feel so object oriented. What to do?
