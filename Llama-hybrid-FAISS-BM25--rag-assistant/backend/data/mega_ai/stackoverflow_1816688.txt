Your assumption is false. The dragstart event will only fire once. Exactly when the user first starts the dragging. It doesn't matter if he stops the dragging motion for a few seconds and then restarts moving the mouse. As long as he doesn't drop the draggable and then click a draggable the event won't fire again. The event which gets fired while the user drags the draggable around is the drag event. This fires when the mouse is moved while dragging.
