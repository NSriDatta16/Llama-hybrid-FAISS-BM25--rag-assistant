How to debug RESTful services?

I'm looking for an easy way to debug RESTful services. For example, most webapps can be debugged using your average web browser. Unfortunately that same browser won't allow me to test HTTP PUT, DELETE, and to a certain degree even HTTP POST. I am not looking to automate tests. I'd like to run new services through a quick sanity check, ideally without having to writing my own client.
