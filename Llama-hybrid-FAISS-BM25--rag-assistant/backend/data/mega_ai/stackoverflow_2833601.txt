Easy way to use Images in WPF

I've only just started using WPF. (I'm a WinForms guy), and from what I can see, trying to simply drag an image onto the Window is a huge PAIN. There seems to be no way where you can just select an option to tell it what picture to put indide the image control. I've seen so many sites within the last 10 minutes with atleast 10lines of code just to insert animage into a window. Is there an easier way?
