Pre.intervention and post.intervention should be contiguous in CausalImpact?

I am running a CausalImpact analysis on a time series and my pre.period goes from 01.01.15 to 30.03.15. I want my post period to be from 15.04.15 to 17.04.15. Is it ok if I create a time series that ignore the gap and just goes from 01.01.05 to 30.03.15 + from 15.04.15 to 17.04.15 (for a total of 3 months and 3 days)? I am afraid I might obtain wrong results if CausalImpact take the data as continuous while in reality there is a gap of 15 days between them.
