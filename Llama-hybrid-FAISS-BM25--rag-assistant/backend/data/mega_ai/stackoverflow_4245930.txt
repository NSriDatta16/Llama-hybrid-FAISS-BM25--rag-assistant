Moving the back ground screen as well as maintaning the tragetory path of a ball in Iphone Game apps

I have game application (cocos2d) in which, a ball is to be shooted from a cannon, this ball travels through a trajectory path and land on a building. Now the problem is that according to the requirement I have to increase the size of the background image due to which my building image is not visible on first view and with the ball traveling i have to drag the background image with out disturbing the trajectory path of the ball. Can some one help me out in this regards. To clarify question bit more I am also attaching a image. Thanks in advance.
