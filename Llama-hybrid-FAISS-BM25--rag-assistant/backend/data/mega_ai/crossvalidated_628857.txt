Weight-of-Evidence Functions (Woe.binning vs. Woebin) as Workaround for Non-Linearity Log-Odds in Logistic Regression?

I have seen weight-of-evidence cited as a way to address non-linearity in LR models. Has anyone seen/heard of the same? The function I am particularly using is woe.binning in R for this. The linearity log-odds is failing, so I am using woe.binning (R function) for it. But, I am unclear whether "woebin" from library scorecard would be more appropriate? The logic behind both of these packages is still a bit unclear (I know conceptually what they are doing, but in terms of manually replicating it or explaining the logic, not sure). woe.binning --> https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/woeBinning/woeBinning.pdf Woebin --> https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/scorecard/html/woebin.html
