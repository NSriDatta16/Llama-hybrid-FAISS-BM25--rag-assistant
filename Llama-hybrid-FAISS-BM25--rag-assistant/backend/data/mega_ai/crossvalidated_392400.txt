Recover $\rho$ of $\nu$-SVM from e1071 package in R

Given a dataset $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ , the primal problem for $\nu$ -SVM is: \begin{align} &\min_{w,b,\xi,\rho} && \frac{1}{2}w^\top w-\nu\rho+\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\xi_i\\ &\text{subject to} && y_i(w^\top x_i+b)\geq\rho-\xi_i,\\ & && \xi_i\geq0, \rho\geq0. \end{align} I need the value of $\rho$ for a computational problem that I am working on. Method for computing $\rho$ from the dual solution $\alpha$ can be found in sec. 4.2 of the LIBSVM paper . Similar ways can also be found in, for example, sec. 7.4 of this tutorial , or sec. 7 of the original paper by Sch√∂lkopf et al. However, using them requires the unscaled version of $\alpha$ , but LIBSVM (thus e1071 ) returns $\alpha/\rho$ directly instead (see sec. 2.2 of the LIBSVM paper). Is there a way to bypass this issue?
