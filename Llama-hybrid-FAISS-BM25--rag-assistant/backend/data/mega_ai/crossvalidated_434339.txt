Confidence interval on mean of mixture distribution with normal components

I have 50 sacks, each containing material from one of 10 varieties of hemp. Each sack has a different weight. I don't know what variety is in each sack, or how much material I have of each variety. Each variety has a different, unknown, average potency (how much CBD is in it, expressed as a percentage), which I assume to be normally distributed. I would like to collect samples (by which I mean a small amount of material) from these sacks, submit them to a lab for potency testing, and then compute a confidence interval on the overall potency of all of the material in the sacks. I can collect any number of samples from each sack, but each test costs $50. How do I compute this confidence interval? Would bootstrapping be reasonable given all of the unknowns (not saying I know how to do this)? Please note it has been several years since I've taken a statistics class, so simple explanations are appreciated. I would also appreciate any suggestions on the title and keywords. Thank you!
