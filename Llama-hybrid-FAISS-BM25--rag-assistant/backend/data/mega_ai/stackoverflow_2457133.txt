I tend to go with whatever makes sense for the organisation of the code, not tab completion - this can vary depending on the code in question, so it's hard to give a direct answer, but use of proper sub-directories does make life easier. I agree with Don. Instead, I navigate sources using tools like find . -name {expr} (file names), grep -r {expr} * (function defs, protos and usage) and combinations thereof. It's possible to write shell scripts to effectively do find/replace operations using sed i 's/find/replace' across your entire source tree. I have a little folder in my ~/ on the path that provides a few useful scripts like this. I combine this with IDEs like Eclipse for editing, or VIM, depending on what I'm doing. I like both equally, really, as I use both for different purposes. Regarding Emacs, I've tried it, I don't like it. It's far too big and complicated and I've got better things to do than learn how to use it (ok let's stop there before we start a "real programmers use..." discussion). So I can't comment on the Emacs tool you've linked to. I guess try it and see if it helps.
