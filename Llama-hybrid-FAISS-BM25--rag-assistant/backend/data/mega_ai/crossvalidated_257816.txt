Creating a variable from multiple survey responses

I am currently working with survey data, and there are multiple questions in the survey that act as a measure of poverty. One question asks how often the individual has had electricity in their residence, another is how much running water and there are about 5 other such questions, each measured on a scale 1 to 5 where 1 is rarely and 5 is all the time. I want to create a dummy variable variable for living condition using those questions. How do I go about it? Does it make sense to just average them out for each observation or is there a more robust way. Another option might just be to run each of them separately, but I just wanted some opinions.
