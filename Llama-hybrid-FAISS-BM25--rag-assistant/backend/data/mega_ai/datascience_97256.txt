Difference between ethics and bias in Machine Learning

I'm confused about the difference between "ethics" and "bias" when those concepts are discussed in the context of Machine Learning (ML). In my understanding, ethical issue in ML is pretty much exactly the same thing as "bias": say, the model discriminates people of color and this is the same as to say that the model is biased. In short, " ethics is always a bias, but it is not necessarily true that a bias is always an ethical issue ". Is this true?
