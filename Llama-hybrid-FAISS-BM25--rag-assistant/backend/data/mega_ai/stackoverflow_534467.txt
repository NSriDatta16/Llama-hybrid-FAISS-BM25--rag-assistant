WinForms: Design vs Code

I am a solo dev building a WinForm App, C# & .Net 3.5, in VS2008. It is, essentially, a glorified data entry and retrieval application. My question is, Is it normal to spend %60 + of my time on "design"? The UI, placing all the controls, naming the controls something intuitive, setting properties on the UI controls(Modifier, onFocused color, etc). It seems that for every 30 minutes I spend writing code I srend twice that messing around with the UI. What am I doing wrong? I realize that is an impossible question to answer so I'll settle for some general pointers. Is there a way to have certain property settings be set by default for all UI Controls? Is there a faster way of editing the existing ones then clicking and editing? Is this really a product of my lack of planning? Is the solution to have planned and written all this down so that I got it right the first time? It is really very frustrating as I love the coding aspect but I feel I spend more time making sure my Font is readable(I have a semi-elderly user base)! EDIT to further elaborate based on feedback! The app I am making is a winform port of a webform, ASP.Net app. Fully functional and in use. I am not allowed to change the Database layer at this point but because of the nature of WinForm vs WebForm the UI has under gone major changes. I am leaving the DAL & BLL for the end so I can first see how much of them I can reuse. I know that this probably isn't normal but seemed to make the most sense in this scenario. Does that make my question more clear?
