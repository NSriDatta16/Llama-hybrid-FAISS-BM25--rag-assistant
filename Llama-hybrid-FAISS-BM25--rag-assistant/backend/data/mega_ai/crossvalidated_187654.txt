Convolution is a function-valued operation on two functions $f$ and $g$: $\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(\tau )g(t-\tau )d\tau$. Often used for obtaining the density of a sum of independent random variables. This tag should also be used for the inverse operation of deconvolution. DO NOT use this tag for convolutional neural networks.
