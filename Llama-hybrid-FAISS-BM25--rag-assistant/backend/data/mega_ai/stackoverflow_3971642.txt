How can I compile a Lazarus Apache module to Apache 1.3, 2.0 and 2.2 selectively?

I've had a look at /etc/fpc.cfg and there is mention to some defines: FPCAPACHE_1_3 FPCAPACHE_2_0 Then in the fcl-web examples there is mention to: Apache1_3 The only one I've found is on the apr.pas on both these files: /usr/share/fpcsrc/2.4.0/packages/httpd20/src/apr/apr.pas /usr/share/fpcsrc/2.4.0/packages/httpd22/src/apr/apr.pas So how does the compiler decide what version of APR to compile?
