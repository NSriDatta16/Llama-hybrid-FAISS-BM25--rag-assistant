Integrate facebook users on Plone

I'm creating a Plone site which will allow users to register with Facebook but I need more than just like boxes and feed forms. I already have collective.simplesocial[1]. Logged users are expected to have some more data than the Plone default (i.e. height, weight, average workout...) and the data that one can get from Facebook. So the question is: how can I register users that some data comes from Facebook? Facebook connect is quite handy since whenever the user is logged on Facebook, it will also be logged on my site. Maybe a Plone PAS plugin? Or just prefilling the register form (though then the user will not be auto-logged with Facebook connect?). Any help will be appreciated!
