Intraclass correlation and aggregation

Imagine that: You have a sample of 1000 teams each with 10 members. You measured team functioning by asking each team member how well they think their team is functioning using a reliable multi-item numeric scale. You want to describe the extent to which the measure of team effectiveness is a property of the team member's idiosyncratic belief or a property of a shared belief about the team. In this and related situations (e.g., aggregating to organisations), many researchers report the intraclass correlation (e.g., Table 1 in Campion & Medsker, 1993 ). Thus, my questions are: What descriptive labels would you attach to different values of the intra-class correlation? I.e., the aim is to actually relate the values of the intra-class correlation to qualitative language such as: "When the intraclass correlation is greater than x, it suggests that the attitudes are modestly/moderately/strongly shared across team members." Do you think the intraclass correlation is the appropriate statistic or would you use a different strategy?
