Embedding a facebook like button on a facebook fanpage tab

I've been trying to find out how on earth to add some kind like button on a facebook fan page. I know there are ways of doing this. This page for instance has implemented one kind of like button: http://www.facebook.com/JimBeam?v=app_100742133310820 I know both of these pages use applications and not the static FBML page that you usually use. So I created an application where it works beautifully. On this application, the like button works. However when I try to add it to a tab on a facebook page I get an error saying: "HTML error while rendering tag "iframe": iframes forbidden by flavor TabFBM" So apparently iframes aren't allowed to render. But obviously there are ways around this so do you have any clue on how they did it on the other pages? I'd really appreciate an answer, and I'm especially curious whether if someone could figure out how they restyled the like button on Jim Beam's page.
