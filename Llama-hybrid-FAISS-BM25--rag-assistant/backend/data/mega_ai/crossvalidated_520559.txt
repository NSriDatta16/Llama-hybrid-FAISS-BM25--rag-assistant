Brief answers to some of your questions: The ARMA model is estimated in one go (not split between MA and AR) e.g. using its state space representation and Kalman filtering. $\epsilon_i$ are not always Gaussian. Their distribution depends on the assumption on standardized innovations in the GARCH conditional variance equation. $\mu$ is the constant and it can be either zero (a restricted version) or not zero (a nonrestricted version). No, the distribution is as mentioned in 1. It is advisable to estimate ARMA-GARCH simultaneously. There are multiple threads on Cross Validated that discuss this. However, you can estimate ARMA first and GARCH second. Least squares will however not help you. The standard way of estimating the GARCH model is by maximum likelihood. Repetition is not needed if you estimate ARMA-GARCH simultaneously. Repetition is usually not done even if you estimate the two parts of the model separately. This is really a different question. See some related threads on Cross Validated or open a time series textbook; you will definitely find a discussion there.
