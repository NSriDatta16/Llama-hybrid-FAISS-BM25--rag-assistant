Regression analysis with non-integer event rates

I am working as part of a team on a large dataset which has been subject to imputation analysis. One of my colleagues has pointed out that the when carrying out regressions that can provide odds ratio/event ratios etc, we first need to have the event rates from each variable in integer form. However, because of the imputation analysis we have been left with non-integer data for many variables. For example, our imputed data shows that 72.1/401 of our participants were in a relationship. My questions are as follows: Is it indeed the case that event rate/frequencies need to be in integer form before regression analysis can be run? If this is the case, can we (either manually or through the use of an SPSS function) adjust the data to correct this issue? I am aware that there is a function for doing as part of the imputation analysis, however re-running the imputation analysis is something we would like to avoid.Also, in case it’s relevant, it’s primarily logistic regressions that we will be running, though we may also use linear regression as well. Finally, I’d just like to point out that I’m not particularly comfortable imputing categorical variables such as the one mentioned above, but this was a decision made by others in my team.
