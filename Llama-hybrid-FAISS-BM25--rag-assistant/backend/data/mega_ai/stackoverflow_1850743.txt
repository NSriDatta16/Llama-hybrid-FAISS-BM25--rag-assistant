I think they are fairly evenly matched in features. I prefer Python, but I have been using it for over a decade so I freely admit that what follows is totally biased. IMHO Python is more mature - there are more libraries for it (although Ruby may be catching up), and the included libraries I think are better designed. The language evolution process is more mature too, with each proposed feature discussed in public via the PEPs before the decision is made to include them in a release. I get the impression that development of the Ruby language is much more ad-hoc. Python is widely used in a lot of areas apart from web development - scientific computing, CGI rendering pipelines, distributed computing, Linux GUI tools etc. Ruby got very little attention before Rails came along, so I get the impression that most Ruby work is focused on web development. That may not be a problem if that is all you want to do with the language, but it does mean that Python has a more diverse user base and a more diverse set of libraries. Python is faster too.
