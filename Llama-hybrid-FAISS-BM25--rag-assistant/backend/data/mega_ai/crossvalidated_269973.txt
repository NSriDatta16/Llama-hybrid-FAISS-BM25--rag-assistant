Checking closeness of a mixture weibull and a mixture normal distribution to sample data

I have a sample data whose histogram shows a two peak distribution. So I generated two distributions which is the Mixture (average) of two (1) two weibull distributions (2) two normal distributions I would like to check which of the two distributions is closer to my sample data. Is the anderson-darling test sufficient enough?
