Logistic regression with BIC: what is my sample size?

I'd like to compare logistic regression models using the BIC. I have 600 data points, but only 30 of these belong to the class of interest. To calculate the BIC I need to know my sample size, $N$. In my case, is my sample size 600 or 30? Should the BIC calculation use the total size of my dataset (600), or just the number of positive samples (30)?
