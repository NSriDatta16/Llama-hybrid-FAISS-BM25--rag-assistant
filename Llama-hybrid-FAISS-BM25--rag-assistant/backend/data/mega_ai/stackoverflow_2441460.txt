I also ran across these, they might be helpful, though I'm not sure about the "make space for dragged item" behavior. http://code.google.com/p/gong-wpf-dragdrop/ which was originally on codeplex, here's part 1: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/gong-wpf-dragdrop.aspx part 2: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/gong-wpf-dragdrop-ii.aspx I would like to know as well. (I'm looking to duplicate the behavior of tabs in chrome or safari). In searching for answers online I ran across your post.
