Unless your current data layer is broken for some reason, don't just start implementing a new one, just because you can. Although if currently the datalayer consists of using stored procedures and that becomes cumbersome to maintain, switching to L2S (or any other OR/M for that matter) might be a valid reason. Just don't think it'll be only a matter of dragging some columns to a canvas and be done. Dependent if there's any logic in the sprocs, the logic has to exist somewhere... I'd say until you can justify the costs of switching your datalayer entirly, stick with your current implementation.
