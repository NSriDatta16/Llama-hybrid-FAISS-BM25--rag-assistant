Binary input variables for a Keras Neural Network

I have a set of forty predictors each of which are binary. I’m using elastic net logistic regression in addition to a random forest Is there any reason why you could not use binary inputs for a Keras neural network? I can’t find anything in the documentation that indicates that this is not an option.
