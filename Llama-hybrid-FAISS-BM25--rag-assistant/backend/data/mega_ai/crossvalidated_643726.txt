method comparison/agreement - is Bland-Altman or equivalence of the mean best

I am interested in the appropriate technique for assessing the agreement of the paired values of measurements made by 2 measuring devices, an equivalence test of the mean of the difference in the pairs or a Bland Altman analysis looking at if limits of agreement (ie the sample mean of the paired differences +/- 1.96 SD) lie within certain equivalence bounds so 95% of differences re acceptable. I would have thought equivalence of the mean, eg using CIs of the differences in pairs, was less appropriate as the measuring devices might well measure the same on average but one measures low when the other measures high and vice versa so they don't agree at all. I agree this is an extreme example but even so we can have poor agreement of the paired values but overall equal means. In such a case the SD of the differences would be high but with a big enough sample size equivalence of means can be shown. Yet I have seen equivalence of the mean suggested eg by cross-validated and chatgpt
