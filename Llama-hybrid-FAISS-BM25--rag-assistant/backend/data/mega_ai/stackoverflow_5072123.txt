Although this answer is not answering the OP's question per se , I figure others looking for Objective-C listings related information will stumble across this question. Below is a listings \lstdefinelanguage for Objective-C 2.0, GNU99, and ANSI C99. While listings includes definitions for both C and Objective-C, the definitions are for the older C89 standard and Objective-C 1.0. The version below adds C99, adds GNU99 to C99, and then adds Objective-C (2.0) to GNU99. You're probably only go to see a difference if you use a font style for keywords that's different than the "normal" font style. I am the author of the code below (except for the ANSI C99 definition, which was derived from the listings ANSI C and modified for ANSI C99). You may use it any way you wish, including incorporating it in to other works, without attribution or compensation. I hereby place it in the public domain. ( Note: this is mostly for those who work for employers who are really picky about such things, I really don't care. ) \lstdefinelanguage[Objective]{C}[GNU99]{C} {morekeywords={@catch,@class,@encode,@end,@finally,@implementation,% @interface,@private,@protected,@protocol,@public,@selector,% @synchronized,@throw,@try,BOOL,Class,IMP,NO,Nil,SEL,YES,_cmd,% bycopy,byref,id,in,inout,nil,oneway,out,self,super,% % The next two lines are Objective-C 2 keywords. @dynamic,@package,@property,@synthesize,readwrite,readonly,% assign,retain,copy,nonatomic% },% moredirectives={import}% }% \lstdefinelanguage[GNU99]{C}[99]{C} {morekeywords={asm,__asm__,__extension__,typeof,__typeof__}% }% \lstdefinelanguage[99]{C}% {morekeywords={_Bool,_Complex,_Imaginary,auto,break,case,char,% const,continue,default,do,double,else,enum,extern,float,for,% goto,if,inline,int,long,register,restrict,return,short,signed,% sizeof,static,struct,switch,typedef,union,unsigned,void,volatile,% while},% sensitive,% morecomment=[s]{/*}{*/},% morecomment=[l]//,% morestring=[b]",% morestring=[b]',% moredelim=*[directive]\#,% moredirectives={define,elif,else,endif,error,if,ifdef,ifndef,line,% include,pragma,undef,warning}% }[keywords,comments,strings,directives]%
