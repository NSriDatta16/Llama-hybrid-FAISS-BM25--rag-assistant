Is it possible to get the declaration name of an object at runtime in java?

Lets say i have a a button somewhere in the code: "JButton closeButton". I dont know that it's called "closeButton" but that's what i want to find out. At runtime, that button gets clicked and once it does i can find out a lot about it through reflection and the AWT api - BUT what i can't do is find out where it is - how it's called in the code, what name is it declared as ("closeButton"). Is it possible to find this out from the JVM? Is there a way to compile and run the code in such a way that the names for the instances get preserved at runtime? Is there perhaps some type of 'javaagent' out there (free if possible) that can help me out in this situation? Thanks EDIT (14:23 EDT): I am using a button as an example but it could be any type of component that can hold a value and have ActionListeners attached to it. I can obtain every bit of information via reflection about that component but i cant find it in the code. Even if there are 10 components that have been declared with the same name, that still gives me a lead, i can eliminate possibilities.
