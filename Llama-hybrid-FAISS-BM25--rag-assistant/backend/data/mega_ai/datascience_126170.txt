Current object detection architectures like Faster-RCNN and YOLO seem to be overcomplicated in comparsion with segmentation architectures like Unet. So, why can't we just draw some rectangles around the instances on the segmentation mask (which can be done easily using opencv or skimage)? Such an appro
