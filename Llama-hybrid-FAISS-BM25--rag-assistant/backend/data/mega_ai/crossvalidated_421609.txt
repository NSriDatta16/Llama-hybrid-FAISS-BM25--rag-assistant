Bayesian repeated updates, likelihood functions with different nature

Let's say we have a prior probability of some diseases 'D'. Then we have some data and likelihood function of symptoms (S) P(S|D) and we update priors. Then we have age (A) likelihood function P(A|D) an make one more update again. My questions is is it ok to make such updates with likelihood functions of different nature? And should I worry about something if I do it this way?
