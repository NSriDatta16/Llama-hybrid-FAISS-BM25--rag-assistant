You can set all widgets resizable and draggable using JQueryUI: $('#widget1').resizable(); $('#widget1').draggable(); // .... $('#widgetN').resizable(); $('#widgetN').draggable(); You need to study both plugins and adapt them for your own purposes. To limit multiple access for widgets, you can just hide them. Without more information and a little source code, we can't help you. Please, post more information.
