Transfer functions in R (TSA package)

In Time Series models’ transfer functions there is a decay parameter in the formula (let’s call it b). In TSA package that decay parameter is not mentioned. When I used other software before (such as SAS) I used to determine b after analyzing ‘prewhitened series’. But in TSA package in R there is no need to specify the decay parameter once you analyze CCF? If not how am I going to know when the decay starts? I understand CCF is used after prewhitening to determine how to filter the outputs but where b comes into the picture?
