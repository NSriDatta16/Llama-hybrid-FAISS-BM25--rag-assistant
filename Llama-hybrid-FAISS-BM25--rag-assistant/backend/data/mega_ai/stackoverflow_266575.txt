Where do I store sensitive encrypted password in an SQL Server agent job?

I prefer to keep our SSIS packages in a solution on the server, not in sql. By default, sensitive data is encrypted with a user key. Since the sql server agent uses a service account to run jobs, we have to change this encryption method to something else. I like encrypting with a password. The problem is whenever I setup a job in a step there is no place to input this password. When I click on the configurations tab, I get a popup dialog for the password. That keeps it stored properly, but is this really the right place to put it. It seems really unusual, and I keep running into issues where it seems to reset itself if I make certain changes. Does anyone know of a better place to input this password that is more stable? Thanks,
