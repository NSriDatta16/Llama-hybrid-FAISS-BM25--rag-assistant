Attach ScrollViewer To FrameworkElement?

Is it possible, using an Adorner or other means, to dynamically take a UIElement/FrameworkElement and place it within a dynamically created ScrollViwer ? I know that the obvious problem will be that you have to detach the element from it's parent element first, but I am looking for an elegant way of doing this.
