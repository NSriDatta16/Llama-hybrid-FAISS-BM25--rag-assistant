how do you push only some of your local git commits?

Suppose I have 5 local commits. I want to push only 2 of them to a centralized repo (using an SVN-style workflow). How do I do this? This did not work: git checkout HEAD~3 #set head to three commits ago git push #attempt push from that head That ends up pushing all 5 local commits. I suppose I could do git reset to actually undo my commits, followed by git stash and then git push -- but I've already got commit messages written and files organized and I don't want to redo them. My feeling is that some flag passed to push or reset would work. If it helps, here's my git config [ramanujan:~/myrepo/.git]$cat config [core] repositoryformatversion = 0 filemode = true bare = false logallrefupdates = true [remote "origin"] url = ssh://server/git/myrepo.git fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* [branch "master"] remote = origin merge = refs/heads/master
