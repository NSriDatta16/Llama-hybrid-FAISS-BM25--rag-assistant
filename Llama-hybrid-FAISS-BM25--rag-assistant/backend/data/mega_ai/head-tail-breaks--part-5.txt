ransport transfer areas. Head/tail breaks are applied to separate the less dense stops where few people exit, from the major stops where the most people exit. Determining traffic hotspots or congestion zones, which can be used to in turn determine road pricing. Natural cities is an effective approach when finding these areas. Using natural cities to identify the polycentric pattern of Chinese cities, i.e. identifying the multiple dense centers of activity found in cities. Determining how city growth affects the thermal environment in cities using natural cities as a measurement tool. Identifying resilient urban areas or systems. Identifying polycentric cities with night time imagery, which can be used to evaluate the urban development levels. Quantifying urban expansion by using POI data as indicators of built up areas. Detecting hierarchical crowd data with different clustering algorithms. Using twitter data obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze spatial hotspots with natural cities. Reducing carbon emissions by dividing urban spaces using head/tail breaks. Using remote sensing to identify core city expansion. Predicting urban growth with fractal dimension logistic curve modeling and head/tail breaks. Head/tail breaks can serve as a main indicator that phenomena are distributed long tailed and that Paretian thinking should favor Gaussian thinking in geographic spaces. For example within biodiversity and pedodiversity studies where there seem to be fractal relationships such as taxa-area relationships. Complementary to this the polygons of soil and vegetation maps also show scaling within their structures. This can be identified and highlighted by using head/tail breaks. In image feature and texture extraction, certain algorithms like the discrete pulse transform, where LULU smoothing is used to extract the features, can be sped up by using head/tail breaks in the algorithm by separating large features and smaller features more effectively. By analysing hierarchies in urban patterns (i.e. Streets, building outlines), visual salience can be determined because it follows a similar principle, namely a scaling law, or long tailed distribution. Head/tail breaks are an aid in determining the hierarchies present because of the scaling nature of urban morphology and could be of further use when studying urban street network applications. This is especially the case for accessibility analysis, combined with space syntax head/tail breaks allow for an in depth understanding of street network structure. Urban structures, like street networks have been proven to be fractal in nature. An important point to note is that this structure is not consisting of only one defined fractal, it is characterized by a multifractal complex network. This means that on different scales, the defined fractal can change. Head/tail breaks can be used to determine the structure of the complex network over different scales, as it adjusts based on the data with each new hierarchy. Head/tail breaks as a classification method can be used to visualize growth or spread patterns in for example a global pandemic, like the Covid-19 one. By using head/tail breaks, main spread events can be effectively mapped and visualized where locations with a high infection rate are highlighted specifically due to them being in the highest class. The risk measurement model based on the head/tail breaks approach can describe the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of the risk of COVID-19, and can better predict the risk trend of future epidemics in each city and identify the risk of future epidemics even during low incidence periods. Rock fracture networks are properties of rocks which are very important in rock engineering with applications in mining, shale gas development or slope stability. Because of the self-similarity characteristics of these fractures combined with the fractal nature they inhibit, head/tail breaks provide accurate measurements and analysis in
