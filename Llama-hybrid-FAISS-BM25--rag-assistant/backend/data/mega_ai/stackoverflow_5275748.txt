SEO is a dark art - nobody will be able to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. However, I do have some general pointers. Pleun is right - your objective should be to get the robots to your product detail page - that's likely to be the most keyword-rich, so optimize this page as much as you can! Semantic HTML, don't use images to show text, the usual. Construct meaningful navigation schemes to lead the robots (and your visitors!) to your product detail pages. So, if you have 150K products, let's hope they are grouped into some kind of hierarchy, and that each (sub)category in that hierarchy has a managable ( Create a sitemap - robots will crawl the entire sitemap, though they may not decide to pay much attention to pages that are hard to reach through "normal" navigation, even if they are in the sitemap.xml. Most robots don't parse more than the first 50-100K of HTML. If your navigation scheme (with a data grid) is too big, the robot won't necessarily pick up or follow links at the end. Hope this helps!
