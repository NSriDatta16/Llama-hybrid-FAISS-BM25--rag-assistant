Okay, hair brained scheme #1 on my side: Use Visual Studio Refactor menu to "extract interface" on 'ApiClientEntryPoint'. Create a new WCF service which implements the above Interface and get VS to generate the method stubs for you. 'For PropertyExposingAnInterface.SomeOtherMethodCall' You will have to flatten the interfaces as there is no concept of a "nested" service operation. Your only other option will be to use T4 code gen ,which will probably take longer than the above idea.
