Mindscape's LightSpeed is generally pretty simple (it takes a convention over configuration approach), and automatically handles the list scenario you describe. Although it requires foreign key IDs under the surface, it has a designer which will take care of adding those for you (you can drag tables on, or create associations using the designer and the designer will automatically implement the foreign keys). See the getting started screencast for an example.
