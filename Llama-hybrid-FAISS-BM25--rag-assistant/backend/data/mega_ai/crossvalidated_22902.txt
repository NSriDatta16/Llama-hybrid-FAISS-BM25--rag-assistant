Model evaluation and comparison for selecting the best model

When comparing results obtained with different models in R, what should I look for to select the best one? If I use for example the following 4 models applied to the same presence/absence sample taken from a species dataset, with the same variables: Generalized linear model Generalized additive models Classification Regression Tree Artificial Neural Networks Should I compare all methods by AIC, Kappa, or cross-validation? Will I ever be certain of selecting the best model? What happens if I compare those 4 models prediction with a Bayes factor? Can I compare them?
