I think you may just have to brute force that one. I.e. comment out any vbo using lines a few at a time till your program doesn't crash anymore. Then you'll have an idea of which lines to focus your attention on and really scrutinize the parameters you're passing. Also try sprinkling glError() calls liberally around your program. Often if you pass a bogus parameter glError will tell you something is wrong before it gets to the point of crashing.
