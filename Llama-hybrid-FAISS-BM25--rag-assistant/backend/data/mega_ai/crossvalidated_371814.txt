VC dimension of signed intervals

Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms , Section 6.8, Question 9 is Let $\mathcal H$ be the class of signed intervals, that is, $\mathcal H = \{ h_{a,b,s} : a \le b, s \in \{-1, 1\} \}$ where $$ h_{a,b,s} = \begin{cases} s & \text{if } x \in [a, b] \\ -s & \text{if } x \notin [a, b] \end{cases} .$$ Calculate $\operatorname{VCdim}(\mathcal H)$ . My understanding is that it should be 2, since we cannot label this as (1 -1 1) for instance. Is this correct?
