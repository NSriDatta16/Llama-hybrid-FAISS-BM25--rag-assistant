My neural network will run okay, but occasionally (every 1000) it provides an error. It's not an "error", per se, it's a warning. It says that it fixes the problem for you. For one in a thousand times it's worthwhile just to leave it. If it did that frequently the "error" would be that you could to have structured the data to avoid the message, permitting faster execution - or you could check for such conditions and apply the fix-up prior to calling the confusionMatrix function, then you wouldn't get the warning. It results from the function: confusionMatrix.default See the documentation for confusionMatrix , parameter positive : positive an optional character string for the factor level that corresponds to a "positive" result (if that makes sense for your data). If there are only two factor levels, the first level will be used as the "positive" result. When mode = "prec_recall", positive is the same value used for relevant for functions precision, recall, and F_meas.table. "The functions requires that the factors have exactly the same levels. For two class problems, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value is calculated using the positive argument. Also, the prevalence of the "event" is computed from the data (unless passed in as an argument), the detection rate (the rate of true events also predicted to be events) and the detection prevalence (the prevalence of predicted events).". See: StackOverflow - confusionMatrix for a classifier in R . It's not uncommon to see the warning, in this Ensemble Learning it occurs over 1000 times.
