Please refer to this link to configure your VM Role; part of what you need is to open a firewall port that allows communication into your VM Role. http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazuremanagement/thread/b5f2967e-57e6-4099-9077-fb6d74897dbf - then you also need to enable TCP connections on your SQL Server instance. But more importantly, are you aware that VM Roles do not have persistent storage capability? Refer to this link for an interesting discussion about that issue specifically: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazuremanagement/thread/b5f2967e-57e6-4099-9077-fb6d74897dbf Did you consider using SQL Azure instead?
