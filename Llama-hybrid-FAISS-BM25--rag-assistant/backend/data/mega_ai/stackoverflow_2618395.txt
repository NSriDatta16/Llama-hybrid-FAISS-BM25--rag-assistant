Arguments On a Console eMbedded Visual C++ Application

I'm trying to develop a simple application that will read some files, targeted for Windows CE. For this I'm using Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ 3. This program(that is for console) will be called like this: /Storage Card/Test> coms file.cmss As you can see, file.cmss is the first argument, but on my main I have a condition to show the help(the normal, how to use the program) if the arguments are smaller than 2: int WinMain(int argc,char **argv) { if(argc But when I execute the program on the command-line of Windows CE(using all the necessary arguments) I got the showHelp() content. Then I've checked all the code, but it's entirelly correct. But I think that eVC++ don't use argc and argv[] for arguments, then I want some help on how to determine the arguments on it.
