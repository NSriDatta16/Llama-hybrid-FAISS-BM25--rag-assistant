I use weak reference for state-keeping in mixins. Remember, mixins are static, so when you use a static object to attach state to a non-static one, you never know how long it will be required. So instead of keeping a Dictionary I keep a Dictionary to prevent the mixin from dragging things for too long. The only problem is that every time I do an access, I also check for dead references and remove them. Not that they hurt anyone, unless there are thousands, of course.
