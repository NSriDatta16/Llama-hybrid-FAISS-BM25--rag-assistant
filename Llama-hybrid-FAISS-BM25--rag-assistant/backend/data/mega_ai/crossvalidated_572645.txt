Help with Modeling Random Effects Model Interaction

I am having some trouble determining the correct modeling strategy for my research. I have a sample of approximately 500 movie observations nested within approximately 250 franchises. The average number of movies per franchise is approximately 2, but the number of movies per franchise ranges from 1 to 14. About 140 franchises have only 1 observation. I first thought about analyzing the data using a multilevel model, but the singleton groups worry me. Here is an example of the model I am trying to estimate: BoxOfficeRevenue = OpenTheaters + AwardWon + Budget + FranchiseBookBased + Budget*OpenTheaters + Budget*AwardWon + FranchiseBookBased*AwardWon + FranchiseBookBased*OpenTheaters + Controls AwardWon is a dichotomous (0-1) variable FranchiseBookBased is a dichotomous (0-1) variable Should I continue down the mixed/multilevel path or are there other suggestions? Fixed effects will not work since it washes away the focal level 2 moderator. Any literature support would be helpful as well. Thanks!
