Rescaling is always a good idea. As pointed out by jb. in some cases it won't make a different, but in some cases it will make a significant difference. Let me add that for PCA related stuff, sometimes subtle differences in the rescaling can make a relatively large difference. Consider evaluating the following alternatives: unit length normalization, linear re-scaling, mean variance rescaling and rank scaling.
