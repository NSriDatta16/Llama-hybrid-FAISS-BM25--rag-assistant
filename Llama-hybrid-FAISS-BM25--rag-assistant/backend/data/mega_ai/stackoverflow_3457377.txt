If you really mean machine learning, rather than pre-programming an algorithm then I think that's really difficult. Simple trial and error approaches are going to perform really badly when the number of boxes becomes large. I wonder whether it's worth looking at the approaches taken in programming computers to play Go. There's been a lot of progress in applying Monte Carlo methods especialy in the end-game, which is a similar kind of combinatorial problem to your packing problem. See This reference.
