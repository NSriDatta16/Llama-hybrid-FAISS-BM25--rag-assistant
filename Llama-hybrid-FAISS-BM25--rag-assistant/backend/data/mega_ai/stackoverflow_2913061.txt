Check your post back, you're probably loading the grid fresh on every page load, so when you page, you're probably calling the code that populates your grid and it resets the page index. You need to make sure to load it only if it is not a postback, if it is a post back you'll have to fetch the data and the appropriate pageIndex from a storage area like ViewState etc.
