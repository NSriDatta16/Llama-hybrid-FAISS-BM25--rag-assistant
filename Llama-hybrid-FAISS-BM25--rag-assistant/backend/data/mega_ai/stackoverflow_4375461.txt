Store the pre tax value in the data base, you can also store the with tax value and use that for most use cases. Th big problem I forsee is the rounding rules for VAT on invoices.These (at least in the UK) are really strict and there is no way for your reverse calculation to get this right. Also you need to store the tax item by item as the VAT dragons will expect you to refund exactly the tax paid if an item is returned. You really need to get hold of the local sales tax rules before you start. My experience is that you can get dragged over the coals if your calculations are out by as little as a penny, and, if you are audited you need to be able to show how you arrived at the VAT figure so not storing anything used in your calculations will catch you out.
