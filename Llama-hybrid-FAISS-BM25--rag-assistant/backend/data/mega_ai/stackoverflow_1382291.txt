This is frowned upon. Your page rank suffers if Google sees this (google "expert exchange google"). People can still access your site with Google Cache You have to take into account every other search engine too, as you'll have to use "browser sniffing" What you'd do is sniff for the Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html) and Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Yahoo! Slurp; http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/slurp) user-agents (at least), and deliver to that client different content altogether. Another option, is to do what expersexchange does, and have all the information buried deep down on the page. That way you have your cake, and eat it too: users don't completely hate you, your page rank doesn't suffer, and you still discriminate non-registered users give a better experience to registered users.
