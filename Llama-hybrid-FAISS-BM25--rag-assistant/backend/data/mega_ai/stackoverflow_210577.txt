Maybe using a language recognition chart to recognize english would work. Some quick tests seem to work (this assumes paragraphs separated by newlines only). The regexp will match one of any of those conditions... \bword\b is word separated by boundaries word\b is a word ending and just word will match it in any place of the paragraph to be matched. my @paragraphs = split(/\n/,$text); for my $p (@paragraphs) { if ($p =~ m/\bthe\b|\band\b|\ban\b|\bin\b|\bon\b|\bthat\b|\bis\b|\bare\b|th|sh|ough|augh|ing\b|tion\b|ed\b|age\b|’s\b|’ve\b|n’t\b|’d\b/) { print "Probable english\n$p\n"; } }
