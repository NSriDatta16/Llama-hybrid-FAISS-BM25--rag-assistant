After some amount of research, I have figured out the solution for this. In Pure Coverage there is a mechanism for instrumenting DLLs only. We can instrument a DLL in permanent instrumentation mode, so that whenever any exe invokes it, the coverage will be recorded. With this mechanism, coverage can obtained for Windows Explorer Context Menu Application.
