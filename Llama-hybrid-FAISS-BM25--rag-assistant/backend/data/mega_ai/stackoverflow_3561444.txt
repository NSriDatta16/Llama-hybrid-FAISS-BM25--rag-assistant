Your XHTML is invalid, and your non-standard method for embedding the SVG in it does so, AFAIK, as a separate document (which doesn't share the same window object as the parent document). The script wasn't written for SVG in the first place though, it has IE specific stuff in it and SVG isn't supported by IE.
