I would create a specific version your application for profiling that can be run without ClickOnce. Hopefully, it wouldn't be too difficult to remove the isolated storage access and just return some dummy values. I'm not sure you could do it via ClickOnce even if you didn't have the isolated storage issue. I haven't used dotTrace but I assume it needs .pdb files to profile your code. I'd be surprised if you were deploying the .pdb files with your app.
