The way I've done it -- which is a bit of a hack, but works great -- is to dynamically add a tag just after the closing of each paragraph. A little regex does the trick: // raw string var myText:String = " This is the first paragraph. This is the second paragraph. "; var myTextField:TextField = new TextField(); myTextField.multiline = true; myTextField.wordWrap = true; addChild(myTextField); myTextField.htmlText = fixClosingP(myText); // adds " " after every occurrence of " " function fixClosingP(input:String):String { var r:RegExp = / /gi; return input.replace(r, " "); } It won't give you pixel-level control over the spacing, but it basically inserts one full break, which works well enough in most cases.
