How to calculate decision boundary from support vectors?

I want to obtain decision boundary of SVM using OpenCV 2.4.11, but it seems that it's not returning it explicitly, but only support vectors . How we can calculate decision boundary from support vectors? Update: Anyway seems via opencv interface I can't get lagrange multiplier $\alpha_i$
