Well you can do it in python, since the "import" statement is just code: if some_conditional: import shortcuts But in this case it would not be very pythonic, since shortcuts is a dependency of the function mood_dispatcher and not of the module itself, then you could do the import inside the function. Python's import system is very flexible and powerful but you must pay attention to the import order (and also avoid circular dependencies as well). Regards
