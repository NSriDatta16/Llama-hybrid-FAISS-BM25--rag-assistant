Adrien already gave you an elegant answer: def stringify(input): return [str(num) for num in input] That works perfectly, but if you intend to only iterate through the representations (and don't need to keep the whole list in memory for any other reason), you should instead do: (str(num) for num in the_list) The parenthesis instead of the brackets indicate a generator expression, just as iterable as a list, but won't fully expand on creation. This may be important if your list is large.
