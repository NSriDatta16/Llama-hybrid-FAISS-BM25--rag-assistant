Log-linear model vs Multinomial-Dirichlet model for contingency table

Given a 1x3 contingency table of the form $$[y_1,y_2,y_3]$$ where each $y_i$ represents a count on some random variable $$X\sim Multinomial(n, \pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3)$$ We can estimate the vector of parameters $[\hat{\pi_1},\hat{\pi_2},\hat{\pi_3}]$ using a Bayesian Multinomial-Dirichlet conjugate model, and then get a sample estimate of the estimand. $$\pi_1 - \pi_2$$ Could we also get an estimate of the difference of proportions using a glm and avoid MCMC?
