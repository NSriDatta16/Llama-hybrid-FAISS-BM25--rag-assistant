I think you should close fos stream in the createPicture() method. BitmapFactory.decode*() methods return null in case of error. So it's better to check for null after decoding. As far as I know you can save a file from the Android internal storage only on an emulator or a rooted device. This can be done using Eclipse's DDMS Perspective or ddms utility from Android SDK toolchain. Just click Device->File Explorer and pull your files from a device. If you want to get a file from a non-rooted device, you'd better save it to the external storage (sdcard). In this case you can connect your device to a computer like external hard drive.
