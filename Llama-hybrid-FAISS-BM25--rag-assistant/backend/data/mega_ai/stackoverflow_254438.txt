LastAccess Time is incorrect

every time i create a FileInfo object and access it's lastaccesstime property, it's always a few minutes off. the file property window remains constant, however the application shows that it is usually a few minutes after the property window time. Also, i noticed that if i drag the file to the cmd window to pass the filename as an argument, the access time updates most of the time, but not always. What could be causing this ? below is an example: static void Main(string[] args) { if (args.Length > 0) { FileInfo fi = new FileInfo(args[0].ToString()); Console.WriteLine(args[0]); if (fi.Exists) { Console.Write("Current: " + DateTime.Now + "\n"); Console.Write("LAT: " + fi.LastAccessTime + "\n"); Console.Write("LWT: " + fi.LastWriteTime + "\n"); Console.Write("CT: " + fi.CreationTime + "\n"); } Console.ReadKey(); } } alt text http://img407.imageshack.us/img407/4728/propertiesox6.png alt text http://img380.imageshack.us/img380/7752/appgt0.png
