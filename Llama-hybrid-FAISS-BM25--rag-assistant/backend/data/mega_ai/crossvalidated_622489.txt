batch training with One-Class SVM model

i am working with an anomaly detection problem. i have a large dataset that i cannot fully load it in the memory does batch training works with normal ML models ? does this make sense ???? # Initialize the One-Class SVM model one_class_svm = OneClassSVM(nu=nu, kernel=kernel, gamma=gamma) # Training in batches batch_size = 1000 for batch_data in batch_generator(X, batch_size): # Train the one-class SVM on the current batch one_class_svm.fit(batch_data)
