How to cope with different lengths of labels– dynamic layout

I have to enable all the text in a winforms application to be replaced; it is an old application and is in “maintenance”. The application was written in .NET v1.1 and later bits of it in .NET v2 therefore it does not use any layout controls. The problem I have is that I need to make the UI cope when a string is longer then the default string. However I don’t wish to make lots of changes to the code due to the risk. In the past I have found that simple changes like adding a panel to a form and dragging the current controls on to it have lost event hook-up etc. Due to the way the WinForms designer moves the code about, it is very hard to use DIFF to spot this sort of problem. So wish to avoid any changes to the control tree if possible. So I am looking for some sort of layout manager that I can just add to a form without having to change the rest of the code (or control tree) – any ideals? Any other options I should be looking at? (The people that are replacing the strings do not have the skill set to rearrange the controls themselves; it would also be a maintenance nightmare as label may need to have different values for each customer) (Answers that say, “If I was you I would not start from here are not useful”) Does anyone know of a layout manager that is external to the control tree? E.g I can point it at a form and it will take over the layout of the controls, without having to make all the controls children of the layout manager. see also this thread on the msdn Forums .
