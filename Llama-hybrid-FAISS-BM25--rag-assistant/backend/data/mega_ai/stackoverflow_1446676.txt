"Use Core Data for storage" checkbox

What actually happens behind the scenes when you select the "Use Core Data for storage" option when creating a new Window based project in Xcode? I'm trying to use Core Data in a project that I've already created, and I'm having a hard time figuring out how to include the framework properly in my Xcode project... Thanks!
