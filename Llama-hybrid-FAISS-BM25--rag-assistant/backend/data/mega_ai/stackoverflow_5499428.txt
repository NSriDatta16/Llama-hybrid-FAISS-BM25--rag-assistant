You can't change the text on a XWPFParagraph directly. A XWPFParagraph is made up of one or more XWPFRun instances. These provide the way to set the text. To change the text, your code would want to be something like: public void changeText(XWPFParagraph p, String newText) { List runs = p.getRuns(); for(int i = runs.size() - 1; i > 0; i--) { p.removeRun(i); } XWPFRun run = runs.get(0); run.setText(newText, 0); } That will ensure you only have one text run (the first one), and will replace all the text to be what you provided.
