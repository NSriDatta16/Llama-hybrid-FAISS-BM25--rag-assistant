Any transformer model (NLP) for code classification?

Does any Transformer (NLP) that is suitable for code classification tasks exist? For example, I have a lot of source codes of various categories (driver, game, email client, etc.). I want to distinguish (classify) these types using such a model. Many thanks for considering my question.
