Do Bayesians interpret the likelihood distribution as subjective as well?

One of the main differences between Bayesians and frequentists is that they have a subjective interpretation to probability. However, do Bayesians actually interpret subjectively the probabilities attached to an outcome GIVEN a set of parameters (i.e. for the likelihood), or is it just that they attach a subjective probability to the prior, and also to the posterior as a consequence? (but $p(x | \theta)$ is thought similarly to the way frequentists think about it.)
