Get Bounding Rectangle of String with NSLayoutManager

I have a large amount of unique strings for which I want to compute their bounding rectangle when they would be laid out in an infinitly large rectangle. Currently I use a single NSTextStorage/NSLayoutManager and loop over all strings, collecting the rectangles: // setup NSTextStorage and its NSLayoutManager, NSTextContainer ... forall (NSAttributedString *astring in ...) { // put string into textstorage [textStorage setAttributedString:astring]; // trigger glyph generation and layout [textContainer setContainerSize: NSMakeSize (CGFLOAT_MAX, CGFLOAT_MAX)]; [layoutManager ensureLayoutForTextContainer: textContainer]; // finally get the bounding box NSRect boundingBox = [layoutManager usedRectForTextContainer: textContainer]; ... } The question is : is it possible to speed up the computation considering that the strings don't need to be drawn? I'm only interested in the rectangle's width and height.
