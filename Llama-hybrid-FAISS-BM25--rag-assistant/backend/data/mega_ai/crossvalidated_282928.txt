For caffe there is a third-party tool called Expresso ( http://val.serc.iisc.ernet.in/expresso/ ) that provides some GUI to help you getting started. Moreover, NVIDIA DIGITS ( https://developer.nvidia.com/digits ) claims to be an interactive tool as well: DIGITS simplifies common deep learning tasks such as managing data, designing and training neural networks on multi-GPU systems, monitoring performance in real time with advanced visualizations, and selecting the best performing model from the results browser for deployment. DIGITS is completely interactive so that data scientists can focus on designing and training networks rather than programming and debugging. Hope this helps!
