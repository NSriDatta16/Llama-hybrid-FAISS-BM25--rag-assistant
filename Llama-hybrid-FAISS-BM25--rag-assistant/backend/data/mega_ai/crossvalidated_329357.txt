I believe you are looking for the bootcov function in R that allows calculations of standard errors for nested clusters. This is well described in Huang 2016, you should have a look at the examples they give in the supplementary materials where they provide the full R script they used for this analysis. Huang, Francis L. "Using cluster bootstrapping to analyze nested data with a few clusters." Educational and Psychological Measurement (2016): 0013164416678980. Using a Monte Carlo simulation that varied the number of clusters, average cluster size, and intraclass correlations, we compared standard errors using cluster bootstrapping with those derived using ordinary least squares regression and multilevel models. Results indicate that cluster bootstrapping, though more computationally demanding, can be used as an alternative procedure for the analysis of clustered data when treatment effects at the group level are of primary interest. Supplementary material showing how to perform cluster bootstrapped regressions using R is also provided. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013164416678980
