Should Github be used as a CDN for javascript libraries?

Serving javascript libraries from a CDN instead of your own server comes with tremendous advantages. Less work for your server, possibility for the CDN to have a copy closer to the user than your server, but most importantly a good chance that your user's browser already has it cached from that URL. The last one means less total work for everybody, so it's clearly a win all around, and is more likely the more often we (developers) rely on the CDNs to serve our javascript. But the popular javascript CDNs (Google, Microsoft, others?) only host a small number of files. For others we have the choice of hosting them ourselves, or ... using the source control server as a kind of CDN. It's unlikely Github or similar has a geographically distributed cache of files optimized for serving globally. But if it's common practice, then there is a decent chance that the user's browser will have it cached. The argument of off-loading work from our servers to github is only valid if Github has willingly volunteered to do this. So, is it common practice? Should we encourage each other to do this? Does Github mind? Do they have an official policy stated?
