How can I POST a multipart HTTP request from Perl to Java and get a response?

I'm trying to post from one of my subroutines in Perl a request to a Java based controller. But I'm not getting any kind of response back. I know the Java code works file because I can get a response if I post to it from a HTML form. This is my Perl code: use HTTP::Request::Common; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $response = $ua->request(POST 'http://testserver/testing.nc', Content_Type => 'form-data', Content => [ method => 'submit', ftp_server => 'ftp.localhost', ftp_user => 'testuser', ftp_password => 'testpass', remote_path => '/home/files', port => 22, file_to_upload => ["$file"] ]); Is there something wrong with this code?
