How to "turn off" jQuery Mobile's styling of drop downs?

I need to turn off jQuery Mobile's styling of drop downs. Ultimately I'd like the device itself (iPhone, Android, Blackberry, etc.) to determine how the drop down looks. Currently my markup is (option quantity reduced for display purposes): State: Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi I tried using data-role="none" on the but nothing changed. Is there a way to "turn off" jQuery Mobile for just the select drop down?
