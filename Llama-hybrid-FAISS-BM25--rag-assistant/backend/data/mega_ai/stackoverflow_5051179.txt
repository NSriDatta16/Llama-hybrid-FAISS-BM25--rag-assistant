regexp to remove entire paragraph based on it's content?

hey guys, I'm a regexp noob, Is it possible with preg_replace to remove a the an entire paragraph tag? lot of content with oder divs etc. The paragraph should only be removed if it is following div has a class of .vidwrapper. Is that even possible? Any idea how this regexp would look like? Thank you for your help.
