Try changing contents of your manifest to simply CACHE MANIFEST with no files listed. The clients should retrieve the new manifest next time they hit the site and their cache should be removed. Note however that they won't be using this new, empty manifest until they refresh the page. I've found that in some cases on some browsers they don't necessarily grab the new manifest right away. This behavior seems inconsistent though. When this happens I tend to clear their caches / offline storage manually in order to force them to update (though I understand you can't necessarily get users to do this).
