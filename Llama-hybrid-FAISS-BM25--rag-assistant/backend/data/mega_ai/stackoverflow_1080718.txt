You have a couple of options, all of which suck. Add #undef DrawText in your own code Don't include windows.h . If another library includes it for you, don't include that directly. Instead, include it in a separate .cpp file, which can then expose your own wrapper functions in its header. Rename your own DrawText . When possible, I usually go for the middle option. windows.h behaves badly in countless other ways (for example, it doesn't actually compile unless you enable Microsoft's proprietary C++ extensions), so I simply avoid it like the plague. It doesn't get included in my files if I can help it. Instead, I write a separate .cpp file to contain it and expose the functionality I need. Also, feel free to submit it as a bug and/or feedback on connect.microsoft.com. Windows.h is a criminally badly designed header, and if people draw Microsoft's attention to it, there's a (slim) chance that they might one day fix it. The good news is that windows.h is the only header that behaves this badly. Other headers generally try to prefix their macros with some library-specific name to avoid name collisions, they try to avoid creating macros for common names, and they try avoid using more macros than necessary.
