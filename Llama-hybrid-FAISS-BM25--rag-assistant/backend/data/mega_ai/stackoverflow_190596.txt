Drag and drop in winapi

I have a pure Winapi application that needs a few new features. One of them would best be implemented as two lists where you can drag-and-drop (multiple) elements between the lists. The new feature can be limited to a single dialog. What would be the quickest way to implement this? A few ideas: Pure Winapi (is it DetectDrag) A separate MFC or .NET DLL that provides this one dialog Embed the Microsoft WebBrowser Control and use JQuery Any of these options that should be avoided? Any better ideas? What is quickest to implement? Any pointers on how to get started?
