Drag'n'drop image inside link from IE to C#

I'm trying to get link to image file (src attribute) which I drag'n'drop from browser onto my desktop application. Image located inside an anchor (a-tag). My code works with Chrome & Fx - but not with IE :( if (e.Data.GetDataPresent("HTML Format")) { string data = (string)e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.Html); It seems like Explorer don't have any "HTML Format" Data sent to drg'n'drop mechanism, or I doing it wrong. is there a way to get the image src from IE? UPDATE I see, that if I select the link ("selection") with Image inside it, IE will send HTML Format. Fx and Chrome do the selection thing automatically upon dragging.
