You could train a non-linear model using only $x_c$ to predict $y$ , i.e. $f(x_c) = \hat{y}$ . Then compute the residual $\epsilon = \hat{y} - y$ . The residual $\epsilon$ will have been controlled for with regards to $x_c$ as $f$ has captured the relationship between $x_c$ and $y$ as well as it possibly could. You can now use the residual $\epsilon$ as input for all further analysis such as any modeling or feature importance algorithms. You’ll want to include $x_c$ as a feature in your further analysis in case of any interaction effects between $x_c$ and $x_1, …, x_n$ . In terms of the choice of the non-linear model for $f$ , random forest is a good and easy-to-use method, but many other non-linear models (e.g. neural networks) could be used as well. Warning: I think this approach works, but would appreciate references to confirm it!
