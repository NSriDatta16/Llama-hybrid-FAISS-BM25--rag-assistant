I havent used the delete functionality with TWIG but check this link This has some infor about deleteion of nodes using TWIG The relevant portion being here: } else { $para->delete; } } The last part of the paragraph handler deletes the twig from the result tree if the paragraph didn't contain a match for the specified keyword. This ensures that only those paragraphs containing a match will make it into the final output. $para is an element passed into the handler.
