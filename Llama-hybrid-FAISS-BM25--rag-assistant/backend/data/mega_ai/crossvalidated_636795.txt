$\mu_t$ is unfortunately called "deterministic", because its defining property is that it is "completely determined" by past values of the process, it is a "deterministic function" of the past values of the process: $$\mu_t = h(Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2},...)$$ But this means that $\mu_t$ is a stochastic process, and one that it must be covariance-stationary, otherwise it could not be a component of a stationary process (given that its other component in the Wold decomposition is stationary). It can be a degenerate process, a constant, which is trivially stationary. The mention that existed in the wikipedia article $\mu_t$ is a deterministic time series, such as one represented by a sine wave. was totally misleading, because it conveyed the sense that $\mu_t$ can be any process (so not necessarily covariance-stationary). But this is not correct. I write "was" because I just corrected the wikipedia entry. The example given in Sargent (1987) Macroeconomic Theory (2nd ed) p. 289 is illuminating, because it does formulate $\mu_t$ using $\cos$ and $\sin$ , but in a way that the process is covariance stationary. Sargent models $$\mu_t = \sum_{j=1}^{m} [a_j \cos(\lambda_jt) + b_j \sin(\lambda_jt)]$$ where $\lambda_j \in [-\pi, \pi]$ , while $a_j, b_j$ are random variables (that do not change with $t$ ), with $$E(a_j) = E(b_j) = E(a_jb_j) = E(a_ja_k) = E(b_jb_k)= 0 ,\quad j\neq k,$$ $$E(a_j^2) = E(b_j^2) =\sigma_j^2.$$ Obviously, $E(\mu_t) = 0$ . As for the covariance, we have (setting $m=1$ for simplicity, it does not affect the result), \begin{align} {\rm Cov}(\mu_t, \mu_{t-\ell}) &= E\Big\{\big[a_1 \cos(\lambda_1t) + b_1 \sin(\lambda_1t)\big]\cdot \big[a_1 \cos[\lambda_1(t-\ell)] + b_1 \sin[\lambda_1(t-\ell)]\big]\Big\}\\ &=\sigma^2_1 \cdot\Big[\cos(\lambda_1t)\cdot \cos[\lambda_1(t-\ell)] + \sin(\lambda_1t)\cdot \sin[\lambda_1(t-\ell)]\Big] \end{align} Then we invoke the trigonometric identity $$\cos\gamma \cdot \cos \delta + \sin \gamma \cdot \sin \delta = \cos(\gamma-\delta)$$ to get \begin{align} {\rm Cov}(\mu_t, \mu_{t-\ell}) &=\sigma^2_1 \cdot \Big[ \cos\big[\lambda_1t - \lambda_1(t-\ell)\big]\Big]\\ \\ &= \sigma^2_1 \cdot \cos\left[\lambda_1\ell\right] \end{align} So the covariance of the process $\mu_t$ does not depend on the index $t$ , but only on the distance $\ell$ between two instances of the process, and we have covariance stationarity of $\mu_t$ . We see that while we can use "sine and cosine" to model $\mu_t$ , at the same time the whole setup must be such that it preserves covariance-stationarity of $\mu_t$ : All the properties of the $a_j, b_j$ random variables are needed to arrive at the covariance-stationarity result. For example, if we had $E(a_1^2) \neq E(b_1^2)$ we would not arrive at the trigonometric identity which allowed us to eliminate $t$ from the covariance function.
