Oracle is certainly one of the more neglected databases in Cake. There is an Oracle driver included by default which has even gone through a number of revisions , but there's very little test coverage for it. Whether that makes the driver good or bad I can't say, it just means it hasn't gone through a whole lot of testing and possibly real-world usage yet. Again, the driver may or may not be fine, but if it's a mission critical app, Cake probably isn't the best choice. Unless you're ready to jump in and fix the driver if necessary. (And contribute patches back to the Cake project. :o))
