The answer to this question is very related to the practical problem you are working with. I spent three years modifying SMOTE algorithm to use it with one problem and the next two years trying to design a biased classifier to deal with another problem. In fact, in academia we care a lot about average accuracy comparing to overall accuracy. Here it comes the point that you should deal with the imbalance data problem. But in practical, in many cases you will find that they care about overall accuracy and not average accuracy. When the cost of missing any of the samples is the same then it makes since. If you do not have any consideration,then the question is: can I maximize both average and overall accuracy? This depends on the features you are using. In some cases, they cost of missing the minority samples is higher, then you need to design a biased classifier. The answer to your question: If balancing the data can maximize both of average and overall accuracy, it is better to do it. If balancing the data can not maximize both of them , then you need to think about the problem requirements
