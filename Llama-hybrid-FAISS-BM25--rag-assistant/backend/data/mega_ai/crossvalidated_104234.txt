Top scoring students across a series of tests

I have a number of students and their scores across a series of tests, all of which have equal importance in my model. I would like to identify the top scoring students (e.g. top 10%). My first idea was to average percentile ranks and work from there. However, I couldn't come up with a way how to attribute statistical significance to the results I'd get. My second idea is the following. First, take one test at a time and convert the scores of all students on this test to $z$-scores . Second, run a one-sample $t$-test for each student, with the following hypotheses: $\mathcal{H}_0$: Average $z$-score across all tests is equal to 0. $\mathcal{H}_A$: Average $z$-score across all tests is larger than 0. This procedure would give me a $p$-value for each student. I could then set a threshold $T$ such that only approximately 10% of students achieve $p$-values lower than $T$. Does this approach make sense? What could be its caveats? On the other hand, if it doesn't make sense, can you sketch an alternative? My interest is in an approach that deals with the class of problems in which I have a set of objects (in the order of thousands) and their scores across a series of equally-important events, i.e., not necessarily only the student-test scenario.
