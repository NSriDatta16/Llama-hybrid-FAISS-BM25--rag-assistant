Have you tried using Bayesian networks? That's the first thing I think of when I need to fuse multiple pieces of data (coming in one at a time) to arrive at the probabilities of a random variable. Bayesian networks don't rely on the independence assumption that naive Bayes does. BTW, hidden Markov models are a special case of Bayesian networks.
