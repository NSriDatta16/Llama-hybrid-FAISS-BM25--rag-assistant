I'm assuming the displayed time series shows number of jobs submitted per 15 minute interval. Categorical features Divide the time series per category. If the jobs can be divided into type1 , type2 , type3 then make a time series for each type and predict each series individually. So type1 -time series has number of type1 -jobs per 15 minute interval. Continuous features For continues features e.g time-to-do-job you can divide the jobs into categories of time00 , time10 , time20 , time30 for jobs that take 0-9 minutes, 10-19 minutes, 20-29 minutes etc respectively. As before generate a time-series per division. Depending on how much data you have and how it is distributed you can make more groups or space them differently.
