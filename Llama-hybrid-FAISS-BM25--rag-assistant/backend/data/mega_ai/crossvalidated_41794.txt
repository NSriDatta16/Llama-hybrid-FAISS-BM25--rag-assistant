Bayesian Updating for a Discrete Rating Value

I have an item for which I slowly collect rating values on a website. It is a movie item on a website and at the beginning it has no rating but I assign it a Gaussian prior $N(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2)$. A person comes on the website and gives it 4 out of 5 (note that I have only discrete ratings 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 stars) My question is how can I update my prior now and get a posterior distribution for the mean of stars. My second question is that let's say I consider the median of the scores as the final score that I want to show to people for that movie how can I do my updating then? I imagine I have to form a discrete prior as well. And my last question is that if I wanted to assign a weight to each rating and find the weighted mean and median how can I do that? These might be easy questions but I am very confused about these. If you know a book or paper that might have discussed a similar problem I appreciate if you could refer me to that too.
