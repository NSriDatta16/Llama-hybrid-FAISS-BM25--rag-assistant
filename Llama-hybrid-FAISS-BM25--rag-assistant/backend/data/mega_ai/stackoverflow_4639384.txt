Using constants for stuff like DEFAULT_USER_ID is still "the way to go" (unless you want it to be configurable, but that's another topic). --> const (C# Reference) Don't use constants for enumerations ( FILE_TYPE_DOC = 1 , FILE_TYPE_XLS = 2 , ...). This can be done more elegantly in C# with enums : enum FileType { Doc, Xls, // or, optionally, "Xls = 2". ... }; You can also use this for flags (constants combinable by bitwise operators), which is another common use case of constants in C: [Flags] enum FontDecoration { None = 0, Bold = 1, Italic = 2, Underline = 4 }
