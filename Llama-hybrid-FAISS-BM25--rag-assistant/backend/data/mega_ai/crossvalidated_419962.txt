In the first case ( predict(model, type='class') we look at OOB errors and in the second case ( predict(model, type='class', data = x) the training data are treated as new data. This second option will artificially inflate the goodness-of-fit from the RF model. CV.SE has very relevant thread under: What measure of training error to report for Random Forests? I would suggest reading through it .
