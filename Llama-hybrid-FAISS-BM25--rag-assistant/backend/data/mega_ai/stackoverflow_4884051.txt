causing 404 error on particular inputs

I've come across a weird problem. I have a simple form which submits data to a php processor page. However, the following input to the description field causes a 404 Error. To recognize and reward the best in Indian theatre, The Mahindra and Mahindra presents META (Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Awards). The only award of its kind, META is designed to showcase the best in theatre being produced in India. An eminent selection committee shortlists the 10 best plays from innumerable entries from all across India. These plays are staged and adjudged under 13 award categories. The festival culminates with an scintillating awards ceremnony. Entering its sixth year, METAâ€™s objective remains to encourage all aspects of theatre craft such as playwriting, set, costume and light design, direction and performance and promoting theatre. I've tried changing the apostrophes and commas, even the brackets, but it didn't help. The code for the form: Title Date Image Description Link On submitting the text above i get the following error : Not Found The requested URL /cms/events/add.php was not found on this server. Apache/1.3.41 Server at www.xyzs.in Port 80 Is this a problem with the text-encoding?
