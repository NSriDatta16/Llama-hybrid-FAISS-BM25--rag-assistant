give feedback on this pointer program

This is relatively simple program. But I want to get some feedback about how I can improve this program (if any), for example, unnecessary statements? #include #include using namespace std; double Average(double*,int); int main() { ifstream inFile("data2.txt"); const int SIZE = 4; double *array = new double(SIZE); double *temp; temp = array; for (int i = 0; i > *array++; } cout The codes are valid and the program is working fine. But I just want to hear what you guys think, since most of you have more experience than I do (well I am only a freshman ... lol) Thanks.
