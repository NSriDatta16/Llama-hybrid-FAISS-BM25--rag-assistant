Overall acurracy +/- E (with 90% C.I.)

I am assessing the accuracy of my classification model. I performed a 4-folds cross-validation and I obtained the following Overall Accuracy: OA = (0.910, 0.920, 0.880, 0.910). So, the average OA is 0.905. My dataset contains 120 samples, therefore in each fold of cross-validation I used 90 samples for training (3/4) and 30 samples for validation (1/4). Now I want to calculate the 95% confidence interval around the mean. I am thinking of using the following formula to calculate the symmetrical interval with respect to the average (confidence interval of the binomial proportion): interval = z * sqrt ((accuracy * (1 - accuracy)) / n) where z is the number of standard deviations from The Gaussian Distribution and n is the number of samples. For 95% C.I. z = 1.96 . But, What I should use n value? 120, 30, 4? Is there a better way to calculate it?
