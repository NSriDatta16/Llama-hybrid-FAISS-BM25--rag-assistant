There's no supported way to do this and it might be near impossible. You might try embedding your "main" table view in a container NSView (that observes the table view's frame changes resizes / performs layout when the size changes). This view would leave room at the bottom for a single-row table view with no headers. You could feed the "main" table view all but the sticky row, and feed only the sticky row to the smaller table.
