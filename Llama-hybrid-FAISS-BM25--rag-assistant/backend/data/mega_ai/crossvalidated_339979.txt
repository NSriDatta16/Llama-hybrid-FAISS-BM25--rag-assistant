Is the LASSO also a subset selection method?

I have got a question about the LASSO regularisation method, this method is usually used in machine learning and multivariate statistics to avoid the overfitting and hence, get better predictions. The "penalised" log-likelihood of a LASSO model is given by: $\underset{\beta}{\text{argmax}} \qquad l(\beta) - \lambda \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{p}\left | \beta _{j} |\right. $ where $l$ is the log-likelihood and $\beta$ are the regression coefficient. Usually the size of the regression coefficients included in the fitted model are shrink. However, I have seen some publications that use the "full" sized chosen parameters later on in a model, instead of the "shrink" sized parameters. Thus, they are using the LASSO as a subset selection method akin to univariate analysis. Would you agree that that is not a correct approach?
