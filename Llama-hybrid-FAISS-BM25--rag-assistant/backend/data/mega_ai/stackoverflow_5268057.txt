How to determine method error (Objective C/iPhone/xCode)?

While working through examples presented by Mark and LeMarche, I have encountered a number of situations where things don't work as expected. For example, Chapter 4 discusses 'Spiffing up a button' with an image. I can't seem to get an image stretched on the button, despite the fact that I followed the original instructions and a number of work arounds [1,2,3]. How does one determine the error encountered in a Objective C method which returns void? (IMHO, a useless paradigm). Guessing at the culprit or error is a useless waste of time, and its not working well for me. Sorry about being snippy - I am at wits end, and I am tired of all the printf's, NSLogs, and guessing. This is no way to develop programs. Jeff [1] Resizing an image with stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth [2] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:topCapHeight doesn't work in initWithCoder: of UIImageView subclass [3] iPhone stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth only makes "D"s // Source code from Mark and LeMarch ('Beginning iPhone 4 Programming', Chapter 4, pp. 99-100) // added for completeness. The same code is presented in 'Beginning iPhone 3 Programming'. // The button type is 'Custom', and the mode is 'Scale to Fill'. Trying to use TIFFs, // removing Alpha channels, resizing buttons so their size is image.height+1, etc - no joy. // The buttons were provided by Apple in their UICatalog example (http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/UICatalog/Introduction/Intro.html). // I've also tried to assign the image to a single button in case the resource cannot be shared. // Finally, no ASSERTs fire (and no exceptions are thrown), so all should be OK (yea, right). - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; UIImage* whiteButton = [UIImage imageNamed:@"whiteButton.png"]; ASSERT(whiteButton != nil); UIImage* strechableWhiteButton = [whiteButton stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:12.0 topCapHeight:0.0]; ASSERT(strechableWhiteButton != nil); [changeSrcFileButton setBackgroundImage:strechableWhiteButton forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [changeDestFileButton setBackgroundImage:strechableWhiteButton forState:UIControlStateNormal]; UIImage* blueButton = [UIImage imageNamed:@"blueButton.png"]; ASSERT(blueButton != nil); UIImage* strechableBlueButton = [blueButton stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:12 topCapHeight:0]; ASSERT(strechableBlueButton != nil); [changeSrcFileButton setBackgroundImage:strechableBlueButton forState:UIControlStateHighlighted]; [changeDestFileButton setBackgroundImage:strechableBlueButton forState:UIControlStateHighlighted]; }
