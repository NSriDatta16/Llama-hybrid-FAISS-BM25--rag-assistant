I agree totally with Jarrod's advice, but just in case you encounter the need to process additional conditions (and want to avoid ugly embedded ruby in your HTML code), take a look at Rails' content_tag method. With it, you can replace something like: > With something like: @post.active? ? 'active' : 'suspended' %> And of course, sticking this code into a helper and calling it from there will earn you more elegance-points. Hope this helps. PS: This is my first post on Stackoverflow, please be gentle. :)
