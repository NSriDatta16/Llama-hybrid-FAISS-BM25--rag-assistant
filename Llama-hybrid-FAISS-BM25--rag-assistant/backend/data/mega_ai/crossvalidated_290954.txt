how many iterations in breakpoint analysis (bfast)?

I am doing a breakpoint (using bfast ) analysis of several Vegetation Index time series (15 years time series; 340 images; MODIS). I have around 20.000 time series objects I want to analyse. I am already working parallel (using foreach ) but it is still very time consuming. And of course the more iterations, the more time needed. Below a short example of going from 1 to 3 iterations and time used respectively (for 50 time series). (sorry, in german, the last one of system.time() is "elapsed"). ndvi.ts is my mts object - each column containing a time series. > str(ndvi.ts) Time-Series [1:340, 1:20054] from 1.43 to 16.2: -0.1213 0.0781 0.3295 -0.0073 0.4163 ... > system.time(bfast.ls system.time(bfast.ls system.time(bfast.ls So I am wondering if there is a rule of thumb, at what number of iterations I get no "better" results? I did not find anything online regarding the max.iter parameter setting. Already using max.iter=3 would slow me down a lot. Of course, if there is some point in which I could make my code faster I am glad to hear that, too.
