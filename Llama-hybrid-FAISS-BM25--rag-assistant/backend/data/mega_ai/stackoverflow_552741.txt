We use VARCHAR for almost everything, and NVARCHAR only very very occasionally. Product Codes don't need NVarchar - we don't allow anything other than A-Z, 0-9 and "_" in them ... Its twice the storage space, but also only have half the entries per index page (and per data page) and half the memory cache is "wasted", more CPU cycles to compare data, and so on. IME the commonly used foreign accents work just find in Varchar (i.e. LATIN-1). We have no plans to do Chinese or other alternate character sets, and when we do being able to handle that characterset by having using NVarchar from Day One will be the least of our worries - Right-to-Left or Vertical alignment of text?? :( And if you allowed NVarchar for, say, a Name how are you going to type the extended charcater in from your keyboard? And if you import the data (so it is already NVarchar) how are you going to be able to search for that customer using your standard QWERTY keyboard. Lots and lots involved with internationalising an application, so my view is that there is no point "allowing for it by using NVarchar". But there again lots of places I go to have NVarchar ... and most of the columns are 50 characters wide too .... they must know something about population growth and expansion plans for ZIP codes that I don't!!
