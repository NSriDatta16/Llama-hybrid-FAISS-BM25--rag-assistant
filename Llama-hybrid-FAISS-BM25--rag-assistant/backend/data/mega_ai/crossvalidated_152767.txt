One way to approach such problems is to find a pivotal quantity , $Q$, which is a function of data and an unobservable quantity (such as a parameter, $\tau$, say) whose distribution doesn't depend on that unobservable quantity. You can then specify the endpoints $l_Q,u_Q$ of an interval for $Q$ that includes a specified fraction ($1-\alpha$) of its distribution (e.g. by placing bounds at the $\alpha/2$ and $1-\alpha/2$ quantiles of $Q$); this interval will be the same whatever the value of the unknown quantity (/parameter). (that is not the density of a suitable Q for this problem) From those limits for $Q(\mathbf{x;\tau})$, you can then back out limits of an interval for $\tau$ itself $l_\tau,u_\tau$ which will have the given ($1-\alpha$) coverage (i.e. would encompass the parameter with the given frequency across many such trials). To that end, consider the distribution of $t/\tau$.
