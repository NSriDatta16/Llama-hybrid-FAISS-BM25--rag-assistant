I would strongly recommended here to use a logistic regression and simply control for age by adding it as a covariate: $logit(Conversion_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Webpage_i + \beta_2 Age_i + \epsilon_i$ There are certainly other ways to control for a confounding variable, like matching, which is closer to what you are trying to do (note that you would have to account for the matched observations, for example with a paired test), but this will discard many observations and is not needed in this simple case. You are implicitly making the assumption that age is the only (observed) confounder. If you have more information about users that could confound your true relationship or explain some variation, you should also include them in your model. The high sensitivity of the result to the random seed, and thus to the choice of which individuals exactly are sampled from the age classes, indicates that there is a lot of variation within age groups.
