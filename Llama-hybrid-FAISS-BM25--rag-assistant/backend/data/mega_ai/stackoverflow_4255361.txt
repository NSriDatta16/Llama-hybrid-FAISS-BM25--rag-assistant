Here's an approach. Write an "agent" in Python. The agent is installed on the various computers. It does whatever processing your need locally. It uses urllib2 to make RESTful HTTP requests of the server. It either posts data or requests work to do or whatever is supposed to go on. Write a "server" in Python. The server is installed on one computer. This is written using wsgiref and is a simple WSGI-based server that serves requests from the various agents scattered around campus. While this requires agent installation, it's very, very simple. It can be made very, very secure (use HTTP Digest Authentication). And the agent's privileges define the level of vulnerability. If the agent is running in an account with relatively few privileges, it's quite safe. The agent shouldn't run as root and the agent's account should not be allowed to su or sudo .
