Is logistic regression a "semi-parametric" model?

I recently see a term "semi-parametric" in the answers of my question but not really understand what is this term means. Wikipedia says In statistics, a semiparametric model is a statistical model that has parametric and nonparametric components. And gives Cox proportional hazards model as an example. I see Cox proportional hazards model and logistic regression are very similar, why we say one is semi-parametric but not say another? BTW I found this answer , says GLM is not a semi-parametric model.
