It sounds like you have a data schema that is GREAT for storage but terrible for selecting/reporting. When you have a data structure of OBJECT, ATTRIBUTE, OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE and OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-VALUE you can store many objects with many different attributes per object. This is sometime referred to as "Vertical Storage". However, when you want to retrieve a list of objects with all of their attributes values, it is an variable number of joins you have to make. It is much easier to retrieve data when it is stored horizonatally (Defined columns of data) I have run into this scenario several times. Since you cannot change the existing data structure. My suggest would be to write a "layer" of tables on top. Dynamically create a table for each object/product you have. Then dynamically create static columns in those new tables for each attribute. Pretty much you need to "flatten" your vertically stored attribute/values into static columns. Convert from a vertical architecture into a horizontal ones. Use the "flattened" tables for reporting, and use the vertical tables for storage. If you need sample code or more details, just ask me. I hope this is clear.
