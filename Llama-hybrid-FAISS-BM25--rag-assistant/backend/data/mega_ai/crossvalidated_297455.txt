There are several works where 1D Convolutions are applied in a similar way. E.g. Effective Use of Word Order for Text Categorization with Convolutional Neural Networks R. Johnson, T. Zhang https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1058.pdf If this approach could make sense or sense, depends on your data. You should use a proper filter size for your convolutions. The same is for the pooling, you have to find the setup which best fit you data. For instance, an image from an oscilloscope instead of an array containing the values the signal takes for each instant of time. Since you have a time series problem, why don't you try a RNN based approach?
