he top two teams in the second round then fight in a final round to declare the tournament winners. In the final round, the rules are modified: The first team to score two cashouts wins, regardless of kills or objectives done. During Season 2, there was also a single-round variant of Cashout. World Tour Debuted on June 13, 2024, with Season 3, World Tour is a competitive mode consisting of weekly rotating Cashout Tournaments with occasionally changing variations of the standard ranked rules. Players are ranked on a leaderboard based on their cash earned, while Win Points given based on tournament placement are used to progress a special World Tour badge and gain additional rewards at the end of the season. Unlike ranked mode, players cannot lose Win Points or cash. While World Tour features the same format as Ranked Tournaments, featuring 4 teams of 3 in each round, the rules are slightly more relaxed, allowing for temporary in-game events like Mega Damage and Low Gravity, and allowing players to swap items from their reserve loadout between respawns. At the end of the first two rounds, the two teams among the four with lowest cash will be eliminated from the match. At the end of the final (third) round, the first team who gets 50,000$ cash out will become the winner. Different amount of win points will be granted after each match ends based on when they are eliminated from the match and whether they have win the final round. Contestants eliminated from the first round will get 2 win points, and 6 win points for the second round. 14 win points will be earned for losing the final (third) round, and 25 if you have won it and become the tournament winner. Ranked Tournament Ranked Tournament is a competitive mode following standard Cashout rules, except that players may not change their loadouts after death, and may only access their reserved items between rounds. As players participate in tournaments, they increase their ranking through various leagues, ranging from Bronze to Diamond. The five-hundred highest-ranked players at the end of the season are given a special "Ruby" rank. Players earn or lose rank points depending on the combined skill of the enemy teams, the expected outcome of the match as a result, and the team's final placement when they are eliminated or win. Originally, The Finals featured both Ranked and Unranked Tournaments, but the Unranked variation was removed in Season 2. In Season 3, the Cashout ranked tournament was temporarily replaced with World Tour to allow the developers to experiment with balancing changes, before it would be reintroduced alongside World Tour in the next season. Quick Cash In this quick-play variation of the Cashout game mode, three teams of three compete against one another to earn money. The ultimate winner of the round is the first team to complete two cashouts (the cash goal is $20,000, and each cashout is worth $10,000). Kills, assists, and deaths do not count towards a team's score. Bank It (Removed Indefinitely) A second game mode, Bank It, focuses more on player vs. player combat and individual play. Scattered around the map are various caches filled with coins, which four teams of three compete to collect. Currency is held by players on their person but is dropped upon their death. Additionally, any time a player is eliminated, they drop additional currency even if they held none. This currency can be turned in at temporary deposits that appear on the map periodically, forcing teams to occasionally congregate in the same place to secure their earned money. The first team to bank $40,000 in currency wins. Solo Bank It (Temporary Gamemode) Bank It also had a temporary "solo" gamemode, where twelve players compete individually in a free-for-all format rather than in teams. Power Shift Added in Season 2, Power Shift is a 5v5 "King of the Hill" mode where teams fight for control of a floating platform that continuously moves throughout the map, with both teams trying to push the p
