How do I get the touch location of a different view?

Touch may specify self to get the touch location in its own coordinate system but how do i get it from another? Say another UIview's coordinate system? - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [UIView beginAnimations:@"box" context:nil]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:1]; [UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentState:YES]; UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; box.center = [touch locationInView:self]; [UIView commitAnimations]; } Could I but in the name of a different UIview where 'self' is?
