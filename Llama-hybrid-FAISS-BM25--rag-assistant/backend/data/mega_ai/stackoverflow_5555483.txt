Take a look at sessionStorage, which works similarly to localStorage but doesn't keep any data once a tab/window/browser is closed. This would also be more secure than localStorage as no data would be kept once a session has ended. There is more details on security in the W3 Storage spec . However if you're storing sensitive data I'd recommend cookies as data in sessionStorage and localStorage can be viewed and edited by the user and is potentially open to XSS attacks.
