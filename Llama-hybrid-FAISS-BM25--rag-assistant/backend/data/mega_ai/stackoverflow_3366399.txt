How do you organize methods and properties within a class?

Say you're declaring a class with all the bells and whistles - constructor and destructor, public, private, protected and static methods and properties, magic methods, etc. How do you organize all this logically? For instance, do you group things by visibility? Do you alphabetize method names? Do you group magic methods together? Do you put the constructor at the beginning and the destructor at the end? Obviously this is subjective, but I'm curious to hear what has worked for others, or what you find easy to navigate when reading others' code.
