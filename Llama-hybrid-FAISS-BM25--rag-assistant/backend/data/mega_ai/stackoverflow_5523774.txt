I tend to really dislike re-inventing the wheel. In the case of storage space optimization people way smarter than me figured out solutions already. I'd prefer, when possible to leverage the hard work of these really smart people. With that said I might consider looking into storing my files in a revision control system such as Mercurial or Git,once I understand how they store binary data. Once you figure out which one you want to use you can look at ways of creating some stored functions most likely in pl/perl or one similar that can interact with the version control system and bridge the gap between your relation data in PostgreSQL and the binary files. My only issue with this approach is that I don't really like that I took a transactional system and have introduced an outside system(Mercurial/Git) into it. And on top of that a backup of the database won't backup my Mercurial or Git repository. But there will always be a trade off so just figure out which ones you can live with.
