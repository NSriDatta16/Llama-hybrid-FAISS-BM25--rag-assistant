Conditions for validity of a robust-error-variance Poisson regression

A variant of a Poisson regression called the "robust-error-variance Poisson regression" is an approach adapted for binary data, specially as an alternative to the logistic regression. What are the conditions of validity that are needed to apply a "robust error variance Poisson regression"? Or in other words, are there any number of assumptions that must be met before doing such a model?
