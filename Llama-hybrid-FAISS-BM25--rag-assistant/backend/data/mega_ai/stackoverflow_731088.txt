Using the Netbeans 6.5 profiler to profile a remote web app?

I'm having trouble using the Netbeans 6.5 profiler to profile the memory usage of a java web app, remotely. I have followed the steps in the tutorial , and was able to customize a Tomcat instance to start with the profiling agents. I can also attach the Netbeans profiler to the running server: for some seconds, the profiler shows graphs with the memory usage of the server. However, I am not able to run my deployed web app. After a few seconds, the server is shut down gracefully as if it simply had reached the bottom of its method main (hardly the expected behavior of a web server). During these seconds, the server is not responsible, and I can't connect to a web application in it, they are simply not deployed. I do not want to import my app into a new Netbeans project just for profiling it. It's possible to profile a remote app without access to its source, right ? After all, for a few seconds, the server was running and being profiled. I want to profile a web application in Netbeans 6.5. What did I forget ?
