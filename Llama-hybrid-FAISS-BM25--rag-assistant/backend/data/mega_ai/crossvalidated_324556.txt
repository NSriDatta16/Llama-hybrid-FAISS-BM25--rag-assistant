Am I wrong to say that the OLS model is fine? I'd say no, you're not wrong, but it does depend on what you mean by "fine." An economist introduced me to the book "A Guide to Econometrics" by Peter Kennedy, which is a really nice book for telling you what happens when classical assumptions are violated but you use the classical technique anyways. Usually the sky does not fall, but you do lose something. In the case of regression with autocorrelated errors, Section 7.4 states: "With positive first-order autocorrelated errors this implies that several succeeding error terms are likely also to be positive, and once the error term becomes negative it is likely to remain negative for a while...In repeated samples these estimates will average out, since we are as likely to start with a negative error as with a positive one, leaving the OLS estimator unbiased, but the high variation in these estimates will cause the variance of [the OLS estimator] to be greater than it would have been had the errors been distributed randomly." Additionally, it goes on to mention that the variance of beta_OLS is also underestimated, which of course will mess up your test statistics. But you still have unbiasedness!
