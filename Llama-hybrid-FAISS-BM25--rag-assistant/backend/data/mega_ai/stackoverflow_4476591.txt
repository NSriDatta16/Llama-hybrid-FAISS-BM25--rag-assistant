jQuery UI Sortable: dragged element disappears

I set the .sortable() , and there are some elements in the container. When I drag the inner element, intend to sort the element with the others, once the dragged one out the container, it can not be seen . But when I drop it into place holder, it could be seen again. Online case is here . Anyone have met the problem before? Or anyone can help me with the problem? Thank you
