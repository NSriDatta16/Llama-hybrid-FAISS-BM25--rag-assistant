The problem is probably not that you don't have the memory "available", but more likely that you've fragmented the memory so much that when you try to add an item to the list, and it must be resized, no single block of available memory can hold it. This will also lead to OutOfMemoryException. How big is the list, in other words, how many strings do you have in it, exactly or roughly, when you get the exception? And how are you populating the list? Do you know in advance the number of items you're going to add? And if so, do you specify the capacity when you construct the list? If you don't know, would it be possible to figure that out, so you could specify that capacity?
