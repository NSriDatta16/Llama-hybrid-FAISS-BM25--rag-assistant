This is a round about way to do it, but you can use the MSBuild task as part of an msbuild project: built with msbuild projectname .proj from the command line. This may seem like overkill, but you can then add extra stuff into the project (like restarting websites, zipping files, Virtual machine control even!, code coverage) that can help you setup and test the project.
