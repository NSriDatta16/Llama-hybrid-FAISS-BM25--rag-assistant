There isn't a single/central validation code for user's input in Drupal. Each form as it own validations handlers, search for _validate in the Drupal API . In addition, there is some re-usable validation functions such as valid_url() and valid_email_address() . Drupal also encourage output sanitization with functions such as t() , check_plain() or filter_xss() . Drupal discourage bad-practive regarding SQL injection by favoring placeholders in query string, see db_query() .
