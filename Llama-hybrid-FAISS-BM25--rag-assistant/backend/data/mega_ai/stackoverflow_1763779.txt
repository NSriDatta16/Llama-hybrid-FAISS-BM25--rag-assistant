Making a smooth path from an irregular number of x,y points to simulate handwriting

I am trying to make a 'brush' tool in AS3 (pure, not Flex) which simulates handwriting, making strokes to be smooth instead of cornered. Then, the trace must be reduced to cubic bezier curves which can be dragged and deformed, affecting the previously drawn path (like the illustrator's pen tool). I'm tracking the mouse movement to get a set of points to draw the path. As far as I know, I need to do a B-Spline path using that set of points. Then I should reduce it to cubic bezier curves (adding the the 'pen tool' functionality to the path). I have already developed the pen tool, using an algorithm which reduces Cubic Beziers to Quadratic Beziers (and then using the Flash curveTo function). But I have no idea how to create a B-Spline (or another simplification), an then reduce it to Bezier curves. Do you know any way to accomplish this?
