The class IndexOutOfBoundsException has appeared more than once in the (implicit) imports. You'll need to reorganize the imports to be more specific (i.e. don't use import com.sun.star.lang.* but import com.sun.star.lang.SomeClassName , if you're using an IDE like Eclipse, it can do that automatically for you), or to use the full qualified class name instead. I.e. including the package, e.g. throws java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException instead of throws IndexOutOfBoundsException That said, imports on com.sun.* or sun.* are considered bad practice since those are undocumented Sun classes which are subject for changes and would not work on non-Sun JVM's. Even Sun itself recommends to not import/use those classes in your own code.
