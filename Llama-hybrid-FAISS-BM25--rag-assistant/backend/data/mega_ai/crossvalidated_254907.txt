Bayesian lighthouse location estimation

I am trying to learn Stan in R and as a fun challenge I am trying to estimate the location of a lighthouse based on the observed flashes. But the models I tried do not converge (Rhat != 1) or have estimated parameters with a large spread. The observed data are flashes from a lighthouse 100 meters away the (straight) coast line. The angle is uniformly distributed, but the observed flashes along the coast line are heavy tailed. n_flashes I want to estimate the lighthouse location by given the actual model generation process to stan. This is my stan model: data { int N; real flashes[N]; } parameters { real x_loc; real y_loc; real angle[N]; } model { x_loc ~ normal(0, 10); y_loc ~ normal(100, 10); for (i in 1:N) { flashes[i] ~ cauchy(x_loc + tan(angle[i]) * y_loc, 1); } } (Note: I model the flash observation with a 1 meter standard deviation, because Stan requires me to give a distribution for flashes[i]). Then I call the model from R: n_flashes But this model has large Rhat 's. How can I improve this model to prevent this? How can I model the angles in stan? How would you model the location of a lighthouse based on the flashes observed along the coast line?
