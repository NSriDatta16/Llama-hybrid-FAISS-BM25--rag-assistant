Sounds like you're not copying the framework into your app. You can verify this by selecting "Show Package Contents" from the app's context menu in the Finder and look if the framework is in the app (under Contents/Frameworks). If not, you need to add a "Copy Files" build phase to your target. Bring up the inspector for the build phase in Xcode, select "Frameworks" as the destination, then drag your framework into the build phase.
