A simple small shell script to compute averages

Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong here? #!/bin/sh if [ $# = 0 ] then echo "Usage: $0 " exit 1 fi sum=0 count=0 while [ $0 != 0 ] do sum="$sum"+"$2" count="$count"+ 1 done if [ "$count" != 0 ] then avg="$sum"/"$count" printf "Sum= $sum \n Count= $count \n Avg= $avg" exit 0 else printf "Sum= $sum \n Count= $count \n Avg= undefined" exit 0 fi exit 1 Here's the output when I try to test the code: ./average sum: =: No such file or directory sum: 0: No such file or directory ./average: 11: count: not found [: 18: !=0: unexpected operator ./average: 25: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string Basically if I had a file that looked something like this: FirstPerson 23 SecondPerson 36 ThirdPerson 22 I want to be able to read that into my program and have it output: Sum = FirstPerson+SecondPerson+ThirdPerson Count = NumberofPeople Average = Sum/Count
