Error when fitting ARIMA model in R

I am trying to fit ARIMA model on a monthly data. I checked for stationarity, it was not stationarity so I tried to difference, but this is the error message I got: >Error in `if (k missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed Here is my code >>>>>>>>> #...create a monthly time series data atm.ts Then the error message comes up.
