Well, you have unit testing, the precise definition of which varies, but certainly contain all those tests defined with a JUnit-like tool and organised in the same way as the source code. If for any source code file, you can find one and only one test, then the thing you found is a unit test. And then there is system testing, which tests the complete system in as close as possible a way to a customer will see it. Any testing that lives in the gap between those two things is an integration test - neither isomorphic with the source code nor representative of an end user experience. That's a pretty big gap between two categories that themselves vary a lot in practise. That gap can contain a lot of potentially useful tests, but the nature of those tests will naturally vary pretty dramatically.
