An OutOfMemoryException is more likely to indicate fragmentation in your page file - not that you are out of RAM or disk space. It is generally (wrongly) assumed that the page file is used as a swap disk - that RAM overflow is written to the page file. All allocated memory is stored in the page file and only data that is under heavy usage is copied to RAM. There's no simple code fix to this problem other than trying to reduce the memory footprint of your application. But if you really get desperate you can always try PageDefrag , which is a free application originally developed by SysInternals.
