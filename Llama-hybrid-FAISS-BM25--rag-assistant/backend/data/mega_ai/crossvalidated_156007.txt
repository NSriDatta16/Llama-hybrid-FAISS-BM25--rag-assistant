Correcting for family-wise error rate with series of repeated measures ANOVA?

I am trying to make requested revisions to an accepted manuscript, and I am baffled by the following comment from a reviewer: "Eight hypothesis tests are reported in the final paragraph of the results section but the authors do not say if they corrected for their Type I familywise error rate. What correction was done or should be done?" To give background, I had a pre- and post-test design, and change was assessed on eight different (theoretically distinct) variables. So, basically, I conducted eight separate repeated measures ANOVAs. I can understand that Type I error rate would be inflated from doing multiple tests, but I have not come across any correction for use with a series of RM ANOVA. Is there a standard procedure or recommended correction?
