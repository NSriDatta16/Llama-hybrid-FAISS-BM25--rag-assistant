Problems with zero values when testing for linearity of the logit

From Field's 'Discovering Statistics using SPSS' I read that you should test for linearity of the logit when using a logistic regression. The process explained in the book covers the natural log transformation of the continous, independent variables, then introducing new interaction variables between independent variables and their log transformation and lastly checking for the significance of the new variables. Unfortunately, there's nothing mentioned how to handle the case when you have zero values for some variables and you cant calculate the ln of 0. Anybody knows how to proceed in this case?
