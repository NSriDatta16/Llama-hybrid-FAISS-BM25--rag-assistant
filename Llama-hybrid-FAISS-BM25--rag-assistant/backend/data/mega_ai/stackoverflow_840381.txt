This would be a dup of What is a bus error? , if it weren't for the Can it happen that a program gives a seg fault and stops for the first time and for the second time it may give a bus error and exit ? part of the question. You should be able to answer this for yourself with the information found here. Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. -- Albert Einstein Of course, taking the question literally... #include #include #include #include int main() { srand(time(NULL)); if (rand() % 2) kill(getpid(), SIGBUS); else kill(getpid(), SIGSEGV); return 0; } Tada, a program that can exit with a segmentation fault on one run and exit with a bus error on another run.
