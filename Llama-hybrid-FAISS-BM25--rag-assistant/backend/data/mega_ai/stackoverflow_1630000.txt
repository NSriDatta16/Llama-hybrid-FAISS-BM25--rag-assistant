Besides of other more procedural approaches, Hoare logic was in the basis of Design by Contract , introduced as an object oriented technique by Bertrand Meyer in Eiffel ( see Meyer's article of 1992 , page 4). While Design by Contract is not the same as formal verification methods (for one thing, DbC doesn't prove anything until the software is executed), in my opinion it provides a more practical use.
