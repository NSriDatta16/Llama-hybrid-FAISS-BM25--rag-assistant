Cross-Validation, how to actually implement the concept

I have 100 samples from a normal distribution with variance equal to 1, and mean equal to 0. I have selected 90 samples randomly out of the 100 and i have estimated their mean (the average of the 90 samples), based on the assumption that the variance is the same as that of the original sample. My question is, how do I compute the likelihood of the remaining 10 samples under the fit? Do I have to estimate the mean of the remaining 10 and compare it with the mean of the selected 90? I have just started studying statistics and would appreciate any inputs.
