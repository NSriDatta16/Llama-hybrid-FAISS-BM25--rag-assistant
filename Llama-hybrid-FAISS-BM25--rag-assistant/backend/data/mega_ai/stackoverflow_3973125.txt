Plug ins are falling out of fashion in the Rails world lately because they are harder to maintain, I guess or because they are considered a less elegant solution. Besides, you can use Bundler in a 2.2 project (I have experience doing it with a 2.3 and 2.2 should be the same, right?). You only need to set up an initializer in your config/initializers folder: http://docs.heroku.com/bundler#using-bundler-from-rails-23x
