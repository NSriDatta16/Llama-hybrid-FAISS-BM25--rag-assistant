I would suggest you use Python with Ski-Image for Image Related operation. For Machine Learning typically for Deep Learning, you should use Keras with theano/Tensorflow backend with GPU capabilities whichever suits you. In order to generate masked images, you should use data augmentation. Data Augmentation Documentation for Keras
