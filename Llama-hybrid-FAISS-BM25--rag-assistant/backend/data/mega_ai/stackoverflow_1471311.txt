malloc and operator new will give you a chunk of address space . The operating system will back this chunk of address space with some physical storage. The storage could be system memory or a chunk of a page file and the actual storage location can be moved between between the various physical storage devices and this is handled transparently from the application point of view. In addition the CPU and memory controller (on board or otherwise) may cache system memory but this is usually (largely) transparent to the operating system.
