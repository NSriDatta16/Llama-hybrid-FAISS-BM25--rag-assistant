The "most important" principal component is usually considered to be the one with the largest eigenvalue. If your package works in the usual way this should be the first principal component, PC1. To see how important each component is, divide the eigenvalues by the number of variables you are decomposing. This tells you the percent of the variation in the data "explained" by each component. How many components you use is ultimately up to you, though you may want to look at this paper . EDIT To find the most important variables in terms of their contributions to the principal component, you will indeed have to look at loadings. Loadings are the projections of the principal components onto your variables. A particularly high (or particularly low) loading for a specific variable means that principal component is intimately related to the variable. My experience with PCA is mostly from stock returns, where we think of high loadings as representing some exposure for a company from an underlying risk. In this setting, high loadings mean lots of exposure. Here you could think of them as some common subject matter across papers, and the loading is how much that paper fits into that subject (or depending on how your data is organized how much the keyword fits into that subject). So it absolutely makes sense to look at those variables which contribute most to your principal component, and to find them in terms of the absolute value of their loadings - as the meaning of a principle component is ultimately unclear.
