regression coefficient on sum of regressors

Say I have the true linear model with normal errors: $y = \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon$ However, I only observe $Z = X_1 + X_2$, so I estimate instead: $y = \delta (X_1 + X_2) + e$, can I express $\delta$ in terms of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ (and perhaps $X_1$ and $X_2$)? Observably when I generate data and estimate the results $\delta$ seems to be the average of the coefficients weighted by the variance of the regressors, but I can't seem to derive a solution. Incorporating hints: Thanks for the hints, which are helpful. Here is an attempt -- although I feel I haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet: $y = a(X_1 + X_2) + b(X_1 - X_2) + \epsilon$ (thanks @whuber!) $y = aX_1 + aX_2 + bX_1 - bX_2 + \epsilon$, $y = (a + b)X_1 + (a - b)X_2 + \epsilon$, therefore $\beta_1 = (a+b)$ and $\beta_2 = (a - b)$. Solving for $a$ and $b$ we get: $a = (\beta_1 + \beta_2)/2$ and $b = (\beta_1 - \beta_2)/2$ Effectively I am estimating $a$ while omitting $b$, so $y = a(X_1 + X_2) + u,$ $u = b(X_1 - X_2) + \epsilon$, therefore my estimate of $\delta$ above will be the estimate of $a$ with omitted variable bias. Calling $X_1 + X_2 = Z$, my estimate of $\hat{\delta}$ is therefore: $\hat{\delta} = (Z'Z)^{-1}(Z'[Za + (X_1 - X_2)b + \epsilon])$ Ignoring $\epsilon$ as it disappears in expectation, I get $\hat{\delta} = a + (Z'Z)^{-1}(Z'(X_1 - X_2))b$ $\hat{\delta} = \frac{\beta_1 + \beta_2}{2} + (Z'Z)^{-1}Z'[X_1 - X_2] \frac{\beta_1 - \beta_2}{2}$ Does this look on the right track? Can we reduce the trailing second expression? I was thinking that since the expression $(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'[X_1 - X_2]$ looks like a regression of $X_1 - X_2$ on $Z$, I could perhaps re-write it as $Var(X_1 + X_2)^{-1}Cov(X_1 + X_2, X_1 - X_2) = Var(X_1+X_2)^{-1}(Var(X_1) - Var(X_2))$?
