I tried the following code and it worked as expected: Prova if (!localStorage["stor"] ) { localStorage["stor"] = JSON.stringify([]); } var aa = JSON.parse( localStorage["stor"] ) ; console.log( aa ) ; aa.push( [ 1 , 2, 2 ] ) ; localStorage["stor"] = JSON.stringify( aa ) ; I am trying, man It seems it has something to do with Prototype library, which I am using. Have a look at this: JSON.stringify() array bizarreness with Prototype.js I still haven't worked out a solution, but I believe I on the right path.
