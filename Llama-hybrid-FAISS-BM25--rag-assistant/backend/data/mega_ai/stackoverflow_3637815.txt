I'll preface this by saying I'm a .net developer so the following might be heretical. It sounds like your company already has a significant investment in java. People, software licenses, and code base. If my company (or group) was primarily java and we were successful in meeting business demands, then quite frankly there would be no way I'd switch. The only way I'd consider switching technology stacks is if the stack we were on was truly dead. Meaning that it was very difficult to find programmers for, it could no longer meet business needs, we had a high number of failed projects, and/or the language itself was no longer evolving. Switching just because someone prefers one language over another is non-starter and ultimately wouldn't make any business sense. The very act of a change like that will mean that the company is going to lose those people who are still committed to the old stack. Replacing people is extremely expensive just in terms of knowledge lost. Another thing, if you don't already know what the hard reasons are for switching platforms then you shouldn't even try to encourage it. Take the accountants point of view, what really would this provide?
