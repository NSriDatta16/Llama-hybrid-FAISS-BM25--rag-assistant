Low MSE loss for object detection but really bad results

I am training object detection using CNN I am using MSE as loss functions, at best it throws loss around 1800 on testing and 1850 on training data, Which in my opinion is quite acceptable, considering that if the bounding box is "dislocated" by 20px on every axis, its already 1600 ( before mean ). However, when the network on the exact data i have trained it on, it result in extremely wrong results, almost like random no way it has around 1800 mean difference. What would general approach be for dealing with things like this? Thanks for help.
