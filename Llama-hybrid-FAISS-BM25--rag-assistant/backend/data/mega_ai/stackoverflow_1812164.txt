You've certainly eliminated a lot of the usual methods of persisting data between pages. Other than queryString parameters, there are also hidden form values (Adam's example) and cookies which are also accessible from the Request object. If the data is relatively small and not particularly sensitive, you could write it to a cookie on the user's machine. Alternately, you'd need some sort of persistence mechanism to hold the data. You could write the information to a file on the web server. The obvious downside is that you need to have more complex logic to ensure that data from each user is kept separate, you'd essentially need to create your own session management logic. The other option that comes to mind would be persisting the information to a database. Unless you need to store and manage a whole bunch of complex data, this really isn't a viable options in most cases. It also comes with most of the same pitfalls as the file storage mechanism.
