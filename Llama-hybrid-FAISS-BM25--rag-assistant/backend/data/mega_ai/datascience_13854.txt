Why Logistic regression into Spark Mllib does not use Maximum likelihood estimation?

During comparison estimates/ coefficients in 'R'& Spark Mllib of Logistic regression, It has been observed that estimates are not same. On further investigation, I found that R & Mllib has different implementations for Logistic regression. R's glm is return a maximum likelihood estimate of the model while Spark's LogisticRegressionWithLBFGS is return a regularized model estimate. Maximum likelihood estimates seems more efficient, as per literature available. I am curious to know, why Spark Mllib developers has not chosen 'Maximum likelihood estimation' technique?
