You can mark the field as obsolete so that the compiler will generate a warning if you try to access it, and then suppress that warning for the property getter/setter. The warning codes that you'd need to suppress are CS0612 for the plain Obsolete attribute and CS0618 if the attribute has a custom message . In general I'd consider this a bit of a hack and try to avoid it if possible. A better solution would be to comment the code appropriately and train your fellow developers so that they'll do the right thing. [Obsolete("Please use the EyeOrientation property instead.")] private int _eyeOrientation; public int EyeOrientation { #pragma warning disable 612, 618 get { return _eyeOrientation; } set { _eyeOrientation = (value > 0) ? value % 360 : 0; } #pragma warning restore 612, 618 }
