I think - as with so many things - it's a combination of a widespread cultural misunderstanding and journalistic attempts at punchy shorthand that turns out to sometimes mislead. " Cell phones cause cancer! " sells more ads than some explanation about investigating a possible link. Of course conclusions based on statistical inference isn't proof in any kind of hard sense. It's reliant on assumptions, and even then conclusions (at best) are probabilistic (as we get, say with Bayesian inference), and then with frequentist inference you have to add in the usual error of misinterpretation of p-values as the probability that the null is true. That's without even considering issues like publication or reporting bias You see similar errors just as much with science reporting more generally and it's just as frustrating . I don't like the phrase 'statistically proven' myself, as I think it gives the wrong impression. While statistics done well is a powerful tool, the things statistics actually tells us can be surprisingly subtle and the appropriate discussion of the meaning of what is learned and the accompanying qualifications placed on the conclusions are often unsuited to the hype and punchiness of a headline or a hurried few paragraphs squeezed in between the usual celeb gossip. Indeed, even in the academic journals where those sort of qualifications would seem essential, they are often left aside and instead there appears some formulaic pronouncement (different from research area to research area) that is regarded as 'anointing' the result. I think there is room for carefully explaining the reasoning going from the results of inference (whether point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, decision-theoretic calculations or even exploratory construction of a few visual comparisons) to the conclusions they lead to. That reasoning is where the real heart of the matter lies (including where the gaps in reasoning would be laid bare, were they explicit) and we rarely see it laid out. Besides that, we can keep sounding a note of caution
