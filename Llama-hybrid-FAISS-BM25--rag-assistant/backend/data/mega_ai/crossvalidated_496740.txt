The OP has explained in comments that they by error used the R glm function, but forgot to specify the argument family=binomial , that is, used the default gaussian family (with identity link.) But that is the usual (least squares) linear regression, not logistic regression, and clearly can give predictions outside the interval $(0,1)$ .
