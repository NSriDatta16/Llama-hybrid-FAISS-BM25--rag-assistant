How to merge multiple ControlCollections in C#?

Is there an elegant way of doing this? Perhaps with Linq? For something like this: List list = { ... } List merged = list.MergeAll(); EDIT: The final collection will be single dimensional in a sense that all controls will be there, not in a nested way.
