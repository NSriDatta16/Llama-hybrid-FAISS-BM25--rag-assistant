You cannot do this with Greasemonkey, because GM cannot manipulate chrome elements enough to set focus to the address bar. You cannot do this with Adblock for the same reason, and because Adblock just stops external elements from loading. None of the FF scripting add-ons could do this either, as far as I can tell. You could write an extension/add-on to reset focus, but the real problem here is that the user is ignoring the tools in place for the job. As Scott Cranfill said, use Ctrl T to open a new tab. If a button is absolutely desired, Firefox already provides one. Do this: In the Firefox menu, select View --> Toolbars --> Customize... . Find the "New Tab" icon and drag it to your toolbar. Click that icon, from now on, when you want a new blank tab. Done!
