Does Normalized Estimation Error Squared (NEES) and Normalized Innovation Error Squared (NIS) Only Apply to Kalman Filtering?

Regarding the NEES and NIS metrics, do they only apply to Kalman Filtering? Or can I use them for any estimator that outputs a prediction and has a covariance matrix? I have never seen NEES applied to any other model, but I want to use it for proving consistency for a Gaussian Process Regression Model. Using the equations for NEES and NIS from the paper Weak in the NEES?: Auto-tuning Kalman Filters with Bayesian Optimization . NEES: $$ \epsilon_{x,k} = e_{x,k}^{\top}P_{k,k}^{-1}e_{x,k} $$ NIS: $$ \epsilon_{z,k} = e_{z,k}^{\top}S_{k,k}^{-1}e_{z,k} $$ where $P$ is the covariance matrix and $S$ is the innovation covariance.
