Given loads of data, can we always model it with polynomials?

Given Taylor series and enough data so as to not risk over-fitting, do you actually need to think about if your phenomenon is following an exponential, quadratic, logarithmic, ..., behaviour? I'm sure you can come up with counter-examples of when this isn't a good idea, but if we're very general and pragmatic, is it usually 'fine' to just fit the data to some degree nine polynomial hoping whatever bizzare pattern is hiding in the data will be very well approximated by its power series?
