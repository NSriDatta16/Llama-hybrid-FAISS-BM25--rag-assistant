Span inside Anchor with event bubbling

I have such a piece of html: Something something INSIDE SPAN something To handle AJAX request when clicking on anchor I have registered handler on click event: $('.addToFriends a').click(function(event){ var target = $(event.target); if (target.is('a')) { // if I click on SPAN element following fragment won't execute! // do ajax request } event.preventDefault(); }); My questions are: why click event is raised for span element? After all, I didn't bind click event to SPAN elements apart from previous question, I thought that if I won't handle SPAN click event, browser will use event-bubbling to raise click event for anchor (if I won't call event.stopPropagation()). But I also didn't work out for me as that click event is raised only once So now, I got round that problem I my solution is: $('.addToFriends a').click(function(event){ var target = $(event.target); if (!target.is('a')) { target = target.parent('a') } ... }); But still, I'm curious why it works like this... Thanks, Pawe≈Ç
