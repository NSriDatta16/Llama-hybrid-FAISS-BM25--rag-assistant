Measuring effectiveness of debt reminders

I am working for a bank that reminds its customers that they owe money back periodically starting from 3 days before their credit deadline, on the day of the deadline, 3 days after the deadline, a week after the deadline, etc. The reminders are text messages and voice calls. I have to check how effective the each text message and call is. I have all the possible data. There is no alternative group (customers that do not get reminders). What is the best methodology for this project? I was thinking on doing an interrupted time series, however there are would be too many interruptions, as there are many events taking place. Any input will be of help.
