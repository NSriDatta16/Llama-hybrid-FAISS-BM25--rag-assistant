Detect rapid increase in time series

I have a short time series of daily counts ( 6 days = 6 counts : 12, 15, 69, 35, 97, 107). This looks like a rapid increase from its initial count of 12. What are some of the statistical techniques to detect such large increases in short time period? "rapid increases" and "short time period" are rather loose terms, but, I am looking for techniques where these can be 'parameters' that I can provide. For example, "short period" could be 5 days. 'Rapid increase' could be 20% increase day-to-day or 90% increase in 5 days...something like that. Suggestions are appreciated.
