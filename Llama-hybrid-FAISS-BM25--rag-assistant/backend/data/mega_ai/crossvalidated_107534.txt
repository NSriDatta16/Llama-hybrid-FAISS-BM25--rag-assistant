It seems that you are not completely aware of what an SVD does. As you wrote, it decomposes a matrix $\mathbf A$ according to $$\mathbf A = \mathbf U \mathbf S \mathbf V^T,$$ Read the details on the involved matrix dimensions and properties for example here . Now, dimensionality reduction is done by neglecting small singular values in the diagonal matrix $\mathbf S$. Regardless of how many singular values you approximately set to zero, the resulting matrix $\mathbf A$ always retains its original dimension. In particular, you don't drop any rows or columns. Consequently, the feature of dimensionality reduction is only exploited in the decomposed version. Consider for example a very large matrix with rank 1, that is, the column/row-vectors span only a one-dimensional subspace. For this matrix, you will obtain only one non-zero singular value. Now, instead of storing this large matrix one can also store two vectors and one real number, which corresponds to a reduction by one order of magnitude.
