You have to be aware, that on average only exp(-1) * original_number_of_trees are used for the out-of-bag estimation of each observation, so you are evaluating a forest with less trees, which usually provide worse results than a forest with all trees (e.g. in cross_validation). You can avoid this by training a forest with more trees (e.g. multiplicate the number of wished trees by 1/exp(-1)) On the other hand it is more similar to leave-one-out than to e.g. 5-fold-CV, because on the OOB trees all observations except of the evaluated one are used.
