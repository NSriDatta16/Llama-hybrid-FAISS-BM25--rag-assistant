Dustin Bachrach posted an elegant (but incomplete) solution here It needs a bit of apple script, so you would have to create a different script for each mail app you want to support, but it seems like an easy thing to do. You would also need to find the users default mail app which can be done by constructing a mailto: url then use LaunchServices LSGetApplicationForURL(): to return the default email client.
