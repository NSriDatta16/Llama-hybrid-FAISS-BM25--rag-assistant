Based on the description and additional info in the comments, I would suggest two possible approaches: Conditional random field , which is a structured prediction model that takes into account dependencies between predictions. The sequential case admits an efficient solution, however here since all data points depend on each other some adaptation and heuristics would be required (I think). Explore existing work on deep learning on graphs , as this is a problem with a simple complete graph.
