Edit: I was answering a different question apparently, I'll leave the original here because the theory remains somewhat relevant. To start with a bit of entry-level jargon: an outcome that can take a binary outcome (true/false, yes/no, helpful/unhelpful, ..) with probability $p$ is called a Bernoulli variable, and repeating $n$ independent Bernoulli experiments with common $p$ is described through the binomial distribution (of which Bernoulli is a special case). The binomial distribution will allow you to calculate, for a fixed number of total draws $n$ , what the probability is of seeing any number of blue balls $x$ . There is a closely related negative binomial distribution that allows you to calculate the probability of having to make any number of $n$ draws before you see a fixed number of $x$ blue balls. It sounds like you want to use the ratio $\frac{x}{n}$ rather than fixing either $x$ or $n$ however, and there a beta distribution might be useful. Briefly, $B(\alpha, \beta)$ can express the probability mass of this ratio for $\alpha=x$ 'successes' (let's assume these are un helpful posts) and $\beta=n-x$ 'failures'. There's one caveat that you need both $\alpha>0$ and $\beta>0$ , so for conditions that didn't occur yet you could use a small positive value like $0.001$ . One point I want to make here is that you usually wouldn't start looking at this ratio immediately, it's not because someone makes their first post a bad one that they should instantly be removed from the system, right? The same is true for the other designs but I hope you wouldn't look for just a single $n$ or unhelpful post $x$ either. You can calculate all of these quantities through various statistical softwares and calculators, I can give some examples in R, assuming $p=0.05$ : what is the probability of seeing at least 4 unhelpful posts out of the first 20? pbinom(x = 3, size = 20, p = 0.05, lower.tail = FALSE) $\approx 0.0159$ , under our assumption that 5% of posts are unhelpful on average this person is not doing great. what is the probability of someone making 10 posts or less before seeing a first unhelpful one? pnbinom(x = 10, size = 1, p = 0.05) $\approx 0.432$ , not unlikely but worse than average. someone has made 14 posts, 3 of which are bad. What is the probability that their value for $p$ is $\le 0.05$ ? pbeta(0.05, 3, 11) $\approx 0.0245$ , not that much evidence that this person makes as many helpful posts as we assumed. Update Apparently you are looking for only the last $n$ (5 in the question) draws out of which a specified $x$ (3) are unhelpful, sort of like a running average of Bernoulli experiments. To my knowledge this has no known distribution (see also for example here ), but Monte Carlo sampling is definitely a valid way of getting some empirical probabilities here. I considered calculating the probability for each given $p$ to produce (at least?) 3 out of 5 unhelpful posts, which itself is a binomial experiment you can do with the above formulae. You could then use the negative binomial (or geometric) distribution to predict the number of 5-posts until failure given that previous probability, but this does not take into account the moving window which introduces all sorts of edge cases and I can't really get it to match the expectations from the simulation results.
