Weighted Average and Ratings

Maths isn't my strong point and I'm at a loss here. Basically, all I need is a simple formula that will give a weighted rating on a scale of 1 to 5. If there are very few votes, they carry less influence and the rating pressess more towards the average (in this case I want it to be 3, not the average of all other ratings). I've tried a few different bayesian implementations but these haven't worked out. I believe the graphical representation I am looking for could be shown as: ___ / ___/ Cheers
