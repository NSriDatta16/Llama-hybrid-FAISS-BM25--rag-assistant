Look at it another way: Why are you putting String/Number/UI formatting methods in your FileSystemSize method? While it can be used in respect of files, this is a general piece of functionality that IMHO should be found elsewhere in a well organised library - just as Path functions are not part of the File or Directory classes in .net, I would put the "format a number" methods in a string or maths utils class. Separate the responsibilities of your objects and you may find there is no need to mix static and non-static members in cases like this.
