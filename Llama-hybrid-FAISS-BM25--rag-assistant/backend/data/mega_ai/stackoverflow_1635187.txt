Excel AVERAGEIF with TODAY() function as criteria

I have values in column c that i want averaged if they occurred in the last seven days (corresponding dates in column a). i can't get the averageif function to work properly, as I need each individual piece of data to be evaluated separately if it falls within the last seven days. this seems like a function that would be used all the time, but i googled for 45 minutes and couldn't find anything.
