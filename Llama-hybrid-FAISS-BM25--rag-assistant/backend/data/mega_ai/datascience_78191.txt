Which algorithm to use for transactional data

I'm given a Dataset of transactions and asked to find insights for businesses. I'm extremely new to ML / Data science and have only been experiencing with KMeans. The dataset has the following features merchant ID Transaction date Military time Amount card amount paid merchant name Town area code client ID age band gender code province average income 3 months card value spending card tapped Ignoring NULL data, what type of analysis can I do on this data? I have done KMeans on if a customer will spend excessive amount (more than median amount).
