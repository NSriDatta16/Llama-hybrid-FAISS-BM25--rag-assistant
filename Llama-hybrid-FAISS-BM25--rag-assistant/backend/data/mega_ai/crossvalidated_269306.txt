Understanding NIPALS algorithm for PLS

I've found a nice presentation describing PLS1 and PLS2 algorithms (pages 16-19). It's pretty clear but there is a thing confusing me. For PLS1. Let's look at the algorithm . The first steps are $w = X'y$ (which maximizes $\operatorname{cov}(Xw,y)$) $w = w / ||w||$ $t = Xw$ $p = X't / t't$ On the one hand one can say $T=XW$ and $WW'=I$, but on the other hand $T=XP$ and $PP'=I$ (because we are searching for a decomposition $X=TP'$ where $PP'=I$, see page 14). So, my question is, aren't $P$ and $W$ the same matrix? And if so, why does the algorithm need to calculate $p$ as $X't / t't$? Why not do it this way: $p = X'y$ $p = p / ||p||$ $t = Xp$ UPDATE After reading provided comments, answers, and links (thanks to @amoeba and @theGD), I get that a strict answer to my question is "No, they are not.". I almost understood why. Actually, I lost my hope to fully understand NIPALS algorthm principle. So, I decided to ask it in a differernt way: What is mathematicial task PLS NIPALS tries to solve? For example, there is NIPALS for PCA as well. And I don't understand it fully too. But I know that it's just a computational method for solving a mathimaticial task (for one iteration): $$ {\mathbf {t}}^{T}{\mathbf {t}} = {\mathbf {w}}^{T}{\mathbf {X}}^{T}{\mathbf {Xw}} \rightarrow \max, \textrm{ given that } \Vert {\mathbf {w}}\Vert =1 $$ So, what is analogous mathematical task for PLS?
