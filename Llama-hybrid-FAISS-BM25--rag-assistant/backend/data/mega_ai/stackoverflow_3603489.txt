So I want to create a browser-based interactive realtime animation of the Earth and the other planets going around the Sun...where do I start?

I would like to create a browser based, interactive, realtime animation, showing the Earth as it goes around the sun, depending on the time of day and time of year. This animation should also (eventually) show the other planets in the solar system and the user should be able to pan around the solar system and see it from different sides (by click-drag, scroll etc.). I wouldn't think it has any real practical application, but I like the artistic value found in the universe...so it would be interesting to start doing it and I'll probably learn a few things while doing this. I don't have any experience with planetary physics, although I'd probably understand it if given a good source of information. I do have some experience with web development, with languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python. Now, questions: Most importantly, how would I begin a project such as this? Where do I get the information about the rotation of the Earth and the other planets in the solar system? What languages should I use/learn? What other thoughts do you have about this idea? What functionality do you think would be interesting for a project such as this? This idea is very much impulse driven, especially at this late hour of the day...as I'm looking out the window and seeing the buildings getting darker and darker, I'm also imagining how the Earth is slowly spinning around itself and also around the Sun and I think it would be a very nice sight to be able to see this from an outside perspective. Hope to get some feedback. Cheers!
