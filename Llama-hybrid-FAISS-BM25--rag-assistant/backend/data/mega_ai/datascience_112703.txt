How to give label to synthetic data

I am doing some research. I have created a dataset with 4 features using a uniform distribution. I think it is a right way to do it but I am not sure. I have done sum the features values/numbers of features, That's my actual probability for a sample. Then gave it to Bernollie distribution and get a class label. There is more randomness. I have also tried, like if the actual probability > 0.50 then it labels 1 else 0. But there is no randomness. I am wondering if there is another way to do it. It would be also helpful if anybody can draw my attention to some literature or some Methods. I need to have the Probability of the sample so I can compare it with the output of ML framework. Thank you in advance.
