What is an elegant solution to the namespace vs classname clash problem?

One of the things that annoys me a lot about .NET is the fact that name-spaces are supposed to be Pascal cased which opens to the possibility of name-space/class-name clashes. Consider the following: namespace MyCompany.MyProduct.SalesOrder { public class SalesOrder { } } This is perfectly valid code, however consumers of SalesOrder as a class must now use the fully qualified name of MyCompany.MyProduct.SalesOrder.SalesOrder otherwise compiling causes the annoying 'MyCompany.MyProduct.SalesOrder' is a 'namespace' but is used like a 'type' error. What are others doing to get around this? Some places I see others just go against the rule and use lower-case packages, this does appeal to me but I do like to conform to the standard and use proper casing. In my usage so-far I have subscribed to the notion of plural based name-space names where possible, however this sometimes just looks ugly. My personal opinion is that .NET has got it wrong and should be using lower-cased name-spaces just like Java's packages.
