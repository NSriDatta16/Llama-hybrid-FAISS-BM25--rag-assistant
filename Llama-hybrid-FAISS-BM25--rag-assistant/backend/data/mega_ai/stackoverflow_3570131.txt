Optimize APC Caching

here is a link to how my APC is running : [removed] As you can see, it fills up pretty quickly and my Cache Full Count goes over 1000 sometimes My website uses Wordpress. I notice that every time I make a new post or edit a post, 2 things happen. 1) APC Memory "USED" resets 2) I get a whole lot of Fragments I've tried giving more Memory to APC (512 mb) but then it crashes sometimes, it seems 384 is best. I also have a Cron job that restarts apache, clearing all APC of fragments and used memory, every 4 hours. Again, my apache crashes if APC is running for a long period of time, I think due to the fragment buildup. Should I use the apc.Filters and filter out some stuff that should not be cached? I am really beginner at this sort of stuff, so if someone can explain with full instructions, Thank you very much !!!
