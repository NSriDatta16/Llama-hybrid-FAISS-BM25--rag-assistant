I typically use the R package 'vegan', and the function rda() to run PCA. You can extract the PC scores (where the languages fall on the PC axes) pretty simply from that output using scores(), selecting specific PC axes (in your case, just the first two), and then calculate all pairwise distances using the dist() function in the base packages of R. Below is a worked example - the following example code uses a sample dataset from 'vegan'. The dataset (dune) is a community ecology dataset. Typically you wouldn't use PCA for that (use other ordinations instead), but it works to demonstrate. Naturally, the help files for rda(), dist(), and scores() might be helpful, but this code should get you started. (tested in R version 3.0.2, and vegan package version 2.0-9) #The following code assumes the columns represent the variables [i.e., measures of languages for you, but vegan uses the terminology "species" as it was written for community ecology datasets] and the rows represent observations [i.e., individual languages for you, or "sites" as vegan calls them]. library(vegan) #load necessary package data(dune) #call data file pca.dune With the final (PC) distance matrix, I think you should be able to line it up with your geographic distance matrix to run further analyses. I hope that helps!
