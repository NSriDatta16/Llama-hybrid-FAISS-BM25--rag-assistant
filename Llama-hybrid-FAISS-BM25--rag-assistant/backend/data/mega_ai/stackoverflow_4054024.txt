Take a look at GitBenchmarks page on Git wiki, the section "Repository size benchmarks" and "Other benchmarks and references" (taking into account when the benchmark was made, and what versions it uses), in particular the entry at the end page: DVCS Round-up: One System to Rule Them All? -- Part 3 by Robert Fendt on Linux Developer Network, from 27-01-2009, contains results of two synthetic benchmarks testing how a system acts under stress (number of commits in repository, or number of files comitted). The test system was a VM running Ubuntu 8.10, and the software versions used were SVK 2.0.2 (last is 2.2.3), darcs 2.1.0 (last is 2.4.4), monotone 0.42 (last is 0.48), Bazaar 1.10 (last is 2.2.1 ), Mercurial 1.1.2 (last is 1.6.4), and Git 1.6.1 (last is 1.7.3).
