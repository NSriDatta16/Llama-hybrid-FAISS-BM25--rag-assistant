If you're willing to assign a prior Beta distribution on $p_1$ and $p_2$, you could do a Bayesian analysis. The model would be \begin{align} p_1&\sim \operatorname{Beta}(\alpha_1,\beta_1) \\ p_2&\sim \operatorname{Beta}(\alpha_2,\beta_2) \\ y_1&\sim \operatorname{Bin}(p_1,n_1) \\ y_2&\sim \operatorname{Bin}(p_2,n_2) \end{align} Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are your hyperparameters for $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively. Here is the example done in R and JAGS. This code can easily be extended to include different $n$. A solution based on conjugacy is presented below. library(rjags) library(R2jags) library(runjags) library(hdrcde) ## The model cat(" model{ for(i in 1:N) { y1[i] ~ dbin(p1, n1) y2[i] ~ dbin(p2, n2) } p1 ~ dbeta(500, 500) p2 ~ dbeta(300, 500) delta The delta is the difference between the proportions. The 95% credible interval for the difference is $(0.09; 0.15)$. This does not include $0$ so we have evidence that there is a true difference between proportions. We can also plot the posterior of delta : jagsfit.mcmc Solution based on conjugacy As I explain here , the posterior of $p_1$ and $p_2$ are also Beta distributions if the priors are Beta distributions. Specifically, the posterior distributions are: \begin{align} p_{1}^{\star}&\sim \operatorname{Beta}(\alpha_1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{1,i},\beta_1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}N_{1,i} - \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{1,i}) \\ p_2^{\star}&\sim \operatorname{Beta}(\alpha_2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{2,i},\beta_2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}N_{2,i} - \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{2,i}) \end{align} Where $x_{1,i}$ and $x_{2,i}$ denote the number of successes for group 1 and 2. $N_{1,i}$ and $N_{2,i}$ denote the sample sizes for group 1 and 2. The solution in R is: alpha1 The 95% credible interval is nearly identical with the one produced with JAGS.
