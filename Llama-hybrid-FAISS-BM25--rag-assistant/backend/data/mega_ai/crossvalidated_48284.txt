R may be of little use to you due to the complexity of your problem. We recently developed forecasts for a daily series that looks "similar" but "different" to yours. . It required combining Intervention Detection , Causal Variables (Holidays , Promotions etc.) and ARIMA structure. We used AUTOBOX ( a product that I have helped develop ) to do this. You can post your data on the board and I will post some results. This is indeed one of the most challenging time series that we have seen ..... and we have been looking for a long time ! It might be interesting to see how other thought leaders would analyze these data and compare the results. EDITED After receiving the data from the OP Data like this requires incorporation of Fixed Events i.e. Monthly/Daily/Holidays along with specially formed days-of-year where significant activity can be detected around the event. The OP posted data and asked for forecasts 60 periods precisely prior to the Super Bowl. He delivered 1827 daily values starting at 1/1/12008. There were three origins for the forecast. Only data up to the point of the origin was used to develop the model/parameters. The three origins were 12/9/2010 (1074 values used), 12/8/2011 (1438 values used) and 12/5/2012(1801 values used). The three Actual-Fit-Forecast Graphs are presented here.First with 1065 values Then with 1438 values and finally using all the data (1801 values) The complete analyses can be found at http://www.autobox.com/1074.zip http://www.autobox.com/1438.zip http://www.autobox.com/1801.zip Each file contains an xls/xlsx file containing the 60 forecasts and other files showing all the analysis. Each equation is different because the number of observations used to identify the model changed. Following is the equation used from period 12/5/2012 to predict the 60 days leading up to Super Bowl Sunday. The equation uses daily indicators reflecting the buildup before Super Bowl Sunday M_SB is a 0/1 variable denoting the day for the Super Bowl , while M_1DB through M_22DB are the days before Super Bowl Sunday and M_1DA through M_3DA are for the days after Super Bowl. In addition there significant responses around 4 other holidays. Jan and Feb have a significant impact along with 6 daily indicators (N10107 through N10607). A significant ARIMA structure was found to round out the model.
