You seem to have 40 predictor variables of the same type, all measuring duration of listening. Maybe these would be similar for similar musical genres ... indicating that the 40 variables do not give 40 independent pieces of information. I think this is a good case for using regression on principal components. So start with a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) of your prediction variables, and use a few of the most important PCs as predictors. The PCA of the predictors by itself could also give useful information. Some similar maybe relevant questions: Logistic PCA and the train/test split Relationship between "Logistic regression + L1 regularization" and PCA Averaging Likert Scales and PCA
