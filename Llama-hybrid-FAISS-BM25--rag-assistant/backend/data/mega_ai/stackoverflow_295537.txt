As far as I can see, your code is full of let statements. I'm not familiar with F# but did do some Haskell. The functional paradigm means not thinking about "how" but about "what": you think Fifo, but you should actually just specify the semantics of the moving average. -- the limited average of a list limitedaverage 0 _ = 0 limited verage n (x:xs) = (x/n) + ( limited average (n-1) xs ) -- a list, transformed into a sequence of moving averages of movingaverages n [] = [] movingaverages n (x:xs) = ( movingaverage n (x:xs) : movingaverages n xs )
