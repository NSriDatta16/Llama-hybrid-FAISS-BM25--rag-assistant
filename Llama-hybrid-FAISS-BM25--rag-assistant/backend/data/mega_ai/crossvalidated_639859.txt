XGBoost original paper equation simplification

In the original XGboost paper ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754 ), in section 3.3, the authors simplified equation 3: To: Shouldn't this be a positive sign with the target being -g/h? Wikipedia shows the same equation in the algorithm section: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost but states target to be -g/h.
