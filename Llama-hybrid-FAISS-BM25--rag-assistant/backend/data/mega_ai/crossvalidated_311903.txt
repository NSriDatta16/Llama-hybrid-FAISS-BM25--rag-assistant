Questions on SVM - Coordinate Ascent and Support Vectors

I was reading up on the dual formulation of SVMs and have some questions to ask. https://github.com/epfml/ML_course/blob/master/lectures/07/lecture07a_svm.pdf 1) Why is it easy to optimize via coordinate ascent ? Is it because $\alpha$ is bounded between [0,1] ? If it is not because of its range of [0,1], then what about logistic regression ? Why does no one talk about coordinate descent for logistic regression ? Can alpha only be 0 or 1 ? Can it take any other values in between ? 2) From the diagram and also point no. 2, $\alpha_2 \subset (0,1) $. When would it be zero and when would it be 1 ? If it lies exactly on the margin then wouldn't that make $\max_{\alpha}\alpha_2[1 - y_2f_2] = 0 $ since it is correctly classified ? i.e. $f_2 = 1$
