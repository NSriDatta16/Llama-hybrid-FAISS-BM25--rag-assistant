Seems like you are looking for the same stuff i googled a few months back :D... I'm running a php/zend based project with Solr (via php-solr-client lib), and so far I havent found anything in php for advanced NLP. For basic stuff, as everyone mentions, you can get away with Solr (stemming, tag clouds / phrase tag clouds, tokenizing, etc), and there are a few basic but useful text processing php libraries out there (nothing fancy really, better rely on Solr itself)... but if you are looking for more algorithmic/semantic/sentiment NLP analysis I suggest you move a bit from PHP and get into Java, as there are more libraries that can help you in this area(such as OpenNLP). In case te adavanced stuff is what you are looking for, you probably might want to take a look at Mahout: http://www.lucidimagination.com/blog/2010/03/16/integrating-apache-mahout-with-apache-lucene-and-solr-part-i-of-3/
