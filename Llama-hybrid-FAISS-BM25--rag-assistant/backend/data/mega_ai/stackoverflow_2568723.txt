At first I wondered why the OP hadn't already marked one of the responses as the answer, but after trying it myself and still have it not work, I dug a little deeper and found there's much more to this issue then I'd first supposed. A better understanding can be gained by reading from a similar question: Why won't control update/refresh mid-process Lastly, for the record, I was able to get my label to update by doing the following: private void SetStatus(string status) { lblStatus.Text = status; lblStatus.Invalidate(); lblStatus.Update(); lblStatus.Refresh(); Application.DoEvents(); } Though from what I understand this is far from an elegant and correct approach to doing it. It's a hack that may or may not work depending upon how busy the thread is.
