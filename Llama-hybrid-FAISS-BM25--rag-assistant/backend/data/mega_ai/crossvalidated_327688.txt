Since your smallest sample size for a group is 30, you can probably just use ANOVA first to establish there is a difference in average score between classes, as your unequal sample size is not a huge departure from the model assumptions. Once you have this, you can conduct pair-wise t-test between classes, adjusted for multiple comparison (Tukey, Bonferonni, etc). If you want to be really rigorous, you can conduct the nonparametric "ANOVA" -- Kruskal-wallis test, followed by pair-wise rank-sum test between classes, adjusting for multiple comparison.
