why nobody uses matlab

I wonder why most people now don't use matlab. I guess the reason is matlab is not free, so companies don't want to use it, then interviewees don't use it, then schools don't encourage it, then nobody ends up using it. But I like it, compared to C++, Python, for it's convenient to plot figures without needing to import any libraries or header files, let alone those powerful ODE solvers. I might be wrong on any of the above points, as I'm not most familiar with other languages. Any comments?
