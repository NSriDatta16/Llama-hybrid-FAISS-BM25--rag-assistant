Can I consider interaction effect between two principal components?

I ran a PCA on five variable and got PC1, PC2 as the main axes. Then I want to run a GLMM with binomial distribution to see how these two PCs influence the response variable. My question is if I can put PC1:PC2 (because I think there should be a influence of PC2 on the relationship between PC1 and response variable) in the model? The current result (when putting PC1:PC2 in the model) shows a significance of interaction.
