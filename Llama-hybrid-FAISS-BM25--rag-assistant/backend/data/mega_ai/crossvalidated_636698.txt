Risks involved in using Linear Regression model when the residuals are autocorrelated

I am working on building a model which contains time series input variables. I build the data around a Linear Regression model and found that the residuals are autocorrelated. Promptly shifted to using a ARIMA model after some research. My question is what is the risk involved here. As for the comparison done on a set of data the outputs are pretty much similar between both the models
