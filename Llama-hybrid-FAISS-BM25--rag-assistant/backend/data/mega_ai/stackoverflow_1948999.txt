search canadian province

I have an input search on the site and I want to search in the database (MySQL) after province name. In database I have just the provinces initials - ex: QC for Quebec, AB - Alberta, etc. The people can introduce into the input search field: QC or PC or Province du Québec or Province Quebec or Quebec or Québec (capital letters or not) (of course - this is just for one of the province, but are more :) ) What kind of SQL statment I can use or how can I solve my problem? Thanks
