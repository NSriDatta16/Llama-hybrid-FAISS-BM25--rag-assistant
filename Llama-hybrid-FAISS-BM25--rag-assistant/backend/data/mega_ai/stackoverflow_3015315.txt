When NGEN is used to pre-JIT assemblies, it is done in such a way that if the same assembly is loaded into multiple processes the executable code can be shared between them (otherwise each process has to have a copy of both the original IL and the JIT-compiled code). Most (all?) of the base libraries in the framework are NGEN compiled when the framework is installed partly for this reason (also to decrease the initial startup time of .NET applications) Rico is the undisputed expert on this: Link Furthermore many of those pages can be shared across processes so we like to encourage putting sharable code into ngen’d images – jitted code can’t be shared.
