Magento: using getModel to get product and category

I have some code that returns an array of product details including a url_path. To create a link to this product I have to know the category and subcategory of the product. Unfortunately out all the data this method returns neither the category or sub category are pulled out. Here is the code I have that gets a product: $product_id = array(231, 230,229,228); foreach ($product_id as $id){ $productDetails = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load($id)->getData(); echo $productDetails['url_path'].' '; } Is it possible to get the category and subcategory for each product?
