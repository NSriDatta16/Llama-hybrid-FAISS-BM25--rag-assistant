Using MEF to handle authoerization/user-access w/ the Navigation Framework

I think im starting to understand how to use MEF now. But im still not sure what the best way of utilizing MEF in order to handle controlling user access. For example: Im using the silverlight navigation framework. And each navigation menu item is to be either disabled or not shown at all if a particular user has rights (i.e. roles, claims) for it. Now I know that I could set the IsEnabled attributes to disable them, but im hoping for a more elegant/flexible approach. To sum this up: - Each menu item needs to be a MEF module extension (so it wouldnt even be download for users with no access to it).
