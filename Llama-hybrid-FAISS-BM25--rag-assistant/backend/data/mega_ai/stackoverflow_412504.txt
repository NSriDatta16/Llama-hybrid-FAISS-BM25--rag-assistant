The command in the original question can be better written as, grep -RHi "string" I use grep -R quite frequently. Of course, the find command can be used for fine-tuning the files to search. I often use the -00 flag to perl to print "paragraph" mode. perl -wnl -00 -e '/something:/ and print;' Change a string to something else, inline, while making backup copies of the original file(s) (from Minimal Perl): perl -s -i.bak -wpl 's/old_string/new_string/g;' *.txt I like side-by-side diffs: sdiff -s file1 file2 Or syntax-highlighted diffs: diff file1 file2 | vim - # or mate - on my Mac I went looking through my history a bit to see if there were other commands, but sadly(??) most of my system maintenance, administration and programming is done through automated tools, lately all written in Ruby (puppet, capistrano, some home-rolled tools, etc), or are related to SCM (git, svn).
