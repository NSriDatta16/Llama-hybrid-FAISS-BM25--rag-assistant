There are design patterns that solve such design issues where code duplication is major concern. The pattern applicable to your scenario is template method design pattern from Gang Of Four pattern catalog. You are in the right direction - please refer to http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternTemplate.aspx for details on the design pattern. Most modern day frameworks provide utility wrappers and template methods for operations like database handling - you can use Spring.NET that provides such methods. You can have a look at this link http://www.springframework.net/docs/1.3.0/reference/html/ado.html for example of template method to use ADO.NET API in Spring .NET
