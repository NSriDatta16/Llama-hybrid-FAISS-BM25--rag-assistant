I think that Ordinal Logistic Regression is fine for your problem. A logistic regression model can be used to describe the average effect of independent variables (a.k.a. explanatory variables) on a binary dependent variable (i.e., the response). Although it cannot be used for non-binary problems, it can still be adopted when the dependent variable is ordinal, in the sense that its values follow some order and assuming that the difference between each value is equal, for example, Low-Medium-High, where the difference between Low and Medium is considered the same as Medium and High on that scale. Therefore, ordinal logistic regression can be used to predict an ordinal dependent variable given one or more independent variables for a non-binary problem.
