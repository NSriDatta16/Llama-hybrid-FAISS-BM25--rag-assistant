Alternatives to MAP estimator

Given some data $y$, dependent on parameter $\theta$, I have some density $p(\theta | y)$. I now want to infer what value of $\theta$ is most `likely' to have originated $y$. One possibility of doing this is calculating the MAP estimate of $\theta$. However, I was wondering if there are other ways of finding candidates for $\theta$, preferably in a Bayesian setting?
