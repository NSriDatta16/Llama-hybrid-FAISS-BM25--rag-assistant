How to structure some data in database for easy retrieval later

I have a set of checkboxes that an Admin can tick to give users privleges. In my case, the Admin can click these checkboxes: Image on ImageShack . These checkboxes will allow users to view data for those countries/cities. http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/4170/screenshotao.png I am trying to rack my brains to do the folowing: 1) How to best insert this permissions into my database 2) How to later work out what permissions each user is allowed At the moment, I am thinking of just adding lots of columns for each checkbox into my db and put a 1 or 0 there. Then check these using lots of if functions!! This is going to be a time waster when coding. Is there anything else I can do? I appreciate any help!
