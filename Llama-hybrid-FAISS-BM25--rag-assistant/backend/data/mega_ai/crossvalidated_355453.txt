For one thing, "Bayesian" doesn't only apply to supervised learning. Any time there is a hypothesis test in frequentist statistics, there can be a Bayesian approach. Also, I would say that Bayesianism is more than just choosing a model and then updating it, although it depends on what you mean by "choosing a model". In a Bayesian approach you choose a prior probability. So, for instance, saying "let's use linear regression" could be regarded as "choosing a model". To make it Bayesian, you'd have to add a prior.
