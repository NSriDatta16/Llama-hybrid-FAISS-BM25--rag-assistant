what does p( y | μ,σ²) really mean?

Just started to study Bayesian Statistics. I am very confused the concept of having a conditional probability on a distribution. Specifically: I understand what p( A | B ) where A="I am sick" and B = "Took a flu shot" means. (probability that I am sick, given that I am from the probability of the population that took a flue shot) But what does p( y | μ,σ²) mean? Can an example be provided? (Just the term "y given a normal distribution" won't help me understand it - I am too stupid for that :) )
