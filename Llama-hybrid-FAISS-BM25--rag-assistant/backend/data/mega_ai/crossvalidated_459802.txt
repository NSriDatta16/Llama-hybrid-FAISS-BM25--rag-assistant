I want to know whether the data I have is showing seasonality or not

I am analyzing weekly data on call money market returns over the period of 12 years on R. I made a time series plot of the data and wanted to know whether this data shows seasonality or not. I tried removing seasonality assuming it exists by decomposing and subtracting the seasonal part and also with the seasadj command in R. But the model suggested by auto.arima() includes a seasonal component as well and I'm confused as to how this can happen if I've already adjusted for seasonality. Thanks
