My first thought would be you came across a phenomenon called correlation bias. This means if two features are highly collinear, their weights will be underestimated in a logistic regression model learning process. I am not super familiar with this phenomenon, so I cannot answer in detail at this moment. I hope my comments poke a helpful direction for you to investigate further. Thanks!
