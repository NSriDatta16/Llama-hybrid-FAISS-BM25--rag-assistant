Tip screen at startup that can be disabled

I am planning on creating a tip page that pops up with directions on how to use the app, and can be turned off with a checkbox. I imagine that in order to save the state of the checkbox's selection, I need top store it as a boolean somewhere on the system. Would this be done in something like a txt file stored locally using IsolatedStorage? Or is there a better way to do this?
