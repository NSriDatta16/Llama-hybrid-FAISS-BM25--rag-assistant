Boosting up till date is the most powerful way of combining CARTs. If by some way you think a model is only an estimate and should have a standard error, then model averaging is a good idea. Note that you can always fit the training data as much as you want (over-fitting). And you will never judge a model on how it fits the training. Therefore cross-validation bootstrapping and other out sample techniques are the only way to access the predictive performance of a model. The performance measure use in assessing a model also plays an important rule. Predictive power is not often used, as power usually refers to hypothesis testing. Predictive performance is a better term to use.
