There's two ways of doing it. The old-school "select an option and submit to rebuild the page" method, which works pretty much universally, and the newfangled AJAX methods, to load the second dropdown's contents without refreshing the page. Both have advantages/disadvantages, so it boils down to what's best for your purposes. The oldschool method doesn't require any javascript at all, but since it does round-trip the form through the server, you'll get the "clear the window and then redraw the page" flickering. The AJAX method bypasses the refresh flicker, but also would no work on Javascript-disabled browsers. It does require a little bit more code, client-side, to handle the AJAX calls and population of the dropdown, but the server-side code would be pretty much the same for both methods: same queries, same retrieval loops, just different output methods.
