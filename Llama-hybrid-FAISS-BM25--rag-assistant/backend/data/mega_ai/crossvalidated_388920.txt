The problem doesn't come from the same means. If there is only two classes,the linear SVM will help you to separate the data in classes thanks to a straight line (2 dimensions/variables) / a plane (in 3D) On your example, an SVM can't classify your data because it can't be separated by a straight line. BUT you can create more data with simple math that will allow you to use the SVM. On this example, addidng a third variable : x3 = x1*x2 will create a third dimension, where a straight plane can divide your data into two classes. A whole part of machine learning is the creation of features , it can be more important than the actual model.
