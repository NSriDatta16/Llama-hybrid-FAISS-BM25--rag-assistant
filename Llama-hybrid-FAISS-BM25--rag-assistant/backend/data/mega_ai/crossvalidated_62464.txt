This is a habit that stems from linear regression, where this sequence of models can be interpreted as ways of estimating indirect effects. Unfortunately this trick does not generalize to non-linear models, like logistic regression (e.g. Buis 2010). Still the habit persists, as you have observed. Unless you are interested in direct an indirect effects, I would just avoid all the complexities involved with comparing non-linear models and just report one model. If direct and indirect effects are of interest then you can choose between different methods, some references are given below: M.L. Buis (2010). Direct and indirect effects in a logit model.
