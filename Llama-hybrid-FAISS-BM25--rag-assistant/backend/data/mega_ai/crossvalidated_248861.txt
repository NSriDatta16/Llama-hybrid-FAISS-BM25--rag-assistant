Means, CI's and post-hoc testing from posterior densities

I have generated posterior distributions of several estimates by combining a series of chains from Bayesian regression models. Specifically, they are merged chains from MCMCglmm models. These models are of the form y ~ a + b + c , where a and b are factors with multiple levels, and c is a continuous variable. From these posterior distributions I can calculate the estimate (mean) and its confidence interval. For the continuous variable this is sufficient. However, for the factors I would like to know the predicted mean and CI for each of the factor levels. Ideally, I would also like to test which levels are different from each other. Example code in R: library(MCMCglmm) m Can one use d to: calculate the means of each level of cyl and vs ? test whether the different levels of cyl differ significantly from each other? (I mainly interested in knowing if and how I can do this in a statistical sense. R code would be appreciated, but it is not the focus of my question.)
