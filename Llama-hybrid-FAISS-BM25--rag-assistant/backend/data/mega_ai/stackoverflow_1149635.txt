How can I enforce an specific direction (i.e. clockwise) of rotation in Core Animation?

I am rotating a view with this: CGAffineTransform rotatedTransform = CGAffineTransformRotate(CGAffineTransformIdentity, rotationValue); I have an object which I want to spin around for about 320 degrees. Now Core Animation is clever and just rotates it as much as needed, doing that by rotating it with -40 degrees. So the object rotates the other way around with a shorter amount of movement. I want to constrain it to rotate clockwise. Would I have to do that by changing animations in little steps, or is there an more elegant way?
