Usage of rightscale init script in it's EC2 Centos 5.4 AMI

I was searching for EC2 EBS storage Centos 5.4 AMI in the community AMI and eventually I found Rightscale AMI (I think they called it RightImage). Now I have created instance using that AMI, but I found out there is some Rightscale stuff inside which is worrying me about the safety on using it. I found out there are the following files in that AMI: /etc/init.d/rightimage /etc/init.d/rightlink /etc/init.d/rightscale /home/ec2 /home/s3sync (may be more other files I haven't found out yet) I know I can look into the script and folder and see what they do, but since a lot of user here recommended using Rightscale Centos AMI in EC2, I hope may be there is already some gurus here know what those mentioned script and folder doing and could advice me i)whether is it safe to delete them. (I'm more concern on whether my data in the server will be safe by using this AMI) ii)any installed apps in RightScale AMI that should be deleted And if you think there is other free EC2 Centos AMI that is secure and solid, do suggest as well, thanks !
