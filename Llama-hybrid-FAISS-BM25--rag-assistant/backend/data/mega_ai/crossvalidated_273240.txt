Cancelling out norms of a vector

I was going through the derivation of the geometric margin for an SVM and I was confused about one step. We have $w^T(x^{(i)} - \gamma^{(i)}\frac{w}{\|w\|}) + b = 0$ We then solve for $\gamma$ $\gamma^{(i)} = \frac{w^Tx^{(i)}+b}{\|w\|}$. But I didn't understand how the $\frac{\|w\|}{w}$ became $\frac{1}{\|w\|}$. I know $\|w\| = \sqrt{w^Tw}$, but I don't see that could cancel with $w$ in any way.
