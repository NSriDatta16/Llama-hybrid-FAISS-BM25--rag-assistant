I'm wondering if this is being overthought a little. Can you not simply map the type as a property? public class DataTypeMap : ClassMap { public DataTypeMap() { // ... Map(x => x.TypeOfContent); } } In sqlite at least this will map to a TEXT column which will store the AssemblyQualifiedName. The relevant hbm.xml is here: The additional question of how to elegantly map the default value is also of interest to me. In sqlite at least there is no 'strong-typing' of a column (I am probably using the wrong terminology, see the link) so at the database level at least it should be possible to simply have an object DefaultValue and persist/depersist without loss of precision. However, it remains an open question as to how to create a mapping for this that NHibernate will understand .
