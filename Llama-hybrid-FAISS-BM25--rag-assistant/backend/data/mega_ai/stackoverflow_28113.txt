The iterative algorithm for Fibonacci, because for me it nailed down the fact that the most elegant code (in this case, the recursive version) is not necessarily the most efficient. The iterative method, (curr = prev1 + prev2 in a forloop) does not tree out this way, nor does it take as much memory since it's only 3 transient variables, instead of n frames in the recursion stack. You know that fibonacci has a closed form solution that allows direct computation of the result in a fixed number of steps, right? Namely, (phi n - (1 - phi) n ) / sqrt(5). It always strikes me as somewhat remarkable that this should yield an integer, but it does. phi is the golden ratio, of course; (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2.
