One possible reason why its not working is that your file-casing isn't exactly the same. In UNIX, file paths are case-sensitive. This is not the case in WIN. So, if you are including ../myFile.php , your file must be name myFile.php , not myfile.php . Also, include are always including files according to the current path . Consider these two files. /home/xxx/public_html/first.php /home/xxx/public_html/dir/second.php When running first.php , the second file will include /home/xxx/public_html/third.php . When running dir/second.php directly, it will include /home/xxx/public_html/dir/third.php . If your include must always be relative to the current file, use the following: include(dirname(__FILE__) . '/third.php'); Using the above code fragment, dir/second.php will always include /home/xxx/public_html/dir/third.php regardless of the current directory.
