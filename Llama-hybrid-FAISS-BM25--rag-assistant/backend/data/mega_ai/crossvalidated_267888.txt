Post hoc Chi square non significant

I am interested to see if there is any relationship between eye color and whether someone is a vegan or not. The data is as follows: Vegan Non vegan Blue 29 23 Green 15 32 Brown 3 9 I ran a Chi-squared test of association and the result is significant. Pearson's Chi-squared test data: vegan X-squared = 7.4115, df = 2, p-value = 0.02458 However, when I ran the post-hoc of this, it turns out the p-values are not significant. Adjusted p-values used the bonferroni method. comparison raw.p adj.p 1 Blue vs. Green 0.0255 0.0766 2 Blue vs. Brown 0.1069 0.3206 3 Green vs. Brown 0.7388 1.0000 What does this mean? If I look at the counts and expected counts of each group, I can see that people who are vegan tend to have blue eyes, and non-vegan tend to have green eyes. R code you can try: library(fifer) vegan
