How can I ban a whole company from my web site?

For reasons I won't go into, I wish to ban an entire company from accessing my web site. Checking the remote hostname in php using gethostbyaddr() works, but this slows down the page load too much. Large organizations (eg. hp.com or microsoft.com) often have blocks of IP addresses. Is there anyway I get the full list, or am I stuck with the slow reverse-DNS lookup? If so, can I speed it up? Edit: Okay, now I know I can use the .htaccess file to ban a range. Now, how can I figure out what that range should be for a given organization?
