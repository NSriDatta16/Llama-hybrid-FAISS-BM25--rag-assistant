No clue what your bug is (I dislike Java :) The simple solution ( O(n) average, O(n^2) worst case) to this problem is copy the source to a nice simple implementation of qsort and make it only recurse on the side that contains the position you care about. It should be about 5 lines of code different so it should be easy to do. If i is small there is a O(n + log(n)*i*log(i)) solution): int FindI(int[] array, int i) { int[] tmp = array[0..i].dup; // copy first i elements; sort(tmp); // sort, low to high foreach(j in array[i..$]) // loop over the rest if(j
