The long and the short of it is that probability is the unique generalization of ordinary true/false logic to degrees of belief between 0 and 1. This is the so-called logical Bayesian interpretation of probability, originated by R.T. Cox and later championed by E.T. Jaynes. Furthermore under weak assumptions it can be shown that the right way to order uncertain outcomes by preference is to order them by expected utility, with the expected taken with respect to the probability distribution over outcomes. See Robert Clemen, "Making Hard Decisions", for an introduction and exposition on applied decision analysis which is based on Bayesian probability and expected utility. You are absolutely right to be skeptical about conventional frequentist statistics; by the design of its inventors (R.A. Fisher, J. Neyman, E. Pearson) it is limited to repetitive events. But many everyday problems don't involve repetitive events. What to do? The typical approach is some combination of forcing square pegs into round holes, and moving the goalposts. Shameful, really.
