I don't know exactly how this would help but here is the exact function you requested in Javascript. I guess using JSNI like Anurag said will help. var urlPattern = "(https?|ftp)://(www\\.)?(((([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.){1,}[a-zA-Z]{2,4}|localhost))|((\\d{1,3}\\.){3}(\\d{1,3})))(:(\\d+))?(/([a-zA-Z0-9-._~!$&'()*+,;=:@/]|%[0-9A-F]{2})*)?(\\?([a-zA-Z0-9-._~!$&'()*+,;=:/?@]|%[0-9A-F]{2})*)?(#([a-zA-Z0-9._-]|%[0-9A-F]{2})*)?"; function isValidURL(url) { urlPattern = "^" + urlPattern + "$"; var regex = new RegExp(urlPattern); return regex.test(url); } Like what @ S.Mark said, I basically took the "java" way of doing Regular Expression in Javascript. In Java, you would just done it the following way (see how the expression is the same). String urlPattern = "(https?|ftp)://(www\\.)?(((([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.){1,}[a-zA-Z]{2,4}|localhost))|((\\d{1,3}\\.){3}(\\d{1,3})))(:(\\d+))?(/([a-zA-Z0-9-._~!$&'()*+,;=:@/]|%[0-9A-F]{2})*)?(\\?([a-zA-Z0-9-._~!$&'()*+,;=:/?@]|%[0-9A-F]{2})*)?(#([a-zA-Z0-9._-]|%[0-9A-F]{2})*)?"; Hope this helps. PS, this Regular expression works and even validates sites pointing to localhost:port) where port is any digit port number.
