Credible intervals with parameter near boundary

When doing Bayesian inference on a parameter that is bounded, often we use priors that approach 0 as the parameter approaches the boundary. For example, when estimating $(\mu, \sigma^2)$ for normal data, the conjugate prior on $\sigma^2$ is inverse $\chi^2$ for some choice of hyperparameters. This prior has density 0 at $\sigma^2=0$ , which is the boundary value. Under a conjugate prior on $\mu$ as well, resulting marginal posterior for $\sigma^2$ is also inverse $\chi^2$ . Since the posterior has density approaching 0 for any $\sigma^2$ very close to 0, it seems that for any $\sigma^2$ sufficiently close to 0, equal-tailed credible intervals (but presumably also HDPI?) will not have nominal frequentist coverage. (In simulations, I am seeing this behavior in a slightly more complicated, but similar, estimation problem with a bounded variance component.) How can I construct a credible interval that retains nominal frequentist coverage when the parameter is near the boundary?
