Here is something i have done a while ago. Note the javascript resources on the left that. http://jsfiddle.net/shrage/N8dKW/ When you hover on a link it can make an asynch call to launch some content for the server, it will fill in the light box with this content. When you move outside the link "AND" the box it will disappear. When you "click" inside the box it will stay visible until you "click outside" the box.
