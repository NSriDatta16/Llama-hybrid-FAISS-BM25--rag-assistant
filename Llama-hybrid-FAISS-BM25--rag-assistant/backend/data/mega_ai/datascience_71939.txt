You could just test whether the tuples entities has any elements: for sent in list(doc.sents): if len(sent.ents) > 0: nb = nb+1 Edit: For the purpose of evaluating boolean expressions (as in case of if statements), empty lists are evaluated as false, even though they don't explicitly equal False . Expanding your example with some print statements: nb = 0 spacy_nlp = spacy.load("de_core_news_md") text = "Nichts. Auch nichts." doc = spacy_nlp(text) for sent in list(doc.sents): print("type of ents: " + str(type(sent.ents)) + " with " + str(len(sent.ents)) + " elements.") if sent.ents: nb = nb+1 print(nb) Results in: type of ents: with 0 elements. type of ents: with 0 elements. 0
