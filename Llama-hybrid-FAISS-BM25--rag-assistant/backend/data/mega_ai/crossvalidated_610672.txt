While there is limited published research directly comparing the Box-Jenkins method based on ACF/PACF plots and information criteria-based methods in ARIMA model selection, most researchers and practitioners have gravitated towards using information criteria methods, such as AIC or BIC, due to their increased efficiency, automation, and out-of-sample forecasting performance. One study that provides a comparison between the two methods is: Makridakis, S., & Hibon, M. (2000). The M3-competition: results, conclusions and implications. International Journal of Forecasting, 16 (4), 451-476. The M3 competition involved researchers and practitioners submitting their models for forecasting various time series. While the study does not focus specifically on comparing Box-Jenkins and information criteria-based methods, it does provide insights into which methods performed better in real-world situations. The results of the M3 competition indicate that the methods based on optimizing information criteria tend to perform better in terms of out-of-sample forecasting accuracy. Given the limited direct comparison of the two approaches in the literature, the preference for information criteria-based methods can be attributed to the following reasons: Automation: Information criteria-based methods automate the model selection process, reducing the need for subjective decisions and interpretation of ACF/PACF plots. Efficiency: Grid searching over possible model orders and selecting the one that optimizes an information criterion is generally faster and more efficient than manually identifying the optimal order from ACF/PACF plots. Out-of-sample forecasting performance: In practice, methods based on optimizing information criteria tend to yield better out-of-sample forecasting accuracy than the Box-Jenkins method. While the Box-Jenkins method may still have educational value and could be useful in specific cases, for most practical applications, using an automated approach like the ones provided by the forecast or fable packages in R is recommended.
