ce platform will be the penetration of the internet. In some developing countries, access to the internet is limited and speeds are also limited. In these cases, firms and customers will continue to use traditional platforms. The second issue of concern is a fraud on the internet. It is anticipated that the fraud on the e-commerce internet space costs $2.8 billion. The possibility of fraud will continue to reduce the utilization of the internet. The third issue is privacy. Due to both spyware and security holes in operating systems, there is a concern that the transactions that consumers undertake have privacy limitations. For example, by stealthily following online activities, firms can develop fairly accurate descriptions of customer profiles. The possibility of privacy violations will reduce the utilization of the internet. The final issue is that e-service can also become intrusive as they reduce time and location barriers of other forms of contract. For example, firms can contact people through mobile devices at any time and at any place. Customers do not take like intrusive behavior and may not use the e-service platform. (Heiner and lyer, 2007) However, in the last years, one can observe appearing of different e-services and related initiatives in developing countries such as Project Nemmadi, MCA21 Mission Mode Project or Digital India even more, in India; Electronic Government Directorate in Pakistan; The E-government citizen program in Iraq; E-government Development Center in Azerbaijan etc. Major e-service keywords A considerable amount of research efforts already exists on the subject matter exploring different aspects of e-service and e-service delivery; one worth noting effort is Rowley's study (2006) who did a review study on the e-service literature. The key finding of his study is that there is need to explore dimensions of e-service delivery not focusing only on service quality “In order to understand e-service experiences it is necessary to go beyond studies of e-service quality dimensions and to also take into account the inherent characteristics of e-service delivery and the factors that differentiate one service experience from another.” Some of the major keywords of e-service as found in the e-government research are as follows: Acceptance User acceptance of technology is defined according to Morris (1996, referred by Wu 2005, p. 1) as “the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support”. This definition can be brought into the context of e-service where acceptance can be defined as the users’ willingness to use e-service or the willingness to decide when and how to use the e-service. Accessibility Users’ ability to access to the e-service is important theme in the previous literature. For example, Huang (2003) finds that most of the websites in general fail to serve users with disabilities. Recommendation to improve accessibility is evident in previous literature including Jaeger (2006) who suggests the following to improve e-services’ accessibility like: design for accessibility from the outset of website development, Involve users with disabilities in the testing of the site ...Focus on the benefits of an accessible Web site to all users. Administrative literacy According to Grönlund et al. (2007), for a simple e-service, the needs for knowledge and skills, content and procedures are considerably less. However, in complicated services there are needed to change some prevailed skills, such as replacing verbal skills with skill in searching for information online. Benchmarking This theme is concerned with establishing standards for measuring e-services or the best practices within the field. This theme also includes the international benchmarking of e-government services (UN reports, EU reports); much critic has been targeting these reports being incomprehensive and useless. According to Bannister (2007) “… benchmarks are not a reliab
