Here it is! This works--but I had to change (window).load to (document).ready otherwise the Mootools slideshow freaks out. --One more thing: I have sIFR on this page (it'd be all Cufon, but you can't justify Cufon) so I had to call the replace sIFR right after the CSS is changed to block, otherwise, the sIFR won't work. I Had to put the sIFR config code just like this and on the same page, it would not work with the config code in another directory where I usually have it. jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($){$(document).ready(function(){$("#field").fadeIn(2000);}); sIFR.replace(test, {selector: '#bar', css: '.sIFR-root {letter-spacing: 0; leading: -2.5; background-color: #e6e6e6; color: #79868e; font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; } a { color: #555055; text-decoration: none;} a:hover { color: #79868e; text-decoration: none; }' }); }); Now I've got jQuery and Mootools happily running on the same page. Someday, I'll learn Mootools when I have the time; I think it'd be more elegant to have everything coming out of the same js library, but this works fine for now.
