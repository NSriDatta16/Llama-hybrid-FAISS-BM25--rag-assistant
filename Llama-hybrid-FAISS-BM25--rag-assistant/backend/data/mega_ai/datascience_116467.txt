(My basic answer, post a more informed one and I'll accept it.) Examples from this article show that the OneHotEncoder will encode for every unique value in a column. You can check what's being encoded by using the OneHotEncoder().categories_ attribute. This attribute will give you a series of arrays that include all the unique values of each column that have been encoded for. If you feed numerical values into the OneHotEncoder you'll notice that these arrays contain every unique numerical value as a category. To avoid this, you should pre-select your categorical columns and feed those to the OneHotEncoder . See the following SciKit-Learn Tutorial , and the reference for ColumnTransformer to see how this can be included in a pipeline.
