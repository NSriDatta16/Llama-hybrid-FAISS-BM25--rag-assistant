Don't have the rep to comment otherwise I wouldn't post such a vague answer. This isn't my area of expertise but ecologists have treated distance data like this with a set of related methods called Distance Sampling. I would suggest looking into this. You can basically bin your data so you get a histogram, then fit a 'detection function' curve to this. Those applications are slightly different to what you are trying to do as they assume a uniform distribution is the reality, and detection decays away from the observer (the cage in your case), and they use the methods to estimate abundance of an organism. But there is no reason you can't use the software to fit the non-linear curves for your use-case. There is bespoke windows software or also R packages. If I recall correctly there are a bunch of choices for the function, half-normal and hazard rate function are both there.
