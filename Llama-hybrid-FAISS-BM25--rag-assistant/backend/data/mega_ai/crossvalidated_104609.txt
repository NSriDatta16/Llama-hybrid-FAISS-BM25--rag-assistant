Way to Measure Groupings Using Distances Between Individuals?

I am working on a problem that requires me to measure groupings of people. I have the location of every individual in my sample at every point in time. It's therefore trivial to calculate the distances between each individual for a certain point in time. Is there a way I can think about groupings using these pairs? Currently I am defining a group as two individuals $\le$ a certain distance away from one another. This is the way I'd like to define my groupings. Basically, I'm trying to find a way to measure "groupishness" of all these characters over a set time span. I know there are n choose 2 pairings, and therefore I could calculate for every possible pair the average distance between them, but I'm trying to get a measure for the entire group. Any ideas would be helpful. Thanks.
