Why does my GLARMA model fail to converge when I exclude the independent variables, while a similarly structured one does not?

For purposes of validating a forecast model, I'd like to compare a GLARMA model that I developed to a null model that includes the same autocorrelation effects but lacks the environmental data. GLARMA are like ARMA, but they allow for count data as the independent variable. Here's a reference for this model type. Dunsmuir, William T. M. and Scott, David J. (2015) The glarma Package for Observation-Driven Time Series Regression of Counts. Journal of Statistical Software, 67(7), 1â€“36. http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v067.i07 library(glarma) library(tidyverse) data(Polio) y Call: glarma(y = y, X = X, type = "Poi", method = "FS", residuals = "Pearson", thetaLags = c(1, 2, 5), maxit = 100, grad = 1e-06) GLARMA Coefficients: theta_1 theta_2 theta_5 0.2184597 0.1272311 0.0872861 Linear Model Coefficients: Intcpt Trend CosAnnual SinAnnual CosSemiAnnual SinSemiAnnual 0.1299754 -3.9283714 -0.0991262 -0.5308445 0.2111276 -0.3932302 Degrees of Freedom: 167 Total (i.e. Null); 159 Residual Null Deviance: 343.0004 Residual Deviance: 250.6179 AIC: 536.7052 X_null Call: glarma(y = y, X = X_null, type = "Poi", method = "FS", residuals = "Pearson", thetaLags = c(1, 2, 5), maxit = 100, grad = 1e-06) GLARMA Coefficients: theta_1 theta_2 theta_5 0.2700613 0.1629822 0.1112386 Linear Model Coefficients: Intcpt 0.1579249 Degrees of Freedom: 167 Total (i.e. Null); 164 Residual Null Deviance: 343.0004 Residual Deviance: 280.207 AIC: 555.5405 However, I'm struggling to do this with my actual data and model. events % as.matrix() My model with data works fine. glarma( y = events_ts, X = concentration_mtx, phiLags = NULL, thetaLags = c(1,6) ) Call: glarma(y = events_ts, X = concentration_mtx, phiLags = NULL, thetaLags = c(1, 6)) GLARMA Coefficients: theta_1 theta_6 0.1301675 0.1773473 Linear Model Coefficients: intercept concentration -0.9438270 0.5214789 Degrees of Freedom: 261 Total (i.e. Null); 258 Residual Null Deviance: 452.4841 Residual Deviance: 224.4038 AIC: 435.2015 However, the null equivalent fails with an error. concentration_mtx_null Error in glarma(y = events_ts, X = concentration_mtx_null, phiLags = NULL, : Fisher Scoring fails to converge from the initial estimates. Why does my model not converge in the absence of environmental data while the built in polio model does? Is there any way I can get a null glarma model for my data that is the same as my working model but lacks environmental data? Thanks for any advice.
