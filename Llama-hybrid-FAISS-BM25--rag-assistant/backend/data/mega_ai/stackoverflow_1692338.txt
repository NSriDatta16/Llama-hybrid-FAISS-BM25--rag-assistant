If a base class has a particular alignment requirement, then any derived classes will have at least that alignment (they could get a stricter alignment requirement due to their own members). Otherwise the compiler couldn't guarantee that accessing the base members would meet the requirements they have. However, there's really nothing you can portably do for stack alignment - that's handled entirely by the compiler and the compiler's platform ABI requirements. As you indicate, a compiler option or maybe a pragma might let you exert some control, but nothing portable.
