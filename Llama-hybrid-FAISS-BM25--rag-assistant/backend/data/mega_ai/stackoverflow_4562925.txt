The paper is pretty much obsolete, it isn't 1980 any more, scrounging bits is not a requirement of almost any display application. When developing an application, e.g. the iPhone you have to plan for l10n across multiple languages so saving a few bits for just Japanese is a bit pointless. Japan is still on Shift-JIS because like China with GB18030, Hong Kong with BIG5, etc, they have a big, stable, and efficient resource pool already locked into locale encodings. Migrating to Unicode requires re-writing a significant amount of framework tools and the additional testing that ensues. If you look at the iPod it saves bits by only supporting Latin, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, skipping Thai and other scripts. As memory prices and dropped and storage increased with the iPhone Apple have been able to add support for more scripts. UTF-8 is the way to save space, use UTF-8 for storage and convert to UCS-2 or higher for more convenient manipulation and display. The differences between Shift-JIS and Unicode are really pretty minor.
