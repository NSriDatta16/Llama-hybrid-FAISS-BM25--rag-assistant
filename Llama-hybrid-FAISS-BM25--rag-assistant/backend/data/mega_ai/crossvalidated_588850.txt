In my experience, the Einstein convention is rarely used in statistics and machine learning, although NumPy functions like numpy.einsum are there to help you with this. In many cases, an index-free version is preferred, something well-known in math and physics, too. E.g., scalar products are not written as $\sum_i x_iy_i$ but rather as $\langle \mathbf x, \mathbf y\rangle$ , or the trace is rather $\operatorname tr(M)$ than $\sum_i M_{ii}$ . And if there is some contraction that you don't know an established coordinate-free notation for, maybe you define a new operator yourself. As with math and physics, the best solution, if possible, would be to use notation that is independent of the coordinate basis (or the coordinate chart if you use non-linear spaces). (I wrote "best solution", but this is rather subjective. There are highly respected scientists that clearly prefer the coordinate notation.)
