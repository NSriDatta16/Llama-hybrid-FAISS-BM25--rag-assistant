Depending on what you're doing with the bits, it may be easier to read by the 32-bit word rather than by byte. In either case you're going to be doing mask and shift operations, the specifics of which are left as the proverbial exercise for the reader. :-) Don't be discouraged if it takes several tries; I have to do this sort of this thing moderately often and I still get it wrong the first time more often than not.
