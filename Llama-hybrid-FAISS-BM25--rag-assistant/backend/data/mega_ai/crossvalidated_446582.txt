Time Series Analysis for Coordinates using LSTM

I have a dataset in which ids of locations connected with corresponding latitudes and longtitudes. I want to predict next location of the activity after training my LSTM model. However, feeding the ids as sequences directly to LSTM doesn't seem suitable since ids are not related with distances between locations. For example distance between id:1 and id:4 can be less than distance between id:1 and id:2. One approach that comes to my mind is to cluster the locations according to their corresponding lat. and long. data. However output of this clustering is again new cluster ids.I am stuck at this point. Maybe one-hot encoding of cluster ids may work while feeding input for LSTM. Any suggestions for solving this problem or any approach or recommendation for modelling this case will be much appreciated. Thank you in advance.
