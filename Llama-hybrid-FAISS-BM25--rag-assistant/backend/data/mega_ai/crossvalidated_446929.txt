How to correctly include offset in Bayesian Zero-Inflated Poisson model in winbugs

I am trying to fit a Bayesian Zero-inflated model and I want to include an offset term. When I compared the output of the pscl package; the result of the count model from the winbugs and pscl package were similar. While the results of the zero-inflated part from the bayesian model and pscl package were quite disimilar. The problem is how to include the offset on zero-inflated part. model{ ## Likelihood for(i in 1:N){ count[i] ~ dpois(lambda[i]) lambda[i] Please I can I correctly specify the offset for the zero inflation part in the model above so as to obtain similar result as produced by the zeroinfl function in pscl package?
