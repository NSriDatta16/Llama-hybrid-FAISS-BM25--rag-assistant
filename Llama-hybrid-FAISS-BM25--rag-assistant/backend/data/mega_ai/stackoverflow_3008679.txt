Make a Vim plugin that calls a bash script

Sometimes I edit a file that represents a server restart. I would like to "bind" this restart to my vim session, so, after saving a file, it would call a bash script that would restart for me. For example, calling :wapache automatically calls restart_apache.sh somewhere in my machine. Is this possible? Is there a plugin that would organize these scripts inside .vim directory?
