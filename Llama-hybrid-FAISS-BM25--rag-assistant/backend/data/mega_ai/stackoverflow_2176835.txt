SubSonic inner join mystery

I've have 2 tables CampaignCoverage and Coverage CampaignCoverage has a CoverageID column. Coverage has a column DateX. Basically I've not specified in the code that CampaignCoverage.CoverageID = Coverage.ID like you would to in SQL. How does this work at all????!!!! CampaignCoverageCollection campaignCoverages = new Select() .From(Tables.CampaignCoverage) .InnerJoin(Tables.Coverage) .Where(Coverage.DateXColumn).IsGreaterThan(ucDateStart.DateTime) .And(Coverage.DateXColumn).IsLessThan(ucDateEnd.DateTime) .And(CampaignCoverage.CampaignIDColumn).IsEqualTo(campaign.Id) .ExecuteAsCollection ();
