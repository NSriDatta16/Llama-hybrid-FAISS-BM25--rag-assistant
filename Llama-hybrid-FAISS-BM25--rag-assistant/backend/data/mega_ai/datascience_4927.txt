While Docker images are now more trendy, I personally find Docker technology not user-friendly, even for advanced users. If you are OK with using non-local VM images and can use Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 , consider R-focused images for data science projects, pre-built by Louis Aslett. The images contain very recent, if not the latest, versions of Ubuntu LTS , R and RStudio Server . You can access them here . Besides main components I've listed above, the images contain many useful data science tools built-in as well. For example, the images support LaTeX, ODBC, OpenGL, Git, optimized numeric libraries and more.
