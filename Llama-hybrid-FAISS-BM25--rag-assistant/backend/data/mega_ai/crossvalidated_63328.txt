Not sure if this amounts to an answer but here are a few remarks: The fact that variables are related in some way (e.g. that users who comment a lot tend to visit a lot pages) is actually a good thing. Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to derive a single activity measure or indeed apply any dimensionality reduction technique. Beside dimensionality, the main reason not to blindly average all your variables is not that they are correlated but that some of them will have more weight in the final sum, depending on their variance/units. It's not clear to me that there are two important components in this case. For example, if you create a scree plot based on the results, you will see that there is no obvious elbow. By construction, the first component captures the most variance of course but in fact the differences are less marked than in many data sets I have personally manipulated. From a pure dimensionality reduction perspective, if you want to retain only a single variable to capture as much variance as possible then it would be the first component. From the way you talk about it, it seems that you are not interested purely in dimensionality reduction but rather in latent variable modeling, i.e. in finding some meaningful factor (“user activity”) driving the behavior you observe. You might therefore want to look at the factor analysis literature, where you will find a lot of discussion on the number of factors to retain, etc.
