Great answers, for the record, I'm going to merge those I upvoted into the approach I'm finally using: Sort and reorganize the data so that similar numbers are next to each other, i. e. sort by id first, then by timestamp and rearrange from ( , , ), ... to ([ , ...], [ , ... ], [ , ...]) (as suggested by schnaader and Stephan Leclercq Use delta-encoding on the timestamps (and maybe on the other values) as suggested by schnaader and ididak Use protocol buffers to serialize (I'm going to use them anyway in the application, so that's not going to add dependencies or anything). Thanks to Marc Gravell for pointing me to it.
