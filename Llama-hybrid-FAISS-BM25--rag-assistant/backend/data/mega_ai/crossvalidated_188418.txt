Predicting the exact rating may be hard, but you can try a simpler model first and see how far you can get with it. For example, you may try to predict if a song will increase its rating tomorrow or not - and this is a binary classification problem. Features can be any data you can extract from these songs, and you'll probably need to add features of the song one position above and some derived features, e.g. difference in downloads between the songs or what's the difference between downloads of the song today and yesterday. Another idea (less simple, though) might be building separate Time Series models (e.g. ARIMA) for each of the songs separately, and then get the rating by ordering the songs according to predicted values from the models.
