Don't understand why I am getting this - 'Error: Value storage corrupted: negative chunk size'

I'm using intelliJ IDEA version 9.0.1 build #IU 93.94 with JDK 1.6.0_17. This error comes up at compile time. It only happens sometimes and sometimes when I hit File|Invalidate Caches and restart intelliJ, my project will build successfully. I have absolutely no idea what to do about this, but it is slowing my progress down quite a bit. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
