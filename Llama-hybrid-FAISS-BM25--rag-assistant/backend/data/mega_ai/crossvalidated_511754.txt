Mediator, Suppressor, Confounder in a Logistic Regression

I have a logistic model, say Category B vs Category A. I run a basemodel, with some controls and my variable of interest $X_1$ (continuous, standardised), which is slightly negative and non-significant. Then in model $2$ I add variable $X_2$ (again, continuous and standardised), which is positive (beta coeff. $+1.3$ ) and significant, $X_1$ keeps being negative but with a much larger coefficient (beta coeff. from $-0.1$ to $-0.7$ ), which is now highly significant. (There is no change in the sample in moving from model $1$ to model $2$ ) . $X_2$ is fairly correlated with $X_1$ ( $r= 0.45$ ) in Category A (the baseline of the model), whereas in Category B the correlation is much smaller ( $r=0.10$ ). Indeed there is a trend of $X_2$ among the various categories of the baseline, whereas among the "1s" its value is quite stable. Overall we have $r=0.34$ . And yes, $X_2$ could be on the causal pathway between $X_1$ and $Y$ . Now I understand what is going on, I have more difficulties in labelling it, let's say. Maybe I am wrong, but I would rule out a confounding effect of $X_2$ between $X_1$ and $Y$ , cause there is a causal pathway (something that should be missing in the case of a confounder). So I would go for a mediator effect. But does this apply also in case like that, where the effect of $X_2$ increases the magnitude of the relationship between $X_1$ and $Y$ ? Maybe is it a case of a suppressor?
