C# Panel.BackgroundImage + transparent Controls = flickering?

I've got a Panel with a jpg BackgroundImage (with BackgroundImageLayout = Stretch ). On the panel it's Controls I add some PictureBoxes with a PNG which has transparent borders. Displaying this doesn't give any problems, but moving (the boxes are draggable) the PictureBoxes does. The result is that the moving PictureBox "disturbs" the BackgroundImage and slows down performance. The faster I drag the box, the more it disturbs the BackgroundImage , and vice versa. How to solve this problem?
