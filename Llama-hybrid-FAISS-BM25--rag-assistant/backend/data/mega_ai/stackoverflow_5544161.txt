Is there an easy way to leverage my view code to be re-used in new projects? I don't know what you mean by easy way nor I know your exact use case scenario but you can encapsulate view logic into reusable WinForms controls into a separate assembly. Those controls might contain different properties allowing to personalize them for each project. That's exactly what companies like Telerik and DevExpress do except that you can get a step further and even incorporate some business logic that could be reused.
