I'm not too familiar with Bayesian Networks, so I hope the following is usefull: In the past I had a seemingly similar problem with a Gaussian Process regressor, instead of a bayesian classifier. I ended up using inheritance, which worked out nicely. All model-specific paremeters are set with the constructor. The calculate() functions are virtual. Cascading different methods (e.g. a sum-method which combines an arbitrary number of other methods) also works nicely that way.
