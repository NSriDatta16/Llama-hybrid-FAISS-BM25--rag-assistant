In the message title you called your array "static". If this is indeed an array with static storage duration, then its elements are zero-initialized by default at program startup. Since the "assigned" values you used in your example are non-zero, you can determine how many elements you have assigned by finding the first zero element in the array. Of course, this will only work when the "assigned" values are guaranteed to be non-zero, i.e. if zero value can be thought of as a reserved value.
