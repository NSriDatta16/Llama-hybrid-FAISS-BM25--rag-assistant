Well Dickey-Fuller test is the test where we try to disapprove the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in an autoregressive model. The autoregressive model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on its own previous values and on a stochastic term. You may consider DF test as special case of Autoregressiveâ€“moving-average model (ARMA). Testing for linearity is totally different thing. It is just one of 5-6 or even more types of test where we try to detect if regression meat the assumptions. I will name few: linear relationship multivariate normality multicollinearity test No auto-correlation homoscedasticity So DF kind of test is type of Hypothesis testing. Addition regression assumptions are particularly made for us when we would like to understand if we can relay on these numbers marked with gold:
