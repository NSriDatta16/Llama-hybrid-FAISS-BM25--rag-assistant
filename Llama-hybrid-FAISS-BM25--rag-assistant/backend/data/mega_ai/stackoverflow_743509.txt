Playground has voting built-in, and it is a tool specifically designed for requirements elicitation and organization (disclosure: I am the owner/developer) However - in most situations, stakeholders do NOT have equal votes - some of them have a higher authority and decision-making power. Voting can be most successfully used when "outsourcing ideas" from the outside - see UserVoice. On internal as well as client projects, you simply build whatever the client desires.
