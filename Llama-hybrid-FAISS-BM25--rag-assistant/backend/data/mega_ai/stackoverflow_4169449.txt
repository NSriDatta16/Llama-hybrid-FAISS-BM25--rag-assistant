My favorite function in all of PHP is strtotime() . If that can't interpret the input then I probably can't code something that could. So I would do something like: mysql_real_escape_string(date('Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime($stragely_formatted_date))); to prepare a DATE string to give to MySQL. As always, think about timezones in your the design. The mysql_real_escape_string() is probably unnecessary but I always feel more secure when I use it.
