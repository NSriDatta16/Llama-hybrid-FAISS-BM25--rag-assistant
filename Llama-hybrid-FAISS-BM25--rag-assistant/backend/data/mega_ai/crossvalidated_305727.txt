Your MSE plot is really supposed to also contain a line for the validation MSE and testing MSE. The MSE of the validation may go up -- as you eluded to. For continuous input features, sometimes when using an ANN for function approximation, e.g. fitting a 3D surface curve, the spacing of the observed data can cause the ANN to literally bomb out (totally fail), so the workaround is to employ Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) when the input is essentially a multi-dimensional grid. You mentioned input spectra, so it sounds like your input is maybe an energy-steradian grid of some sort. (so it sounds like you are not using the ANN to classify discrete objects, but rather predict using all continuous data). Other than the above issues, other things you might consider is use of "cross-entropy" instead of MSE -- so see Bishop's classic ANN book available free online. Since many of your input spectra result in a matrix essentially being fed to the ANN, try using PCA to reduce dimensions and accept dimensions whose eigenvalues $\lambda_j>1$ as a start. That way you will prevent correlated data from being used in the ANN. Correlated data slow down an ANN's learning, since it wastes time learning the correlation. Orthogonality is the best thing to feed an ANN. FYI - PCA is also a very common technique to denoise data for input into an ANN. Below are images for ANN MSE with and without use of PCA.
