Simple Time Series Prediction

I have a data set like this. Here the first column is date, the second column is Temperature, third one is humidity, fourth and fifth column are two other boolean data. I have data of 6 years like this. 2010-01-01,25.6,59,0,1 2010-01-02,25.6,60,0,1 2010-01-03,24.2,45,1,1 2010-01-04,26.3,20,0,1 2010-01-05,26.2,17,0,1 2010-01-06,24.3,65,0,0 2010-01-07,23.1,50,0,1 2010-01-08,26.3,25,1,0 2010-01-09,26.6,23,0,1 2010-01-10,24.3,60,0,1 And the label (The variable I want to predict) for this data set is: (boolean) 0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0 Now I want to implement Machine Learning to predict from this data set for a future time frame. I have almost no knowledge on machine learning. I want to use python to do it. Which library or methodology will be best and easiest for this? And can I have a simple sample code?
