C#: Can I cast an explicit delegate to an Action delegate?

Given: delegate void Explicit(); Can I: public void Test(Explicit d) { Action a; a = d; // ???? } I have a scenario where I need to overload a constructor that has: public MyClass(Expression a) {} but the following overload is ambiguous: public MyClass(Action a) {} I figured using an explicit delegate would resolve the ambiguity but I need to cast that explicit delegate to an action in order to leverage the existing code.
