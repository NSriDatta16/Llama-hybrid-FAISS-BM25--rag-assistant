DataBinding: 'System.String' does not contain a property with the name 'dbMake'

I am a newbie at ASP.net and after using sqldatasource with a listview to insert and show results from an SQL server db I want to try using the LINQ datasource since it seems to be more flexible in codebehind. My problem is this: I droped a listview control to the page and I created the Linq datasource in codebehind with vb. the issue that I am having when I ..Select d.columms name i get the error system.string does not contain a property with the name "columname".. if i ommit the column name then its works fine.. the funny part is the d.count works fine but after that i get the error.. please see my code below: vb code Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load Dim rowsCount As Integer Dim showSearchForm As String showSearchForm = Request.QueryString("tab") If showSearchForm = "1" Then Dim db As New ASPNETDBDataContext() Dim q = From b In db.PassengerVehiclesTables Select b.dbMake rowsCount = q.Count MsgBox(rowsCount) lvMakes.DataSource = q lvMakes.DataBind() PnlPassengerVehiclesSearch.Visible = True ElseIf showSearchForm = "2" Then aspx code Search Passenger Vehicles Form..... b.dbMake needs to work so that i can use Distinct ,, ia m using asp.net version:3.5 and IIS version 7.0 .. not sure what i am missing ,, but i did try alot of approaches,,1- checked the web.config file and it seems to have two assemblies and two namespaces for LINQ..2- used different databinding syntaxs,,and i searched a lot for the solution.. the last one i read the person ommited the name of the column,, i thought that wasnt the best solution.. also my dbMake column is comming up in the "intellisence" .. thank you in advance for your help..
