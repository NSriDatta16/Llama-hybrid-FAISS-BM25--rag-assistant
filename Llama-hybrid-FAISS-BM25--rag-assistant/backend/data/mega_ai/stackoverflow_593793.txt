Since it is dev only (and probably doesn't have to be very elegant), how about using TSQL to generate a pile of TSQL that you then copy back into the query window and execute? SELECT 'SELECT * FROM [' + tables.TABLE_NAME + '] WHERE [' + Columns.Column_Name + '] = ' + CONVERT(varchar(50),@COLUMNVALUE) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.Columns as Columns INNER JOIN INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES as tables On Columns.TABLE_NAME = tables.TABLE_NAME WHERE Columns.DATA_TYPE = @COLUMNTYPE It won't be pretty, but it should work... an alternative might be to insert something like the above into a table-variable, then loop over the table-variable using EXEC (@Sql) . But for dev purposes it probably isn't worth it...
