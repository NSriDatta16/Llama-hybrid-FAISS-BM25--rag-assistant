What statistical test to use for a within-subject design with binary dv?

I am asking because I am lost and I failed my first submission because of wrong analysis. The goal of my experiment is to examine the moderating role of product involvement in the relationship between maximizing tendency and intentions to switch a product. Maximizing tendency (the independent variable) is measured as a continuous variable, intention to switch as a binary variable (Yes or No). Product involvement is measured by testing participants for 2 product categories, differing in involvement (High or Low). To be more specific, I measured participants maximizing tendency and then participants had to complete a task which consisted in choosing a product from an assortment, and after they were asked if they wanted to switch to a different model. Every participant did this one time for a high involvement product category, and another time for a low involvement product category (so it is a within-subjects design). So each participant has a maximizing tendency score and intention to switch "values" for each category (so either Yes or No). Keep in mind, they have intention to switch for the high involvement product and intention to switch for the low involvement product. I need to check whether there is an interaction effect, but I don't know how to do it. I tried using logistic regression, analyzing each product category separately but this did not allow me to measure any significant difference between the 2 conditions. I am looking online but I don't find anything perfect for my case. What kind of statistical test can I use to analyze this? P.S. I am using SPSS
