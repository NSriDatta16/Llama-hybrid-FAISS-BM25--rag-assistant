Interpreting RandomForestRegressor feature_importances_

I have a Random Forest model for a dataset with 3 features: rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10) rf.fit(X, y) If I look at the importance of each feature I get: rf.feature_importances_ > array([ 0.45453475, 0.23246138, 0.31300387]) I know that feature 1 is the most important but how do I interpret these results exactly? Could I say, for example, that 45% of the variability of the model is explained by feature 1?
