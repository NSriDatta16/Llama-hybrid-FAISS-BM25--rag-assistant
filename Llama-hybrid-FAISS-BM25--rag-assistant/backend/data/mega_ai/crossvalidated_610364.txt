Why don't we use the harmonic mean of sensitivity and specificity?

There is this question on the F-1 score, asking why we compute the harmonic mean of precision and recall rather than its arithmetic mean. There were good arguments in the answers in favor of the harmonic mean, in particular that it is suited to take the average of ratios and drops to zero whenever one of the other does. Which begs the question, why is the harmonic mean of sensitivity and specificity not a thing (to my knowledge)? There are both ratios and the same fine arguments could apply.
