Overestimating the lower values and underestimating the higher values in Regression

I've tried many different models from Linear to non-linear and flexible models like random forest to solve a regression problem. But all of them apparently overestimate the lower values of the response variable and underestimate the higher values. Below you can see the "observed versus fitted" plot of the random forest model: Question: What are the possible reasons behind this issue and how it be fixed?
