NEVER use setcookie() to setup a session state. You should have a session_start() in your header file. NEVER use md5() its extremely broken , sha1() is on the NIST list of approved message digest functions (but its kind of broken ), however the sha2 family is better, sha256() is a great choice but you'll need to find the source code online for it because PHP doesn't have a secure hash function. You also need a salt, try searching SO for one of the 10,000+ posts relating to password storage. ALWYAS die() after you do a header("location: ..."); . This function only modifies the HTTP response header, the script still executes . The entire session must be over HTTPS. Currently you are probably violating OWASP A9 . And yes, StackOverflow volates OWASP, and they don't care .
