As Luminita said, you need to split it into 2 problems a) prediction of default 2 common approaches are logistic regression ( predict defaults occurring within eg 1 year after issuance) survival models (cox or discrete survival model [=apply logistic regression to predict probability of surviving a given month after issuance]) It is commonly accepted that there is a term structure to defaulting ( eg unlikely to default after 2/3 of loan paid off) (there are lots of blogs analysing lending club investments eg http://peerlendingserver.com/uncategorized/1310/ - keywords IRR /default/vintage) b) optimisation of loan offer here you take the model of defaulting ( eg probability of defaulting this month|not defaulted in previous month is constant) and you calculate what the IRR on the loan for the bank is (taking into account defaulting and Loss Given Default (LGD) ). So then you might specify that on average you want to achieve a x% return on each loan and then work out for given interest rate what default probability will achieve this. a book giving you some insights might be 'modelling structured finance cashflows with microsoft excel'. I am sure there are [much] better books
