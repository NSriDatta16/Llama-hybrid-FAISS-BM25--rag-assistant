The joint distribution just needs to be a valid probability distribution, with matching marginals. That's it. It turns out that you can characterize the set of such distributions via copulas . That is, if we assume for now that $X$ and $Y$ are each real-valued, every such distribution has cdf of the form $$ \Pr(X \le x, Y \le y) = C(\Pr(X \le x), \Pr(Y \le y)) $$ where $C$ is the joint cdf of a distribution that has uniform margins on the unit square. The converse also holds: any such $C$ gives you a valid joint distribution. I'm pretty sure something analogous holds for $X$ and $Y$ taking values in $\mathbb R^n$, but apparently it only holds in one direction for infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces . That doesn't necessarily help you in computing the Wasserstein distance, but it might help in thinking about what it means.
