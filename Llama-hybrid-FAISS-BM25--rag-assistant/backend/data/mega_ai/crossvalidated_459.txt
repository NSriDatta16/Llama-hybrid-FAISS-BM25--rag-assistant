Good line color for "threshold" line in a time-series graph?

We're plotting time-series metrics in the context of network/server operations. The data has a 5-minute sample rate, and consists of things like CPU utilization, error rate, etc. We're adding a horizontal "threshold" line to the graphs, to visually indicate a value threshold above which people should worry/take notice. For example, in the CPU utilization example, perhaps the "worry" threshold is 75%. My team has some internal debate over what color this line should be: Something like a bright red that clearly stands out from the background grid and data lines, and indicates this is a warning condition Something more subtle and definitely NOT red, since the "ink" for the line doesn't represent any actual data, and thus attention shouldn't be drawn to it unnecessarily. Would appreciate guidance / best practices...
