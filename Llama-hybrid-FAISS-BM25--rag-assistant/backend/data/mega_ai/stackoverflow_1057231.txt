Filesize might not be the best way to determine whether the script is working properly. Have you checked over the data the script produces? Use the saved sql file to create a temp duplicate of the table you are trying to export. Run your script on this temp table. Use a utility such as WinMerge to see if the two files are identical or not. It's not terribly elegant, but it is quick, doesn't require any costly tools, and if WinMerge does pickup any differences between the two, that should also indicate where the problem lies.
