I think i can provide you with a good illustrative example of what user350942 described in your link. Consider $X_t$ the stochastic process containing the state of a patient in the ICU. $t = 0$ is ICU admission and the possible sates are just intubated, non intubated and as absorbing states you get dismissed and dead. In this example nobody ever comes back to the ICU after being dismissed. Now we get 4 doctors with different ideas about what kind of process $X_t$ is, asking the only questions that matter according to their opinion: 1st: Doctor Time Homogeneous Markov Chain asks only one question "What state is the patient in?", the nurse replies: "They are intubated". The doctor thinks that's bad but not terrible. 2nd: Doctor Time Inhomogeneous Markov Chain asks only two questions "What state is the patient in and how long has he been in the ICU?", the nurse replies: "They are intubated and they've been in the ICU for 30 days". The doctor thinks that's terrible. This doctor doesn't care what happened in the 30 days, beyond the patient now being intubated, so his believes about $X_t$ are still Markov even if he includes $t$ , because there was always going to be a state of the patient at that point in time. 3rd: Doctor Time Homogeneous Semi Markov Chain asks only two questions "What state is the patient in and how long has he been in that state?", the nurse replies: "They are intubated and they've been intubated 2 days ago". The doctor thinks that's not all that bad. Now this doctor believes, that the patient not being intubated slightly more than 2 days ago changes the probabilities of their future development. Therefore he does not believe that $X_t$ is strictly Markov. 4th: Doctor Time Inhomogeneous Semi Markov Chain is a workaholic and asks three questions "What state is the patient in, how long has he been in that state and how long has he been in the ICU?", the nurse replies: "They are intubated, they've been intubated 2 days ago and ICU admittance was 30 days ago". The doctor thinks that, when put together, this is bad but not terrible. In principle the 4th doctor is probably right but of course more complex models require more data and, if the time effects aren't huge, the time homogeneous Markov Chain might very well be the only model with reasonable estimates. Whether time is continuous or discrete isn't relevant for the distinction between these four different types. With discrete time, like only looking at patient development in full days, you have actual probabilities for each individual day, while with continuous time you are looking at all possible moments and the probability of something happening in an individual, infinitely short moment is of course 0. Instead you just have some abstract background risk, which expresses itself through mathematical machinery.
