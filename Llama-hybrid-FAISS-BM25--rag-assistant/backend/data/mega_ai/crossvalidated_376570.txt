Random Group By Time Interaction

Assume we have two groups of subjects which are measured repeatedly over time with respect to the values of a continuous outcome variable. To analyze the resulting data in R, we might fit a linear mixed effects models of the form: lmer(Outcome ~ Group * Time + (Time | Subject), data = Data) Assume also that Time is treated as a continuous variable in the model. This model essentially assumes that the average temporal profile of the Outcome variable is different across the two groups and that, in each group, there is subject variability in the intercepts and slopes describing the subject-specific temporal profiles. The amount of variability in intercepts and slopes, respectively, is assumed to be the same across the two groups. What if we wanted to allow the subject-specific intercepts and slopes to exhibit different amounts of variability across the two groups? Could lmer accommodate this through syntax along these lines, say: lmer(Outcome ~ Group * Time + (Time + Group:Time | Subject), data = Data) Does this even make sense? The reason I ask this is because all linear mixed effects models with fixed effects for Group*Time I've encountered so far include just the (Time|Subject) term so I got intrigued about why this is the case. If anyone could shed some light on this for me, I would very much appreciate it. Thank you in advance.
