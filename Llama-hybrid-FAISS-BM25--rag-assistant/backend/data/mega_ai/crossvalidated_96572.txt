Before going into the formal definition of mixing coefficients, the main idea of this notion is to quantify the dependence of a sequence of random variables. We would like to have theorems which do not only apply in the independent case, but "if the time series is not too far away from an independent sequence". There are several way for a sequence of random variables to be dependent, and mixing (in the sense $\rho$, $\alpha$ or $\beta$) is one of them. First of all, we compare the dependence between two $\sigma$-algebras, either directly by comparing the difference between the measure of the intersection and the product of measures ($\alpha$-mixing), or the correlation between what is measurable with respect to the first and second $\sigma$-algebra ($\rho$-mixing). Then we compare the dependence in these sense between the past and future $\sigma$-algebras.
