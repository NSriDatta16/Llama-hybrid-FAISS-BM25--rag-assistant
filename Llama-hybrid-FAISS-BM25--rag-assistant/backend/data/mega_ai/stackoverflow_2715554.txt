I would suggest finding a less evil way of getting hits on a website like a Google Adwords campaign . Also, for your convenience, I have included the first link in my google search of "How to drive traffic to your website." http://sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/ecommerce/a/drivetrafficmm.htm Please pay attention to #3
