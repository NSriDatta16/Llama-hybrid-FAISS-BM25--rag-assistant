Yes, in practice those values are skipped. In your description in terms of a Frobenius norm, this corresponds to minimising the components of the norm which can be measured, i.e. those which have known ratings. The regularisation term can be seen as a Bayesian prior on the components of the feature vectors, with the SVD calculating the maximum likelihood estimator, subject to this prior and the known values. It's probably best to think of the SVD as a method for inferring the missing values. If you've already got a better way of doing this, why do you need the SVD? If you don't, then the SVD will happily fill in the gaps for you.
