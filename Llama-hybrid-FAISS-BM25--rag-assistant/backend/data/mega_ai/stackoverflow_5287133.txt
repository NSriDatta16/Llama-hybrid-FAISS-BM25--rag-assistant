SQLite uses static rigid typing. With static typing, the datatype of a value is determined by its container - the particular column in which the value is stored. Any value stored in the SQLite database has one of the following storage class: NULL INTEGER REAL TEXT BLOB so I am not sure what you meant by but the date is stored as a long, unhelpful integer. For more details please refer to Datatypes In SQLite Version 3 . For further information on storing date/time in SQLite please refer to SQL As Understood By SQLite . I hope this helps.
