Additional formatting on a tag

I am using tags to preserve long strings of text that include user-entered line breaks. When the input into the original form was exactly: Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2 Paragraph 3 ...the pre returns: Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2 Paragraph 3 In the database, the string is stored: "Paragraph 1\r\n\r\nParagraph 2\r\n\r\nParagraph 3." Why is this happening? If the best way to get around this to simply strip out all leading spaces from every newline, how can I accomplish this so it happens across the entire site? Edit: I'm using Ruby on Rails - what would be the code in that case? A particular problem I'm having is with a HAML page. %pre - unless condition.blank? %br - unless @user.show_notes == false :preserve #{@user.notes}
