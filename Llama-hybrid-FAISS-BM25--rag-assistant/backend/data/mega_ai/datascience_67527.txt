You can try XGBoost or LightGBM, they often perform better than Random Forest Try do not remove missing values, complex ensemble models such as RF and GBM treats it well, may be you lost some useful information doing so, especially if you have large percent of your data missing in some features Try do not remove outliers, sometimes it's better to have it in your data Try to increase n_estimators and max_depth, may be your trees not deep enough to catch all data properties
