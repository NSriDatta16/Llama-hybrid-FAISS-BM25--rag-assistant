For variables that used in the model (or have potential usage in the model), people usually call them "features" (in machine learning community) or "independent variables" (in statistics community). For columns you mentioned such as name, created at, modified at. We may not use them in the model, but for some reference. We still can call them features, but it is more common to call them "columns" or "fields", or "attributes" in general. The term "metadata" means the data about the data. For example, the data set size, and data set time range etc.
