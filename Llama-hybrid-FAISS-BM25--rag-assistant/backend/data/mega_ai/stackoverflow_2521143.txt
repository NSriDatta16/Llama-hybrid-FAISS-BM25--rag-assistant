Working with arrays of lists pattern in java

I am writing a card game in java where I need to spread cards from a deck into several columns until I have fixed amount of cards left. This is how I do this. public class Column extends ArrayList {} List deck = Cards.createNewDeck(); Column[] columns = new Column[10]; int c = 0; while (deck.size() > 50) { if (c == 10) { c = 0; } if (columns[c] == null) { columns[c] = new Column(); } columns[c].add(Cards.dealTopCard(deck)); c += 1; } This somehow seems clunky. Is there a more readable/comprehensive way of doing the same thing?
