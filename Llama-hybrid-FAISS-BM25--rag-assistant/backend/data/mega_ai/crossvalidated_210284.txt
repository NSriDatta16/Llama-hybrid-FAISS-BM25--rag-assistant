RJAGS bayesian approach of mixed effects model

Why my posterior result always shows that the sigma and sigma.c estimates to be around 50? It should not be that large as I know from another approach of analysis and also summary of the data. Is it because I have only one observation for each year-country combination? write(" model { for(i in 1:n) { life[i] ~ dnorm(a[Country[i]]+ b[Year[i]]+b7*fertrate[i], sigma^(-2)) } b[1]~dnorm(0,0.0001) b[2]~dnorm(0,0.0001) b7~dnorm(0,0.0001) sigma ~ dunif(0, 100) for(j in 1:J) { a[j] ~ dnorm(0 , sigma.c^(-2)) } sigma.c ~ dunif(0, 100) } ", "life3.jags") mm3.jags = jags.model("life3.jags", data=list(J=194, n=376, Country=suit1213d$Country, Year=suit1213d$Year,fertrate=suit1213d$fertrate),n.adapt=100,n.chains=3) mm3.vars = c("b","b7", "sigma", "sigma.c") mm3.sim = coda.samples(mm3.jags, mm3.vars, n.iter = 50000,thin=100) summary(mm3.sim) Iterations = 5100:55000 Thinning interval = 100 Number of chains = 3 Sample size per chain = 500 1.
