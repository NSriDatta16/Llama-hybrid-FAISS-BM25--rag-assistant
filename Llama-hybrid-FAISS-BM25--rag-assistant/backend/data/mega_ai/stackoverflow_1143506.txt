Your property needs 'private' removed from 'private set;' When you make the short hand properties in VS 2008 without implementing get/set, the compiler creates private member variables for you (of which name who knows). The Storage option in ColumnAttribute specifies which private member to use. Linq to SQL doesn't know how to set the property if you mark the setter private and have the getter public (don't ask me why). If you wish to make your property readonly, make a private member variable like you did above. You can clean it up by writing it like the following: [Table( Name="TBL_REGISTRATION" )] public sealed class Registration : IDataErrorInfo { public Guid RegistrationID { get { return _registrationID; } } [Column( IsPrimaryKey = true, IsDbGenerated = true, AutoSync = AutoSync.OnInsert)] private Guid _registrationID; }
