I'm afraid I cann't answer the question for creation time, but for last modification time you can use the following to get the epoch date , in seconds , since filename was last modified : date --utc --reference=filename +%s So you could then so something like: modsecs=$(date --utc --reference=filename +%s) nowsecs=$(date +%s) delta=$(($nowsecs-$modsecs)) echo "File $filename was modified $delta secs ago" if [ $delta -lt 120 ]; then # do something fi etc.. Update A more elgant way of doing this (again, modified time only): how do I check in bash whether a file was created more than x time ago?
