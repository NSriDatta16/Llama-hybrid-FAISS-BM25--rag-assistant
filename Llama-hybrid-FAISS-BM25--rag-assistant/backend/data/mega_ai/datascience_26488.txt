rows to columns in data.table R (or Python)

This is something I can't achieve with the reshape2 library for R. I have the following data: zone code literal 1: A 14 bicl 2: B 14 bicl 3: B 24 calso 4: A 51 mara 5: B 51 mara 6: A 125 gan 7: A 143 carc 8: B 143 carc i.e.: each zone has 4 codes with its corresponding literal. I would like to transform it to a dataset with one column for each of the four codes and one column for each of the four literals: zone code1 literal1 code2 literal2 code3 literal3 code4 literal4 1: A 14 bicl 51 mara 125 gan 143 carc 2: B 14 bicl 24 calso 51 mara 143 carc Any easy way to achieve this in R? If not, I would also be comfortable with a solution in Python.
