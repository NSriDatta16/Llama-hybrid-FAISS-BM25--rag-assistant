The nice thing about GLMs is that they bring together different models under a common denominator. In your question you have discussed logistic regression as a GLM, but you can also show that Poisson regression is a GLM, etc. Properties derived for GLMs apply to all of them. Those are just the linear predictor and the link function. The background is some sort of regression model, so you have a part that is $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 ...$ . That is the $\eta$ . That $\eta$ is related to the dependent variable, through some transformation, the $h(\cdot)$ . These are parametric models, so these assumptions can be wrong. If you apply such a model to a particular dataset, it is up to you to make sure that these assumptions are a reasonable simplification of the reality you are studying.
