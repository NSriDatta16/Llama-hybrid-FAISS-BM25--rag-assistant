I 100% understand everything you've said here and, on the surface, it sounds like it's not any kind of bug. It seems like you are actually referencing something you shouldn't. If that's, in fact, the case that's obviously something you want to fix. My first guess would be to look at your "ConditionApplies" formulas. Under certain cases, would they create invalid references (referencing data of the wrong type, dividing by zero, circular references, etc.). The most common cause of problems like that would be dragging formulas but not having the "$" signs in the appropriate places. So your cell references change when you expected they'd stay the same. For example: =SUM(A1:G25) should be something like the following to prevent the column and row from incrementing when dragged: =SUM($A$1:$G$25) Recommendation Look at the "ConditionApplies" formulas (or better yet, post them here) and aggressively place $ where ever they don't break things. Then "re-drag" your new formulas, updating the previous ones.
