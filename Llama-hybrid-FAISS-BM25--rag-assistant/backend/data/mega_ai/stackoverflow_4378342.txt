Text Editor using jquery

I am looking for a text editor in my webpage. Actually my requirements are uploading image, dragging and resizing images, changing canvas background color,text background color, dragging text, changing font and fontsize. I have seen so many editors like nicedit, yuiedit and lot of jquery editors. None of them have dragging text by mouse and changing background canvas. Is there any editor available with above mentioned options.?
