R: logistic regression residual deviance higher and null deviance but predictors all significant interpretation

I am running a logistic regression, but for a group of predictors I tried, all of then are highly significant but the residual deviance is much higher than the null deviance. glm(formula = label ~ pitch_0 + pitch_1 + pitch_2 + pitch_3 + pitch_4 + pitch_5 + pitch_6 + pitch_7 + pitch_8 + pitch_9 + pitch_10 + pitch_11 + pitch_12 + pitch_13 + pitch_14 + pitch_15 + pitch_16 + pitch_17 + pitch_18 + pitch_19, family = "binomial", data = sh_missLDA_wLabel) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -8.49 -8.49 0.00 0.00 8.49 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 4.276e+14 5.339e+06 80083623 I am wondering in this case, what does this result implying? From my previous google search, it seems to say that if this indicates a lack of fit to the data but why is the case that all of the predictors are significant to with p-value More details: the pitch variables are the first 25 components from PCA, where pitch variables are initially in very high dimensions of more than 10,000 per data point and the first 25 components correspond to more than 50% of the variation. I also tried to put in pitch variable at a time and see the results, only pitch_19 and pitch_20 are significant, reported below. glm(formula = label ~ pitch_20, family = "binomial", data = sh_missLDA_wLabel) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.990 -1.195 0.790 1.154 1.458 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
