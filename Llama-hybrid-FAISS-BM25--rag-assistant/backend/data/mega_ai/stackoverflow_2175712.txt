Enable Maximize, Minimize and Restore Window in WPF (Manual Resize is disable)

I need to enable the following on my application (C# WPF application): Have normal size of 1024*768 The user can maximize the application The user can minimize the application The user can restore the application (1024*768) The user cannot manually resize the application by draging its border. There isn't any ResizeMode the fulfills all of those requirements. Is there any way to do do?
