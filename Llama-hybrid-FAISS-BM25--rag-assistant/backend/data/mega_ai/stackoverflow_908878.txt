Detect win or web forms

Any reliable elegant way of detecting whether the current app is a win or web forms (or other) application? We have a common config class which needs to open either app.config or web.config. Currently, I'm catching ArgumentException when I try OpenExeConfiguration but it's not very elegant and might mask other issues.
