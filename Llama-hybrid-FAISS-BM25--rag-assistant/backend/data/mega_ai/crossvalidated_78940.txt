Distribution of sum of squares of T-distributed random variables

I am looking at the distribution of the sum of squares of T-distributed random variables, with tail exponent $\alpha$. Where X is the r.v., the Fourier transform for $X^2$, $\mathscr{F}(t)$ gives me a solution for the square before the convolution $\mathscr{F}(t)^n$. $$\mathscr{F}(t)=\int_0^{\infty } \exp \left(i\, t\, x^2\right)\left(\frac{\left(\frac{\alpha }{\alpha +x^2}\right)^{\frac{\alpha +1}{2}} }{\sqrt{\alpha }\ B\left(\frac{\alpha }{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)}\right) \, \mathrm{d}x$$ With $\alpha=3$, the solution is possible but unwieldy and impossible to inverse to do an inverse Fourier for $\mathscr{F}(t)^n$. So the question is: has work been done on the distribution of the sample variance or standard deviation of T-distributed random variables? (It would be to the StudentT what the Chi-square is to the Gaussian). Thank you. (Possible Solution) I figured out that $X^2$ is Fisher $F(1,\alpha)$ distributed, hence will look at the sum of Fisher distributed variables. (Possible Solution) From the Characteristic Functions the average of $n-$summed $X^2$ has the same first two moments of a $F(n,\alpha)$ distribution when these exist. Hence with u the square root and doing a change of variable inside a probability distribution, the density of the standard deviation of n-sample T variables can be approximated with: $$g(u)=\frac{2 \alpha ^{\alpha /2} n^{n/2} u^{n-1} \left(\alpha +n u^2\right)^{-\frac{\alpha }{2}-\frac{n}{2}}}{B\left(\frac{n}{2},\frac{\alpha }{2}\right)}$$
