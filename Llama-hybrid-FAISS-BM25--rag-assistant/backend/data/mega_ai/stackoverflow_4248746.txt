Help me understand question related to HashMap in Java

Im given a task which i am a little confused to understand. Here is the question statement: The following program should read a file and store all its tokens in a member variable. Your task is to write a single method that returns the number of items in tokenMap, the average length (as double value) of the elements in tokenMap, and the number of tokens starting with character "a". Here the tokenMap is an object of type HashMap ; I do have some idea about HashMap but what i want to know the "key value" for HashMap required is a single character or the whole word?? that i should store in tokenMap. Also how can i compute the average length?
