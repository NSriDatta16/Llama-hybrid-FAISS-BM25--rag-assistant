The $l_i$ do not correspond to anything in your dataset. Logistic regression is fit via Maximum Likelihood which seeks to assign $p^*$ to observations such that the binomial log likelihood is maximized. That is, given covariates $x$ and a binary outcome, we can assign a probability $p^*$ that future observations with covariates $x$ will yield an outcome of 1. So we don't fit the $l_i$ , we fit the $p^*$ .
