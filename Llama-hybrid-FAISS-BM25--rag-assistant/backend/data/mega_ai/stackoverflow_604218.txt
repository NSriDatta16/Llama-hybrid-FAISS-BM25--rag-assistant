How do I add a link to a file in PdfSharp?

I can't seem to get PdfSharp to show a picture for this annotation. It doesn't have the PdfAnnotation.Icon property, so I can't set that. XFont font = new XFont("Verdana", 10); PdfPage page = wDoc.Parent.Page; XGraphics gfx = wDoc.Parent.gfx; XRect rec = gfx.Transformer.WorldToDefaultPage(new XRect(new XPoint(30, 60), new XSize(30, 30))); PdfRectangle rect = new PdfRectangle(rec); PdfLinkAnnotation link = PdfLinkAnnotation.CreateFileLink(rect, wDoc.FileLocation); gfx.DrawString("These files were attached:", font, XBrushes.Black, 30, 50, XStringFormat.Default); link.Rectangle = new PdfRectangle(rec); page.Annotations.Add(link); I've gotten it that far, and the annotation DOES exist, except it's a blank box! How do I go about making it say something, or even just show a picture?
