It sounds like you have a UINavigationController as the main VC of your app, and a UITabBarController as one of the VC's on its stack. I believe Apple actively discourages people from doing this in their apps, and so do I. It is never done in the iOS itself, and I have never seen it in any third-party apps either, so users will probably be confused. I think you should embed the UINavigationController inside the UITabBarController instead of the other way around, or you could just choose to use another way of showing what you want to show.
