Your ANOVA is meaningless. What you need to do is 1) Organize your data as following: Year C Group 1991 9.23244802 1 1992 0 1 ........ 2018 x.xxxxx 5 2) Fit the model $$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X +\beta_2G_2 + \beta_3G_3 +\beta_4G_4 +\beta_5G_5 +\beta_6G_2X +\beta_7G_3X +\beta_8G_4X +\beta_9G_5X + \epsilon$$ where $X$ = year and $G_i = 1$ if group = $i$ , otherwise = 0, for $i=2,...,5$ . 3) Test the multiple null hypothesis $H_o: \beta_6= \beta_7=\beta_8=\beta_9=0$ . If $H_o$ is rejected, it means at least two slopes are different. Otherwise, there is not enough evidence to say that 5 slopes are not the same.
