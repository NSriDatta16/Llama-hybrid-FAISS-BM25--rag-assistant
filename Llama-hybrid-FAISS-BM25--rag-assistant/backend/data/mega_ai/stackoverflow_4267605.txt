Your solution works fine, except that I want this to work only after I press space (this is what is meant by non-word character, right? So, I am typing a non-word character, only it doesn't work in all cases) I don't get it. Why does it matter that other text follows, if I still press space? thanks though, this is much better than the previous one not working at all! @chris morgan: oddly, it's working for me too, sometimes, in an empty document. If I load up a tex document (latex-suite package), it's impossible. But I m not sure it's latex-suite specific. Sometimes this happens for .txt documents, too..
