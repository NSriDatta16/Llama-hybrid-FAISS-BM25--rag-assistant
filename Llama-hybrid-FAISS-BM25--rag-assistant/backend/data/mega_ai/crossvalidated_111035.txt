What does the name "Logistic Regression" mean?

I am checking an implementation of Logistic Regression from here . After I reading that article, it seems the important part is the find the best coefficients to determine the sigmoid function. So I just wonder why this method is called "Logistic Regression". Is it related to the logarithmic function? Maybe I need some historical background info to understand it better.
