To test if you're getting html you can use URL.openConnection() to get a UrlConnection can then call getContentType() which should return "text/html" for an HTML page. You can then use the getInputStream() method on the UrlConnection() as a drop in replacement for url.openStream(); If you actually want to validate that the content the server is sending you is HTML you'd need to find an HTML validation library. I don't know of one off-hand, sorry. Something to consider, which may be why www.smu.com returns no data, is that a number of websites will serve different data depending on the User-Agent string sent on the HTTP connection. You may need to modify that on your UrlConnection with: UrlConnection.addRequestProperty("User-Agent", ...); See more info here : Setting user agent of a java URLConnection
