How to get a http page using mechanize cookies?

There is a Python mechanize object with a form with almost all values set, but not yet submitted. Now I want to fetch another page using cookies from mechanize instance, but without resetting the page, forms and so on, e.g. so that the values remain set (I just need to get body string of another page, nothing else). So is there a way to: Tell mechanize not to reset the page (perhaps, through UserAgentBase )? Make urllib2 use mechanize's cookie jar? NB: urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor(self.br._ua_handlers["_cookies"].cookiejar) doesn't work Any other way to pass cookie to urllib ?
