Be warned that you're not going to get good results if you don't require training first. Speech recognition is a statistical application of phonetics, a field which is pretty frank about the fact that there's so much variation in the signal that it's almost a miracle anyone can understand what anyone else says. An off-the-shelf speech recognition engine will most likely tend towards a more general accent of English, but will fail miserably for anything even slightly different. That's why training is so important. We can do well by overfitting with ease, especially if we reduce the problem space. But creating an extensible machine learning solution? Therein always lies the rub. That being says, consider Sphinx-4. It's an off-the-shelf solution written in Java available at http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/
