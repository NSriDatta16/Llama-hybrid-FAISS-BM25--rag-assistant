Zend Session DB Handler and Serialized Data

We are using Zend Framework 1.7 on a project (old, I know) and just made a change to move the session data from files to the database. This appears to be working fine in both environments we deployed it in. However, there is one big difference: in environment A (PHP 5.2), the session data is being stored in a plaintext serialized format, e.g.: key|[php serialized array] In environment B (PHP 5.3), the data appears to be getting base64 encoded somehow: IpgJ4fbSZ0v2qi4RmGcgQ9tP7YEUyN1R9-7oroGl4071fnlk_UVkkrkUcpdHdw_UsRYy-6NpL61gTuL2Htcmv3HU5UM3ClwSDndY40kyimDPs3SdS7gNHwhwdpailLOfrIxqV48hZDhNHKlIpSX2QZm0jOHjRhZc2kjXnMgqioLqJiDdgyUCRnqKcZ_ZtBISq8BAZARW61P5Ls_ZSO506ltuNqIJIJGkV2R7qvDKLLCtxUQUwd7P8IlJiC7iq_Q4GIn3gMr0KwAHLP6adzxSusVk5begrx9lBk9Dxp8KkJ8Gx8rfKJfvVBIJKZgmsFsWq41dV0J4y1Lgihvx9nU73g.. Both environments appear to be working otherwise, but I need to make sure we understand why this is happening, and I can't seem to find any documentation or similar situation anywhere. My assumption is that the difference in PHP version and/or configuration in php.ini is influencing it, but I am at a loss as to how.
