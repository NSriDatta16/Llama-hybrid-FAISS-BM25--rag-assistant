Try without the extra (parentheses) if error? error: try [secretAgent/firstName] [ probe disarm error ] REBOL 2 errors are hair trigger. Your error was triggered in bubbling up one set of parentheses, rather than trapped. See the difference here: if error? error: try [0 / 0] [print ['bad mold disarm error]] if error? (error: try [0 / 0]) [print ['bad mold disarm error]] REBOL 3 error handling is slightly different -- disarm is not longer necessary, for example.
