There are a number of ways of determining the distance between two points, but for plotting points on a 2-D graph you probably want the Euclidean distance . If (x1, y1) represents your first point and (x2, y2) represents your second, the distance is d = sqrt( (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 ) Regarding grouping, you may want to use some sort of 2-D mean to determine how "close" things are to each other. For example, if you have three points, (x1, y1) , (x2, y2) , (x3, y3) , you can find the center of these three points by simple averaging: x(mean) = (x1+x2+x3)/3 y(mean) = (y1+y2+y3)/3 You can then see how close each is to the center to determine whether it should be part of the "cluster". There are a number of ways one can define clusters, all of which use some variant of a clustering algorithm . I'm in a rush now and don't have time to summarize, but check out the link and the algorithms, and hopefully other people will be able to provide more detail. Good luck!
