How to check if Tomcat runnning using Embedded Tomcat

In reference with one of the articles: Howto embed Tomcat 6? I understood how to embed tomcat in a java application. Thanks for that. However I need to know if there is any elegant method provided by org.apache.catalina.startup.Embedded to check if the container is already started or not? For example, if I create a batch file for the example given in the link above and click it twice; second time it would fail with JVM_BIND error; tomcat is running. Please help.
