if you want to avoid "key lookup", use covered index create index ix_QueryMembership_NameHere on QueryMembership (QueryID) include (PersonID); add more column names, that you gonna select in include arguments. for the point that, why PK's "key lookup" working so slow, try DBCC FREEPROCCACHE , ALTER INDEX ALL ON QueryMembership REBUILD , ALTER INDEX ALL ON QueryMembership REORGANIZE This may help if your PK's index is disabled, or cache keeps wrong plan.
