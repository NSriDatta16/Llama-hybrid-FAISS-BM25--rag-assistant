Javascript Namespacing. Does it increase JS/Browser performance?

SO i totally understand why we should namespace in javascript, but is it mainly for organizational purposes and to keep the global namespace uncluttered?. Does namepacing actually help in performance of the browser/JS engine. Just wondering what your thoughts were. Thanks
