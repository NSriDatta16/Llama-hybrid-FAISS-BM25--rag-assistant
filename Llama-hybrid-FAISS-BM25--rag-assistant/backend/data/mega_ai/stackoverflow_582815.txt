CKRet/Quintin , thank you for the fast responses. A quick try with this code seems better and breakpointing and stepping through the code seems to be firing the events correctly. I'm fairly new to .NET as the last real VB programming I did was VB6 so I'm not sure if this is the most elegant way to solve the problem. Also a note that when LastEventHandler = Nothing, calling the RemoveHandler does not throw an exception, which is quite nice. Maybe I should suggest to MS they should update that article. Private Sub DGUserBets_EditingControlShowing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewEditingControlShowingEventArgs) Handles DGUserBets.EditingControlShowing Dim combo As ComboBox = CType(e.Control, ComboBox) Static LastEventHandler As EventHandler If (combo IsNot Nothing) Then // Remove an existing event-handler, if present, to avoid // adding multiple handlers when the editing control is reused. RemoveHandler combo.SelectedIndexChanged, _ LastEventHandler LastEventHandler = New EventHandler(AddressOf DGUBStake_SelectedIndexChanged) // Add the event handler. AddHandler combo.SelectedIndexChanged, _ LastEventHandler End If End Sub
