Paraphrase recognition using sentence level similarity

I'm a new entrant to NLP (Natural Language Processing). As a start up project, I'm developing a paraphrase recognizer (a system which can recognize two similar sentences). For that recognizer I'm going to apply various measures at three levels, namely: lexical, syntactic and semantic. At the lexical level, there are multiple similarity measures like cosine similarity, matching coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, et cetera. For these measures I'm using the simMetrics package developed by the University of Sheffield which contains a lot of similarity measures. But for the Levenshtein distance and Jaro-Winkler distance measures, the code is only at character level , whereas I require code at the sentence level (i.e. considering a single word as a unit instead of character-wise). Additionally, there is no code for computing the Manhattan distance in SimMetrics . Are there any suggestions for how I could develop the required code (or someone provide me the code) at the sentence level for the above mentioned measures? Thanks a lot in advance for your time and effort helping me.
