According to a blog entry MbUnit v3 and Gallio alpha 1 , So whats going on here, Gallio is a neutral test platform that is an off shoot from the work we had done on MbUnit v3. Gallio is both a common framework and a set of runners for testing tools. MbUnit v3 uses Gallio as its native test platform, Gallio can also as Jeff mentions run MbUnit, NUnit and XUnit.net tests. For both migration purposes and to help improve how you are using your existing test framework we hope this will prove useful. We still have a lot of work to do but make no secrets of what we are up to, check out our road map. I do want to draw attention to the work we are doing with our new runners. Starting with Icarus, our new GUI. So, "Gallio is a neutral test platform" and "Icarus, [their] new GUI."
