Removing controls in a loop

Yesterday I wrote a piece of code to remove all the controls in a form that fulfills certain criteria. Writing it naively, this is what I come up with. for (int i = 0; i But it so happens that the code is wrong. I then change it to: foreach (Control ctr in this.pbBoardImage.Controls) { if (ctr.Length == 2) { this.Controls.Remove(ctr); } } But it still wasn't correct. I know that the correct way would be: for (int i = this.Controls.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--) { if (this.Controls[i].Name.Length == 2) { this.Controls.Remove(this.Controls[i]); } } However it still doesn't feel elegant. I couldn't use List.RemoveAll, since this.Controls wasn't a List. So can I ask for a more elegant way, preferably without using a loop?
