Neural network for generating interesting sets

I'm facing the following problem: There are $n$ items $U=\{i_1,...,1_n\}$ . I have many examples $X$ where $X\subseteq P[U]$ (the power set of $U$ ). The goal is to create a system that given these examples, learns to generate "interesting subsets". By "interesting" I mean subsets that their elements have high correlations, but their support doesn't have to be very high. Also, there could be situations where different parts of a subset appear in the examples and I want to generate the corresponding subset, i.e.: Example 1 - $\{A,B,C\}$ Example 2 - $\{B,C,D\}$ Example 3 - $\{A,C\}$ Example 4 - $\{A,D\}$ I would expect the system to generate the subset $\{A,B,C,D\}$ where $A,B,C,D\in U$ . I tought about training a $GAN$ that learns to generate binary vectors with indices correspnding to the items, i.e. $G(z)\in \{0,1\}^{|U|}$ , but I'm not sure if there's much theoretical justice for that. Other approaches I considered are Apriori algorithm but I ended up conviced that it is not appropriate for the specific task. I Also thought about training a bayesian network, with nodes as bernouli variables indicating the occurence of each item, but it falls because I have hundreds of items, and it makes the training impractical for $BN's$ . I'll be happy to hear more approachs on how to tackle this problem.
