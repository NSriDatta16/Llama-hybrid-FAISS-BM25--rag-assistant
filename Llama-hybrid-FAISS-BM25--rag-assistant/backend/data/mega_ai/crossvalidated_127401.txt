The forecasts are not flat. The prediction intervals are extremely wide and highly skewed, so you can't see the variation in the point forecasts. Most likely the point forecasts are actually reasonable, but the prediction intervals are clearly not. You could try a regression model with Fourier terms for the seasonality, and ARMA errors for the remaining time series dynamics, applied to the logged data.
