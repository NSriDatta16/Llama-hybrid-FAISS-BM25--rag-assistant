Seeing as this is probably not Python related, but a Windows problem (I for one could not reproduce the error given your code), I'd suggest attaching a debugger to the Python interpreter when it is started. Since you start the interpreter implicitly by a drag&drop action, you need to configure Windows to auto-attach a debugger each time Python starts. If I remember correctly, this article has the needed information to do that (you can substitute another debugger if you are not using Visual Studio). Apart from that, I would take a snapshot with ProcMon while dragging a file onto your script, to get an idea of what is going on.
