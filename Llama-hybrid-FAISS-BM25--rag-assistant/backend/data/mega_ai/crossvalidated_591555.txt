Logistic regression with mixed effect and rare events - warning in lme4::glmer

I feel this is related to r glmer warnings: model fails to converge & model is nearly unidentifiable , and I think that the reason why the model fit fails (?) is that I have too rare events(?). Sadly, my understanding of the topic is not quite at a level where I would know how to deal with that. I admit the solutions in the linked thread answering the related question are a bit over my level and I am also not sure if they are appropriate for my problem. I don't think I have multicollinearity, but I simply think that I have to few TRUE events (see the table in below reprex code). I have a binary outcome variable (TRUE/FALSE) - this is an event that happens or not when starting a therapy in an individual. There are repeated measures per individual, (more than one therapy start). I therefore believe that I need to fit a logistic regression with mixed effect, and I thought lme4::glmer would be my friend. However - I have this warning. I would highly appreciate your help what I can do to deal with this problem.
