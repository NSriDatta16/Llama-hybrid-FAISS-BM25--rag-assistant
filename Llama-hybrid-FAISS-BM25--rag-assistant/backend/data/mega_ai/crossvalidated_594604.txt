why the residuals need to have constant variance in layman's terms The assumption of homogeneity of variance is important for inference on the coefficients of the model (which are interpreted as the average effects of the variable on the outcome). The sampling variance of the coefficient $\beta_1$ (the slope) in a linear regression involves the estimated variance $$ \mathrm{Var}\left(\hat{\beta}_1\right)=\sigma^2 /\left[\mathrm{SST}_1\left(1-R_1^2\right)\right]$$ If $\sigma^2$ is not constant (e.g. is a function of the predictor), then the variance is misspecified and hence the standard error (and consequently confidence intervals and p values) will also be incorrect. When homogeneity of variance is violated, there exist methods for correcting the standard errors. See "robust standard errors" or "the sandwich estimator"
