To design a Multilayer Perceptron, should I use more units per layer and less layers or more layers and less units, which is better?

I feel confused about how to design a Multilayer Perceptron(MLP). I have read a number of papers about how to design a deep CNN structure, like VGG or ResNet. However, for a Multilayer perceptron, a more basic ANN structure, should I follow this trend to make the MLP deeper? Actually, I try some trials on python that stacking more layers in one network, but the result showed it make no sense. Therefore, I just wanna ask the question above. can anybody give me some suggestions?
