One thing that's useful for analysis of time series like this is to explicitly break out the frequency dependent features, rather than trusting that your model will discover them. Do a wavelet transform and you'll quickly get both enough data that deep learning is sensible and you'll expose a number of useful features for the model. I am not yet aware of papers investigating what sort of masks are most useful for CNNs on wavelet data, but I haven't looked. You might be able to find some prior work.
