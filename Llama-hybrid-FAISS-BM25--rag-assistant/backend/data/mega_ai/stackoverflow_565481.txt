Since the String constructing doesn't work have you tried just constructing it your self? android.net.URI auri = new android.net.URI(what ever); java.net.URI juri = new java.net.URI(auri.getSchema(), auri.getSchemaSpecificPart(), auri.getFragment()); You might also want to double check that your getting valid data out of Android URI class. The docs as listed in my other answer discuss how it does pretty much no error checking. If there is infact an error the class just spits out garbage anyway and doesn't throw any exceptions. Which could very likely be why the java class which does do validation is throwing an exception.
