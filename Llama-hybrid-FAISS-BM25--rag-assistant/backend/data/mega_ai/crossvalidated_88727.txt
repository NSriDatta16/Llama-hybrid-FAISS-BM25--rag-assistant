If I understand your problem correctly, this should be possible. Although you're not dealing with an active learning problem, it does remind me of one approach in that domain . One technique people use to identify samples that need expert annotation, in support vector machine-driven active learning, is data points are identified that, if their predicted class were to change, it would most greatly affect the position of the decision boundary. You may be able to approach quantifying the change in decision cost using a technique like this. Are you using SVMs for your classifier? If so, this might be a good approach. If not, you may be able to go about it by avoiding over-ridding the classifier decision on those cases that would lead to more frequent misclassifications in your already-labeled data.
