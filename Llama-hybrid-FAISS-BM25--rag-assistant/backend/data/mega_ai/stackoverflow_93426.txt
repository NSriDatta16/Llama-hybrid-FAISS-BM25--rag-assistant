Modeling is creating an abstraction of a problem, where as programming is the implementation of such an abstraction. Modeling can be done in many ways: textual, formulas, diagrams... UML is one standard of modeling object oriented concepts. Programming can be done in different ways too, depending on the tool, language etc. There are ways to generate the program right out of the modeling tool, typically out of UML models. This goes even a step further, where UML models are "executed" directly. Other common confusions about object-oriented programming exist too - starting from "it's the thing where your drag and click", over hybrid 3rd generation concepts I refer to as "processing Objects" to practical patterns and ending with pure OOP.
