I wanted to tell you that I solved it differently: I have not solved it as a time series, but as follows: I surrender my network The features as input, and get as output a real value (call volume) This works very well, and Even without exogenous factors. Also I use the coding you suggested to me to ensure the neighborhood (unit circle, with cos and sin formula). The question I ask myself is why does it have advantages, for example, to pass the day of the week as two parameters instead of coding it as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7? My mathematics knowledge is unfortunately not so good, to understand immediately. Do you have a good explanation for me? Do you think I would get the same results if I encode my data differently? So if I give it only as a parameter with, but normal normalize them between 0-1 @CagdasOzgenc
