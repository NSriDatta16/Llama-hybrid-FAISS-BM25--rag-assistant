NCover with a C++/CLI assembly

Does anybody know how to do coverage of an C++/CLI class using NCover? NCover only measures coverage of an assembly if it finds a matching .pdb file. However, my C++/CLI project does not output a .pdb file. If I go to "Visual Studio -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Output Files -> Program Database File Name" and set it to "MyDll.pdb" it actually outputs a file called "MyDLL.idb"!?
