Is the result of feature extraction a feature representation?

If a use a feature extraction method on images, do I then get a feature representation or is there a different meaning behind feature representation? To my understanding, when I use a CNN on an image the convolutional layers perform feature extraction. Can I then also say that I get a new feature representation after each of these layers? Thanks in advance! I am relatively new to machine learning...
