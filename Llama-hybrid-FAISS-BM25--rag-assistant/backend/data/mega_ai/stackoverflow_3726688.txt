Actually, this starts to look more and more like a compiler application. In fact, if I remember correctly, the Aho Dragon compiler book uses a regex example to build a DFA compiler. That's the place to start. This could be a really cool compiler project. If that is too much, you can approach it as an optimization in several passes to refine it further and further, but it will be all predefined algo's at first: First pass: Want to match Cat, Catches cans Result: /Cat|Catches|Cans/ Second Pass: Look for similar starting conditions: Result: /Ca(t|tches|ans)/ Second Pass: Look for similar ending conditions: Result: /Ca(t|tch|an)s*/ Third Pass: Look for more refinements like repetitions and negative conditions
