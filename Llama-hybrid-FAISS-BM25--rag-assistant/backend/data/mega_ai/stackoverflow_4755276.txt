When you install a Silverlight application to run OOB, it creates a directory in isolated storage which has an index.htm page in it that actually "hosts" the OOB application. (It's described here: http://debuggingblog.com/wp/2009/07/17/silverlight-3-outofbrowseroob-explained-and-how-to-host-any-xap-package-by-modifying-the-metadata/ ). One way to do what you need to do is to edit that index.htm page, and pass in the parameters there. Of course, you'd need to figure out how to edit that page (likely hard to do automatically, unless you've got a setup.exe). Would it make more sense to just prompt the user for their userid/password? You'd only need to do it once -- after that, you could store it in a configuration file in some well-known location (presumably encrypted or at least obfuscated in some fashion).
