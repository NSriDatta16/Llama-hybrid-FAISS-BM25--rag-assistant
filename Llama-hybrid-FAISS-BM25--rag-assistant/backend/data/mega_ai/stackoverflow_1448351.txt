Creating a ToolBox component with design-time support using a UserControl

I have a UserControl for Windows Forms. How can I convert it to a component? What I want to do is, to add it to the VS toolbox, add it to form with drag and drop at design-time and change its Location and Dock properties using the Properties window. What should I look for to do this? I've created something similar before but it was a Component class. I can add it to the VS toolbox, add it to the form with drag and drop and change its custom properties using the Properties window but since it's a component it shows on bottom component area and has no design-time support.
