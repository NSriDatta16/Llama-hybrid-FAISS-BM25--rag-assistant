When 2% of the Bayesian Model have not converged?

I have model with 20000 latent parameters, set up in a Gibb's sampler. 98% of the parameters and sometimes 99.5% of the parameters satisfy the Geweke convergence statistic, have low autocorrelation at a lag of 10 and have a good effective sample size. My parameters of interest are in the 98%. Running the chain to 100000 iterations doesn't really change much. What are my options? Similar to this one If all components of a hierarchical model have not converged, can we say that any parameters have truly converged? and Latent variables, overparameterization and MCMC convergence in bayesian models
