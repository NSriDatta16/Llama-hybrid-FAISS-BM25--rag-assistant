Multiple peak fit - decomposing a graph into visible and hidden peaks of the same probability distribution

I have a graph as a set of coordinates (x, y), where x is a progressing time and y is proportional to an amount of molecules (chromatography results). Visible peaks on the graph look like of gamma distribution (but not necessarily, could be Weibull, Poison or Normal-skewed). I need to decompose the graph into multiple signals of the same probability distribution (gamma or other), which are presented either by visible peaks or by internal/hidden ones, located anywhere under graph's curve. Desired results would look like this: The existence of the internal ones is inferred after fitting distributions to visible peaks first and then calculating differences between the sum of visible peaks fitted models slopes and the original graph curve. nls() will not work for this problem, since it will miss the internal peaks/signals (besides the fact that it is sensitive to start parameters). And probably ALS package (or others) would do the job, but I am loosing myself in its input structure and descriptions. My math knowledge is not sufficient. Looking for some existing elegant solution/tool in R. Could anybody please advise!
