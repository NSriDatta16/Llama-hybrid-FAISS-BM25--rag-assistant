Yes indeed they are related because both are used to predict $y_{n}$ and $s_{n}$ at time step n based on some current observation $x_{n}$ and state $s_{n-1}$ i.e. they both represent a function $F$ such that $$F(x_{n}, s_{n-1}) = (y_{n}, s_{n})$$ The advantage of the RNN over Kalman filter is that the RNN architecture can be arbitrarily complex (number of layers and neurons) and its parameters are learnt , whereas the algorithm (including its parameters) of Kalman filter is fixed. Recurrent Neural Networks are more general than Kalman filter. One could actually train a RNN to simulate a Kalman filter. Neural nets are kind of black box models and weights and activations are very often not interpretable (above all in the deeper layers). In the end neural nets are only optimized to make the best predictions and not to have "interpretable" parameters. Nowadays if you work on time series, have enough data and want the best accuracy, RNN is the preferred approach.
