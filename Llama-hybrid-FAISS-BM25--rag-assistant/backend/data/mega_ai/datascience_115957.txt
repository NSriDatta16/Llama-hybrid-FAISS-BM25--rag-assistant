How to design and use CNNs for sentence classification?

I'm playing around with using CNNs for sentence classification. Basically all models I found implement the same model proposed in Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification (Kim, 2014), where multiple convolutional layers are used in "parallel" for different window sizes (reflecting different n-gram sizes): I even implemented the model , and it works fine. However, now I have 2 main questions now: Is there something "intuitive" these filters are learning? For example, in the case of image classification, these first/early filters typically learns basic edges in different directions. Can we say anything similar in case of sentence classification. Why haven't I seen CNN models for sentence classification with multiple sequential convolutional layers? Is there some intrinsic reason why this is not a good idea in case of text data?
