Find multiple patterns with a single preg_match_all in PHP

Using PHP and preg_match_all I'm trying to get all the HTML content between the following tags (and the tags also): paragraph text don't take this item 1 item 2 don't take this table content I can get one of them just fine: preg_match_all("( (.*) )siU", $content, $matches, PREG_SET_ORDER); Is there a way to get all the content with a single preg_match_all? I need them to come out in the order they were found so I can echo the content and it will make sense. So if I did a preg_match_all on the above content then iterated through the $matches array it would echo: paragraph text item 1 item 2 table content
