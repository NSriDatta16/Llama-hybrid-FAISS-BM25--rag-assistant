The component has a virtual method IsCustomDrawn() which is called to determine which code paths need to be executed. In the base class implementation it checks whether any of the event handlers to paint the subitems is assigned, but you can override the method to return True for all those paint stages you want handled, even when there is no event handler assigned. If you want to handle everything in code you should probably override CustomDrawItem() and CustomDrawSubItem() and do everything there. To get everything working I would build the app with debug DCUs, step into from event handlers and look around what the minimum amount of code you can get away with is. The important method to check out is TCustomListView.CNNotify() - here the Windows messages for owner drawing are handled. Edit: I forgot to add that you should try to not owner draw the text in the control, but just to set canvas properties in the various paint stages - the reason being that otherwise you will have to make sure that text output is pixel-perfect in all Windows versions, something that the VCL doesn't achieve. You can see this by adding a few columns and rows to a list view and toggling the OwnerDraw property at design time, the text jumps around.
