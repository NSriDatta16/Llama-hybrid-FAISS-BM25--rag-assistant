It can. In fact, your second paragraph implies the first paragraph. Assume NP-hard problem H is polynomially reducible to problem X. By definition, there exists an NP-complete problem C that is polynomially reducible to H. Since both reductions are polynomial, you can reduce C to X in polynomial time. Therefore, NP-complete problem C is reducible to X in polynomial time. Therefore problem X is NP-hard.
