JAGS does not allow directed cycles (parameters being used to define themselves), so you can't use y to define the parents of y. That means that if y appears on the left hand of a distribution, then it can't also appear on the right (even if it is fully observed as in your case). Technically speaking, it is sufficient to use the following: y[i] ~ dnorm(y.hat[i], tau / dummy_y[i]) You just then define dummy_y from y (in R) and include it as data for JAGS. This prevents JAGS from seeing the directed cycle ... which arguably does not fix the problem but does at least make the error go away. However, a better solution is to define the functional relationship for tau based on x (or possibly y.hat) instead: y[i] ~ dnorm(y.hat[i], effective_tau[i]) effective_tau[i] I would also think more carefully about this relationship - if x (or y.hat if you use that) is negative, then effective_tau becomes negative and you have a problem. Assuming this is a linear relationship on whatever the scale is x observed is also probably a strong assumption (although I have no idea about your application so can't really comment on this). Writing the effective_tau out like I have done above allows you to more easily define other relationships, e.g.: log(effective_tau[i]) This multiple-GLM-in-1-model approach is one of the big advantages of MCMC (when used wisely).
