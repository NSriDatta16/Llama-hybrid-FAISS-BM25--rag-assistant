If you're targeting OS 4.5 and later, all I can say is good luck. BlackBerry support for HTML was pretty poor in older devices, and you're hit and miss at best with anything more than the most basic use of JavaScript. I've had very little luck with anything other than non-dynamic HTML websites with the older browsers. With OS 5.0 and later you have a lot more options. Support for the Gears APIs and better JavaScript. The Widget SDK even lets you easily create HTML/JS based 'Widgets' for BlackBerry that can contain a bunch of pre-cached data. BlackBerry 6 of course, with its WebKit based browser and HTML5 support can do pretty much anything that iOS or Android devices can. So my recommendation is to only go dynamic if you can target 5.0 and later. Or potentially a site that degrades gracefully to browsers that don't support JS well (either user agent detection or some fancy JS coding) and users with older devices have to deal with a slower experience.
