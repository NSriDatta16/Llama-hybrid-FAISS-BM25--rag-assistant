Say you know you want n members per team. Then create a local variable which is n*mean where mean is the average skill level per person. Then when your randomly selecting your team members do so within that limit. E.g. while(new random record){ if(team_skill+random person skill > n*mean){ next; } if(team_skill+random person skill
