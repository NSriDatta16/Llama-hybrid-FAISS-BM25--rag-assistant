How to extract a div section from one xhtml document into another xhtml document

I'm trying to extract a div section from an xhtml document into another xhtml document by using xslt. However, I did not succeed. Rather, the xslt transformation resulted in a wired output. Suppose the following xhtml document to transform: title test some blabla hello world! some other blabla test paragraph The xslt should extract the div section with the id "testid" and write it into a new xhtml document which should look as follows: title test hello world! My xslt code looks as follows: The output actually is as follows: de title test some blabla testidtestclass hello world! some other blabla test paragraph What do I need to change in the xslt in order to get the correct results? Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
