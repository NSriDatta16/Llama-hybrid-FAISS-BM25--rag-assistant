Gibbs Sampling doesn't explicitly require you to know $Z$ . It requires you to sample from the full conditionals , i.e. $\frac{1}{Z}f(\alpha|\text{rest})$ , in some way which means knowing $Z$ already, or approximating it via various MCMC methods (e.g. Metropolis-Hastings, choosing suitable proposal function etc.) as @baruuum pointed out. So, if you imagine the case that you have a black-box doing the sampling step for you given the target function, (i.e. you just call sample method); Gibbs depends on it, but doesn't need $Z$ to be known since the sampling step is actually doing the integration for you implicitly.
