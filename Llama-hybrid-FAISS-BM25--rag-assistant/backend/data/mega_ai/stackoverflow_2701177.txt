There's a class like that in Magento. Well, it's got a lot more stuff in it, but the philosophy is the same: add some magic method goodness to the rest of your classes via inheritance. They named it Varien_Object, Varien being the name of the company. I've also got something like this in a custom framework I've helped build. It's just called Base. I guess what I'm trying to say is... no matter what you call it, it wont help people understand what it does until they go through the code. Don't worry about it too much, by the time you're done it'll be buried so deep in your app that the only people that find it will be the kind that can grok what it does fairly quickly anyway
