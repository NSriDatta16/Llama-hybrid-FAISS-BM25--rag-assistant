Classes are a way to organize programs. Classes can be used to represent entities in the real world, or artifacts in our programming world, reducing the complexity of programs by allowing us to reason about them in terms of a higher granularity. It is well-known in psychology that experts organize knowledge into "chunks" to allow them to reason more easily and quickly about their domain. Classes allow us to reason more easily and quickly about our programs. In addition, classes allow us to group together the knowledge about an entity together with the methods/procedures/functions/operations that are naturally associated with that entity. Again, this provides a natural way to organize the information in our programs. There are other advantages of classes, such as inheritance, but primarily classes are a cognitive way of organizing program structure to reduce the complexity.
