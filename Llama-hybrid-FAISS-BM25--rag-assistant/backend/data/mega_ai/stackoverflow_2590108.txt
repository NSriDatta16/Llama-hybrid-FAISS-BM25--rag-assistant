Getting the value of an xml attribute with Applescript

I want to parse the Yahoo! Weather API and I want to save these element attributes to variables for later use: How can I do this with applescript? So, set locationCity to [city] set locationRegion to [reagion] set locationCountry to [country] set astronomySunrise to [sunriseTime] set astronomySunset to [sunsetTime] I want the forcasts to be in an array of some sort to organize them by day/date
