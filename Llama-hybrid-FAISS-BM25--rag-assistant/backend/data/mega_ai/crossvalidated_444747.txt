Does a mixed model make sense in this case?

Suppose I am modeling the sales by week for all 50 states in the United States for a beverage company and I want to see the effect of marketing on sales. Would adding a fixed effect and a random interaction by state make sense mathematically? Or are there issues with matrix invertability or any other issues? I know random effects are typically added if the level is drawn at random from a population of levels for that factor in experimental design so want to know if it makes sense in this case. I would then derive the final coefficient of the marketing variable as the sum of the fixed effect coefficient and random effect coefficient.
