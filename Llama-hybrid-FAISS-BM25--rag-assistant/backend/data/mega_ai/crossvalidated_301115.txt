Do RNNs such as LSTM only provide value for sequences where order matters?

I understand how LSTM can be useful for time-series or a series of words in order, but I'm curious if LSTM would provide benefit when the ordering of the inputs is not controlled. For example, assume I'm trying to make a binary classification decision. My input is a list of 10 User IDs fed through an embedding, and that embedding sequence is fed into an LSTM and out into a single dense output node. If those user IDs can appear in any order, does using RNN/LSTM provide any value?
