Modify HTTP Headers for a JSONP request

I am using jquery to build a request to the Twitter Search API. I am using jsonp, as is needed for cross-domain requests. However, the Twitter API specifies that you should set a unique User-Agent for these requests, and limits your requests if you do not. The problem is, I see no way of setting this header via jquery. This is the code I am using: $.ajax({ url: 'http://search.twitter.com/search.json', dataType: 'jsonp', type: 'get', data: { q: 'twitter' }, success: function(data) { alert(data.results); } }); I have tried using the beforeSend method, but it appears that this event is not firing. Can anyone come up with any way of solving this problem? Thanks.
