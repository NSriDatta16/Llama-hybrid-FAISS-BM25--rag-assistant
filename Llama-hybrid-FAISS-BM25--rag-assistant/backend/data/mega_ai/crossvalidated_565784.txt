We can rewrite the expression as: $$E{\frac {X}{X+c}}=1-cE{\frac {1}{X+c}}=1-c\int {\frac 1 {x+c}}p_X(dx)=1-cH_{p_X}(-c)$$ where $H_{p}$ denotes the Hilbert transform of the density $p$ . The wikipedia page gives a few examples of distributions for which the Hilbert transform has a closed form (in particular, the case of uniform distributions), but there is not any kind of explicit expression in general.
