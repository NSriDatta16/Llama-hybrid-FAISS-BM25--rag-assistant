XGBOOST : model.predict_proba() and model.predict() conflicting behaviour

I have two classes 1 and 2: The output of model.predict_proba() : [0.333,0.6667] The output of model.predict() : 1 This is happening for around 200 test values out of the test data of 10 lac. For all other records, both the functions' outputs do not conflict. Even if the probability of class 2 is higher, the predict function gives the final class as 1. What could be the reason for the output of model.predict() and model.predict_proba() not syncing with each other for those 200 records?
