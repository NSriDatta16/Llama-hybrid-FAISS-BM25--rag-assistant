One notion might be helpful: data (datum) and copies. If you declare a variable, let's say a byte, it resides somewhere in the memory, in a data segment (roughly speaking). There are 8 bits somewhere in the memory devoted to store that piece of information. However, there can be several copies of that data, moving around in your machine. For various technical reasons, e.g. thread's local storage, compiler optimizations. And if we have several copies, they might be out of sync. So you should always keep this notion in mind. It's true not only for java class fields, but for cpp variables, database records (the record state data gets copied into several sessions etc.). Variables, their hidden/visible copies and the subtle syncing issues will be around forever.
