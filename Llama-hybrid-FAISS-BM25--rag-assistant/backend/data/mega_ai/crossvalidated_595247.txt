Which regression coefficient should be used to calculate Odds ratio? Standardized or unstandardized?

I've run a multilevel logistic regression in R, and I want to calculate the Odds Ratios for the predictors in the model. R automatically gives the unstandardized regression coefficients for a multilevel log regression, do I need to first standardize the predictors before calculating Odds ratio? In simple words: is Odds ratio the exponentiated beta(standardized) coefficient, or is it the exponentiated unstandardized coefficient? I've seen people use both so I am confused as to what's the right way.
