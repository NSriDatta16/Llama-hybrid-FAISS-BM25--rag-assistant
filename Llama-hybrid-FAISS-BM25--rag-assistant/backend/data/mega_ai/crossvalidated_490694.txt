Problem understanding the representation of a cellular automaton using a CNN

I am having problems understanding how the author in " Cellular automata as convolutional neural networks " is representing a CA with a CNN. Specifically in appendix A we have: I don't understand two things, How filters of dimension $M$ are applied on a lattice of dimensions $L\times L\times(M+1)$ in the second step and How the result is something useful, i.e. what the $L\times L\times M$ resulting lattice is exactly representing.
