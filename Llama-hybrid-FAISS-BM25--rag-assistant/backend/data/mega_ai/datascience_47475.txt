The first step is to place all your variables on the same dataframe, so a date row would have a complete set of information for that specific date. The second step is to understand the data and make sure the data make sense. At this stage you have three different data set with a different number of rows. The exact same variable "order" has three different values across the three tables. Does that make sense? You also have only 5 somewhat random data points. I think with just 5 random data points, you won't have enough information to develop a model that is anymore predictive than a simple average. Train ticket sales is most probably very highly seasonal (vacation, holidays, workweek, commuters, etc.). To do a good model I would venture you need at least a few years of data so you can observe the seasonal pattern from year to year. If you are just learning data science, I may suggest start with another data set that is a heck of a lot larger than this. Here you have literally nothing to work with.
