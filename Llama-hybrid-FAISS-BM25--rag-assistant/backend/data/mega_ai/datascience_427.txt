Does anyone use Julia programming language?

Is anyone using Julia ( http://julialang.org/ ) for professional jobs? Or using it instead of R, Matlab, or Mathematica? Is it a good language? If you have to predict next 5-10 years: Do you think it grow up enough to became such a standard in data science like R or similar?
