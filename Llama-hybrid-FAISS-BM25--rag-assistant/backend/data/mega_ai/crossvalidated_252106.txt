What is the definition of clustering problems in probability terms?

Say that $\mathcal{X}$ is the samples set and $X$ is a r.v. that takes value in it, and $\mathcal{Y}$ is the labels set with $Y$ a r.v. that takes value in it. Classification problems are easily represented in probability terms. For example, when we wish to classify some sample $x \in \mathcal{X}$ our goal i to find $\hat y$ that solves this: $$ \hat y = \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\text{args max }} \Pr(Y=y|X=x) $$ That definition represents the optimum classification problem solver. We can say that all supervised learning algorithms (e.g. SVM, RF, etc) try to estimate that conditional-probability maximizer above. The definition is generic, simple, and commonly found in books/Internet. But the challenge that I am facing is how to define clustering problems in probability terms, i.e. similar to what I showed earlier for classification, but for clustering instead. My attempt Let's say that $\mathcal{C} = \{i:1 \le i \le k\}$ is a set that has a bijection against $\mathcal{Y}$, and $C$ is a random variable that takes values in $\mathcal{C}$. Then I suppose that clustering in probability terms aims to only find: $k$ (which implies finding $\mathcal{C}$). $f_{X,C}$ is the joint the density of r.vs $X$ and $C$. That maximize the following: $$\begin{split} (k^*,f^*_{X,C}) &= \underset{(k,f_{X,C}) \in \mathcal{H}}{\text{arg max }} \sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \prod_{x\in\mathcal{X}} f_{X,C}(x,c) \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(1)\\ \end{split}$$ Here $\mathcal{H}$ is the space of hypothesis. Usually domain knowledge is used to reduce its size by assuming things like maybe $p_C(c) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}$ (for any $c$), or that $f_{X|C=c}$ is normally distributed (for any $c$), and plug this information into $f_{X,C}(x,c)=p_C(c)f_{X|C=c}(x)$. Once $k^*$ and $f^*_{X,C}$ are found, for any sample $x$ we predict its cluster identifier to be: $$ c^* = \underset{c \in \{1,2,\ldots,k^*\}}{\text{arg max }} f_{X,C}^*(x,c) $$ Q1: Is equation $(1)$ the expectation maximization algorithm? Q2: Is there any clustering problem that its optimal solution is not representable by this?
