Drupal: How to get deeplink to comment?

I need to build and print a deeplink to any given comment. So that the user can directly access the specific comment with just clicking a link. I could not find a native drupal function to get this so i build it my own. My solution nid); $path = $base_url.'/'.$base.'#comment-'.$comment->cid; $link_options = array('html'=> $html); $commentlink = l($date, $path, $link_options); ?> To print the link you only have to call . But i'm pretty sure there is better and much more drupal like way to solve the problem. The Better Way Mikeker did it :) As he suggested here are the solution. nid", array("fragment" => "comment-$comment->cid")); ?> Note the little difference bettween Mikeker and my version. array("fragment" => "comment-$comment->cid")); and array("query" => "comment-$comment->cid")); The query param will add an ? to the url. So your path looks like //…query http://example.com/path/to/node?comment-2 In opposite to my solution (fragment): //…fragment http://example.com/path/to/node#comment-2 Note: Do not include the leading '#' character to a fragment identifier. It will be added by drupal.
