How to calculate the standard average of a set excluding outliers?

I have a set of numbers, and I need to calculate their average excluding outlier values (which I don't know a priori). It came to mind that many years ago I studied Standard Deviation. Could I apply it to this problem? If so, could someone give me an example of how to do it since I have to code it into PHP?
