Rank deficiency and interaction term not estimated

I am trying to inspect the data from a 2 x 2 factorial design. The experiment was run by other researchers and the design was settled upon before. Participants were tested 3 times using 3 different texts. These texts can be defined by two factors with two levels each. I will give you a comparable example: Factor 1: Lexical complexity (average vs. high) Factor 2: Readability (average vs. high) Three different texts were created based on the two factors and data was collected from each participant for each of these three texts. Text 1: high lexical complexity + average readability Text 2: average lexical complexity + high readability Text 3: average lexical complexity + average readability I am trying to fit a linear-mixed effects models with intercepts-only random effects for participant. I am trying to estimate a model that includes an interaction between Lexical Complexity and Readability, but to no success. The model is rank deficient and the interaction is not estimated. Any idea what could be wrong here?
