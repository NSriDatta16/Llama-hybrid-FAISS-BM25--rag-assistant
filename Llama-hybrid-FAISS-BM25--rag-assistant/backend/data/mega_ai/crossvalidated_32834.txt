I would agree with John. Another simpler approach might be to say four or five categories such as very poor [0,x1] poor[x1,x2] average [x2,x3] good [x3,x4] and excellent [x4,24]. Known the test you should be able to pick reasonable break points. I raise this idea because it just seems to me that the difference between a score 24 and 25 say probably does add much useful information regarding the relationships you are trying to look at,
