How does DeepMind's DQN agent determines target values for sampled episodes?

In DeepMind's paper titled Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning authors present Algorithm 1 (available in the paper reachable with mentioned link) for training of deep Q-learning network. In the algorithm, value of y_j, representing a target predicted value for given episode sampled from replay memory, is assigned. As far as I know y_j is supposed to be a vector of numbers representing values of actions for given state which the deep Q-network should output. However in the algorithm single scalar value is assigned into y_j. How is this possible?
