Test $H_0$ hypothesis that the population variances are equal

Here is the problem: Suppose you analyze potato prices in Brno and Prague. For Brno you analyze 18 shops and find sample variance 45. For Prague you analyze 27 shops and find sample variance 75. Test the equality of price variances using the 5% significance level. First, as this is two tailed test, the regions of rejection on either side should be equal to $\alpha / 2 = 0.025$ . Then for null hypothesis to be rejected, the test statistic $F = \frac{s_1^2}{s^2_2} = \frac{45}{75} = 0.6$ should be less than $F_{1-\alpha/2, \nu_1, \nu_2}$ or greater than $F_{\alpha/2, \nu_1, \nu_2}$ . $F_{1-\alpha/2, \nu_1, \nu_2} = 0.396$ and $F_{\alpha/2, \nu_1, \nu_2} = 2.313. $ So, with confidence interval $\alpha = 5% $ we cannot reject the hypothesis, that the price variances are not equal. The p-value given for the ratio and given $\nu_1 , \nu_2$ is equal to $0.863 cannot be rejected. But is there a way to find p-value from tables? Also, how to know how to graph the given F distribution ?
