Which classifiers do consider the order of the features?

In case the order of features can make a difference in the results of a classification approach, which classifier algorithms perform better? I know Naive Bayes/KNN use bag of words and ignore the order. Does SVM do the same (I understand it highly depends on its kernel)? And does feature selection approach do the same thing as the bag of words-based techniques?
