SQL Server VARCHAR(MAX) and DB Size very high

I am storing the HTML in the database. No, this is not a dynamic web application, but a template that gets stored in database and finally gets printed. This template is VARCHAR(MAX) and has on average of 700K records (7 lac records). There are about 28K records stored in database and the DB size is already 21GB. I figured that it is the Template column causing the DB size to be big. The size of this column in database is about 17GB. Do you think I can add any compression logic to compress and then save this data in database? I know it will be add up little overhead for compression, but i doubt if it is going to be big. I cannot store database outside of SQL as this will make the sensitive data available to anyone having file share permissions. Any other ideas also appreciated. (Binary, Text or anything else)?
