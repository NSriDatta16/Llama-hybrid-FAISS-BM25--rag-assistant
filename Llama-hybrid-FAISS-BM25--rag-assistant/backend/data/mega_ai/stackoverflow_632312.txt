I find http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/urllib2.shtml to be a good source of information about urllib2, which is probably the best tool for the job. import urllib import urllib2 url = 'http://www.someserver.com/cgi-bin/register.cgi' user_agent = 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT)' values = {'name' : 'Michael Foord', 'location' : 'Northampton', 'language' : 'Python' } headers = { 'User-Agent' : user_agent } data = urllib.urlencode(values) req = urllib2.Request(url, data, headers) response = urllib2.urlopen(req) the_page = response.read() The encoding is actually done using urllib, and this supports HTTP POST. There is also a way to use GET, where you have to pass the data into urlencode. Don't forget to call read() though, otherwise the request won't be completed.
