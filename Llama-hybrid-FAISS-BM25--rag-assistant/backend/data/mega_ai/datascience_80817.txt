What GPU size do I need to fine tune BERT base cased?

I want to fine tune BERT Multilingual but I'm not aware about the GPU requirements to train BERT Multilingual. I have GTX 1050ti 4GB on my local machine. I want to know what size of GPU is needed and what type of GPU is needed to train BERT. I have access to server resources. Could anyone tell me what size of GPU should I request for on server.
