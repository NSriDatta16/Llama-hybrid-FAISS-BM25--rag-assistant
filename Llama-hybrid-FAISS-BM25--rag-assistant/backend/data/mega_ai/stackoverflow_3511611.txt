Provisioning a wordpress user/blog

I have a wordpress blog inside the company where I write blogs. I want the people inside the organization to comment on the blogs. I was able to grok through the authentication inside the company and get the person's username. I want to auto register a user if he/she doesn't already exist in the system based on their username. Can someone point me to a resource on how to get this done? I know that wordpress has hooks to different functions. Can I just call a function with a person's username and auto register/login the person as a subscriber?
