Is this an example of semi-supervised learning?

I am working with advertising data, specifically click-throughs as a measure of engagement. Each row of my data set represents a user that received an ad impression. The label would be whether the user clicked or not. Let's say I have a number of features and I use those features to create clusters, for example, using K-means. After running the ad, I notice that certain clusters tend to be enriched with users that clicked on the ad. Now, of course, I could create a supervised learning model using LR or something more sophisticated. But what if as a simple model I just choose to show impressions to users who belong to the enriched cluster? Is this an example of semi-supervised learning? Is it possible that this method could be better than simply running SVM or logistic regression?
