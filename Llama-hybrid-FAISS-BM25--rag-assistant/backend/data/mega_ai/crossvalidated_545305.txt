Neural networks can do lots of things and you can probably get one to somehow do this, but this does not really sound like a problem where a neural network would be the obvious choice. It would seem more obvious to describe this kind of data using a mixture distribution. I.e. you have some kind of distribution such as a lognormal, normal or uniform (or whatever else) distribution that describes what happens within the red bars (and values outside those bars are either very rare under this distribution or even impossible - you'd have to decide how to handle that bit based on the context/subject matter knowledge of the problem), while the remainder of the distribution is described by another distribution (e.g. a lognormal or log-student-t with much higher variance).
