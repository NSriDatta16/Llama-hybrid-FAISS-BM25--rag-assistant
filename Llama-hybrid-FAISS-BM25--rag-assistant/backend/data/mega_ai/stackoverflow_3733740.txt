HTML/CSS drawing a square window in a css mask

So I have a grid of images (map tiles) and I draw a semi-transparent mask over it using an absolutely positioned div with width and height set to 100%. I now want the user to be able to draw out a rectangle on the mask, with the mouse using mouse-down, drag, mouse-up. The rectangle would be drawn dynamically as the mouse moves, and the rectangle would be like a window through the mask displaying the map tiles underneath with no semi-transparency. I'm currently looking at using 5 divs - one for the window and 4 for the mask which would be resized using javascript as I drag the mouse. Does anyone know an easier way to do this ? I'm using jquery and I need to support IE7 upwards so html5 only technology is out. Cheers, Colm
