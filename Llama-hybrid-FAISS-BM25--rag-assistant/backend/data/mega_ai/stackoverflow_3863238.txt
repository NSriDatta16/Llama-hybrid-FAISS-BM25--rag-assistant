Adding new article to transactional replication gives error at subscriber

I have an updatable transactional replication set with SQL Server 2008. Everything is working fine. I added a new table to the existing publication thru sp_addarticle followed by sp_addsubscription. After that I ran the snapshot agent. Snapshot has been generated only for newly added table. So the new table was successfully replicated to subscriber. I could even able to replicate a newly inserted record into new table to subscriber. But vice versa is not possible. When I insert a record into new table in the subscriber database, I am getting an error *Msg 515 'Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'msrepl_tran_version', table Servername.dbo.Tablename'; column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails.'*. Please help me to resolve this issue. Many Thanks in advance. Geeta
