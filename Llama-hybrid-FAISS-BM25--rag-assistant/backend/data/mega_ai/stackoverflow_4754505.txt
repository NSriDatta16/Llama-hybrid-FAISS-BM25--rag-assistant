My info doesn´t erase after uninstall the app

I made an app that use the sharedPreferences and i storage some info there, when i uninstall the app and install again the info storage there always appear, i don´t know why. I don´t programming anything to keep them there. I just upgrade my Galaxy S to 2.2.1 and i did a back up of all my apps including that i made, i don´t know sure if Android does not erase correctly the app. I did uninstall others apps like facebook one and apparently erase all files fine. I need suggestion of what can i do, please.
