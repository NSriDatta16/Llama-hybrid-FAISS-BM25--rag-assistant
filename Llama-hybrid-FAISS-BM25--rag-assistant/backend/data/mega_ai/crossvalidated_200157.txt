Why does predict() in PCA makes an additional scaling when the data is already scaled?

Imagine I have my PCs after scaling the data with log10 : preProc Here preProc$rotation contains my two PCs. Now I want to project my new data onto the PCA space by: trainPC Here I scale my new data with log10 . However it seems like the predict() function additionally scales my data with the scale() function (can be verified by running: getS3method("predict", "prcomp") ): scale(newdata, object$center, object$scale) %*% object$rotation Am I understanding this correct, that double-scaling is done in this case ( log10 and then built-in scale() )? I actually need only log10 .
