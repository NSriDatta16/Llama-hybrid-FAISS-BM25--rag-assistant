EasyMock returns Null for Expected Method

I have am having a problem with EasyMock returning null for an expected (defined) method call. Creation of the mocked Object mock = EasyMock.createMock(DAO.class); Mock Set up in unit test. expect(mock.update(myObj).andReturn(myObjUpdated).once(); replayAll(); service.setDao(mock); service.processData(myObj); verifyAll(); processData method simply calls MyObject objUpdated = dao.update(myObj); here is the interface that the mock is being built from. public interface DAO { public ENTITY update(ENTITY entity); } I am pretty confused by what might be causing the problem. I have confirmed that 'obj' is the same object as I defined in the unit test. I have also not experienced this problem (that I am aware of) with any other methods that mocked. Could the problem possibly be with the Object that is being passed in? Thanks in advance. I am really not sure what other information might be helpful to you here. edit: this is the test class (and as it turns out where my misunderstanding began) public class TestMyService extends EasyMockHelper {...}
