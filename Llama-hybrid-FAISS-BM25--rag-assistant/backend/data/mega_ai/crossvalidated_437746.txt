Bayesian statistics can be applied to most statistical questions (I won't say all because it's impossible to know, but all the stuff that commonly comes up on the frequentist side can be done in a Bayesian context). The advantages of Bayesian statistics include the ability to directly sample the distribution of the parameter of interest, and the ability to model complex, intermixed random variables that make up a single system. You can also encode prior information in your models. The assumptions tend to be stronger than frequentist statistics as a result. You have to have some prior information, which is really another parameter to figure out. You also spend a lot of time figuring out how to sample from intractable distributions (MC, VI).
