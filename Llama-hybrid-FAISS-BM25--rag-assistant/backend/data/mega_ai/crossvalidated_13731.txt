If you can assume that the responses are continous, just run a linear regression. However, It will not be a good aproximation if, for instance, people considered 7 and 6 as similar, or 1 and 2 as similar. If you can't assume they are continous, you can run an ordinal logistic regression directly with your data, or you can agregate responses in fewer categories (in the limit, you agregate in only 2 categories and ran a logistica regression). What makes more sense depends of your problem and data. Visual inspection of the relationsfip of response and IVs can help you to decide what to do.
