iPhone Automatic Device Provisioning Error

In my xcode organizer, I click "refresh" on the "Automatic Device Provisioning" and I keep getting this message: An unexpected error occurred. Please try again. If the problem persists, please contact Apple Developer Support (http://developer.apple.com/support). I know this is just a generic error message, but I cannot for the life of me figure out if it's my fault, or if apple's server is down. The Certificate and Provisioning Profile I got from iTunes connect imported just fine. I see them in the organizer. Has anyone seen this error?
