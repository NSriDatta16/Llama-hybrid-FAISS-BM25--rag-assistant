Haxe is an open source, multiplatform programming language that allows developers to JavaScript, C++, C#, Java, JVM, Python, Lua, PHP, Flash, NekoVM and HashLink using the same syntax. Haxe includes a set of common functionality that is supported across all platforms, such as numeric data types, text, arrays, binary and some common file formats. Haxe also includes platform-specific APIs. It can be integrated with existing libraries using extern definitions (e.g: JavaScript) or leveraging the compiler to connect directly to native libraries (e.g: .jar for Java and .dll for C#). Haxe can also compile to bytecode ( Neko , HashLink or JVM), which runs in the runtime created by the same developer. Haxe is a garbage-collected language. Some target platforms do not have a native garbage collector - in those cases Haxe provides its own runtime, like hxcpp in the case of C++, to take care of GC and other things. Haxe ships with its own package manager called haxelib . Haxe was developed by Nicolas Cannasse and other contributors and is backed by the Haxe Foundation . It was named Haxe because it was short, simple, and "has an X inside", which the author humorously asserts is necessary to make any new technology a success. Haxe is pronounced "hex" /heks/ , although many community members pronounce it "hacks". Haxe is known for its multitude of game development and multimedia libraries. With frameworks like nme , openfl or kha built on top of Haxe, developers can target platforms like: Web ( html5 , flash ) Desktop ( hashlink , neko , windows , linux , mac ) Mobile ( android , ios , blackberry ) All from a single code base. Popular game engines include haxeflixel , haxepunk , flambe and luxe . The powerful nape physics engine is written in Haxe as well. With UI frameworks like haxeui and stablexui , user interfaces can be created for a wide range of target platforms. With ufront , there is also a feature-rich MVC web framework available. To create reactive web applications using a virtual DOM, coconut.ui can be used, which shares significant similarities with react .
