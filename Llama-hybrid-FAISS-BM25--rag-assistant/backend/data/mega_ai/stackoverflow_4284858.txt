I agree with answer 1 that that is what is supposed to happen, and often does. But it doesn't always work and will work partially sometimes. For example my current Solution. Project 1 namespace ToolsTester - This is just a temporary form to test the view tools in the 2nd project. Project 2 namespace UltimateFileFinder - This has three views. The first 2 views (user controls) UltFilesView and UltSlideShow appeared as usual on the toolbar so I could drag them onto ToolsTester to try them out. Then I added another user control UltPanel, this will not go onto the toolbox. Though it compiles without errors. I have come across this problem a few times, sometimes removing and reasserting the reference fixes it. Other times I would have to remove the test project and create a new one. I tested Visual Studio (full version) before release and this was one of the areas I reported back, so the problem was known pre-release. This project I am on now I know that I will need to remove the test project and create a new one, in this case the tester is only a few simple caller and event responses, that is not always the case, there are times when the tester project can be quite complex because it is mimicing the target that the tools will be part of.
