Does anyone know the history of ASP.NET Webforms?

I'm curious about ASP.NET Webforms and all it encompasses (viewstate etc..). This solution looks like it wants to tell me a story but I'm trying to figure out what. Does anyone here know the history of webforms and why the system works the way it does? Can anyone take me to early year 2000 and tell me what companies were clamoring for? What did they want Microsoft to create? What was the environment like at the time? I know the web was the rage and so was the dot com era so something was up.
