See http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Params::Validate#SUPPORT for how to submit a bug report. You spent a lot of energy discovering the cause of and the solution to a problem. It would be a shame if someone else had to retrace your steps without knowing what you have already learned. I think that CPAN modules should be rock-solid and neither break themselves nor their environment In a perfect world, software would always do what it claimed to do and not have any undocumented side-effects. CPAN is a pretty open system, so almost anybody can upload almost anything. I think this is more of a feature than a bug -- a low barrier to entry makes developing Perl modules easier and has encouraged a vaster and more useful library to be developed. Params::Validate was released nine years ago and has been updated about 94 times since then. If you look through the CHANGES file, you'll see that the author(s) have been quite conscientious in keeping the module up-to-date and fixing occasional problems as well as adding new features. It probably won't shock them to hear that a user found a problem, nor should you be too shocked to find that some of the libraries are merely excellent and not perfect.
