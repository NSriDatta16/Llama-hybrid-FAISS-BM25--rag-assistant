Have a look at PowerDbg . That's a good start imho. Short description copied from codeplex: PowerDbg is a PowerShell library that enables you to easily create PowerShell scripts to automate a WinDbg / CDB debugging session. You can use PowerDbg for Kernel Mode or User Mode, Post-Mortem debugging or Live Debugging and for native or managed code. PowerShell has several advantages over the WinDbg Scripting Language. A few of them are: Easier to create scripts Leverage the .NET Framework Debugging and tracing features Code reuse through functions and cmdlets Easier maintenance Easier to build large scripts Easier to format and display the important information Whether you’re an old hand frustrated with WinDbg scripting, or you’re having your ‘first memory dump’ freak-out, PowerDbg is for you. And hopefully for everyone in the middle too.too.
