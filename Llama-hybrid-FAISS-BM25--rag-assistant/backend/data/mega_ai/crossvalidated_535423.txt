Confusion about Typical Set concept

The typical set is defined as the sequences which have a probability in $[2^{-nH(X) - \epsilon}, 2^{-nH(X) + \epsilon}]$ . These are the sequences which give the average informativeness but certainly do not include the most probable sequences. For instance, for a Bernoulli distribution generates binary sequences with a probability .9 for 0's, the most probable sequence is all 0's but it is not included in the typical set. However, the probability of having a sequence that belongs to the typical set goes to 1 as n (the number of elements generated or the length of the sequence) goes to infinity per AEP theorem. I understand the mathematical proof but this sounds counter-intuitive. How could a very long sequence generated by a Bernoulli process with .9 probability for the 0's to not contain with high probability the sequence of all zeros?
