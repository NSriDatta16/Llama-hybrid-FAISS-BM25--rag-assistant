How do I prevent the console from appearing when building a Windows SDL project with Eclipse?

When you run the .exe, the SDL window appears, but so does a console window. How do I get just the SDL window by itself? What configuration option should I be changing? Is there one? I'm compiling with MinGW and using Eclipse Ganymede.
