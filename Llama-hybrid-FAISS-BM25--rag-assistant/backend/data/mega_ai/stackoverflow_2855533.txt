You implemented the table view data source drag-reception methods, not the outline view data source drag-reception methods. An outline view is a kind of table view, but it uses the outline view data source protocol exclusively; the table view data source protocol is only for table view data sources, not outline view data sources. See the NSOutlineViewDataSource protocol for more details on exactly what you need to implement in your data source. On that note: You need to implement the methods in your data source, which is currently not your document. I don't know why you've done it that way; ordinarily, the document (in its role as mostly a controller) owns the model, so it should be the views' source of the dataâ€”the data source. I suggest merging the OutlineDataSource class into the MyDocument class, and changing the table view drag-reception methods to their outline-view counterparts.
