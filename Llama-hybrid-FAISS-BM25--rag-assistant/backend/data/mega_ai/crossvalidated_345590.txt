Semi-parametric models such as Cox regression are not easily applied in the presence of interval censoring. In this situation the default choice is to use parametric models. On the other hand, time-dependent covariates are easily included in a right-censored setting and not with interval censoring. To include time-dependent covariates in an interval censoring scenario few methods have been proposed, and this is probably the best available approach. However, this method (as far as I know) has only been implemented in SAS. The Weibull model is among the possible methods they discuss, so if you are interested in a proportional hazard model you will be fine. For your analyses I see three options: Choose this latter approach based on parametric survival, which would be ideal for your data, and use SAS to fit your models. If you prefer to use R, make an assumption on when events are occurring within the interval (normally distributed for example), and do a classical right-censored analysis using Cox regression (in this case you can refer to this R tutorial) Seek alternative approaches such as the one you mentioned based on logistic regression.
