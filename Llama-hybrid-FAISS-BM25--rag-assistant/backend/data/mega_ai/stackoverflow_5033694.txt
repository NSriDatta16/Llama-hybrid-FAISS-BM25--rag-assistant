Explanation of performance considerations of read/write on Google Datastore (GAE)?

I'm having a very difficult time understanding the mechanics of the Google App Engine Datastore . I want to understand the mechanics so I can build my database in an optimal way for the database. Given my example below, can someone help me in: structure the database optimally understand the performance of both read and write given that structure Example: Let's say I have N baseball players and each has a unique ID. I'd like to keep a daily tally of the homeruns hit by each player (storing a "total daily homeruns" property) and basically increment it when a homerun is hit. So, as time increases, I'd like to show a graph of homeruns each day for each baseball player over X years. Player 1 1/21/2011 - 2 homeruns 1/22/2011 - 0 homeruns 1/23/2011 - 1 homeruns Read Requirement : Read the last 5 years of daily "homerun" data for a certain player? Write Requirement : Increment a daily homerun count for a certain baseball player. I would love to understand how to structure the data and also the mechanics of both read and write? Will this simple storage task scale? Thanks all.
