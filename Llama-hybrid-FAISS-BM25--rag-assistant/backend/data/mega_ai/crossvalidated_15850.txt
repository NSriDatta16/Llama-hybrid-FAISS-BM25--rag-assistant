Dasymetric mapping is mainly focused on interpolating population estimates to smaller areas than available in currently disseminated data (see this question for a host of useful references on the topic). Frequently this was done by simply identifying areas (based on land characteristics) in which obviously no population exists, and then re-estimating population densities (ommitting those areas). An example might be if there is a body of water in a city, another might be if you identify industrial land parcels which can not have any residential population. More recent approaches to dasymetric mapping incorporate other ancillary data in a probabilistic framework to allocate population estimates (Kyriakidis, 2004; Liu et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2011; Zhang & Qiu, 2011). Now it is easy to see the relation to your question at hand. You want the population estimates of the small areas. But, it should also be clear how it may fall short of your goals. You not only want the population data, but characteristics of those populations as well. One of the terms used to describe this situation is the change of support problem (Cressie, 1996; Gotway & Young, 2002). Borrowing from the geostatistical literature in which one tries to make predictions of a certain characteristic over a wide area from point samples, recent work has attempted to interpolate areal data to different target zones. Much of the work of Pierre Goovaerts focuses on such area-to-point kriging methods, a recent article in the journal Geographical Analysis has several examples of the method applied different subject materials (Haining et al., 2010), and one of my favorite applications of it is in this article (Young et al., 2009). What I cite should hardly be viewed as a panacea to the problem though. Ultimately many of the same issues with ecological inference and aggregation bias apply to the goals of areal interpolation as well. It is likley many of the relationships between the micro level data are simply lost in the aggregation process, and such interpolation techiques will not be able to recover them. Also the process through which the data is empirically interpolated (through estimating variograms from the aggregate level data) is often quite full of ad-hoc steps which should make the process questionable (Goovaerts, 2008). Unfortunately, I post this in a separate answer as the ecological inference literature and the literature on dasymetric mapping and area-to-point kriging are non-overlapping. Although the literature on ecological inference has many implications for these techniques. Not only are the interpolation techniques subject to aggregation bias, but the intelligent dasymetric techniques (which use the aggregate data to fit models to predict the smaller areas) are likely suspect to aggregation bias. Knowledge of the situations in which aggregation bias occurs should be enlightening as to the situations in which areal interpolation and dasymetric mapping will largely fail (especially in regards to identifying correlations between different variables at the disaggregated level).
