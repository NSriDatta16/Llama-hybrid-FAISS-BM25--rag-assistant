How hard is it to build an Email client? - Python

I'm venturing in unknown territory here... I am trying to work out how hard it could be to implement an Email client using Python: Email retrieval Email sending Email formatting Email rendering Also I'm wondering if all protocols are easy/hard to support e.g. SMTP, IMAP, POP3, ... Hopefully someone could point me in the right direction :)
