Best way to detect bot from user agent?

Time goes by, but still no perfect solution... See if someone has a bright idea to differentiate bot from human-loaded web page? State of the art is still loading a long list of well-known SE bots and parse USER AGENT? Testing has to be done before the page is loaded! No gifs or captchas!
