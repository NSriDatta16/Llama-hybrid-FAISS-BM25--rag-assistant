Why are compiler specific directives called pragmas?

Possible Duplicate: Where does the word “pragma” come from? I know that pragma commands are used to pass compiler specific directives to a compiler implementation, but why was the keyword pragma chosen? What is its etymology? Most language keywords are taken from real words, but pragma seems only to be defined within the context of programming.
