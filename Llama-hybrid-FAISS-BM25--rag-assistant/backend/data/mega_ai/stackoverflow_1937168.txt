You can set the output cache to cache content relative to accept headers , not response headers . From this walkthrough on IIS 7.0 caching : Using this configuration, the output cache will cache a different value for each language that user agent's ask for. You could add "Accept-Encoding" to the varyByHeaders to cache gzipped and non-gzipped versions of the same resource. As for expiry headers, as far as I can tell the output cache doesn't take any notice of them. You have to set the output cache expiry and the expiry HTTP header separately - after all there's no guarantee that you would want to use the same policy for both.
