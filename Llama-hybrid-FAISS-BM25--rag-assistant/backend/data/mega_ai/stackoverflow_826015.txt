Using rails or ASP.NET for website on Windows

I need to create a site that interact with some windows applications. Currently this is done through direct calls so I would like these to run on the webserver. This means that the site will have to run on a Windows based system. I have been doing some ruby lately and am very keen on using rails for the site, but have at the same time seen plenty of discouraging posts regarding this. Should I rather use ASP.NET (MVC) for a windows system or is rails stable enough to handle this?
