Econometrics: How to Derive the OLS Estimators of a log-log model

Consider the following two simple linear model specifications: $log(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1log(x) + u$ $(1)$ $log(y/x) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1log(x) + v$ $(2)$ where y and x are two random variables for which we have a random sample size n and both u and v are error terms. (a) Show that $\hat\alpha_1 = \hat\beta_1 - 1$ where both $\hat\alpha_1$ and $\hat\beta_1$ are the OLS estimates of the population parameters. (b) Show that $se(\hat\beta_1) = se(\hat\alpha_1)$ This is what I have completed thus far but now I am having issues with Part (b) of this problem $$ln(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1ln(x) +u$$ $$ln(\frac{y}{x}) = ln(y) - ln(x) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1ln(x) +v$$ $$\Rightarrow $$ $$ln(y) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 ln(x) +v \Rightarrow ln(y) = \alpha_0 +(x_1+1)ln(x)$$ And since we know that the ln(x) must equal we can conclude: $$1 + \hat\alpha_1 = \hat\beta_1\Rightarrow \hat\alpha_1=\hat\beta_1 - 1$$ I will now work on Part (b) which I will add later on today hopefully. (Also, studying for an exam tomorrow) If anyone catches an error that be appreciated if you can bring it to my attention. (b) $$se(\hat\alpha_1)=\frac{\frac{\hat\alpha_1-\alpha_1}{sd(\hat\beta_1)}}{\sqrt(\frac{\hat\sigma^2}{\sigma^2})} = \frac{\hat\alpha_1-\alpha_1}{sd(\hat\alpha_1)} \sim N(0,1)$$ we know that: $$tratio = \frac{\hat\alpha_1-\alpha_1}{se(\hat\alpha)}\sim t_{n-k-1}$$ If anyone can help me proceed with this question and put me on the right track that would be appreciated.
