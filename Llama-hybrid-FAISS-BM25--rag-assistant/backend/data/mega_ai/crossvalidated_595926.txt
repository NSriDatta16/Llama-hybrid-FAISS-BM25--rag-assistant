I have not seen a method published in the academic literature extending relative weights analysis to ordered logistic regression. That is, it is unclear how it is implemented in {displayr} ; I suspect the method uses linear regression to decompose the $R^2$ however. That said, there is a method using the dominance_analysis() function from the parameters {parameters} package that is designed to work with the proportional odds model/ordered logit model. For example, the below uses the datasets::mtcars data to get a ordered logit model and then conduct a dominance analysis on it (based on an approach discussed by Luchman, 2014). library(MASS) mtcars |> transform(gear = as.ordered(gear)) |> polr(gear ~ mpg + qsec + wt, data = _) |> parameters::dominance_analysis() # Dominance Analysis Results Model R2 Value: 0.530 General Dominance Statistics Parameter | General Dominance | Percent | Ranks | Subset --------------------------------------------------------------- Intercept: 3|4 | | | | constant Intercept: 4|5 | | | | constant mpg | 0.177 | 0.335 | 2 | mpg qsec | 0.075 | 0.142 | 3 | qsec wt | 0.277 | 0.523 | 1 | wt Conditional Dominance Statistics Subset | IVs: 1 | IVs: 2 | IVs: 3 --------------------------------- mpg | 0.296 | 0.233 | 0.004 qsec | 0.021 | 0.131 | 0.074 wt | 0.440 | 0.333 | 0.058 Complete Dominance Designations Subset | Depending on how large your model is, you might consider using the sets argument to group variables to speed along runtime.
