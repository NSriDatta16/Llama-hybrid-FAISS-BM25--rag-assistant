Best way for cross browser applications

In our organization, we are still on .net 1.1 environment, using javascript, a few open source applications/widgets. Development is done using Visual Studio 2003, grid view, and iframes. Our application works in Internet Explorer 7 and IE 8 (in compatibilily mode). Can anyone give any basic steps we can take to get our application to work cross browsers? What are the starting locations we can get at to start making existing code work in different browsers?
