Viewing Ad-Hoc crash reports from an iPhone

I'm doing some beta testing. I've got a crash and trying to figure it out. If I connect the iPhone, I can see the Crash Report in the XCode organizer. So I see this (my app is called Lineskipper): Thread 0 Crashed: 0 libobjc.A.dylib 0x323fe6f4 0x323fc000 + 9972 1 UIKit 0x32ba205e 0x32b60000 + 270430 2 UIKit 0x32ba1ffe 0x32b60000 + 270334 3 UIKit 0x32ba1fd0 0x32b60000 + 270288 4 UIKit 0x32ba1d2a 0x32b60000 + 269610 5 UIKit 0x32ba263e 0x32b60000 + 271934 6 UIKit 0x32ba1656 0x32b60000 + 267862 7 UIKit 0x32ba1032 0x32b60000 + 266290 8 UIKit 0x32b9d928 0x32b60000 + 252200 9 UIKit 0x32b9d3a0 0x32b60000 + 250784 10 GraphicsServices 0x32913b72 0x3290f000 + 19314 11 CoreFoundation 0x32567c26 0x32511000 + 355366 12 CoreFoundation 0x32567356 0x32511000 + 353110 13 GraphicsServices 0x32912cb8 0x3290f000 + 15544 14 GraphicsServices 0x32912d64 0x3290f000 + 15716 15 UIKit 0x32b62768 0x32b60000 + 10088 16 UIKit 0x32b6146c 0x32b60000 + 5228 17 LineSkipper 0x000022e0 0x1000 + 4832 18 LineSkipper 0x0000229c 0x1000 + 4764 Not particularly helpful. From what I understand, I need to symbolize. So I read this little nugget of wisdom in Apple TN2151 Given a crash report, the matching binary, and its .dSYM file, symbolication is relatively easy. The Xcode Organizer window has a tab for crash reports of the currently selected device. You can view externally received crash reports in this tab - just place them in the appropriate directory. This is the same as the Mac OS X directory described in the first section. It doesn't matter which device you have tethered, but the directory in which you place the crash report must be the directory for the tethered and selected device. It is not necessary to place the binary and .dSYM file in any particular location. Xcode uses Spotlight and the UUID to locate the correct files. It is necessary, though, that both files be in the same directory and that this directory is one that is indexed by Spotlight. Anywhere in your home directory should be fine. So basically, I don't get it. I drag the crash report out of the organizer, put it in the directory Apple references here (~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/) and then... I double-click it. It opens up the console app, and I see exactly what I saw in the Organizer. So did I do something wrong? How do I know I did it? How do I view the console file so that I know exactly where the crash was?
