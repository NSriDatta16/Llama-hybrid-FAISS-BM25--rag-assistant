I will write matrix square roots of $\Sigma$ as $\Sigma=A A^T$ , to be consistent with the Cholesky decomposition which is written as $\Sigma = L L^T$ where $L$ is lowtri (lower triangular). So let $X$ be a random vector with $\DeclareMathOperator{\E}{\mathbb{E}} \DeclareMathOperator{\Cov}{\mathbb{Cov}}\DeclareMathOperator{\Var}{\mathbb{Var}} \E X=\mu$ and $\Var X =\Sigma$ . Let now $Z$ be a random vector with expectation zero and unit covariance matrix. Note that there are (except for the scalar case) infinitely many matrix square roots. If we let $A$ be one of the, then we can find all the others as $A \mathcal{O}$ where $\mathcal{O}$ is any orthogonal matrix, that is, $\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}^T = \mathcal{O}^T \mathcal{O} =I$ . This is known as unitary freedom of square roots . Let us look at some particular matrix square roots. First a symmetric square root. Use the spectral decomposition to write $\Sigma = U \Lambda U^T = U\Lambda^{1/2}(U\Lambda^{1/2})^T$ . Then $\Sigma^{1/2}=U\Lambda^{1/2}$ and this can be interpreted as the PCA (principal component analysis) of $\Sigma$ . The Cholesky decomposition $\Sigma=L L^T$ and $L$ is lowtri. We can represent $X$ as $X=\mu + L Z$ . Multiplying out to get scalar equations, we get a triangular system in $Z$ , which in the time series case can be interpreted as a MA (moving average) representation. The general case $A= L \mathcal{O}$ , using the above we can interpret this as a MA representation after rotating $Z$ .
