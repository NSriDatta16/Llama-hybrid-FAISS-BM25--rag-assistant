Since the content of the SharePoint Wiki page is indexed in the content database by page name, simple re-hosting the content is probably not possible . Therefore, a more feasible approach would be to load the wiki page into an IFRAME and then using Javascript code to modify the properties of the controls you want to 'hide' by either setting their visibility to hidden or their width/height to 0 . Not as elegant or efficient, but it will do the trick. Note: use the Developer Tools in IE8 (or something equivalent) to inspect the live HTML DOM of your page and experiment with modifying the attributes.
