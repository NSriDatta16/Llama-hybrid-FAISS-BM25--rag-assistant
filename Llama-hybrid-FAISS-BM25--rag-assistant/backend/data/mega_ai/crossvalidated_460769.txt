This gets at something called the inclusion-exclusion principle. For two events, $A$ for dining in restaurant A and $B$ for dining in restaurant B: $$P(A\text{ or } B)=P(A) + P(B) - P(A\text{ and } B)$$ (The formula for $n$ events is given in the Wikipedia page on inclusion-exclusion. Read it if you get the hiccups and need a scare.) The intuition is that $P(A)+P(B)$ may overshoot $P(A\text{ or } B)$ , so we subtract out some probability to correct that overshoot. That correction is the overlap of $A$ and $B$ , which has been counted twice, once by $P(A)$ and then again by $P(B)$ , so we subtract out the overlap. I encourage you to draw a Venn diagram of this. I will post one in an edit to this (I already owe someone another edit to a different post of mine, so I know I’ll be editing CV posts this weekend), but you’ll learn more if you try the Venn diagram yourself. EDIT Let's look at a picture. Purple is the overlap of blue and red. In this picture, since purple counts towards both red and blue, $P(red) = 0.5$ . Likewise, $P(blue) = 0.5$ . $$P(\text{red}) + P(\text{blue}) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1$$ But hold on...a quarter of the rectangle is neither blue nor red. So we subtract out the overlap of blue and red, $P(\text{blue and red})$ , to get the probability of being blue or red, $P(\text{blue or red})$ : $$P(\text{blue or red}) = P(\text{red}) + P(\text{blue}) - P(\text{blue and red})= 0.5 + 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.75$$ "Inclusion-exclusion" comes from the fact that we include (double count) the overlap, and then we exclude (subtract out) one copy of the overlap.
