I'd go for the first option in this case. Edit As I've mentioned in the comments, it depends on the situation. A relatively clean way for me would be to define a categories method in the controller and declare it a helper. Then call that when you need it in the view. However (and this is the situation I envisaged when first answering) if it's a single form field I'd simply call the model from the view just for the sake of simplicity - methods like helper_method :all_categories private def all_categories Category.all end aren't exactly the most elegant code.
