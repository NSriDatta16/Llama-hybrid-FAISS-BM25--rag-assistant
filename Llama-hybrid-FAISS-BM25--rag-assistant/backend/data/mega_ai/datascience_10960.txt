Need some tips regarding starting out with the field's specific programming languages, with a heavy focus on data visualization

I've got rather expansive development experience, but I'm new to data science. I have been trying to familiarize myself with the main concepts and deciding between R and Python to put my time into. I know you can write Python in R and vice versa, but since data visualization in a beautiful manner would be a very high priority for me in the future and both Python and R use additional packages and libraries for data representation, I'm not entirely sure whether it's possible to use the additional libraries when integrating code into one another. I would really appreciate it if someone could give me some advice regarding this and also provide me with some general tips about the best approaches, practices and tools when it comes to data visualization.
