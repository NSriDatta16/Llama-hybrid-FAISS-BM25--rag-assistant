A nice Python implementation of Naive Bayes Clustering combining EM algorithm and Naive Bayes algorithm for unsupervised learning. This implementation based on « heuristic » approximate method of moments (MOM) and tensor decomposition techniques was used to cluster high-dimensional binary data patients in groups from their electronic healthcare records. The paper « Clustering Patients with Tensor Decomposition » in Proceedings of Machine Learning for Healthcare 2017 gives detailed explanation.
