This sounds like you are wrestling with a common problem: how to use a hammer to fasten a screw. Both alternatives you listed are bad, each for different reasons. But that's because you are trying to stuff your particular data model into a relational database system. A good approach would be to look beyond the relational database at some other database/storage systems , try a couple out, and find the best fit for your project. I have tried the EAV model and gave up because it was far too complex, and I am afraid to try the multi-tables model with a relational database system. The easiest solution I have found with a relational database is: store each complete response as a single CLOB, serialized into JSON or YAML (or something else lightweight), in a responses table. create table responses ( id uuid primary key, questionnaire_id uuid references questionnaires.id, data text )
