Android Emulator gives blue screen of death

No matter which type of android virtual device I create from the Android SDK and AVD Manager, whenever I start it, my entire laptop just shuts down after getting the blue screen of death. I see this error in the Event system Log ("Driver VPCAppSv.sys has been blocked from loading.") but not sure if it's related to it or not. Anyone have any ideas? I've installed again 3 times with no luck.
