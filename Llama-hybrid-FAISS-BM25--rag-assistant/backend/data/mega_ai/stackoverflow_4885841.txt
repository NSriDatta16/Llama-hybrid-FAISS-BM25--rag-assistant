requirement of root privileges for libpcap functions

The pcap_lookupdev() fills in the errbuf variable when run as non-root user, while the same functions returns the value of the first available network interface when run as root. Is this access disabled by the OS or the library. I think it is the OS. What is the right answer? This is not a homework question
