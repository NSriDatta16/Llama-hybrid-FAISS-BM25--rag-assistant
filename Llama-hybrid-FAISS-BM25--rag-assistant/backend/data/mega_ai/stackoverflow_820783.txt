Read TMM as a book outlining a problem, perhaps THE problem, in software engineering: its not the technology, its the people! All the improvements you mention spring from that core realization. They are all in place to solve the problems Brooks laid out. This is the book that I'm sure Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham and Alister Cockburn and Martin Fowler all read, took to heart and then began to craft their silver bullets.
