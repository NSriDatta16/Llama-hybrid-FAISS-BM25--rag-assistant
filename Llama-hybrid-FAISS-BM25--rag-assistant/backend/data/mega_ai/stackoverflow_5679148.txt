Actually, there are two different points. Look here . Center of gravity The geographic midpoint, sometimes called the center of gravity, center of mass or centroid is the average coordinate for a set of points. If you mark several points on a world globe along with the geographic midpoint, the geographic midpoint does indeed look like it is in the center. Imagine that several weights are placed at various points on a world globe and then the globe is allowed to rotate freely until the heaviest part of the globe is pulled by gravity until it is facing downward. Then the lowest point on the globe would be the geographic midpoint for all of the weighted locations. The geographic midpoint is calculated by finding the center of gravity for the locations. The latitude and longitude for the locations are converted into Cartesian (x,y,z) coordinates. The average x, y and z coordinate is calculated. This average coordinate lies within the interior of the earth and is the true center of mass, and a line can be drawn from the center of the earth passing through this point then out to the surface of the earth which is the geographic midpoint. The average x, y and z coordinate is converted into the latitude and longitude for the midpoint. The given formula assumes a spherical earth, and sea-level points. The answer is much more complex if a more accurate model is needed. Center of minimum distance This point minimizes the combined travel distance from a set of points. The center of minimum distance is the point of absolute minimum travel distance, however it does not attempt to equalize the amount of distance traveled from the other points. There are calculators here The methods are described here Note that sperical earth is assumed. If higher accuracy is needed, the solution would be much more complex.
