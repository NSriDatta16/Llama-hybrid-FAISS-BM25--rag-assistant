From your comment... I have an existing Spring MVC application which does not currently use SpringSecurity ... which needs a way to get the currently logged in user Can you not just use HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() ? Returns a java.security.Principal object containing the name of the current authenticated user. If the user has not been authenticated, the method returns null. Finally, your comments on thread safety seem dubious since security context objects and pricipal objects are immutable and are stored in ThreadLocal storage by default which makes them perfectly thread safe.
