Advice for NN Architecture

Could someone give me advice on the architecture of NN for the following task: I have a list of agents (with some properties) and a list of activities in time of each agent (an every agent has a different number of records of the activities). I need to divide agents on two classes. I have big amount of labeled data. The way my friends do the task is the following: Manually figure out and extract features form list of activities for each agent (like max, mean time between records and etc.) Add those features to the table of agents Use random forest classifier Their approach works quite well, but I dislike the idea of manually inventing and extracting features from lists of activities. As I understand multi-layer neural networks are good in extracting features and I want to use this advantage However, my first problem is: each agent has different number of activities. As a result, amount of data is different for each agent. How to form input layer of NN? I'm not sure about how to be with the fact that those activities have quite clear periodic patterns. Should I do something special about it? I would be glad to hear any ideas. Thank you
