We have been using indentation to indicate statement groupings as a readability aid for a long time. This occasionally causes problems when the indentation and the actual statement groupings (indicated by {};, begin/end, whatever) are in conflict; we read one meaning, but the code actually says something else. Python took the simplifying approach. If we find indentation a help in clarity of expression, why not make it the way the language itself determines groupings. When we write code, we express intent to other readers, so looking at what writing gurus say is often useful: A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. ~William Strunk, Jr., The Elements of Style, 1918 So, maybe a programming language should have no unnecessary syntax elements...??
