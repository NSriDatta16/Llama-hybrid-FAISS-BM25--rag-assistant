Actually you should use queue for breadth first search and stack for depth first search, and run your algorithm from a while loop. Making recursive function calls can drag your program significantly if you do simple operations while traversing, and may cause a stack overflow, but these days you would need to try really hard to see one. Just have a hash on the side to keep track of already visited nodes in case it is not a tree but a well connected graph.
