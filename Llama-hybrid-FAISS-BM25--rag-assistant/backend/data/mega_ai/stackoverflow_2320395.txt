Very often. I have sometimes gone for a walk in the forrest while pondering a problem. And more often than not the solutions I happen upon have something to do with trees. I have also worked on UI ideas inspired by physics. Using concepts such as gravity, magnetism or electric repulsion to organize items on the display. I also once heard an interesting talk on SOA, believe it or not. The central idea of the talk was that different subsystems in a SOA architecture should cooperate in the manner of cells in a biological system. The subject was highly illuminating as to how a complex system can actually work, even if it is constructed out of loosely coupled components.
