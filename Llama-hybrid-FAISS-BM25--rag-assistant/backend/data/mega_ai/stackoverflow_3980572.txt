how to bind my view model properties to application settings?

My view model MyViewModel has a property MyProperty that i need to read/save from/to the application's settings. My project has Settings.settings file and the Settings type has MyProperty property. i need to bind MyViewModel.MyProperty to Settings.MyProperty so that any changes to MyViewModel.MyProperty are reflected in the Settings.MyProperty, and possibly the other way around. how can i do that? note that i cannot derive MyViewModel from Settings because MyViewModel already derives another type. EDIT: i can do it manually of course: read and write from and to Settings in my property definition, but i am asking whether there is a more elegant approach. class MyViewModel : ViewModelBase { public int MyProperty { ... } public MyViewModel() { // here i need to bind Settings.Default.MyProperty to this.MyProperty } }
