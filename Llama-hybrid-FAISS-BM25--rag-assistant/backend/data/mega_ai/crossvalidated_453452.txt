I think this is exaggerated language. Both frequentist and Bayesian have their merits, and statisticians routinely rely on both types in their work. To answer your questions: We can still consider $X \sim N(\mu, 1)$ . However, we are not observing $X$ , but $X' = \min(100, X)$ , which is another Random Variable. 2,3. Now, the authors are saying $\mathbb{E}(X') \neq \mu$ , even though $\mathbb{E}(X) = \mu$ . Is this a limitation in frequentist inference? Perhaps. Many statistical inference techniques (e.g. confidence intervals, p-value, hypothesis testing) require that our estimator ( $\hat{\mu}$ ) to be a consistent (roughly speaking: asymptotically unbiased) estimate of $\mu$ . Now, the thing about Bayesian inference is that it does not care (much) about biasedness. It doesn't solve the frequentist problem. It just provides another perspective on it. The particular example given, however, is specially constructed to be paradoxical. Since we know that no values of $x_i > 100$ are observed, the mean observed $\bar{x}'=\sum_i x'_i/n$ , is an unbiased estimate of $\mu$ . But this is only due to an idiosyncracy of this setup, since in this particular case , $\bar{x}'=\sum_i x'_i/n = \sum_i x_i/n = \bar{x}$ . However, in general, $\mathbb{E}(\bar{x}') \neq \mu$ , even though $\mathbb{E}(\bar{x}) = \mu$ . A Bayesian, however, can be more flexible. First, she can define $S$ to be the event that " a randomly drawn sample contains no $x'_i=100$ ". Then she can say, $\mathbb{E}(\bar{x}' | S) = \mathbb{E}(\bar{x}|S) = \mu$ . Note that the precise statement is quite delicate. If the sample did in fact contain one $x'_i = 100$ , but we are excluding that observation, or if we are repeating the sampling procedure, and only selecting one which doesn't contain any $x'_i=100$ , this is not the event specified by $S$ . This is, in some way, the limitation of frequentism. Conditioning on an event like $S$ simply does not fit in with frequentist philosophy, since it is concerned with the long term behaviour of a procedure or estimator. On the other hand, the fact that in this particular case, the Bayesian has an unbiased estimate is something of a fluke. Bayesianism does not in the end solve the questions frequentist inference tries to address. #### Edit #### I just realized I actually got tricked by the paradox. Using an event like $S$ does not solve the problem, as it still implies $x_i for all observed $i$ . Ultimately, I think the answer is that the Bayesian simply is not interested in $\mathbb{E}(X')$ , and the frequentist cannot consider $\mathbb{E}(\mu|X'=x')$ . Thus the fact that the estimate is biased or not is irrelevant to the Bayesian. A Bayesian may of course still be interested in analysing the properties of an estimator, but that will then make him a frequentist.
