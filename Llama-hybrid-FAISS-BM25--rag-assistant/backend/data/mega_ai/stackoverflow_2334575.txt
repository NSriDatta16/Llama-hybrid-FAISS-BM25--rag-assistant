You'll need to implement the payment APIs of any major third party providers that are available to you. You then will need your customers to provide their API credentials to you so you can connect to these APIs representing them. That will allow payment to go straight to them. Problem: If these API allow for refunds there is nothing to stop you from essentially taking money from these accounts by issuing refunds. This will naturally discourage anyone with half a brain from using your service. Based on your location this may not be a service you will able to provide as is. You may need to find a partner in a country that has Paypal, Amazon, and/or Google payment services available to them. That way you can implement middle man payment options.
