What are the major industry standard Automated Testing Frameworks?

I'm working on establishing automated testing practices and test suites in an organization. A peer is telling me that we "should use a framework". To me, a framework is any set of code and/or other tool that helps you create something. My peer seems to be suggesting that there are industry standard automated testing frameworks. I've seen the following patterns in designing Test systems before: Data Driven Keyword Driven Model Driven Query Driven My counterpart includes "Modular" as one of these. Because of my background in Software Engineering, I hear the word "Modular" and think of modular programming (as opposed to object-oriented, aspect-oriented or procedural programming)... a way of organizing code, not a methodology or framework type in and of itself. I've seen the wikipedia definition for "Modular Automation" and it looks the same as the programming paradigm. What am I missing? What can I read to get on the same page as my counterpart? Is it me or him that doesn't understand something? I have over a decade of software engineering experience, my counterpart has been in QA for nearly that long. He's not able to site references. I've searched the google for 6 hours now trying to learn about this "Modular Framework" and can't find a technical example and nothing more than the standard programming paradigm (e.g. organize code into modules).
