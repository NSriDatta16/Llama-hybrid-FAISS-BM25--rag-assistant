Answering this myself since someone on our team noticed Validator from jQuery Tools ! Presentation - Supports HTML5 input fields. pattern fields make sure the user can only input test in a certain pattern. Side effects - Triggers events on the form and on individual fields: onFail and onSuccess Widget-driven elements - "Custom input types" are encouraged. The basic demo even includes a natural numbers-old "age" field. Groups - Write a "function matcher" whose sole purpose is to filter which fields are to be validated. Server-side validation - Does it and does it intelligently â€” depends on your validator calling a callback (so it's async-friendly) instead of a return value. Multiple forms per page - jQuery Tools seems to be very well built and this shouldn't be a problem. Customizable error display - Errors next to fields? All in one place? No problem. Still not good enough? Bind events on failure. Even uses tooltips by default. Snappiness - Demos are very snappy Submit buttons - No problem. Update: Yep, just reimplemented a chunk of our site with jQuery Tools' validator tooltips. Fantastic!
