It is not correct. Think of the example where mean(y)=0. You cannot in general use a mean like this. If you needed a standardized impact measure (highly discouraged; reporting in real units is much more helpful and relevant) you almost always need the normalizing factor to be a measure of dispersion that cannot be zero unless all values are identical, for example, Gini's mean difference (mean absolute difference between any two y -values) or standard deviation. By in my humble opinion the desire for unitless impact measures of the type you read about is often caused by avoidance of thinking.
