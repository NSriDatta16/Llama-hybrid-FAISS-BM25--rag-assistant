Need Help with Generic HTML/CSS Layout

I've been designing websites for a while now and haven't had any complaints, surprisingly. But, there's one thing that bothers me quite a bit. I'm slow. It takes me, on average about an hour to style 1 webpage (a full webpage incl. content, images, text and so on) - and I don't know if that's how long it takes most people? And I always run into the same problems over and over again (even though each time I use a different way, based on what I learned last time), which causes me to constantly re-align, re-adjust, re-write. I know I'm doing something wrong, but I just don't know where anymore. When my pages are finished, they're great, but there's always some very tiny, but noticeable differences between each browser - and it really * me. Below is HTML & CSS for a generic, empty webpage. Maybe you could be so kind as to tell me what you think is wrong with it, and how I might be able to better it?
