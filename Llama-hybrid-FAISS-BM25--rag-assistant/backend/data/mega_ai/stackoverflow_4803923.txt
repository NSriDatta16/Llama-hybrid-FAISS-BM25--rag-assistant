If you follow all instructions, verifying your property name is correct, that it is correctly being assigned a new value, you are using a singleton to guarantee one instance of you view model, and you have successfully assigned your DataContext in the UI - make sure that whatever is forcing your property to update is done after the visual tree has been completed, i.e. move the refresh of your property to a button, rather than say the Loaded event of your window. I say this because I had the same issue, and found that when I refreshed my view model data property from my Infragistics NetAdvantage ribbon window's Loaded event, my PropertyChanged event was always null.
