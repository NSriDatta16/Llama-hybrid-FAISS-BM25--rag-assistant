I haven't done anything like this myself, but I think your idea to utilise an iframe is on the right track. In fact, this is how Google Maps generates its embed code. Your app will need to generate a URL with all relevant Google Map parameters such as bounds, zoom level as well as your application-specific params. Any event that triggers the map to re-draw (drag, zoom, etc.) will generate a new URL. If you try the embed link in Google Maps as an example, it generates a URL that looks something like this: http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&sll=45.434035,12.339057&sspn=0.003294,0.004812&ie=UTF8&ll=45.432724,12.338966&spn=0.006588,0.009624&t=h&z=17 This URL can then be wrapped up in an iframe which your end users can place on their web pages. Re: resizing Yes, it's possible to dynamically resize it if width/height is part of your application params that generates the embed code. Again using Google Maps as an example: If you mean resized by user, after it's been displayed, I'm not sure.. most likely, yes.
