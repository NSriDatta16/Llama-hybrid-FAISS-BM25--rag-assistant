For example, is there a way to produce valid predictions alongside this model? Yes, there is, and it is called logistic regression . The details of logistic regression are too long to put here. You can find them in any number of books on Generalized Linear Models . Logistic regression fixes near all of the problems you've listed here: Non-normality is no problem because we model the likelihood (appropriately) as binomial rather than normal. Dependence of the variance on the mean is also naturally handled The logistic link function $\operatorname{logit} : \mathbb{R} \to (0,1)$ , so we always get valid predictions. The trade off is (perhaps) in interpretability. Linear probability models are dead simple in their interpretation, but the coefficients of a logistic regression are in terms of log odds ratios . Its simple to state what these are, but difficult to interpret them in the same way as the coefficients of a linear model. LPM vs Logistic regression is hotly debated in some circles, and before progressing I think it may be beneficial to kindly ask whomever suggested LPM why they did that and not suggest logistic regression.
