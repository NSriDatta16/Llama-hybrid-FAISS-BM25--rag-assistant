Organisation of applications in Symfony

I'm looking to use Symfony as the framework for a gallery website - but I was wondering about how to organise the applications. The example Symfony documentation takes a simple approach with a Frontend/Backend split - but this seems a bit limited. For a gallery site, there are quite a few components which can interact to varying degrees - homepage, images, galleries, tags, comments, text pages, RSS feeds, etc. I guess my question is - would I have an application for homepage, one for gallery views, one for gallery management, one for tags, etc? Things like tags can be applied to both images and galleries (and also maybe text pages). Or should have these as modules within the simple Frontend/Backend split?
