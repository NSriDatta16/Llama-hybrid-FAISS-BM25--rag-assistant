Is there academic research on how to choose the number of layers and neurons in a neural network?

I did some research and I understand that there is no right answer in choosing the number of layers and neurons in a neural network architecture. I have seen some guidelines and rules of thumb in posts and blogs. Even though they are helpful, I am wondering if there is any academic paper on them. Do you have any study/work/research about how to choose the number of layers and neurons to share?
