How to generate random networks for comparison with my network?

I have a network of 361 nodes and 695 edges. I want to prove that my network is statistically significantly different from a random network. Small-world connectivity is a key parameter that has been tested to prove whether a network is real or random. As per this question , I would like to generate multiple random networks and get an average across all the networks that I generate. My question is: Should I use the same number of nodes and edges over all the random networks that I generate?
