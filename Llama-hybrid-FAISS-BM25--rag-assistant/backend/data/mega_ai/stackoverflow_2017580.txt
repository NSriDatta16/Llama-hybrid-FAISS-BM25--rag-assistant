Probably because that's what a dictionary returns when you do a standard iteration over it. It gets converted to a sequence containing it's keys. This example exhibits the same behaviour: >>> for i in {"a": "1", "b": "2"}: ... print i ... a b To get what I assume you expect you would pass it as variable keyword arguments instead, like this: >>> def a(**kwargs): ... print kwargs ... >>> a(**{"a": "1", "b": "2"}) {'a': '1', 'b': '2'} Note that you are now basically back where you began and have gained nothing.
