I would suggest investing into a test automation tool. If you are using continuous integration you can make it work in tandem. There are tools aout there which will scan your codebase and will generate tests for you. Then will run them. Downside of this approach is that its too generic. Because in many cases unit test's purpose is to break the system. I have written numerous tests and yes I have to change them if the codebase changes. There is a fine line with automation tool you would definatelly have better code coverage. However, with a well wrttien develper based tests you will test system integrity as well. Hope this helps.
