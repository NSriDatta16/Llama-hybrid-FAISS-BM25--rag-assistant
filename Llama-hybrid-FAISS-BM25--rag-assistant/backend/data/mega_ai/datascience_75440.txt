I have faced this issue for many years, as a data scientist or an ML engg. we have to create a ton of models before coming to a conclusion. Effectively storing all the model's profiles, parameters, and features used is a pain specially if you have multiple notebooks. modellogger is a python package that can help you to organise the stuffs and create a full blown summary with dynamic stats on the call of an function. pip install modellogger follow the 3 steps easy documentation and voila you have it.
