Does it make sense to take a weighted average over cross validation results?

I am using P-splines to estimate an unknown function $f(x)=y$ that I am fitting to data $x,y$ . I am using cross validation to estimate the roughness parameter. It is important to me to not only estimate the function itself, but also its uncertainty at any given point. I am currently partially achieving this through the propagation of the uncertainties in the data, because each $y$ value already has estimated 1-standard-deviation uncertainties $\sigma_y$ . So I do $N$ Monte Carlo realizations of the data, re-fit the splines in each realization, and take an average over those results. However, this only propagates the random uncertainties in the data, and I also want to propagate the systematic uncertainties of the fit. I was thinking I can possibly achieve this by averaging over the cross-validation results. In particular, I was thinking I can take a weighted standard deviation over the fits with different roughness parameters, where the weights are given by the reciprocal mean square error. Is there statistical justification for this? Or is there already a different well-known way to accomplish what I want?
