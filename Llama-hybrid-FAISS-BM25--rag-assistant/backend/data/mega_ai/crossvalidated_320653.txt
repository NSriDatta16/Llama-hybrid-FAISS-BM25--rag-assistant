There is nothing wrong with the method, it has been explored in the literature a lot. This is for instance the way that many papers use to evaluate extrinsically word embeddings with tasks like classification. One would expect however to lose in terms of accuracy as the length of the documents increases. Models like doc2vec have been proposed to address such limitations, but it is always better to test them in your benchmark.
