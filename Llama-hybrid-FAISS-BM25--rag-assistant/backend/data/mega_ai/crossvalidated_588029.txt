There is a way to perform a restricted search of the parameters of ARIMA in autoarima, as it is a very short time series the data you have, I would only grid on AR - MA parameter from the model that is (p,q). So by editing the ranges of p and q (max and min) you would improve the results by having a more reasonable result. In order to decide aproximated ranges you can use acf and pacf plots. auto.arima( y, d = NA, D = NA, max.p = 5, max.q = 5, ... For more info, please see documentation at: https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/forecast/reference/auto.arima.html please note that ARIMA/ARMA is a generalization of a regression so similar to classic methods like moving average can be leveraged.
