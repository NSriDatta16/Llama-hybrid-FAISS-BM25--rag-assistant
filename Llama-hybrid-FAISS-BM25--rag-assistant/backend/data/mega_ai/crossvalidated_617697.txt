Importance of linear discriminants to classification at a given point

Many outstanding answers here detail the fundamentals of linear discriminant analysis. These include descriptions of its use in dimensionality reduction , an explanation of classification using Bayes' rule , and a description of within- and between-class scatter matrices . Common methods for measuring importance of discriminants to classification as a whole (eigenvalue and correlation-based) are included in the first answer . These seem to tackle the problem, "How important is discriminant d for separating clusters in general?" I am searching for something slightly different: How important is discriminant d , given the value of an input point, x, that we would like to classify ? What I've tried so far: iteratively removing discriminants and calculating class probabilities at x using Bayes' rule. Stopping when statistical difference between iteration i and i+1 exceeds a threshold. I would prefer, however, a non-iterative solution that is more similar to the direct calculation of discriminant coefficients.
