Write a python script that generate your version source file. Then make it run by whatever build scripts/tool you're using. Choose a rule to actually rewrite the version file and enforce it in the python script : it's really dependent on the type of project and release organisation you're doing. In my home project I use a script that generate a version file each time I build, because I need to know wich computer-developer built the version and at wich time. But in a lot of job works I used a script that generated the version file but only if I wanted it to. That's because the dev team decided when a specific version was a "release". I suggested using a Python script because Python runs on all developement platforms and is really powerful and easy when it comes to text files manipulations. It can then be called by whatever build system (Visual Studio, CMake, etc.) you use.
