You're asking about naming conventions, and the answer is, it's really up to you. I allow for extra levels of hierarchy in a namespace if there will be multiple implementations. In your case, the .Sql is appropriate if there is some other storage mechanism that doesn't use Sql for queries. Maybe it's XML/Xpath. But if you don't have that, then it seems like the .Sql layer of naming isn't necessary. At that poiint, though, I'm wondering why you would use {games,users} at the prior level. Feels like the namespace is more naturally JoltEnvironment.Game.Storage ..And the Fully-qualified type names would be JoltEnvironment.Game.Storage.SqlItem JoltEnvironment.Game.Storage.SqlUser and so on. If a namespace, like JoltEnvironment.Game.Items, has only one or two classes, it seems like it ought to be collapsed into a higher level namespace.
