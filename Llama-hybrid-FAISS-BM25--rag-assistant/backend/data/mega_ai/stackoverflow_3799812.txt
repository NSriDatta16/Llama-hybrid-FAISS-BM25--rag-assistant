Take a look at Ext JS . It has a clean architecture that is well-suited towards highly complex javascript applications. Data handling and server communication is done via stores. Data rendering is done via grids (with in-cell editors), and forms (with a rich set of form controls), which can both talk to the stores. There's also a set of layout classes to abstract away CSS positioning (border layout, box layout, table layout, form layout, ...). It is however not MVC in the typical sense. The library encourages a programming style that avoids dealing much with HTML and CSS, letting you live (mostly) in pure JavaScript land. You end up thinking in terms of components and data, instead of individual dom elements and style rules. If you don't like that approach, be warned, you won't like this library.
