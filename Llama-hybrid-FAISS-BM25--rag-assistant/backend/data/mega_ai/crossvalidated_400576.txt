Correlation of two autocorrelated time series

Say I have two time series $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ that are autocorrelated and I want to compute correlation coefficient between them. I've heard that in case of a high autocorrelation (close to 1) the correlation coefficient will be inflated. I, however, can not find any good reference showing this fact mathematically. Let's assume that we are talking about stationary time series.
