I currently use code similar to this for embedding youtube videos into apps. However, when a user taps on the video (generates a thumbnail the user can tap on in the webview) it goes full screen, so may not be what you're looking for. NSMutableString* urlString = [NSMutableString stringWithFormat:@"http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/%@?v=2&alt=jsonc", youtubeId]; NSURLRequest* request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:urlString]]; NSURLResponse* response = nil; NSError* error = nil; NSData* data = [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:request returningResponse:&response error:&error]; // Extract JSON from data into an NSDictionary NSDictionary* jsonDict = /* however you want to do it */ // Make sure that the video hasn't been flagged as restricted, otherwise the user won't know what's going on. Later check restricted and present an error as appropriate. BOOL restricted = youtubeVideoRestricted(jsonDict); If restricted is NO , then I feed the web view some html like this: embedSrc = @" " " " " " " "; embedSrc = [NSString stringWithFormat:embedSrc, youtubeId, youtubeId]; I have this in an app on the store right now, works fine. That said, I've learned to keep the video up. So in case of problems with the youtube feed, it falls back to the blip.tv service where the video lives as well. User doesn't notice something failed on youtube. But that's beyond the scope of your question.
