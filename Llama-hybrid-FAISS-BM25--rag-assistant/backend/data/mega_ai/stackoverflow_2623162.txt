I would implement something like: Available Assigned +-----------------+ +-------------------+ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | +-----------------+ +-------------------+ Filter: ----------- Where each box is a list view, the filter text box allows the user to filter the available diagnosis', and items are drag/droppable between boxes. Once an item has been assigned, mousing over would show an inline delete button to allow the user to remove previously assigned values.
