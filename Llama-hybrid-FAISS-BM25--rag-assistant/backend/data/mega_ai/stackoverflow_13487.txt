It should be possible. I have developed a xulrunner application that connects to a TCP server using sockets. Extension development would likely have the same capabilities. I used a library from mozdev - JSLib . Specifically check out the networking code . The fact that there is a Firefox add-on for JSlib add-on for Firefox makes more more confident. Essentially, as I understand it, sockets are not part of JavaScript, but through XPCOM, you can get raw socket access like you would in any c/c++ application. Warning: JSLib doesn't seem to receive a lot of attention and the mailing list is pretty sparse.
