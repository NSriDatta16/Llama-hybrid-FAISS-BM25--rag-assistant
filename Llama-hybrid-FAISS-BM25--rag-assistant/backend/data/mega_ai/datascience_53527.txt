Accuracy decrease in production after adding additional input datas

I am trying to predict TimeSeriesA by using a CNN. I create snapshot images of the timeseries and these are then labelled. With a very simple snapshot I get reasonable training and test accuracy. When I apply the model to real world in production I also get reasonable accuracy. Inorder to improve the accuracy, I added other timeseries to the snapshots that may or may not add value. Both my training and testing accuracy increased (Training much more so). However, my production accuracy has gone down greatly. Why might this happen? The original data is still in the snapshot in exactly the same format. Can a CNN be confused (wrong word!) by the additional data? Here is a look at the stationarity of TimeSeriesA: Year: 2000 Ave: -0.0003 Std: 0.0076 Skew: 0.2166 Year: 2001 Ave: -0.0002 Std: 0.0072 Skew: 0.0158 Year: 2002 Ave: 0.0006 Std: 0.0056 Skew: -0.2445 Year: 2003 Ave: 0.0007 Std: 0.0065 Skew: -0.0402 Year: 2004 Ave: 0.0003 Std: 0.0067 Skew: -0.2640 Year: 2005 Ave: -0.0005 Std: 0.0056 Skew: 0.2420 Year: 2006 Ave: 0.0004 Std: 0.0047 Skew: 0.2711 Year: 2007 Ave: 0.0004 Std: 0.0039 Skew: -0.3177 Year: 2008 Ave: -0.0001 Std: 0.0087 Skew: 0.3768 Year: 2009 Ave: 0.0001 Std: 0.0076 Skew: 0.2327 Year: 2010 Ave: -0.0002 Std: 0.0074 Skew: 0.0112 Year: 2011 Ave: -0.0001 Std: 0.0074 Skew: -0.2599 Year: 2012 Ave: 0.0001 Std: 0.0051 Skew: 0.2541 Year: 2013 Ave: 0.0002 Std: 0.0046 Skew: 0.0818 Year: 2014 Ave: -0.0005 Std: 0.0039 Skew: -0.1489 Year: 2015 Ave: -0.0004 Std: 0.0076 Skew: 0.2973 Year: 2016 Ave: -0.0001 Std: 0.0051 Skew: 0.0076 Year: 2017 Ave: 0.0005 Std: 0.0045 Skew: 0.3101 Year: 2018 Ave: -0.0002 Std: 0.0045 Skew: -0.1658 Year: 2019 Ave: -0.0002 Std: 0.0033 Skew: -0.1124 I train the model with data up to end of 2010. I get a training accuracy and validation accuracy of around 65%. When I then appy the model to data from 2011 to 2019, I get a drop-off in accuracy. The green years are those included in the training.
