Given $y_1$ and $y_2$, the posteriors on $(\mu_i,V_i)$ are independent: $$ (\mu_i,V_i)|y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\xi_i,V_i/\lambda^\mu_i)\times \mathcal{IG}(\lambda^{\sigma}_i,\alpha_i)\,, $$ where the normal distribution is the conditional distribution of $\mu_i$ given $y_i$ and $V_i$ [see formula (2.7) in Bayesian Core !] Then this means that, conditional on $(V_1,V_2)$ and $(y_1,y_2)$, $$ \mu_1+\mu_2\sim \mathcal{N}(\xi_1+\xi_2,V_1/\lambda^\mu_1+V_2/\lambda^\mu_2)\,. $$ Unfortunately, the marginal distribution of $V_1+V_2$ is not so straightforward since it is the sum of two inverse gamma random variables with different scale and shape parameters... Even the sum $V_1^{-1}+V_2^{-1}$ does not enjoy a simple expression when the scale parameters are not the same!
