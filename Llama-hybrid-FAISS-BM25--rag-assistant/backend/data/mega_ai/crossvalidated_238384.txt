How to implement a SVM on a distributed platform like Hadoop

I am trying to implement a SVM on a distributed computing paltform. More generally, I am asking how to solve a minimax problem distributively. I can not find a way to tackle the X'X because computing an entry in this matrix will require two training examples. And this leads to the problem of dividing the input into chunks in a typical distributed platform. Does anyone know how to solve this problem or know any source that I can refer to?
