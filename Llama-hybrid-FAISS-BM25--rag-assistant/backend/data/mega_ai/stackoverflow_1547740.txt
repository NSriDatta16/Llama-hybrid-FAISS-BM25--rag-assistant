I suggest reading this Blog entry Introducing Tinder, an XMPP object implementation library Smack -> Cross-platform real-time collaboration client optimized for business and organizations Whack -> Java XMPP component library Tinder -> Java based XMPP library, providing an implementation for XMPP stanzas and components Tinder builds on code from Openfire and Whack. Does not replace Smack but will most likley replace Whack, OpenFire (formerly WildFire)
