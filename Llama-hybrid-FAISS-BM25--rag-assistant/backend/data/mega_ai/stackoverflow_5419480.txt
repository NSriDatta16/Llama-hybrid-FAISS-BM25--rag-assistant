First of all, you need to make sure that Magento cache is enabled. You can do it in Admin -> System -> Cache Management. All cache data should be enabled there. If it didn't help, you need to enable Profiler, and this will help you to see bottlenecks as a table in the footer. You can do it in 2 steps: Go to Admin -> System -> Configuration -> Developer -> Debug, and enable Profiler. Edit Magento's index.php file, and uncomment this line: Varien_Profiler::enable(); After steps 1 and 2 has been done -- go to any page, a look at the footer.
