What machine learning model would be the best fit for this problem [Sample Data-set and Plot Attached]?

So I've got a dataset that looks like: Weight(KG) Count 25 9 4 17 55 9 4 25 4 7 .... .... My aim is to find any relation between the weight and count and maybe predict count based on a given weight . I'm using Linear Regression (I don't know if this is the right way to go). Results were pretty disappointing: Without label encoding (categorizing) and feature scaling (normalizing) the R squared metric was around 4%. With the encoding and scaling down it 'improved' to 6%. My Regression plot looks like this ( X_train (weights) and Y_train (counts) ): I'm completely lost as to what model would actually give me some insight into this problem. So my questions are: What model would work better for the given data and plot? Should I convert the problem into some kind of classification problem and try to predict whether for a given weight the count is above, say, 20 ? Should I try adding in more features and try my luck? If so, would it still be a regression problem? I'd appreciate any comments on all these questions or even on a single one. Thanks in advance. Much appreciated.
