Negative population variable importance

EDIT: Question solved on mathoverflow . The question is: Is it possible for the population variable importance to be negative ? The variable importance is defined below in the context it comes from: random forests. But no knowledge is required about random forests, the question is a simple statement in probability theory, and the reader can skip everything related to statistics. Consider we run a random forest on $n$ independent realizations of a random vector $(X_1,X_2,X_3,Y)$ assuming $Y$ is a numerical response variable. Let $f$ be the best theoretical classifier defined by $E[Y\mid X_1, X_2, X_3]=f(X_1, X_2, X_3)$. The variable importance $\hat I_j$ of the $j$-th predictor $X_j$ is defined as follows. For each tree $t$ of the random forest, there's a classifier $\hat f_t$. The mean squared error $MSE_t$ in tree $t$ is the mean squared prediction error in the out-of-bag sample of tree $t$. The $j$-th perturbed mean squared error $MSE_t^{(j)}$ is defined similarly after randomly permuting the values of $j$-th variable in the out-of-bag sample. Finally $\hat I_j$ is defined as the average difference $\overline{MSE}^{(j)} - \overline{MSE}$ over all trees. Let's take $j=1$ to shorten the notations. In Correlation and variable importance in random forests (Gregorutti & al) , an expected result is claimed : when $n$ and $ntree$ go to $\infty$, then $\hat I_1$ goes to the population variable importance $$I_1 = E\left[{\bigl(Y-f(X'_1,X_2,X_3)\bigr)}^2\right] - E\left[{\bigl(Y-f(X_1,X_2,X_3)\bigr)}^2\right]$$ where $X'_1$ is a random variable having the same distribution as $X_1$ but independent of all other random variables $X_2,X_3,Y$. Of course some kind of consistency of the random forest classifier $\hat f$ (aggregate of the $\hat f_t$) is required in order that this convergence result holds. The question is: "is it possible that $I_1 In case you are interested in a simple example, the paper Correlation and variable importance in random forests (Gregorutti & al) investigates some particular cases such as the additive case $f(X_1,X_2,X_3)=f_1(X_1)+f_2(X_2)+f_3(X_3)$. It is easy to check that $I_j=2Var\bigl(f_j(X_j)\bigr)$ in this case.
