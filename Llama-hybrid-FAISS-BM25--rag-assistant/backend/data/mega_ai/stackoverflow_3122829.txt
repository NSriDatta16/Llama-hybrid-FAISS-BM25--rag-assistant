The idea that this has anything to do with random memory contents when a machine is powered up is bogus, except on embedded systems. Any machine with virtual memory and a multiprocess/multiuser operating system will initialize memory (usually to 0) before giving it to a process. Failure to do so would be a major security breach. The 'random' values in automatic-storage variables come from previous use of the stack by the same process. Similarly, the 'random' values in memory returned by malloc/new/etc. come from previous allocations (that were subsequently freed) in the same process.
