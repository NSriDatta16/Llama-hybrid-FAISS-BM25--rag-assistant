Is your SVM implementation parallel? One simple idea would be to split your 10-fold CV across 10 machines (or cores). This should reduce the algorithm's runtime to almost 1/10 of its current running time. What do you mean by "info gain?" Have you tried applying LibLINEAR on a dataset with no features removed?
