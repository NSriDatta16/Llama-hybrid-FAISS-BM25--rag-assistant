just make gstat d:\path\database.fdb you will get someting like this for your index : > Index CLIENT_IDX (2) > Depth: 3, leaf buckets: 545, nodes: 138523 > Average data length: 10.12, total dup: 13873, max dup: 645 > Fill distribution: > 0 - 19% = 0 > 20 - 39% = 0 > 40 - 59% = 0 > 60 - 79% = 0 > 80 - 99% = 545 if Depth is more than 3 : you will have to increase the page size. It is the same as Douglas Tosi say. You can see this very well in tools like IBExpert full edition or in IBAnalist
