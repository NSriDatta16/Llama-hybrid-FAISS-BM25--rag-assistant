This sounds like homework, but let me answer with some general principles and ideas: If this is a time series, there should be some kind of time value attached, such as the year or month these occurred in. Where has it gone? As a first step in any data analysis, especially for time series, plot the data . This should help you answer your specific questions 1 and 2. The first column is just the sum of the other two and has no independent role. It might be convenient if you want to do a plot of, say, female suicides as a percentage of the total, which will help you answer your specific question 2. Your data are far too short a time series to do any kind of sophisticated statistical analysis on. A plot is the best you could hope for. If you were to do such analysis (on a longer sample), you would want to have some hypotheses about possible explanators, like unemployment, bankruptcies or some other thing that might drive people to suicide. Before launching into data analysis, ask yourself some questions about how the data are compiled and what their quality are. Is the source of these data trustworthy? Are there other sources, and if so, are the consistent with your data? How are the data compiled? Are you sure you have the full count of case (the population), or is this a sample, an estimate or some other thing? Do the data get revised? If so, does this change how you might view the apparent downward trend in the last few data points? Do the data look plausible relative to data from other sources on, say, total death rates and the total population? For example, if the population is a small village of a few thousand, these numbers might seem implausibly high (though not impossible if there is something special - and tragic - about that village). Conversely, if these data refer to a large population like the United States, they are probably too low and some cases might be being missed. I hope these suggestions point you in the right direction.
