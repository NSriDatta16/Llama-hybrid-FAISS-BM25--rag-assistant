Here's what I ended up doing. I wrote a custom template stringfilter to switch the tags around. Now, my template code looks like this: {% load pretty_forms %} {{ form.as_p|pretty_checkbox }} The only difference from a plain Django template is the addition of the {% load %} template tag and the pretty_checkbox filter. Here's a functional but ugly implementation of pretty_checkbox - this code doesn't have any error handling, it assumes that the Django generated attributes are formatted in a very specific way, and it would be a bad idea to use anything like this in your code: from django import template from django.template.defaultfilters import stringfilter import logging register=template.Library() @register.filter(name='pretty_checkbox') @stringfilter def pretty_checkbox(value): # Iterate over the HTML fragment, extract and tags, and # switch the order of the pairs where the input type is "checkbox". scratch = value output = '' try: while True: ls = scratch.find(' -1: le = scratch.find(' ') ins = scratch.find(' ', ins) # Check whether we're dealing with a checkbox: if scratch[ins:ine+2].find(' type="checkbox" ')>-1: # Switch the tags output += scratch[:ls] output += scratch[ins:ine+2] output += scratch[ls:le-1]+scratch[le:le+8] else: output += scratch[:ine+2] scratch = scratch[ine+2:] else: output += scratch break except: logging.error("pretty_checkbox caught an exception") return output pretty_checkbox scans its string argument, finds pairs of and tags, and switches them around if the tag's type is "checkbox". It also strips the last character of the label, which happens to be the ':' character. Advantages: No futzing with CSS. The markup ends up looking the way it's supposed to. I didn't hack Django internals. The template is nice, compact and idiomatic. Disadvantages: The filter code needs to be tested for exciting values of the labels and input field names. There's probably something somewhere out there that does it better and faster. More work than I planned on doing on a Saturday.
