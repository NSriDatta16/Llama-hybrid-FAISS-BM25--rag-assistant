There is too little information on your research question and data-structure to really allow good advice, but I'll try. In this scenario "status" is you "dependent variable", since you suspect that it depends on "entry_time" and "last_veh_time" (your "independent" variables). There is an excellent explanation on terminology here . Given the minimal information above, I cannot see why you would want to perform a mixed model analysis rather than a standard logistic regression. You only need a mixed effects model when there are repeated measures on a single experimental unit (e.g. if the same vehicleIDs is showing up in several rows) or if there is some other grouping/clustering factor of no interest that makes some vehicles more similar to each other (i.e. cluster together). If this is not the case and you have only one vehicle per line, I think no mixed model is needed. If you vehicleIDs are showing up repeatedly, your mixed logistic regression might look something like this: glmer(status ~ entry_time + last_veh_time + vehicle_type + (1 | vehicle_id), data = model_data, family = binomial) #The link-function describing the relationship between your linear model and the binomial distribution of your outcome PS: Currently "entry_time" is continuous. Depending on your research question you might want to consider whether it makes sense to convert "time" into sub-variables calendar date & daytime or even year & month & day & daytime.
