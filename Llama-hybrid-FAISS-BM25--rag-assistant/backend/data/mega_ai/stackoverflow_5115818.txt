How to normalize neural networks for genetic algorithms?

I am trying to train a simple feedforward neural network using a genetic algorithm, however it is proving fairly inefficient because isomorphic neural networks appear different to the genetic algorithm. It is possible to have multiple neural networks, which behave the same way, but have their neurons ordered in a different way from left to right and across levels. To the genetic algorithms those networks' genotypes will appear completely different. Therefore any attempt to do crossover is pointless and the GA ends up being as effective as hill climbing. Can you recommend a way to normalize the networks so they appear more transparent to the genetic algorithm?
