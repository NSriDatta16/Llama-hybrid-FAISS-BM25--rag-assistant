How to explain a difference between the test and validation set's distribution of probabilities by a binary classificaion model with probabilities?

I am using Random Forests for a binary classification model, where the output of the model is a score between 0 and 1. The problem is that there is a stark difference between the distribution of my instances with respect to the score between the validation and the test set. Here are the histograms: 1) Validation Set 2) Test Set I can think of two reasons that might explain this: 1) Overfitting, although it is my understanding that RF tends not to overfit 2) The pattern is indeed different for the instances of my test set I am at a loss as to what might explain this behaviour. I should also note that when we compared the proportion of 1/0 outcomes for 0.1 buckets between the test and the validation set, the results are also very different Thanks for the help!
