Is there such as role as a Java Runtime Administrator?

There are Database Administrators (DBA) and Unix|Windows System Administrators. There are likely soon to be Cloud Administrators. There are hordes of "administrators" who are tasked with administering and managing numerous large-system JVMs running on/in various stacks, yet I've honestly met very few of them who have any real understanding of what a JVM is, monitoring it, instrumenting, measuring, & tuning. Do large organizations hire Windows administrators who are responsible for managing their Oracle instances? yet businesses and the public sector the world over expect system admins to manage JVMs with the same opacity. Is there a valid operational role of a Java Runtime Administrator ?
