No it's not. This is done quite frequently actually. Generally one does this when one needs time critical code to run quicker (everything else equal, calling a C function is quicker than an Objective-C method). However, it may also be nicer in some other cases to write C functions instead. Remember though that Objective-C is a superset of C. Everything C can do, Objective-C can do, and it should not be considered bad to do anything C can do. There may be cases where doing some things is discouraged, but anyway.
