Transition matrix to a compact set of rules

I would like to ask you about methods of converting a discrete time Markov chain, represented by a fully known transition matrix, into a relatively small set of transition rules. For example, let there be a transition matrix: $$ \left(\begin{array}{cccc} 1-m & m & 0 & 0 \\ u & 1-u-m & m & 0 \\ 0 & u & 1-u-m & m \\ 0 & 0 & u & 1-u \\ \end{array}\right) $$ where a coordinate (either a row or column one) represents tha value of a state vector, containing only a single element, e. g. a queue size $q$, which can be $0 \ldots 3$. A row number expresses the current state, and a column number expresses the next state. So, e.g. for $q=3$, there is a probability $u$, that the next state will be $q=2$, and a probability $1-u$ of staying in the same state. The method I ask about, on basis of that matrix, would be able to find out these two transition rules: $$ \begin{array}{c} q > 0 \rightarrow \mathrm{prob}(u): \,\, q' = q - 1 \\ q to describe that matrix. This could ease to see the patterns in a Markov chain given by, often directly hardly readable, transition matrix.
