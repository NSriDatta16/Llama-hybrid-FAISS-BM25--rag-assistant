I'm not sure how to do it with an MSI, but what about reversing the problem? Instead of using an MSI, you could create a service that the Siverlight client checks on startup and, depending on the return value, the client could clear its own isolated storage. Of course, this assumes that you can update the Silverlight client; it's not clear from your question if you can.
