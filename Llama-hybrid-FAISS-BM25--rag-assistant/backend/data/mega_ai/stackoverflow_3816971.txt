If you want it working for new method, try this: u = User.first u.organizations.new :name => "new organozation" u.save u.organizations.size => 1 When you do org = User.first.organizations.new :name => "test" then you assign to org only organization and you save only that object. It doesn't save associated objects. That's why it doesn't work that way. When you call create it saves created objects to db, using new or build doesn't save it to db.
