Late, but for posterity: You want the mitools package, which allows you to supply a list of estimated parameters and their estimated covariance matrix. Get a list of the parameters from each model, say, param.list , and another list of the covariances, say, cov.list . Then run: summary(MIcombine(param.list, cov.list)) Note that it's not necessary to use Zelig to extract treatment effects, and using glm is acceptable too. If using MatchIt , the estimated effect is intepretable as the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT).
