Longitudinal mixed model in R: a special case with various complications

The longitudinal dataset has n=275 and 8 measurement points. There are 3 groups (3 different drugs) with roughly n=80 each. The complications are: (1) Substantial dropout: only n=136 have all observations. Dropout is not missing at random, of course: severity predicts dropout, so do a few other variables in the dataset. (2) I have 17 dependent variables (DVs) of interest. Dimension reduction (e.g., PCA) is not possible because the covariance of variables changes dramatically over time (there are 4-5 dimensions/components at baseline and 1-2 dimensions/components at study exit) (3) The 17 DVs are all ordered-categorical, and have different ranges (from 0 to 2 to 0 to 4). My research question is whether the 3 drugs (groups) have differential impact on the trajectory of the 17 DVs. The best possibility seems to be to fit 17 longitudinal mixed models or 17 generalized estimation equations to the data, and correct for multiple testing somehow; there is probably too little power to fit multivariate models with even 2 DVs (let alone 17). The package lme4 using the lmer() function cannot handle ordinal data, and I cannot model skewed ordinal variables with 3 categories as gaussian. The package ordinal using the clmm2() function deletes missing values listwise, deleting too many observations. So I seem to be trapped between a rock and a hard place and don't know how to fit the model even in the univariate case.
