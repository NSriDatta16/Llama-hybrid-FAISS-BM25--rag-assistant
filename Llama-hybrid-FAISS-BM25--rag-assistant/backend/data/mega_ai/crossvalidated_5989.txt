It is usually the statistician using the classifier that is the problem (for picking the wrong tool for the particular problem at hand, or for using it incorrectly). The "no free lunch" theorems show there is no a-priori distinction between classifiers (which works best/worst depends on the data), so I'd say there isn't a worst classifier in a general sense. However, some classifiers are easier to shoot yourself in the foot with than others, in which case, I would nominate artificial neural networks (the over-fit very easily and need proper architecture selection and none of the solutions to such problems are reliable).
