Can you post the html you're using to embed the move in the page? I have to admit, though, that I find all the nuances of embedding flash to be a headache. I can never remember them all, so I rely on this project to handle all the browser variations for me: http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/ . You might find that using swfobject helps make the problem "just go away" :-) Their docs also have some 'non-javascript' fallbacks if you need that.
