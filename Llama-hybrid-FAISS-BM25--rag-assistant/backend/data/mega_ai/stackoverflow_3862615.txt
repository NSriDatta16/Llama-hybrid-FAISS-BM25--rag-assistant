I encountered the same problem, after several days of inspection we found that it is internal bug of IE8 with its image cache. Try to delete complete browser history if it works for the first time. If it is your case then working solution is to add dummyParam to every image URL (with value e.g. new Date().timeInMilis() or something similar). I made this param enabled for user.agent=ie8 only. I am really afraid of IE9 :(.
