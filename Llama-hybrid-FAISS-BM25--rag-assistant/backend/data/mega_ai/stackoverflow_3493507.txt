ATTENTION Besides the already mentioned solutions to get the whole autocomplete help to work, there is another quirk: it might not be enabled. Go to Window > Properties and then to PHP > Editor > Code Assist (JAVA has a similar option) and set "Enable auto activation", preferably with a delay that you see comfortable (0ms). If you are bothered by the program suddenly deciding to do things for you without prompt (and doing it wrong), deselect "Insert single proposals automatically" and you should be fine.
