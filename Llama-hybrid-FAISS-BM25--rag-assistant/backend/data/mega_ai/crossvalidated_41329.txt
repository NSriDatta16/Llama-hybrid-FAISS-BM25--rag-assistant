Principal Component Analysis is generally a good choice for dimension reduction in most cases, I am not sure it will suit for your particular problem, but it will find the orthogonal dimensions along which most variation of data samples are captured. If you develop in R, you can use prcomp() to simply convert your original matrix of data points to the PCA form.
