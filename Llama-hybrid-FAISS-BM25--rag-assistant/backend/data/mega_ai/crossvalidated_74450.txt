Naive SE vs Time Series SE: which statistics should I report after Bayesian estimation?

I am new to Bayesian estimation. When I do some estimations with JAGS, I find there are statistics called Naive SE and Time Series SE. What exactly do they mean? Is it necessary that I report one or both of them as part of the estimation result?
