Giving Access Denied error ini IE7/8 and NS_ERROR_PROXY_CONNECTION_REFUSED in firefox

I am using JQuery, FLXHR for Cross browser authentications. I have implemented JQuery FLXHR to my project, all is working fine till I am using the same domain for example if my login page is (http://staging/login/loginpopup.aspx) and its sending the request to (http://staging/login/login.aspx) for user authentication it works great, just when I change it for HTTPS request, I mean when I send to HTTPS request (https://staging/login/login.aspx) from HTTP it is giving error "text/html (NS_ERROR_PROXY_CONNECTION_REFUSED)" in firefox and "Access Denied" error in IE7 and IE8. If I see in Response Header in HTTPFOX it shows below content. (Status-Line) HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Authentication Required ( The ISA Server requires authorization to fulfill the request. Access to the Web Proxy filter is denied. ) Via 1.1 DXBMIPX12 Proxy-Authenticate Negotiate Kerberos NTLM Connection close Proxy-Connection close Pragma no-cache Cache-Control no-cache Content-Type text/html Content-Length 727 Please suggest what I am missing or what changes are required to fix it.
