Using Neural Networks when target variable has huge deviation

I have a dataset of 10 features which are in the small range between 0.5 and 1 exactly, while the target variable is between 75 and 9000 with a standard deviation of 350 , now I need to use a Neural Network to perform regression on the data but I'm struggling with finding a suitable architecture to solve the issue I'm facing with discrepancy between the ranges of the input and output
