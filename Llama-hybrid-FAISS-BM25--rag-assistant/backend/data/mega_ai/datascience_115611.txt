Yes, you can use a Multivariate RNN. Multivariate RNN In this architecture multiple sequential features (i.e., a number of sequneces) as an input to your recurrent layers. Taking pytorch as a reference, you can see that the input of LSTM object is a tensor of shape $$input = (L, H_{in})$$ where $L$ is the length of your sequences whereas $H_{in}$ is the number of input features* (i.e., a number of sequences). I attach below a couple of resources in case they are helpful: Keras implementation: https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/ Pytorch implementation: https://stackoverflow.com/a/56893248 Hope it helps! * Input can also have $(L, N, H_{in})$ for $N$ batches.
