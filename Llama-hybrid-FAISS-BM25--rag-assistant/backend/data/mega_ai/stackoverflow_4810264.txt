Here is some code that I put together using the tkrplot package and optionally the logspline package. Just run the function (you can change the arguments, but to test you can try it with the defaults) then in the new window that comes up click in the plot, left clicks will add a point where you click, right (or middle) clicks will remove the point closest to where you click. I will probably clean it up a bit and include it in a future release of the TeachingDemos package (so comments/suggestions are very welcome). TkBuildDist ', mouse1.down) tkbind(img, ' ', mouse2.down) tkbind(img, ' ', mouse2.down) tkwait.window(tt) out Here is another version that allows the dragging of the heights of the bars: TkBuildDist2 0 && w = ly && ty ', mouse.move) tkbind(img, ' ', mouse.down) tkbind(img, ' ', mouse.up) tkwait.window(tt) out
