State Design in modern Elevator

I like to implement one language model for elevator operations. To do this I worked out on how elevator works, its time, counterweight aspect, etc. Next, I found it operates mainly by a priority queue. There is also an elevator library in Python. I found some datasets in Kaggle. I found the following discussions, like, https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/331692/what-algorithm-is-used-by-elevators-to- find-the-shortest-path-to-travel-floor-or https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/96278/elevator-algorithm-and-implementation https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/54981/implementing-simple-elvator-algoirthm My question is how do I order the state sequences in a simple modern-day office/housing elevator? I like to start simple and slowly advance into complicated situations. I know NBC, CRF, HMM, RNN (with LSTM, and GRU) well. I know Keras, Tensorflow, and NLTK well. I built NER, Summarizer, QA, Sentiment Classifier. Any good help will be welcome. If anyone may please suggest. Thanking in advance.
