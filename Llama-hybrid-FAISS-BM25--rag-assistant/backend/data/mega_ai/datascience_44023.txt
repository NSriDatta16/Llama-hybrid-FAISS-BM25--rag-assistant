There is some ambiguity in dimensionality you ask for. The vector space that your input lies in is $12\times12 = 144$ dimensional. So, if you're going to apply some kind of dimensionality reduction algorithm, e.g. PCA, this is the dimension . But, we sometimes tend to refer to dimension as the shape of the tensor, which is $2$ in this case. Some libraries might read the image into $12\times12\times3$ tensors, in which the third entry indicates RGB decomposition, even if the image is black and white. In this case, the tensor dimension is $3$ .
