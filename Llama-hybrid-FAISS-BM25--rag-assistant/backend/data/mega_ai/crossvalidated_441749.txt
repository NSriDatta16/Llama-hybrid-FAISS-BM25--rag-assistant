How do ARMA and ARMA-GARCH models relate?

I would like to understand how GARCH models work but I'm having some problems. I have a highly persistent AR time series and I would like to model the conditional mean as well as its conditional variance. I thought of 2 possible ways: Estimate an AR(1) model, obtain the residuals, fit a GARCH(1,1) to the residuals. The first model models the mean, the second model the variance. Estimate an ARMA-GARCH model. I assumed, that both ways should yield the same results in terms of coefficients but that's not the case. Why do the AR coefficients differ? I have created a reprex in R. You only need the fGarch and tseries packages besides base. library(fGarch) library(tseries) # Simulate time series with heteroscedasticity set.seed(1) y # Model Estimation # Estimate AR 1 model_arma ar1 intercept #> 0.9820884 -0.0391143 resids Estimate Std.
