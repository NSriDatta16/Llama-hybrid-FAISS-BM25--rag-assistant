Leveraging Core Animation for Animation in OpenGL

I'm interested in using Core Animation to drive custom animations in my OpenGL scene on the iPhone. I was hoping to find a mechanism that allowed you to generically animate a keypath of an NSObject or a delegate method for each animation tick. What I have come up with is to animate an arbitrary property of a CALayer and poll them from OpenGL to determine the progression of the animation. However, I'm convinced there's a better way to do it. What is the cleanest, safest way to tap into this great animation engine ?
