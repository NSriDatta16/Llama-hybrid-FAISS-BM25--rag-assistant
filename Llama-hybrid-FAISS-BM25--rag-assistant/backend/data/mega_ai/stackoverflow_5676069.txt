Docs covering validation: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/validation/ But it think it would be enough to set blank and null to false according to docs: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/models/fields/ UPDATE: blank and null diff coverage: http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2006/jun/28/django-tips-difference-between-blank-and-null/ But they come as default False ... snap... It means that all the validation has to be done as shown in http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/validation/#using-validation-in-practice or in templates. There is many ways to validate forms. You can use even javascript witch would allow post only when fields are valid. Best probably would be do the validation according to this: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/forms/ UPDATE: It seems that its in some sort near duplicate of Resubmitting Image in ImageField after Validation Error in Django
