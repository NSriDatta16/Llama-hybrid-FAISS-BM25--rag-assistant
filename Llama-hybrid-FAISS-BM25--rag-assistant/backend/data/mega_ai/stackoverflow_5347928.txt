If you have one pixel, I'd say its blueness in terms of RGB is the the value of B / (R + G + B), so 1 is totally blue and 0 is not blue at all and white is 1/3 blue. (Watch out for black, which is a special case.) And the blueness of an image is the average blueness of its pixels. And if that's too costly, just take the average of a fixed number of randomly-chosen pixels.
