What is the best way to average two colors that define a linear gradient?

If I have two colors defined by their RGB values, can I average the Red, Green and Blue values and then combine to define a third color that looks like a visual average of the two? ie NewColor = (R1+R2)/2,(G1+G2)/2,(B1+B2)/2 EDIT1: Thanks for all the responses. For my current needs, I am only dealing with color pairs that are shades of the same color so I think that averaging them will work. However, I will try converting to Lab Space to make sure that assumption is true and the technique will be useful in the future. EDIT2: Here are my results FWIW. Color1 and Color2 are my two colors and the two middle columns are the results of averaging in L a b space and averaging RGB respectively. In this case there is not a lot of difference between the two color and so the differences in the output from the averaging techniques is subtle.
