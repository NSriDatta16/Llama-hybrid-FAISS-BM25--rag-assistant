Averaging Cumulative Distribution Function

I have several (x,y) datasets which form various CDF curves. These are generated by cross-validating models built with different parameters. For example: Aa = [0, 0.1 1, 0.2, 2, 0.3, ... xn, yn] Ab = [0, 0.1 1, 0.2, 2, 0.3, ... xn, yn] Where Aa and Ab refer to curves generated by cross-validating a model built on parameter combination Pa . And I then have: Ba = [0, 0.1 1, 0.2, 2, 0.3, ... xn, yn] Bb = [0, 0.1 1, 0.2, 2, 0.3, ... xn, yn] Where Ba and Bb refer to curves generated by cross-validating a model built on parameter combination Pb . My first step would be to average Aa and Ab to produce an average curve A and Ba and Bb an average curve B . I thought about simply averaging y-values, but I can't guarantee that all curves would share the same x-values so that wouldn't work. Next, I need to decide whether A and B are significanlty different. I thought about two possible strategies: a) Use Matlab's polyfit function to fit the datasets to a polynomial function, and use a t-test to compare polynomial coefficients. b) Use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare x/y values for each point. Any advice?
