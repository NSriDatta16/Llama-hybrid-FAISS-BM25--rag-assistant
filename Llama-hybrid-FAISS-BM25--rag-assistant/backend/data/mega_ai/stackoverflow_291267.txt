I used it in college, but I haven't used it much since. If you're shaky on recursion at all, I highly recommend learning Scheme or Lisp. You'll learn to think recursively about all sorts of things. Is recursion always the right way to go? Of course not. But it's a useful tool to have in the toolbox. I always encourage developers to learn new languages. The more languages you learn and become proficient with, the more abstractly you'll think about problems. The less you're tied to a specific language, the more likely you are to choose the language which best fits your problem.
