Pooled OLS vs RE and FE

I am conducting research for migration from third countries outside EU to Slovakia, Czechia, Hungary and Poland. I have $t=11$ and $N=20$ . I am using Gretl. The only good, economic meaningful results are from pooled OLS. I understand that I should not use this method in panel data (and Breusch Pagan test confirmed me that), but all other results from FE and RE are not economically meaningful and they have completely different signs from pooled OLS. Is there some way that I can use pooled OLS, or what should I do in this case?
