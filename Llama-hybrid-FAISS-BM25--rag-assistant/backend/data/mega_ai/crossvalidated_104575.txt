I am assuming that you realize logistic regression is only suitable for binary outcome. What I think you're asking is if you can flip the identify of a binary IV and a continuous DV, and fit them into the outcome and exposure of a logistic model accordingly. The answer is probably not. Because regression model assumes the independent variables are measured without error. If you swap their identity, you would attribute the residual to the exposure, and worse, you're assuming the current depressive symptom score is measured without error. Try to use model closer to linear regression, and put them IV and DV in their right spots as best as you can.
