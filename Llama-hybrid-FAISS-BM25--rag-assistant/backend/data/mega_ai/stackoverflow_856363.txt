Overriding the OnMouseDown for a DataGridView disables the check boxes even when calling the parent's method

I am working on .NET 2008 winforms, I am trying to drag and drop objects from a DataGridView to some other control. So I had to override the OnMouseDown event handler. Since I have checkboxes there, their state is never changed. Here's my overriden method public class SeriesGrid : DataGridView { protected override void OnMouseDown(MouseEventArgs e) { base.OnMouseDown(e); DataGridViewSelectedRowCollection selectedRows = this.SelectedRows; if (selectedRows.Count == 0) return; List toDrag = new List (); for (int i = 0; i DoDragDrop seems to be causing the problem, because if I remove it the checkboxes work fine, however I don't get anything to drop in the other control Any Help?
