The answer is a domain/process specific problem of approximating the expected values for one of the processes ( process_a ) at the time intervals of measurement of process_b . A few options, in order of increasing sophistication: Take the values of timeseries_a that are closest in time to those observed in timeseries_b . Assumption: the best approximation of process_a at time t is that of the closest measurement in time of process_a . Approximate the values of timeseries_a at the time of measurement of timeseries_b using a weighted average. Assumption: the best approximation of process_a at time t is the weighted average of the measurements of process_a around that time. Model process_a more fully as a regression problem, and make an estimate of the values at the same measurement times as process_b . Assumptions: whatever the assumptions of your models are. Very open to other's answers as well!
