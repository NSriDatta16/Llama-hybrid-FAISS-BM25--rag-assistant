Implementation of Univariate logistic regression

For Univariate Linear Regression I can calculate the parameters (And most everything else) from simple sum of squares. Is there a corresponding method for Logistic Regression? Any pointers to code (in any language) would be helpful. (Yes there are many solvers, but I want to implement as a simple Map-Reduce algorithm, as I have for Univariate Linear Regression)
