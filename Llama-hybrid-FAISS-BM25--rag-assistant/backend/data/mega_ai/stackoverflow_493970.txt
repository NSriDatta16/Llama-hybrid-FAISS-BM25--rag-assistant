I've never before used NoIsolation, but if I am understanding it correctly, it literally runs all of your test code in the MSTest class. That being so, it does and should read the App config for MSTest. If you insist on using noisolation, I'm thinking you would have to merge your App.config into MSTest.exe.config. Of course, that is a hack. It would probably be better to avoid the noisolation altogether. If it is due to an error, fix the error if possible. Work around the error if reorganizing (major refactoring) your app is not possible. I'm not sure there is an elegant alternative. I found " I think we need to find the root cause of this issue in order to avoid the noisolation switch. You might need to modify your applicaton. Is it possible to create a simple solution that repro the same issue? " at this URL .
