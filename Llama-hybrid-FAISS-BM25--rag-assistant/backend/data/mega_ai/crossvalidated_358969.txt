Big categorical data

I am trying to predict the price of used vehicles using three different models: Regression, ANN, and random forest. I am having 6 variables as an input for my model. One of my variables is the manufacturer of the vehicle, and I have 186 different manufacturers. The other 5 variables are numerical. Any idea on how I must approach this problem? I was thinking to do one hot encoding for the categorical variable (manufacture) and then apply PCA. Is that correct? Do I need to standardize my data before doing PCA?
