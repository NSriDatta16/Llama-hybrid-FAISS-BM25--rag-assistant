How many doors does a salesman have to knock before reaching x sales?

Imagine a salesman assigned to a neighborhood, each home has a unique and independent conversion rate associated with it that we might model like N = [.3, .2, .5, .1, .1, .1, .1, .5, .4] There are two versions of this problem : The salesman gets drunk before going selling and knocks on doors randomly, rather than in any particular order. The salesman is very astute and knocks on doors from most likely to least likely How many doors does he need to knock, on average, before he makes 3 sales?
