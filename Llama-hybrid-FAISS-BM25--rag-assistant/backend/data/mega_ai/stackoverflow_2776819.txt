How much memory does a hashtable use?

Would a hashtable/hashmap use a lot of memory if it only consists of object references and int's? As for a school project we had to map a database to objects (that's what being done by orm/hibernate nowadays) but eager to find a good way not to store id's in objects in order to save them again we thought of putting all objects we created in a hashmap/hashtable, so we could easily retrieve it's ID. My question is if it would cost me performance using this, in my opinion more elegant way to solve this problem.
