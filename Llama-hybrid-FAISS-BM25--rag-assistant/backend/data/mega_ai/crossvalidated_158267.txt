what is the relation between "data visualization" and "embedding"?

I am reading several articles about metric learning lately. Sentences like "build better data visualizations via embedding" and "low-dimensional linear embedding of labeled data" pop up very oftenly. The question is, how to understand the meaning of "embedding" here? Is it the same as the "feature extraction"? Like find a good mapping to project the original space to a new space, such that in the new space, the distance measure would be easier to calculate? Many thanks for your time and attention.
