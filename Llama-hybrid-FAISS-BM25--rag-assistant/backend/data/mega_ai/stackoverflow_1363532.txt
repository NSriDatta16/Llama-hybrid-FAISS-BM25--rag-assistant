What is the proper way to reference Embedded Resources in .net xmldoc comments?

I have a C# project that uses xml comments . I make chm files from them with Sandcastle via the Sandcastle Help File Builder . One of the member functions in this project makes use of an embedded resource . I want to reference it in the help file. It seems that sandcastle does not support this, but the xml documentation files it parses does. I say this because of the following example /// /// Displays the resource text. /// /// The file is loaded from the . private static void ShowResource() { // Getting text from embedded resource } If I compile that code and compile a chm from the resulting xml documentation I get the following in the build log: Warn: CachedResolveReferenceLinksComponent: Unknown reference link target '!:Resources.HelpTextFile.txt'. And the remarks section is: The help file is loaded from the [!:Resources.TextFile.txt]. If I do as Agent Smith for ReSharper suggests and change the element to the build log says: Warn: CachedResolveReferenceLinksComponent: Unknown reference link target 'P:ProjectName.Properties.Resources.TextFile'. And the Remarks section of the chm changes to: The help file is loaded from the HelpTextFile(). So my question is a two part one: Is my use of the element for referencing a resource correct? Is there a way to get sandcastle to reference an embedded resource in the chm files it generates?
