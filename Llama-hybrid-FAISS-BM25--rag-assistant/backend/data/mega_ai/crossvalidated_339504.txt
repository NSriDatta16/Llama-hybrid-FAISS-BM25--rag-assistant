Gung's suggestion is correct: if the objective is merely stating and testing a hypothesis, the McNemar's test is correct. Like the intuition from modeling independent data, even in dependent data: when the OR != 1, the RR != 1 and the discordant pair probability != 0.5. A limitation of this type of analysis is that you do not explicitly come up with a confidence interval for the relative risk. I might recommend two approaches to get around this: Use a mixed model Use a mid-p probability model and transform to a relative risk. The median-unbiased mid-p ratio estimators, their CIs, and p-values are invariant to transformations that preserve order (1-1). So like in McNemar's test, we can focus on modeling an event probability among discordant pairs. When the null hypothesis is true, $p=0.5$. But this conditional probability can be transformed to a relative risk by rescaling it according to the number of discordant pairs. Here's a simulation using a simply random intercepts-type data generating process with a mid-p estimator. We see the coverage of 95% CIs for the relative risk is approximately correct. library(epitools) set.seed(123) do.one rr } test Gives approximately the correct 95% coverage > mean(test, na.rm=T) ## NA cases where no events [1] 0.9457 Fagerland, M.W.; Lydersen, S.; Laake, P.
