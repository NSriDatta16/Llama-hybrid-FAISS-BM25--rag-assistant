As for Tensorflow's Keras here is the good answer: TensorFlow or Theano: how do they know the loss function derivative based on the neural network graph? And if we will dig into the source code we will see that it uses math_ops.sign wich is return 0 for 0: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c91e944d626b517781af6a63c0aee302ab2457e3/tensorflow/python/ops/math_grad.py#L577
