In many real-world problems (especially in cases where data are the result of measurements) the amount of data available is relatively small and it is very costful to get more measurements. Luckily, modern data science is based on computers, where we can repeat simulations of our experiment to produce more data. Bootstrapping actually creates bigger samples out of your existing data and can even do this in multiple repetitions to allow significance testing. Bootstrapping respects the distribution that your existing data have, so you don't need to make any assumptions regarding the distribution of your data. This is important because in most statistical approaches there are such assumptions, which sometimes we don't even realise or check before we apply them. (e.g. have a look here or at this post) Bootstrapping is commonly used for the calculation of confidence intervals or for hypothesis testing. If you are using python, you might find the following links useful: - Calculation of confidence intervals with bootstrapping example - 2-paired hypothesis testing with bootstrapping
