If compilation or linking is failing with an out of memory error like that, it is likely one of two issues. First, does your boot drive or the drive that you are building your source on have free space (they may be the same drive)? If not, then that error may arise when the VM subsystem tries to map in a file or, more likely if boot drive is full, the VM subsystem tries to allocate more drive for swap space. Secondly, is your application just absolutely gigantic? I.e. is it the linker that is failing as it tries to assemble something really really large? There is also the possibility that the system has some bad RAM in it. Unlikely, though, given that the symptoms are so consistent. In any case, without more details, it is hard to give a more specific answer.
