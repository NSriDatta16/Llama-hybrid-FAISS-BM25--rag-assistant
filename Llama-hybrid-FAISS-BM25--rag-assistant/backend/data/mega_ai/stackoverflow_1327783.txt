Cache the values during your nightly load if the data doesn't change throughout the day. It will make retrieval much faster. I'm a big fan of summary tables when necessary. In your case, they're necessary! One thing you may want to look into, since you own SQL Server, is Analysis Services. By creating a Multidimensional Database, or a cube, these aggregations all happen automagically, and you can drill down and across your data to find numbers at the speed of thought, instead of trying to write reports that capture all of those numbers. Spend 10 minutes and watch the intro video of it, and I think you'll garner a real appreciation for SSAS's power.
