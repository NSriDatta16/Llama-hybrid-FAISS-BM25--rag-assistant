LSTM or other RNN package for R

I saw some impressive result from LSTM models producing Shakespeare like texts. I was wondering if an LSTM package exists for R. I googled for it but only found packages for Python and Julia. (maybe there are some performance issue which explains why these programs are more preferred over R) Do You know about an LSTM (or at least an RNN) package for R? If exists are there any tutorials for using them?
