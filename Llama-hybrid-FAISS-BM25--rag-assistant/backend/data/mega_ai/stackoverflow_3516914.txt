In UTF-8, Hindi text averages to about two bytes per char. You seem to read 1000 chars, and apply the calculation to the file length in bytes. So, if you happen to know the language beforehand, you could compensate for the char to byte ratio. Otherwise, you could determine the byte count of the first 100 chars to estimate the ratio. I do not know Clojure very well, but maybe you can determine the current position in the file as a byte count with some variant of a seek function after having read 1000 chars?
