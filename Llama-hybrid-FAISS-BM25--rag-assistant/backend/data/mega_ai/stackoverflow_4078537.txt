Local storage is a nice idea, cookies might also be a solution (which even works in older browsers) if the texts are not too long. However, I'd use server-side backups (created automatically via AJAX requests) and only fall back to local backups if there's no connection to the server. You can never know if local backups persist when the browser or even the whole system crashes.
