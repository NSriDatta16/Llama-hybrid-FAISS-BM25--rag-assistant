How can I deal with reinforcement learning problem when terminating some episodes early

Episodes during reinforcement learning have a fixed length. However, because of physics, some episodes are terminated yearly because flying agent hit the ground. In my situation the terminal state is defined as flying agent reaching point A on the ground. However, each episode has time limit (if flying agent didn't reach point A in some specified time then the flight was unsuccessful). Occasionally flying agent hits the ground before reaching point A and this also implies unsuccessful flight. While both situations may be explicitly expressed as negative reward I wonder 1) if it makes sense to keep fixed length episodes and penalize agent for "flying" underground; 2) have time as part of state?
