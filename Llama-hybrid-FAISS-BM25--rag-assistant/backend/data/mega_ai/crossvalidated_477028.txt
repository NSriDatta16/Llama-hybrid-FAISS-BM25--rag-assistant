Closed-form likelihood. Why to use Bayesian parameter estimation instead of maximum likelihood?

Given a model with a closed-form likelihood , what are reasons to use Bayesian parameter estimation instead of maximum likelihood? In other words, what are additional estimation results that you can get with Bayesian parameter estimation but not with maximum likelihood estimation? I am NOT looking for a discussion of the different underlying paradigms but rather something more "tangible". For example, something along the lines of more accurate intervals for predictions or observation-specific parameter estimates for exogenous covariates or handling of missing values or...
