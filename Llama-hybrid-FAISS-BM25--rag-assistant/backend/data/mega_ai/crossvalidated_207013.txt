Suppose each row corresponds to a person, with $X1$ representing the number of posts they've made to stats.stackexchange.com with the "data-transformation" tag, and $X2$ represents the total number of posts that person made. If you were trying to answer the question "which person loves data transformation the most?" you couldn't just use raw counts of $X1$ because some people don't post as often. So as a compromise, $X1/X2$ would represent the proportion of posts a person makes with "data-transformation" tag and conceivably, a higher ratio indicates stronger preference (you'd have to discard people with low number of posts $X2$). So yes, ratios are nice when you want a unitless relationship between two features. This doesn't really have much to do with random forests and the answer of whether a random forest can predict a ratio strongly depends on how you setup the cost and link functions it uses. Given enough trees, it can predict anything so in theory it will predict your ratios after binning $X1,X2$ in enough ways and combinations to give you a prediction of the ratio.
