Quicksort runs in O(n log n) expected/average time, but O(n^2) worst case. This occurs if the pivot chosen is consistently either the minimum or the maximum. Ideally, you want to select the median as your pivot. If finding the median directly is too costly (usually this is the case if you're trying to use quicksort), what's commonly done instead is to either take the median of three potential pivot elements, or else just pick a random element as your pivot. The latter method renders quicksort nondeterministic because of the randomness inherent to the pivot selection process.
