For data science and web development tasks, both combinations are capable of handling most of the tasks with ease. However, the i9 (12900H) and NVIDIA T600 4GB combination would likely be better for data science workloads that require high CPU performance, such as running complex machine learning models, data preprocessing, and intensive calculations. On the other hand, the i7 (12800H) and NVIDIA RTX1000A 4GB combination may be better suited for tasks that require more powerful graphics processing, such as gaming, 3D modelling, and video editing. That being said, choosing between the two options depends on your specific use case and budget. If your primary focus is on data science and web development tasks, then the i9 and NVIDIA T600 4GB combination would be the better choice. However, if you also plan to use the laptop for graphics-intensive tasks, the i7 and NVIDIA RTX1000A 4GB combination may be a better option.
