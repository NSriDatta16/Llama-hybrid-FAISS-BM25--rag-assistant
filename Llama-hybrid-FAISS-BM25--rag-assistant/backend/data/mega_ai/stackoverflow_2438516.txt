jQuery Sortable - Limit number of items in list

I have a schedule table I'm using jQuery Sortable for editing. Each day is a UL, and each event is an LI. My jQuery is: $("#colSun, #colMon, #colTue, #colWed, #colThu").sortable({ connectWith: '.timePieces', items: 'li:not(.lith)' }).disableSelection(); To make all LI's sortable except those with class "lith" (day names). User can drag an event from day to day, or add new events by clicking a button, which appends a new draggable event (LI) to the fist UL (Sunday). I want to make each day accept only up to 10 events. How do I do this?
