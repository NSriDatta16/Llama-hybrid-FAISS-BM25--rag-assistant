My dataset has only positive values. Why do I get some negative PCA scores?

I have performed PCA on gene expression data having 20,000 genes (these are my variables). All values are positive. The PC1 scores for some of the patients (out of 1089) are as follows: -158271.26229 12962.73772 19410.42314 324372.09441 410186.46224 140222.21492 158159.11682 -224566.35112 -158070.07088 -78099.70606 126694.22508 -74185.23425 37071.94993 1479125.93204 812833.70820 -85862.15807 My question is, what do these negative values mean?? Note that some other values are positive.
