why is the account managed by AccountManager is delete automatically?

My little App creates an account in AccountManager. But if i move the App from internal storage to SD card, the account is automatically delete by AccountManagerService if i unmounted the SD card or reboot the machine. does anyone have any idea about this ? does this mean we cannot move the App to SD card or is it because i am missing some config attributes in the config xml ? D/AccountManagerService( 245): deleting account XXX because type com.XXX no longer has a registered authenticator D/ContactsProvider( 945): removing data for removed account Account {name=XXXX, type=com.XXX}
