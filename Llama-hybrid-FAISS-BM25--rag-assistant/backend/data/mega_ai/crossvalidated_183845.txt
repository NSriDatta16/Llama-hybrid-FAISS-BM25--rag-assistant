How are the coefficients computed in multivariable logistic regression in R statistics?

I'm going crazy, because I can't find a simple description how the coefficients are calculated in R statistics in the multivariable logistic regression (and I'm not a mathematician). Are they standardised? So i.e. when I have x ~ y1 + y2 and the coefficient for y1 = 0.2, is this the coefficient in the model when the parameter y2 is 0, the mean of y2 or somehow all the parameters of y2? Sorry, I'm stuck on this simple question ... p.s.: I also have an interaction y1:y2 if this changes anything ...
