Many version control systems allow you to configure them in a way so that they store only the differences between several versions of a file and save space through that. For example if you have a 1Gig file committed, change a part of it and commit it again, only the changed part will be stored in the version control system. There won't be 2Gigs used (initial and new file) but only 1Gig+sizeOfChanges. There's just one downside:if you're storing files which change their whole content from revision to revision this can also be counter-productive as the changes take almost the same space as the original version. Archive files are a example for such files where only a small change in the (real) content can lead to a completely changed content of the archive file. I'd suggest to test several version control systems on your own and with your specific needs and environment and monitor each one at the server-side how the storage requirements for each system changes.
