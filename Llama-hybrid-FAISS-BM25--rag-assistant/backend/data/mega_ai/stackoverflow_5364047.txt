I would recommend not putting it inside the UIScrollView. Just sit it on top of the UIScrollView visually, but make the root UIView as its parent. You can drag it around in the Document Viewer (hit Cmd-0) and drag it so that the activity indicator is listed as the same level as the other children of the root UIView. The things at the top of the list are in the "back" so make sure the activity indicator is listed below (but not inside) the UIScrollView.
