Introduction to Information Retrieval seems to be the recommended text these days for the underlying technology; it was released in 2008 and I haven't read it yet. (The full text is free online.) Managing Gigabytes , as TimB recommended, is my favorite older book; it's much better written than Modern Information Retrieval , though that's also worth a look. There's more you can find with the obvious search .
