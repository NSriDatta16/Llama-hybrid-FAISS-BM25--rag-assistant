You should add a listener on the marker and listen for the drag or dragend event, and ask the event its position when you receive this event. See http://code.google.com/intl/fr/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#Marker for the description of events triggered by the marker. And see http://code.google.com/intl/fr/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MapsEventListener for methods allowing to add event listeners.
