I've done this by using a hidden text field. Not incredibly elegant but it works, basically on whatever event you want to show the keyboard for you call [myHiddenTextField becomeFirstResponder]; then monitor the input using the text field's text property, register for the event to let you know when something has been typed [myHiddenTextField addTarget:self action:@selector(processKeyboardInput:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventEditingChanged];
