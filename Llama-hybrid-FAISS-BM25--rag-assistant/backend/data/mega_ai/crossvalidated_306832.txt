What is the difference between time series analysis and panel data analysis?

Do time series analysis and panel data analysis use the same analytic method? If I know how to conduct time series analysis, what else I should know before I start to conduct panel data analysis? for example, different analytic methods or some important issues I should pay attention to, while conducting panel data analysis?
