Get current, "real" frames-per-second (fps) of a running Flash movie?

What is the best way to get the current, "real" frames-per-second of a running Flash movie using Actionscript 2? By "best", I mean it should be accurate over a period of time (i.e. it does some averaging) and with a minimal built-in performance overhead. Thanks!
