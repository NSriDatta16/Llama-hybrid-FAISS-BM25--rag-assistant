Given that you have a large sample size (df = 1741) it is not surprising that you get highly significant results with a small effect size. The two are answering different questions: The p value answers: "If, in the population from which this sample was drawn, there was really no effect at all, how likely is it that, in sample of this size, a test statistic as large or larger than the one we got would occur?" The effect size is what it says - how big is the effect? In a logistic regression, the most intuitive (at least to me) effect size measures are the odds ratios, rather than the parameter estimates.
