Expected squared error of example of James-Stein estimator

Efron and Hastie give an introductory example to compare the James-Stein estimator vs the standard MLE. This is from their book Computer Age Statistical Inference (downloadable for free) on pages 91 and 92. Here is the statement of the scenario: Suppose we wish to estimate a single parameter $\mu$ from observation $x$ in the Bayesian situation $$\mu \sim N(M, A)$$ and $$x|\mu\sim N(\mu,1).$$ This implies that $\mu$ has the posterior distribution $$\mu|x \sim N(M+B(x-M),B),$$ where $B=A/(A+1)$ . The Bayes estimator of $\mu$ (denoted by $\hat{\mu}^{\mathrm{B}}$ ) is $M + B(x-M)$ . My question is around their stated expected squared error of this estimator. They state that the expected squared error of this estimator is $B$ , i.e. $E\lbrace(\hat{\mu}^{\mathrm{B}}-\mu)^2\rbrace=B$ . I do not understand how they derived that. I am not sure whether my derivation is incorrect because of major or minor logical flaws (or both). I attempted to derive the expected squared error formula as follows. As I understand it, the expectation is wrt $X$ conditional on a fixed $\mu$ . Accordingly, $$E\lbrace(\hat{\mu}^{\mathrm{B}}-\mu)^2\rbrace=\int_{S_X}(\hat{\mu}^{\mathrm{B}}-\mu)^2f_{x|\mu}(x)dx,$$ where $S_X$ is the support of $X$ . Replacing $\hat{\mu}^{\mathrm{B}}$ with its formula, we have $$E\lbrace(\hat{\mu}^{\mathrm{B}}-\mu)^2\rbrace=\int_{S_X}[(M+B(x-M))-\mu]^2f_{x|\mu}(x)dx.$$ Adding in $Bu-Bu$ under the square exponent, we have $$E\lbrace(\hat{\mu}^{\mathrm{B}}-\mu)^2\rbrace=\int_{S_X}[(M-\mu+B\mu-BM)+Bx-B\mu]^2f_{x|\mu}(x)dx.$$ Letting $K=M-\mu+B\mu-BM$ and multiplying out square factor, $$E\lbrace(\hat{\mu}^{\mathrm{B}}-\mu)^2\rbrace=\int_{S_X}[K^2-K(Bx-B\mu)+(Bx-B\mu)^2]f_{x|\mu}(x)dx.$$ We can then split the integral into three separate integrals based on the terms in the square brace above. Clearly $$\int_{S_X}K^2f_{x|\mu}dx=K^2$$ . Furthermore, $$\int_{S_X}K(Bx-B\mu)f_{x|\mu}dx=0,$$ since $E_{x|u}\lbrace X \rbrace=\mu$ . Finally, $$\int_{S_X}(Bx-B\mu)^2f_{x|\mu}(x)dx=B^2,$$ since $Var\lbrace X \rbrace=1$ . Putting the above together, we have $$E\lbrace(\hat{\mu}^{\mathrm{B}}-\mu)^2\rbrace=K^2+B^2.$$ $K^2=(M-\mu+B\mu-BM)^2=[(1-B)(M-\mu)]^2$ represents the offset penalty (that increases the further $\mu$ is from $M$ ) and $B^2$ represents sampling variability in $X$ . If you take the expectation with the above wrt the prior dbn of $u$ (i.e. do not condition on a fixed $\mu$ ), then you obtain $$(1-B)^2A + B^2$$ . Where have I gone wrong?
