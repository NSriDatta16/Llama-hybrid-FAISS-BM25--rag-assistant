Bayesian Statistics Theorem

Suppose a voter poll for a presidential election is taken in three states. In state A, we find that 55% of voters support the Republican candidate. In state B, we finnd that 60% of voters support the Republican candidate. In state C, we find that 45% of voters support the Republican candidate. Of the total population of the three states combined, 50% live in state A, 30% live in state B, and 20% live in state C. Given that a voter supports the Republican candidate, what is the probability that the voter lives in state A?
