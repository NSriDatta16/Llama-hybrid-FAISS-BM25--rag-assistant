The workaround I'm using is to put my runtime initialization code in an InitializeRuntime() method, which I recursively call from the toplevel constructor. This solves the problem, but I always have to remember to add the call to InitializeRuntime() for every single UserControl I add instead of just drag'n'dropping the component using the designer.
