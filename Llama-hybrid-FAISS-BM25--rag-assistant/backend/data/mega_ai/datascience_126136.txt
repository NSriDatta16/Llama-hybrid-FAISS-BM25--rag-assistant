Empty Confusion Matrix and Zero Precision/F-score

Could you please say why I'm getting this warning while doing a binary classification using Artificial Neural Networks? The data are colored images. UndefinedMetricWarning: Precision and F-score are ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no predicted samples. Use the zero_division parameter to control this behavior. And the confusion matrix remains entirely empty for one label. Actions I've taken: I'm using the stratify parameter when splitting the data into training and testing sets to maintain class proportions. I've checked the test data, and both labels have a sufficient number of samples. The data isn't heavily imbalanced either. The ratio between the two classes is 1/3 (class 0) and 2/3 (class 1)."
