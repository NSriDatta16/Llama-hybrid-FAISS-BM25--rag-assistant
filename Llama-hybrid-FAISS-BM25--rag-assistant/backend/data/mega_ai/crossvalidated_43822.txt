You can look at the PLS' coefficients (the β of $\hat Y = β (X - \bar X)$, not the loadings), but take into account the meaning of the center $\bar X$ of the model: the PLS models influence of deviations from this center. If you took the column averages of your data matrix: does this $\bar X$ have any meaning? If not, you may want to build another PLS model where $\bar X$ has an interpretible meaning e.g. the X average pattern for wild type all-zero (i.e. PLS wihtout centering X) You can then check whether this gain in interpretability costs too much performance. An alternative is probing the markers singly. First, predict the outcome for all-zero input. Then have in turn each marker being the only one set 1 and look how much the predicted yield changes. Side note: if your input were continuous, you'd also need to take into account the spread of inputs for each column.
