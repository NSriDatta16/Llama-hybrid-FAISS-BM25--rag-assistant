I use Zend Studio for Eclipse for php, Eclipse for Flex Builder and Aptana for javascript and Air Apps. I have also used the Aptana Eclipse plugin which works well but requires Eclipse Ganymead whereas Flex Builder requires Europa. My situation might be a bit different because I use a Linux desktop, but I wish I could have just the one Eclipse for all my work. ho hum... I have to say Aptana is fantasic - although Zend is better for PHP. I haven't tried the Jaxter stuff yet but I love the way it handles javascript libraries - much better than JSEclipse.
