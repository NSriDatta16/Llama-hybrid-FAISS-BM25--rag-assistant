I don't think the solution you are looking for will involve the Task API. Or at least, not directly. It doesn't support the notion of percentage complete, and the Task/ContinueWith functions need to participate in that logic because it's data that is only available at that level (only the final invocation of ContinueWith is in any position to know the percentage complete, and even then, doing so algorithmically will be a guess at best because it certainly doesn't know if one task is going to take a lot longer than the other. I suggest you create your own API to do this, possibly leveraging the Task API to do the actual work.
