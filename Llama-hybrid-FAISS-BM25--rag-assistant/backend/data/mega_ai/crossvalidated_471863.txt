If you are using R, you can use the predict function ( https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/predict.lm.html ) to compare your model's predicted values to the actual values. Of course, if your model is designed as a forecasting tool, you may not be able to assess the future "goodness of fit" currently, but you should still be able to apply the predict function to data where the values of the response variable are known. Other common measures of fit include RMSE, R-squared, and MAE, all of which can be drawn from the postResample function in caret . Link here: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caret/versions/2.27/topics/postResample . As you mentioned, autocorrelation is another problem to consider in evaluating time series models. You can use the acf function to quantify and visualize autocorrelation ( https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/acf ). Corrections to autocorrelation include robust standard errors, and the inclusion of lag terms.
