Unfortunately, you are not going to run away from this. Your best bet is to write your code in C and P/Invoke it. There is a small catch-22, someone could just decompile your application to CIL and kill any verification/activation code (for example, the call to your C library). Remember that applications that are written in C are also reverse-engineered by the more persistent hackers (just look at how fast games are cracked these days). Nothing will protect your application. In the end it works a lot like your home, protect it well enough so that it is too much effort (spaghetti code would help here) and so that the assailant just moves onto your next door neighbor (competition :) ). Look at Windows Vista, there must be 10 different ways to crack it. There are packages out there that will encrypt your EXE file and decrypt it when the user is allowed to use it, but once again, that is using a generic solution that has no doubt been cracked. Activation and registration mechanisms are aimed at the 'average Joe:' people who don't have enough tech savvy to bypass it (or for that matter know that they can bypass it). Don't bother with crackers, they have far too much time on their hands.
