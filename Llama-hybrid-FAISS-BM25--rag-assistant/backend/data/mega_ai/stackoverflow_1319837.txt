Yes (providing I understand the question). If your just trying to customize the Java Icon in the Dock see ... http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Java/Conceptual/Java14Development/03-JavaDeployment/JavaDeployment.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001885-208447-TPXREF120 Point two under OSX Application Bundles section "If you add an appropriate icon, it shows the application icon in the Dock, clearly identifying your application. (Otherwise, a default Java coffee cup icon appears in the Dock.)" There is an example app (Java) for handling drag and drop events for your dock icon as well located here : http://www.devdaily.com/blog/post/jfc-swing/java-handle-drag-drop-events-mac-osx-dock-application-icon If you want you application to automatically add it's icon during installation to the dock (possibly what you mean) you should know that there is no "official apple" way to do this as it's BAD design on OS X to force your icons into a users dock, and typically frowned upon. All MAC users i know will instantly remove your application as a result of such behavior. That said however, you can review the system administration guides on Apple's site to see how it can be done programatically.
