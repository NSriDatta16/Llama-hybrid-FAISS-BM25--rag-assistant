Why would you want to waste a lot of your time learning shell scripting? Once upon a time I was a master of it and wrote entire systems with sh scripts, but that was before perl and other scripting languages. sh is a horrible language that encourages bad habits, and isn't in demand. Learn only minimal basics -- what you can get from one or two reads of the sh man page. Then learn something useful -- perl and python are good bets for someone with limited time resources.
