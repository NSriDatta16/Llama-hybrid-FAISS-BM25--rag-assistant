The question's abit vague. I shall interpret it as: You are trying to implement the function f(m1, p1, m2, p2) (definition given by that if clause) using neural networks. For (1), you need to consider how you are representing the network, which is affected by what type of network you are using. For (2), to train the network, you'll need to use use true values (i.e. instances of m1, p1, m2, p2, and f(m1, p1, m2, p2) ). For (3), you don't really have 3 types of outputs. Rather, you have 3 possible outputs. Of course, it is possible to train 3 networks to respond when that particular output is the answer, but you can also (with the proper type of network) achieve the same with a network with one output.
