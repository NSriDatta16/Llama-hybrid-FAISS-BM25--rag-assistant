Should I use Mean Square Error or Classification Rate?

I am a self-taught person and I would like your help. I am learning about predictive modeling in general, and I'm also trying to do predictive modeling for a specific problem. I am exploring alternative ensemble learning algorithms (CART, Random Forest). For this problem and model, I am trying to predict three categories with arbitrary labels 0/1/2. I get a good value of accuracy (0.81), but very high error (Mean squared error = 0.37). My question: How do I interpret these diagnostics? Is this a bad model? How should I interpret mean squared error? How should I define the intervals for mean squared error for an acceptable model?
