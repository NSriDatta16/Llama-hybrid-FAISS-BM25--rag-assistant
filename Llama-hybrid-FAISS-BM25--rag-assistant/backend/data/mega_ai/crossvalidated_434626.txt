There is an approximate relationship between logistic regressions and a multinomial logitsitc regression, but not the one you describe, see for example: Several logistic regressions vs multinomial regression I suspect that the main problem you have is the concept that multinomial logits give you predicted probabilities on all outcomes rather than a predicted $y$ as in linear regression. You of course can apply some arbitrary cut-off to say it predicts outcome 3, but that usually works extremely poorly. For example, if one category is large, then you always predict that large category, and the explanatory variables add nothing at all.
