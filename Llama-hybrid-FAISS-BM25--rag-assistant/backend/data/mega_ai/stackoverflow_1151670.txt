Binding enums are really a troublesome operation, even in WPF. But there seems to be an elegant solution to it, which is available at the Caliburn framework. The solution, however, is not available in the framework code, but in it's LOB Samples . Look for the BindableEnum and BindableEnumCollection classes on the Caliburn.Silverlight.ApplicationFramework project. HTH.
