You can convolve your array with any kind of low-pass (i.e. smoothing) filter. If you want your ramps to be straight lines, you can use an average filter; if you want the ramps to be sigmoidal, you can use a Gaussian filter. The size of the filter window determines the width of the ramp. For example, to use a 3x3 average filter (which will give ramps of width 3 pixel), you'd do the following: %# pad the image by twice replicating borders to avoid border effects %# use padarray instead if you have the image processing toolbox tmp = img([1 1 1:end end end],[1 1 1:end end end]); %# apply the convolution. Normalize the filter so that the sum %# of all pixels in the filter is 1, and use the 'valid' option %# to automatically discard the padding. smoothImg = conv2(tmp,ones(3)/9,'valid');
