Using Random Forest classifiers post K-Means for Cluster Feature Importance

I was wondering what the caveats were to the following process for describing clusters produced via K-Means with Random Forests: Create clusters of data via K-Means Train K random forests with a binary output where the label is 1 if that row belongs to the k'th cluster and 0 if it doesn't Extract the top M important features from the K random forests pertaining to each cluster As for now, I am using PCA to extract the principal eigenvector and then sorting the coefficients by absolute value to determine the top M important features. Let me know if you have any insight.
