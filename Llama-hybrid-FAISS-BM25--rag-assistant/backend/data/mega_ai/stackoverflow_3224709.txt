Actually, Carl's answer is not fully correct, and saying "MySql" doesn't help either. You see, database systems like mysql have "storage engines". These usually write to files, but there are some which write to memory (MEMORY), others write memory but keep a file backup (MyISAM) and a few to /dev/null (BLACKHOLE). So it all depends on the storage engine: MyISAM - Default engine as of MySQL 3.23 with great performance MEMORY - Hash based, stored in memory, useful for temporary tables InnoDB - Supports transactions, row-level locking, and foreign keys BerkeleyDB - Supports transactions and page-level locking BLACKHOLE - /dev/null storage engine (anything you write to it disappears) EXAMPLE - Example storage engine ARCHIVE - Archive storage engine CSV - CSV storage engine ndbcluster - Clustered, fault-tolerant, memory-based tables FEDERATED - Federated MySQL storage engine MRG_MYISAM - Collection of identical MyISAM tables ISAM - Obsolete storage engine (list from PhpMyAdmin Egines list)
