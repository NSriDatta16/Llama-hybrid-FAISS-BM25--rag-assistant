Broadly speaking, there's no free lunch in machine learning: In particular, if algorithm A outperforms algorithm B on some cost functions, then loosely speaking there must exist exactly as many other functions where B outperforms A /edit: also, a radial SVM with C = 4 and sigma = 0.206 easily yields an R2 of .99. Extracting the actual equation used to derive this dataset is left as an exercise to the class. Code is in R. setwd("~/wherever") library('caret') Data
