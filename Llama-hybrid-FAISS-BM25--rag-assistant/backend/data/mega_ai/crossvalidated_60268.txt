Support vector machines do their magic through measures of distance. Changing the scaling is equivalent to redefining distance. This is why an SVM model requires the exact same scaling factors for both training and testing data. In the "A practical guide" APPENDIX B, the author states a common mistake in scaling training and testing data"stresses the importance of using the same scaling factors for training and testing sets?" Does every one here agree with this statement. I certainly do.
