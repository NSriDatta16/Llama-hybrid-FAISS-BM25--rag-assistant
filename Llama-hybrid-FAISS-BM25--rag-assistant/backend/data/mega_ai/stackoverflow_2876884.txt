TRUE..However, this would use the instance of Skype running on your server. NOT TRUE..It is certainly impossible to interface with the instance of Skype running on your client's machine using client-side JavaScript ^ The client side javascript CAN make server calls via javascript ajax, hell you can even make server side calls WITHOUT using javascript by embedding the call in an image tag! ie. img src="myskype_server.com/announcestatus.php?session=23eedwrwe23323&status=viewing mortgage documents" announcestatus.php // connect to server actually running skype //do a series of security checks // connect to the actual windows pc running skype (It's host name can be fixed by using a service like www.dyndns.com) // If anybody is particularly interested, I can package up the wobbly code I used to implement this and post it.
