Including day of week in a logit model

Let's say that I am putting together a logistic regression model where I am predicting something (y) based on the day of the week. However, the model needs to account for each single day. Therefore, instead of: y = B0 + B1*(day) Where day is a categorical variable with 7 levels. It would be: y = B0 + B1*(monday) + B2*(tuesday) + B3*(wednesday) + ... + B7*(sunday) I'm basically thinking that each day needs a separate coefficient because each has a different affect on y. However, I think each will need to be a dummy variable so that for monday, 1 is for monday, and 0 for not monday, and so forth. I'm just curious if there is a statistical logic to doing it the second way with separate days? What's the best way to do this?
