iphone ==> UIAlertView change background?

I am trying to change the background of the uialertview. Everything works fine except the background image i am adding to the uialert view won't scale inside the alertview. So basically you see only part of my background image based on the current size. Is there any way to make it so that the image scales inside the alerview until it fits? UIAlertView *theAlert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:title message:msg delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@"OK" otherButtonTitles: nil]; [theAlert show]; UIImage *theImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"bg.jpg"]; theImage = [theImage stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:16 topCapHeight:16]; CGSize theSize = [theAlert frame].size; UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(theSize); [theImage drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, theAlert.frame.size.width, theAlert.frame.size.height)]; theImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext(); UIGraphicsEndImageContext(); theAlert.layer.contents = (id)[theImage CGImage]; [theAlert release];
