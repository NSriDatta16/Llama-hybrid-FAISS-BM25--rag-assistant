The hook_form() is not really a hook but nonetheless it's just generating forms, it's not handling the storage. If you want to manage a custom storage to avoid CCK you will have to declare your tables through the schema API and then handle the actions you want to perform in the hook_nodeapi() or the submit callback automatically invoked. Good luck for your quest.
