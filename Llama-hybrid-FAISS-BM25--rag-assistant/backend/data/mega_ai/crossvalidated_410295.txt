In a comment you say you want to see if "the neighborhoods are different in z scores" but if you want to see if the neighborhoods are different, z scores are not the way to go. In his answer, BruceET made a few good suggestions. I have one more: You can do logistic regression with "neighborhood" as an independent variable and whatever it is you are working with as a dependent variable. This lets you compare all the neighborhoods at the same time.
