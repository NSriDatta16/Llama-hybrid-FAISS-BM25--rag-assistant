cURL Time Out on Server but Not on Localhost

Stuck with this particular issue. I have code that get lots of pages from a forum i.e. www.q8yat.net . Now I have a loop that uses curl to get the pages from the forum. Everything works fine on my localhost. BUt when I upload the files on my server and try to get the pages I get a connection timeout error usually after a fixed amount of pages are loaded but thats not always. The curl options I am using are : $options = array( CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true, // return web page CURLOPT_HEADER => false, // don't return headers CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION => true, // follow redirects CURLOPT_ENCODING => "", // handle all encodings CURLOPT_USERAGENT => "spider", // who am i CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER => true, // set referer on redirect CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT => 1, // timeout on connect CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 1200, // timeout on response CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS => 10, // stop after 10 redirects ); phpinfo of my server: http://topics4today.com/public/02_12_2010/fcrawl/src/phpinfo.php Ok i believe the forum is using an apache module:' mod_bwlimited' to limit the amount of data I can request based on my ip. A possibility.
