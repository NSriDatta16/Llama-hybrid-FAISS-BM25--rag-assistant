The key to this is examining any information you recieve and then display and/or use in code on the server. Get/Post form variables if they contain javascript that you store and later redisplay is a security risk. As are any thing that gets concatenated unexamined into a sql statement you run. One potential gotcha to watch for are attacks that mess with the character encoding. For instance if I submit a form with utf-8 character set but you store and later display in iso-8859-1 latin with no translation then I might be able to sneak something past your validator. The easiest way to handle this is to always display and store in the same character set. utf-8 is usually a good choice. Never depend on the browser to do the right thing for you in this case. Set explicit character sets and examine the character sets you recieve and do a translation to the expected storage set before you validate it.
