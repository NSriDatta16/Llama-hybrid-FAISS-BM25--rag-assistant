can you post some of the html? Or fix the image? It looks like you took care of the left margin for your UL, but there may some extra margin lying around in some of your other block elements since they tend to come with built in margin. i also agree with Robert Harvey. Try to use percentages where reasonable instead of pixels. it'll be more consistent across any changes the user or browser makes to screen size, font size, etc. are block1, 2, and 3 all UL's in the listcol div?
