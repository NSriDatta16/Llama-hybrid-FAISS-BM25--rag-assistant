I suggest using the weakest possible cast always. reinterpret_cast may be used to cast a pointer to a float . The more structure-breaking the cast is, the more attention using it requires. In case of char* , I'd use c-style cast, until we have some reinterpret_pointer_cast , because it's weaker and nothing else is sufficient.
