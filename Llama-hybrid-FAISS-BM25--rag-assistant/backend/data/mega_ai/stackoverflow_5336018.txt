How to make Thumb non-draggable after certain Height and Width in WPF?

I have a resizable button whose control template has Thumbs among other things: ... Now I want these thumbs should become non-draggable after user has reached certain Height and Width. I tried to use MaxHeight and MaxWidth but that didn't help. Anyone out here can help me out. Thanks!
