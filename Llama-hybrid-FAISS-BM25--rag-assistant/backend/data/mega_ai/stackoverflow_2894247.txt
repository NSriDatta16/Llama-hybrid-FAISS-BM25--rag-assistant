Looking for a good Dynamic Imaging Solution

I work for a small E-Commerce shop and we are looking for a process that will handle resizing our product images dynamically. Currently our designers take high resolution photos, either provided by the manufactures or created in house, and alter them to fit various pages on our site. The designers are constantly resizing, cropping, altering compression levels, etc., of each product photo to fit the needs of the business. Being that our product line is updated frequently, this becomes a monotonous task. Abobe Scene7 does exactly what we are looking to do and the images are served up from a CDN. Unfortunately we found it to be too expensive. I'm curious to learn how others handle this process at their organizations. Does anyone know of any good 3rd party tools or other SAAS providers that can handle performing some basic image manipulation and serving them on the fly?
