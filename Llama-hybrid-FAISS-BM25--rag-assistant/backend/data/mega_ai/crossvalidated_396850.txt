Statistically significant difference between real and dummy models

Suppose I'm building a machine learning model, like logistic regression, and I want to compare its performance with a dummy model, like taking the mean of the features in my training set. Suppose also that I train my models multiple times in order to get robust statistics. I can then plot a histogram of the test errors: suppose the two histograms (real and dummy models) are very close to each other (the means are $0.\text{something}$ apart). Is there a way to quantify how different the two models actually are? Is a Student's t-test appropriate? How can I say whether the real model is actually better than the dummy one?
