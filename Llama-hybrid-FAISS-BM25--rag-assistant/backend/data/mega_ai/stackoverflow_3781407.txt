Xcode: iPad iOS 3.2.2 debugging problems

I am trying to provision my app to run on my iPad for testing. I have everything set up properly, but in the organizer, Xcode displays this message: The version of iPhone OS on “iPad” does not match any of the versions of iPhone OS supported for development with this installation of the iPhone SDK. Please restore the device to a version of the OS listed below, or update to the latest version of the iPhone SDK; and then it gives me a list of available iOS versions (3.2.2 is not one of them.) I have restored it back to the factory settings and done everything I could find online and searched around. Does anyone know what could be causing this problem? It won't let me compile it to the device as a result. Thanks!
