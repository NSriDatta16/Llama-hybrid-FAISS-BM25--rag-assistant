Origin of the Boolean Model of Information Retrieval

Simple question, but I can't really find the answer to that: Who "invented" Boolean Retrieval? Of course, I assume that the concept grew over time, but is there a paper or publication that mentions/defines the Boolean Model as a whole for the first time? On Wikipedia , the book by Lancaster and Fayen (1973) is cited, but I couldn't find any definition in there, either.
