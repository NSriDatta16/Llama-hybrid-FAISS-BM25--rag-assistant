Feature selection for circular data in time-series

I'm predicting ozone concentration based on meteorological and seasonal variables. In the feature engineering stage I converted the MONTH, DAY_OF_WEEK, DAY_OF_YEAR to its sin and cosine components because I read in some articles that this is how circular values should be treated. I have 3 questions regarding this: 1) When I try to do feature selection, or feature importance, why is the cosine having more importance than sine for the same variable? Is there a scientific explanation? 2) I'm trying to study which variables have higher importance for predicting ozone, but how can I determine that since the seasonal variables are split into sine and cosine? 3) In the feature selection, can I drop the sine of the same variable and keep the cosine if the cosine has more importance/weight while the sine isn't? For example, here is the feature importance by XGBoost Regressor:
