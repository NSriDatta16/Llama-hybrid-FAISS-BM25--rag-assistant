How to put an object on amazon S3 using the SOAP API on windows phone 7?

I'm having a hard time consuming the S3 API on Windows phone 7, mainly because of the lack of example for actually putting an object on S3 using the SOAP API? Where do you even put the body of the item? As far as I know, there isn't even a field for it in the putObject method... (PutObjectAsync(string Bucket, string Key, MetadataEntry[] Metadata, long ContentLength, Grant[] AccessControlList, Exam_Helper.AWS.StorageClass StorageClass, string AWSAccessKeyId, System.DateTime Timestamp, string Signature, string Credential, object userState)) So, how do you put an object on S3 with windows phone 7.
