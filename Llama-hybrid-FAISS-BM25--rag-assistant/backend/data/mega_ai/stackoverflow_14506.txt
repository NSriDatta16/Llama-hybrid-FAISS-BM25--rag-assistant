Well you could add a: #pragma warning (disable : 4996) before you use fopen, but have you considered using fopen_s as the warning suggests? It returns an error code allowing you to check the result of the function call. The problem with just disabling deprecated function warnings is that Microsoft may remove the function in question in a later version of the CRT, breaking your code (as stated below in the comments, this won't happen in this instance with fopen because it's part of the C & C++ ISO standards).
