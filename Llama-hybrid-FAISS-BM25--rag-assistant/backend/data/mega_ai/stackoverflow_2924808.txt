Silverlight: Binding a custom control to an arbitrary object

I am planning on writing a hierarchical organizational control, similar to an org chart. Several org chart implementations are out there, but not quite fit what I have in mind. Binding fields in a DataTemplate to a custom object does not seem to work. I started with a generic, custom control, i.e. public class NodeBodyBlock : ContentControl { public NodeBodyBlock() { this.DefaultStyleKey = typeof(NodeBodyBlock); } } It has a simple style in generic.xaml : ... clipped for brevity My plan now is to be able to use this common definition as a base definition of sorts, with customized version of it used to display different types of content. A simple example would be to use this on a user control with the following style: and an instance defined as The DummyData is defined as With a simple C# class behind it, where each of the fields is a public property. When running the app, the Dummy Data values simply do not show up in the GUI. A trivial test such as works just fine. Any ideas around where I am missing the plot? Update: Binding to the datacontext in the definition in generic.xaml works fine, but any binding in the ContentPresenter is lost.
