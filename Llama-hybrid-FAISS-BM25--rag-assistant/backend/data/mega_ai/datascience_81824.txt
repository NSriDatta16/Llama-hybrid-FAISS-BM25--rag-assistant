Distinguish randomly generated texts from reasonable for human texts

I have strings short texts of 2 types: '23jd2032n0d2mn', 'fn830n30rn83', 'fhui29n4ok', 'qn4foml', ... and 'sweetie23', 'king3prussia', 'maryjesus', 'lovedog4and_kitties', ... Is there a way to distinguish one type from another? I've tried to vectorize texts with word2vec and classify on these vectors with xgboost, but I didn't succeded to achieve got F1-score.
