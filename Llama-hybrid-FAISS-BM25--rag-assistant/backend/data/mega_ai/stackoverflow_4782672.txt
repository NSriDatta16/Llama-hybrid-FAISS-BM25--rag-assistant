In fact DefaultStyledDocument is a tree of Elements. There are BranchElements and LeafElements. Leaf represents a piece of text with text attributes like font size/style, font color attributes - bold, italic, underline etc. BrachElement contains Leaves or another branch elements. In simplest case the branches are paragraphs. But root Element is also instance of BranchElement. All Elements may have own AttributeSet. To find e.g. color of text LeafElement's set is asked. If color isn't defined the leaf's parent element is asked. You can use this to see how Document is represented (Model) and How the model is represented in views. http://java-sl.com/JEditorPaneStructureTool.html The example shows HTMLDocument's structure but you can use the same code to see structure of StyledEditorKit as well
