The difference between statistics and data mining is largely a historical one, since they came from different traditions: statistics and computer science. Data mining grew in parallel out of work in the area of artificial intelligence and statistics. Section 1.4 from Witten & Frank summarizes my viewpoint so I'm going to quote it at length: What's the difference between machine learning and statistics? Cynics, looking wryly at the explosion of commercial interest (and hype) in this area, equate data mining to statistics plus marketing. In truth, you should not look for a dividing line between machine learning and statistics because there is a continuum--and a multidimensional one at that--of data analysis techniques. Some derive from the skills taught in standard statistics courses, and others are more closely associated with the kind of machine learning that has arisen out of computer science. Historically, the two sides have had rather different traditions. If forced to point to a single difference of emphasis, it might be that statistics has been more concerned with testing hypotheses, whereas machine learning has been more concerned with formulating the process of generalization as a search through possible hypotheses... In the past, very similar methods have developed in parallel in machine learning and statistics... But now the two perspectives have converged. N.B.1 IMO, data mining and machine learning are very closely related terms. In one sense, machine learning techniques are used in data mining. I regularly see these terms as interchangeable, and in so far as they are different, they usually go together. I would suggest looking through "The Two Cultures" paper as well as the other threads from my original question. N.B.2 The term "data mining" can have a negative connotation when used colloquially to mean letting some algorithm loose on the data without any conceptual understanding. The sense is that data mining will lead to spurious results and over-fitting. I typically avoid using the term when talking to non-experts as a result, and instead use machine learning or statistical learning as a synonym.
