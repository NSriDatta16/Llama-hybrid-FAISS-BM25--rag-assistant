Tucows sells Comodo code signing certificates for $75 per year, that's as cheap as it goes from what I can tell ( https://author.tucows.com/ , "Code Signing Certificates" section). That's still too much money for me to spend so I didn't try how it works. Not that I can try, from what I can tell you need to be a registered organization to buy a Comodo certificate. As to Ascertia, getting a certificate is easy enough ( http://www.ascertia.com/onlineCA/Issuer/CerIssue.aspx ) - but such a certificate is as worthless as a self-issued certificate because you would need to import their root certificate before seeing an effect.
