GemStone-Linux-Apache-Seaside-Smalltalk.. how practical is 4GB?

I am really interested in GLASS . The 4GB limit for the free version has me concerned. Especially when I consider the price for the next level ($7000 year). I know this can be subjective and variable, but can someone describe for me in everyday terms what 4 GB of GLASS will get you? Maybe a business example. 4 GB may get me more storage than I realize.. and I don't have to worry about it. In my app, some messages have file attachments up to 5 MB in size. Can I conserve the 4 GB of Gemstone space by saving these attachments directly to files on the operating system, instead of inside Gemstone? I'm thinking yes.
