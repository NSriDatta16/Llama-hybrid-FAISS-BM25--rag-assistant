I think this might help you alot: http://actionscriptexamples.com/2008/11/26/creating-toggle-buttons-in-flash-with-actionscript-30/ It is actionscript only. But it's the same if you drag the Button component to the stage and asign an instance name to it. That way to can access it from the as script.
