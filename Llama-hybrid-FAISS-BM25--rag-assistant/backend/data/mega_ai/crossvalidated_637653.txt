First, this would be multiple logistic regression, not multivariate. The latter term applies when there are multiple outcome or dependent variables. Also, the cells mix counts and statistics. Second, this table is oddly formatted and doesn't seem to contain the information needed to run a logistic regression. If "outcome of interest" is the DV, then it should be the columns and Land should be one of the rows. And "median age" won't work well. If you have the raw data, then you can use any statistical program to run a logistic regression along the lines of outcome ~ land + age + sex (with details depending on the program you use). The output will include ORs for each independent variable.
