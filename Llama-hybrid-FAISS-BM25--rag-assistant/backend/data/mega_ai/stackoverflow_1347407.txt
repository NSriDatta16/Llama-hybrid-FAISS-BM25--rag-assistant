CSS organisation with ids and classes

What do you think is the best way to organise the CSS of a site? I wanted to have ids followed by classes. However they are not exclusive. Example: h4 { padding: 5px 5px 5px 10px; font-size: 110%; font-weight: bold; color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px 0px 5px 0px; background:transparent url(/images/example2.jpg) no-repeat scroll left top; text-transform: uppercase; } #rightcol { padding: 0px; width: 306px; overflow: hidden; float: left; margin: 0; border: 0; } #rightcol .container { margin: 5px 6px 0 0; padding: 5px 5px 0 5px; background: #FFFFFF; } #box_info { border: 1px solid #AAAAAA; background: #4F4F4F; line-height: normal; background: #4F4F4F url("../images/example.gif") repeat-x top left; } #box_info.container { margin: 10px 5px 10px 10px; background: transparent; padding: 0; } If there is a id infobox inside of a id right nav, the infobox's container will have the right nav's instead! This needs to be here as sometimes I need it without borders margins etc. Related Info Info in here So my question is: Is there a way to make them exclusive (or private if that is a better term) or a better way of organising CSS. Cheers in advance. edit: Just to let you know, I like putting containers in for the simple reason of width. I want 100% width but I also want to indent my containers. I find adding padding to the box then adding margin to the containers I get what I desire. If you can tell me how to do this with just one div, then go ahead although I just want a way of organising CSS better, not html (as I believe I am doing it the best it can be, but take a shot at proving me wrong :) ). Thank you :)
