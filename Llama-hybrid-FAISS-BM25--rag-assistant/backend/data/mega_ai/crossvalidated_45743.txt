Satisfaction of detailed balance equation in Metropolis-Hastings algorithms?

To sample a target distribution, it suffices to construct a Markov chain with the target distribution being its limiting distribution. Note that such a MC may not satisfy the detailed balance equation with respect to the limiting distribution. But Metropolis-Hastings algorithms require that. So, I wonder what (good or bad) this extra requirement can bring? For example, Will it reduce the mixing time of the MC, i.e., increase the rate of convergence of the distribution of $X_t$ to the target one? Does it have some computation purpose(s)? If the detailed balance equation is not required to be satisfied, what are some ways to construct a MC (its transitional kernels, more specifically) such that its limiting distribution is the target one? Given any target distribution, does there always exist a MC (its transitional kernels, more specifically) such that it has the limiting distribution, its limiting distribution is the target one, and/or it satisfies the detailed balance equation with respect to its limiting distribution?
