Do not worry about the quadrants indeed, orientation in biplots is mostly arbitrary. Variables can be in different quadrants and still close together, or in the same quadrant but far apart. The distance between the variables is indeed of interest as well, it indicates e.e how different people with brown and black hair are with respect tot eye colour. The distance to the origin relfects how different they are from the (weighted) average eye colour profile. I can really recommend Greenacre's work, take a look at this online available book too.
