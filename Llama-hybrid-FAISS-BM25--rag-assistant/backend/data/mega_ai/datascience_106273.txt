The fact that you are using accuracy as the metric suggests that your model is not performing well. It is an overly optimistic model. The reason being that for multiclass classification you should never use accuracy. It will always give overly optimistic results. Go for categorical_accuracy as the metric and sparse_categorical_crossentropy as the loss. As for increasing the performance of your model: 1.) Increase your number of epochs to atleast 50 or 100 2.) Use a different metric as suggested above 3.) Use adam or a variation of adam as the optimizer 4.) Since you do not mention hyperparameter tuning I am assuming you haven't done any. Try Keras Tuner for hyperparameter tuning. As far as computational time is considered in CNN, 15 mins is not computationally expensive. CNN even when training on GPU takes a lot of time so 15 mins is nothing new.
