csh idioms to check for environment variable existence?

I've got a few csh scripts where I need to check that certain environment variables are set before I start doing stuff, so I do this sort of thing: if ! $?STATE then echo "Need to set STATE" exit 1 endif if ! $?DEST then echo "Need to set DEST" exit 1 endif which is a lot of typing. Is there a more elegant idiom for checking whether or not an environment variable is already set? Notes: This question is quite similar, but specifically asks about solutions in bash. I'm not looking for people to advise me to stay away from csh because it's cursed, scary, or bash is better. I'm specifically interested in a more elegant solution than what I'm using now.
