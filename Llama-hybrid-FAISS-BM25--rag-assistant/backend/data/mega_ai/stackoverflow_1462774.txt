Exclude item from handle on jQuery draggable

I have a draggable with overflow set to auto to show a scrollbar when the content is too wide. I want the entire content of the to be draggable, so I have not added a handle. Now when I try to drag the scrollbar, the entire is dragged instead of scrolling the content. Is there a way of excluding an element from the handle of a draggable in jQuery? I need something like: $("#element").draggable({ handle: "not(#thisTable)" }) Is there a way of doing this with selectors or something like that?
