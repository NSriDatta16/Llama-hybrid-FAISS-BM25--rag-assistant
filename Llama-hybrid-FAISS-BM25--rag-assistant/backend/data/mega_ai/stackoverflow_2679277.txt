Mobile Safari on the iPhone and iPad will hold 5MB before throwing a QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR when using localStorage. If you're using HTML5 SQL, the user will be prompted at 5MB intervals to increase the storage limit. Desktop Safari v4 does not have a limit, afaik, on localStorage. However, Safari v5 limits the site to 5MB before throwing a QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR , exhibiting the same behavior as the mobile version.
