How to draw graphics/text on top of another application

I want to enhance an application, but there is no 3:e party API available. So basically the idea is to draw graphics/text on top of the applications windows. There are problems with z order, clipping, and directing mouse clicks either to my application or the other application. What is an elegant way of doing this? Example image here. It is a trading application where my application wants to add extra information into the trading application's windows. [URL= http://img104.imageshack.us/my.php?image=windowontop.png][/URL]
