If we abstract away all of the details of the algorithms, tree ensembles have simple structure: A function to initialize a tree A function to choose a split A function to determine when to stop building a single tree A function to determine when to stop adding trees to the ensemble ensemble_continue = True for t in range(max_trees): i = 0 ensemble[t] = initialize_new_tree(X,y) tree_continue = True while tree_continue: ensemble[t][i] = get_split(X, y, ...) i += 1 tree_continue = check_tree_termination(ensemble[t]) ensemble_continue = check_ensemble_termination(ensemble) if not ensemble_continue: break So building a tree ensemble just means that you initialize a tree, grow the tree using the split function until the termination criteria are met, and then build the next tree. You stop building trees when you satisfy the termination criterion for the ensemble. Random forest and gradient boosting implement different methods, but have the same basic outline.
