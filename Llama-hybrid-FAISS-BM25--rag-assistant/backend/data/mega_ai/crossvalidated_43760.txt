Sparse estimated data recommender system

Premise: For a product and a user, the system has to recommend him/her other non-users related with him/her that are most likely to be interested in that same product. Available data includes: Non-users: Basic demographics ( e.g. age, gender, location, date of birth). Simple relationship with other users. Users: Non-user data Products the user interacted with in the past ( e.g. datetime, level of interaction). System usage data ( e.g. time since last login, first login datetime). Product: Value. Datetime when the product was made first available. Data properties: Most non-users have very few relationships with other users (not uncommon to have only 1). Most users have few medium interactions and even less strong interactions with products. Demographic information is quite similar among all users (unevenly distributed). Total registered interactions for some products are quite limited in number. Initial approach: Create a matrix of product interactions and users. Normalise the data. Assign to each non-user the average score for each product, calculated from the scores of all users that have relationships with that non-user (using the above matrix). Perform a KNN for the user and the other non-users he/she is related to. Use their "estimated" product interaction scores to obtain most similar non-users. Question: What other approaches could be applied in order to reduce bias and/or increase recommendation quality?
