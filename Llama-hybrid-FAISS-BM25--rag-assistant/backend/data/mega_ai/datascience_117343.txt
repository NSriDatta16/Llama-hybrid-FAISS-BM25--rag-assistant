It looks like the first CNN layer in the paper you mentioned is a 1D convolutional layer, which is different from a 2D convolutional layer (conv2D) that is commonly used for image processing tasks. In a 1D convolutional layer, the kernel is applied along a single dimension (e.g., the time dimension in a time series), whereas in a 2D convolutional layer, the kernel is applied to a 2D region of the input feature map. To implement the first CNN layer described in the paper using PyTorch, you can use the torch.nn.Conv1d module, which is designed for 1D convolutional layers. The Conv1d module takes in three main arguments: the input channel size, the output channel size, and the kernel size. You can set the input channel size to 4 (since the input tensor has 4 channels), the output channel size to 32 (as stated in the paper), and the kernel size to 3. As for the output size of the first CNN layer, it is determined by the kernel size, the stride, and the padding. The output size is calculated as: output_size = (input_size - kernel_size + 2 * padding) / stride + 1 Therefore, you can choose the stride and padding to make the output size of the first CNN layer match the desired size of 2x5. For example, if you set the stride to 2 and the padding to 0, the output size will be (10 - 3) / 2 + 1 = 4, which is not what you want. Instead, you can try setting the stride to 1 and the padding to 1, in which case the output size will be (10 - 3 + 2 * 1) / 1 + 1 = 8. This is larger than the desired output size of 2x5, but you can later use pooling or other techniques to reduce the size of the feature maps. In general, it is usually a good idea to design the architecture of a neural network to match the characteristics of the input data and the desired output, rather than trying to fit the output of one layer into a predetermined input size of the next layer. For example, in this case, you can consider the size of the input tensor, the kernel size, the stride, and the padding to determine the output size of the first CNN layer. However, it is also important to consider the computational complexity and the capacity of the model, as well as the trade-off between the accuracy and the efficiency of the model.
