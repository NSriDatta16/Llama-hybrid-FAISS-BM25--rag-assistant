As for the dragging and dropping, you'll need to use dojo.dnd.Source . In your Js, you'll need: dojo.require("dojo.dnd.Source"); Your HTML will look like this (for the most part): ... 8 more times ... I set up a simple example using google's logo that you can drag from one div to another on jsbin . As for saving to a database, I'm unclear on what you want to save. The src? Something else? That being said, you could use dojo.query to get the images of a certain div to call an xhrGet to your PHP page/service. Basically: dojo.query("img",dojo.byId("div1")).forEach( function() { // this is now the image dojo.xhrGet( { url: '/somepage.php', data: { image_name: this.title } // ???: depends on what you want load: function( data ) { alert("I worked!"); }, error: function( data ) { alert("O NOES!!!"); } } ); });
