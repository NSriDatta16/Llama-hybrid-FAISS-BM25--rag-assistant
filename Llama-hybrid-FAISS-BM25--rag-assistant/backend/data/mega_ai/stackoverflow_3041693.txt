sortable + draggable demo - how to get access to dropped item?

I have a sortable list. When a new item is dropped into the list (from a draggable), I'd like to get access to it to perform some operations on it. This is what I have: $("#mySortableList").sortable({ receive: function(event, ui) { alert("this is the dropped item: " + ui.item.toString()); } }).disableSelection(); so "ui.item" is the element that was dropped, but it's not the duplicated item that will now be part of my list. How do I get access to the new item that was dropped? I am using the exact demo from the jquery-ui site here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#sortable Thanks
