Ordinal regression might be a good choice here. Chapter 13 of Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies explains this approach. It makes no assumptions about the distribution of outcomes, working just with their rankings. There is an assumption about how the linear predictor from the regression is associated with progressively higher outcome values. A typical assumption is an extension of logistic regression to multiple ordered outcomes. Although ordinal logistic regression is often thought to be restricted to a small set of ordered outcomes, as illustrated on this page , it can be used effectively with thousands of outcome levels . It also can deal with the stacking up of values at ends of the scale, as in your data. The orm() function in the R rms package provides an efficient implementation.
