I need to ungzip/regzip a file for edit in my c++ in windows

I'm working on a small application that parses a certain file, un-encrypts, makes changes, re-encrypts, and saves. It works well, but for it to work I need to manually ungzip it, run the application on the output, then gzip what comes from that. I'm just wondering if someone knows of an elegant solution/library I can use to automate both stages within the C++ application that will run on windows. Bonus points if it can detect if the file is gzipped in the first place. Thanks a lot!
