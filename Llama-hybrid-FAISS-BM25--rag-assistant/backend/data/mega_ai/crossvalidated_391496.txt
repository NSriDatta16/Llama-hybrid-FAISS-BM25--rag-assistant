Best I can do is a tad lengthy but perhaps easier to follow (1st try): So for a (static) linear regression, the usual format is y = mx +b, like the equation of a line (b is a constant, m is the slope, x are your predictors, y is your response). The magic of regression is that it amps up this equation to the matrix level (so now we have a line in an n-dimensional space and not the usual 2-dimensional line residing in the x-y plane like above), so now more like Y= MX + b where Y and X (and M) are matrices, and regression determines our M and our b through a bunch of matrix algebra, likelihood estimation or etc. We can do this because we know the data exists in multiple observations like Y(i) = MX(i)+b for all values of i, up to our number of observations. But for time series, sequential data, this i is really a time step t, so now more like Y(t) = MX(t) + b, BUT now we can do a trick. Instead of assuming M is a matrix of static slopes to be determined by the data, what if we assume M is not a set of fixed values across all the observations over time, but instead a changing, dynamic, update-able set of slopes that are related to the prior time step, t-1, for all steps of t? This would stand to reason because in a time series, the last value of y(t-1) is related to the next value of y(t) generally (this is auto-regressive and can be tested for). There is no reason to believe M doesn't change over time too so why not check it out. To do this we insert a few more 'internal parameters' in our regression set up that allow for changing conditions at different (but sequential) t to take advantage of this y(t) to y(t-1) relationship. Dynamic regression allows our M, our slopes (i.e. our regression parameters i.e. the effect sizes of our predictors) to change over time and may give us better abilities and insight as to what is going on (rather than treating every parameter in M as 'static' at all t, but the parameters that evolve and change across the flow of t) -- - - Sometimes it helps, other times other 'non-stationary' analysis helps (like ARIMA and straight auto-regressive AR(1), etc) -- - -
