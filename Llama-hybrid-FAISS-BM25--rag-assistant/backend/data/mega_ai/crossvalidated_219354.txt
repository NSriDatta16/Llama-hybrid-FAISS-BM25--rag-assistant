Repeated measures but not longitudinal: A case of multivariate LMM or repeated measures LMM?

I am trying to get my head around the question of what kind of model is most appropriate for the following data: Every participant rated 14 written statements in terms of various aspects (e.g. credibility, writing style, and logic). All aspects were rated on a Likert scale from 1-7. The statements were presented randomly. The dataset looks as follows in the long form (example with 4 statements instead of 14): I would like to explore what predicts the perceived credibility. Predictors: writing_style, logic Outcome/y: credibility I am thinking of my data as having the individual at L2 and the statements (repeated measures/observations) at L1. First, I was thinking that this is an instance of an LMM with repeated measures (as I repeatedly measure the same thing but it is measured for different items, i.e. statements, rather than for different points in time). However, most examples I encountered in literature or found online are longitudinal studies which does not apply to my data. Question: I began to wonder whether my data needs to be understood as multivariate or whether it can still be analysed as LMM with repeated measures but perhaps something needs to be analysed differently as the sequence is not of interest?
