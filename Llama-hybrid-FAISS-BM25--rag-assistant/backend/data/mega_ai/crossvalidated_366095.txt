For future reference, the book referenced in Richard Hardy comment has the answer. The book says, and I quote: The unit root test described above are valid if the time series $y_t$ is well characterized by an AR(1) with white noise errors. Many financial time series, however, have a more complicated dynamic structure that is captured by a simple AR(1) model. Said and Dickey (1984) augmented the basic autoregressive unit root test to accommodate general ARMA(p, q) models with unknown orders and their test is referred to as augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. The "test described above" is the standard Dickey-Fuller test. Above quote is available on p. 120 of the book (or 140 of the pdf)
