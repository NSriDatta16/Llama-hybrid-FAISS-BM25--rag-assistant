If this is actually XML then I agree with the other answers. But if it isn't valid XML, but just something that looks vaguely like XML then you should not try to parse it with an XML parser. Instead you can use a regular expression: $matches = array(); preg_match_all(": (.*?) :is", $string, $matches); $result = $matches[1]; print_r($result); Output: Array ( [0] => apples are red... [1] => john is a boy.. [2] => this is dummy text...... ) Note that the i means case-insensitive and the s allows new lines to match in the text. All text not inside paragraph tags will be ignored.
