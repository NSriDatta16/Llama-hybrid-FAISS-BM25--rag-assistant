Finding components 'inside' ui:repeat

I'm trying to get the child elements of a UIRepeat , which i expect to contain all the iterated content. However, instead I only see the contents of one iteration. I guess I would have to iterate through the com.sun.faces.facelets.component.UIRepeat object, but how to do that? I see there's a getSize() function, but setIndex() is private , and the DataModel contains the objects, not the elements. Also I can't find the com.sun.faces.facelets.component.UIRepeat class in the reference documentation: http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E17802_01/j2ee/javaee/javaserverfaces/2.0/docs/pdldocs/facelets/ui/repeat.html . The main problem is that I have been displaying elements iteratively with ; I want to change the value of elements from a managed bean. Thanks in advance, Daniel
