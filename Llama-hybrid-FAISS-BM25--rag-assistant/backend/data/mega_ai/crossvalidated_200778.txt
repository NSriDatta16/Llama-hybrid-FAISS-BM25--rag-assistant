RF and (RBF) SVM have different theories behind them, but assuming you have enough data, they perform similarly well. They both can learn complex functions and deal nicely with noisy and uninformative variables and outliers. If you are trying to get best results for something like a kaggle, you would ensemble multiple models including RF and SVM anyway. In non kaggle settings, you might consider how hard is it to implement the model, put it to production, make a prediction, interpret, explain it to a manager etc. SVM (linear or highly regularized RBF) would be definitely preferred if you have small amount of data or you are dealing with a course of dimensionality. There is couple of reasons for it, one is that is better to look for maximum margin hyperplane instead of series of best splits on your features, also there is usually no need for a complex boundary because in high dimensional space there will be some hyperplane that can separate the data anyway. Another issue is that RF is harder to tune (has more parameters to tune), so you need more data. Another think, cross validation can be very cheap and fast for SVM, especially LOOCV. Since only a few samples are support vectors (not always), you don have to retrain your classifier on every fold, but only when the data that are now in the test set were support vectors before. This can also make online learning easier. Also, it might be cheaper to store support vectors than full trees. Is often better to make probabilistic model than classifier. So, make model first and decision later. In that case logistic regression will be preferred. And you can still use kernels and regularization to make it behave like you want. Also, you will not use RF to answer questions like: correcting for age, lifestyle, sex and education, does drinking alcohol increase chance of dyeing of heart attack?
