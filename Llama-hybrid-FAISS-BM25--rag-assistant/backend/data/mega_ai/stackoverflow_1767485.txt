SQL to Linq translation with inner join and 2 left joins (with sub-query)

I have the following query which works fine in SSMS. Im using LinqPad ( C# ) but really puzzling to succeed with the left outer join in LinqToSql: SELECT DISTINCT A.LocID, V1.PrfValue AS pID, V2.PrfValue AS sID, D.DivisionManager, A.IsApproved, A.DateCreated FROM dbo.Locations AS A INNER JOIN dbo.Divisions AS D ON A.DivisionID = D.DivisionID LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.ValuesInLocations AS V1 ON A.LocID = V1.LocID AND V1.PrfID IN (SELECT PrfID FROM dbo.PrfTag WHERE (LevelTypeID = 1)) LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.ValuesInLocations AS V2 ON A.LocID = V2.LocID AND V2.PrfID IN (SELECT PrfID FROM dbo.PrfTag WHERE (LevelTypeID = 2)) As you can see, this isn't the most elegant query to begin work, and I agree that the subquery in both left joins could be improved. However, could you please help me with this translation??
