I'd strongly discourage including those intermediate outcomes, for the sake of interpreting the parameters. Let's translate "predicted difference in the response of two individuals that differ by one unit on the regressor in question and that have the same value on all other regressors" into the terms of the study question: if you include the intermediate outcomes in the model, you're only comparing students who delayed enrollment to others who delayed enrollment, and comparing students who went to similar colleges to each other. If students with lower high school GPA are also more likely to delay college enrollment, and students who go to private colleges have higher GPAs, a model that includes both variables will only be useful for predicting a student finishing college based on their GPA if you also already know what kind of college they went to. Is that the prediction you need?
