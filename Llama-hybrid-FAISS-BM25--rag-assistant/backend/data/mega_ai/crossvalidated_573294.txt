In general, for debugging, you could have a look at the data that is so badly predicted to get more insight. In this case, it looks like this has to do with the fact that angles are not really an interval but rather a circle where you identify $0$ and $2\pi$ ( $0$ and $360$ degrees). If you have small angles near $0$ , maybe, because of noise, they could actually be large angles near $2\pi$ that were just shifted by noise. This will confuse the neural network and it will not give good predictions near $0$ . So maybe it is better to predict a point on the unit circle, i.e. change your response variable, a scalar angle, into a point on the unit circle, a two-dimensional vector.
