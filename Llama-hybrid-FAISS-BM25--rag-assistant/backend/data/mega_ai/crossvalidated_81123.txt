What does it mean to sample a probability vector from a Dirichlet distribution?

I'm essentially learning about Latent Dirichlet Allocation. I'm watching a video here: http://videolectures.net/mlss09uk_blei_tm/ and stuck at minute 45 when he started to explain on sampling from the distribution. Also I tried to consult a machine learning book that doesn't have a detailed introductory on Dirichelt distribution. In the book I'm reading it mentioned an example on sampling "probability vectors" from the Dirichlet distribution, but what does that mean? I understand sampling from a distribution as getting random values for the random variables according to the distribution. So let p_X,Y(x,y) but the pmf of any distribution, sampling from this distribuiton means I get a random (x,y) (i.e. random values for x and y). To get the probablity of the getting the event (X=x AND Y=y) we evalute the pmf of the distribution ... so we get only one number. But what are "probability vectors" here!! I attached a screenshot for the book. I really hope you can help!
