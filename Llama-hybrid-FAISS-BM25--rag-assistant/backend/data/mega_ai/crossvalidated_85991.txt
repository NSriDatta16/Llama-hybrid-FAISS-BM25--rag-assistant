(1) A stationary ARMA process has a "rapidly" decaying acf because the acf shows the extent to which previous observations predict the current observation. An AR(1) model would have one significant lag, and AR(2) would have two significant lags....and so on. Strictly speaking, an ACF cannot tell you whether the time series is non-stationary. You can no more discern whether or not a series is non-stationary by looking at the ACF than you can by just graphing the series. That is to say, it's just sort of obvious. GDP, for example, obviously exhibits a trend...but you should still use tests - ADF, KPSS, etc. - to properly diagnose the non-stationarity. The slow decaying ACF works the same way. It is not a proper diagnosis per-se, but it is a pretty obvious clue. (2) Yes, a stationary ARMA process should have a rapidly decaying ACF. How rapidly depends on the process. Do not assume that just because the ACF doesn't decay after one or two lags that it is non-stationary. You may also have a fractionally integrated series - something you should also test for. (3) The ACF looks very slow because effects of previous innovations on a stationary series die out over time. This is why the AR / MA coefficients of less than one are important. You can think of these coefficients as "discount factors" for the influence that previous innovations are having on the current period. They decay because the the structure of the series is such that last period matters the most, two periods ago matters a little less, three periods ago matters less than two periods but is still significant, until you go far enough back that innovations from several periods ago no longer influence current observations. In a non-stationary series, there is no decay. (4) Slowly decaying is answered above. Seasonality doesn't necessarily imply non-stationarity. It just means that there is some periodicity in the the observations that you must take into account. If you have a monthly consumer spending time series, you might see some seasonality. Every twelve months there is a huge spike in consumer spending around the holidays. That periodicity needs to be taken into account when modeling the time series.
