SSRS 2008, Force HTML3.2

I'm trying to export reports using the URL In 2005, I could use rs:Format=HTML3.2 and life was good Now, with 2008, it appears all I have is HTML4.0 but I need it in HTML3.2 for a variety of reasons, the main one being, it is basic html and works in all our viewing devices. Is there a way to get this renderingExtension enabled in 2008? Or to trick the HTML4.0 renderer into rendering HTML3.2 , perhaps with an old UserAgent or something?
