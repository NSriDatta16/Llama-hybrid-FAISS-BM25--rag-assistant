Gibbs sampling how to sample from the conditional probability? Bayesian model

I want to learn Gibbs sampling for a Bayesian model. How can I sample the variable from the conditional distribution? In this example, arrow means dependent; for example, Grade depends on Difficulty and Intelligence . To use Gibbs sampling to calculate the joint distribution, first I set the Difficulty and Intelligence to (1,1). The next step is to sample Grade from the $\rm{P(Grade|Difficulty=1,Intelligence=1)}$, but how can I sample?
