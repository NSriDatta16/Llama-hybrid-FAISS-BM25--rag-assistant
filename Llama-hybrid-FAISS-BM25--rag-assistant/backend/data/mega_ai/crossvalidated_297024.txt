the ACF for the 1st difference looks rather stationary, but the ADF test shows p value about 0.58 (when lag order manually changed to 6), otherwise, it is around 0.96. Why this happens and how can I overcome it??? By the way, how can I estimate alternative proper number of lags in R (incorporated ADF test suggests me 2 lags). KPSS pvalue - 0.007 and Ljung-Box = 0.01 I have 20 observations in total (19 after differencing). The original time series have a clear upper trend and at the end begin to decline
