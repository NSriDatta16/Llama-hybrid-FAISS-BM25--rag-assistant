The Diebold-Mariano (DM) test is about the expected value of loss from one forecast vs. another forecast, $\mathbb{E}[L(e_1)]$ vs. $\mathbb{E}[L(e_2)]$ . The $H_0$ is $\mathbb{E}[L(e_1)]=\mathbb{E}[L(e_2)]$ or equivalently, $\mathbb{E}[L(e_1)-L(e_2)]=0$ . In words, the expected value of loss differential is zero. The DM test applies on raw losses such as absolute error or squared error. The test statistic is the usual $t$ statistic applied on the loss differential $L(e_{1,t})-L(e_{2,t})$ with $t=1,\dots,n$ : $$ DM=\frac{\bar{x}}{s_x/\sqrt{n}} $$ where $\bar{x}$ is the mean loss differential, $s_x$ is the estimated standard deviation of the loss differential and $n$ is the sample size. The DM test does not apply on averages such as mean absolute error (MAE) or mean squared error (MSE). Thus, it does not apply on MASE, as MASE is just a scaled version of MAE. If you just have two MASE values (one for each forecast), you cannot run the DM test; you do not have the information needed for obtaining the test statistic, e.g. you do not have $s_x$ . However, MAE is the empirical estimate of the expected loss corresponding to absolute errors: $\text{MAE}=\hat{\mathbb{E}}[|e|]$ . So, you can simply run the DM test on absolute errors $L(e_i)=|e_i|$ for $i=1,2$ . Your $H_0$ will be $\mathbb{E}[|e_1|]=\mathbb{E}[|e_2|]$ , i.e. that the expected absolute errors from the two forecasts are equal in population.
