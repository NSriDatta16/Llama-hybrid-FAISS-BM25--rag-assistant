Prevent remote script using PHP CURL from logging into website

What are some methods that could be used to secure a login page from being able to be logged into by a remote PHP script using CURL? Checking referrer and user agent won't work since those can be set with CURL. The ideal solution would be to solve this without using a CAPTCHA, that is the point of this question to try and figure out if this is possible.
