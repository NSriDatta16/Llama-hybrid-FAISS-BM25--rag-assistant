I store everything in a "c:\projects" directory on my windows machine and ~/projects on our unix-oid (linux & solaris) environments. Below that I have a "learning" (for code experiments and snippets /directory) and then one directory for each project. After some time, when a project is defunct, I erase the local storage and the code is archived only in SVN.
