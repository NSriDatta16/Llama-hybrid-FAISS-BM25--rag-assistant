"What are some ways to gracefully handle the complexity mismatch and keep your clients happy?" Accurate and honest estimates of cost and time and sticking to agreed functionality and timing. To address the rest of your question, the best way is to organise your estimates of effort in the same way that they think about the problem. When they see "shiny button = 128 man days" or "10 new screens = 0.5 man days" then they will either ask why, which gives you a chance to explain the difference between their perceived complexity and your reality, or they will not ask, in which case you have disclosed the costs and they can make a judgement about how important the relevant features are against their budget priorities. What I have found is that the relationship with a non-technical client works fine so long as you have their trust and the only way to consistently earn and retain their trust is by delivering on quality on time on budget. HTH and good luck.
