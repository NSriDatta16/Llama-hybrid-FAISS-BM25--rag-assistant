The Eclipse wiki has a tutorial using the Web Tools Platform to do just what you are looking for. It requires WTP and Tomcat, if you don't have those already available to Eclipse. It starts with an unannotated class and finishes with a WSDL and test client. It allows you to view generated SOAP messages. To create, it instructs you to select the file you want to convert into a web service and run File -> New -> Other... -> Web Services -> Web Service . Then you click Next , move the slider to the Start Service position, and client to Test Client . You select Monitor the Web Service and then click Finish . Then you can play with your Test Client and see your generated WSDL. Note that the above paragraph is a summary of the tutorial, which you can find in full at the provided link.
