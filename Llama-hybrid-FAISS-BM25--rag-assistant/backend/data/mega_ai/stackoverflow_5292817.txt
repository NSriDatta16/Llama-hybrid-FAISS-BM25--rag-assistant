You will have to make a new static method where you iterate PcapLinkType.values() and compare: public static PcapLinkType forCode(int code) { for (PcapLinkType typ–µ : PcapLinkType.values()) { if (type.getValue() == code) { return type; } } return null; } That would be fine if it is called rarely. If it is called frequently, then look at the Map optimization suggested by others.
