For the imbalanced data sets classification, downsampling is mostly used in the case when there is huge difference between the size of two groups, while for your case, maybe upsampling (aka duplicate your set1 to alter the balance) is a better strategy. You can also design your own strategy of resampling (bootstrap for example). Besides, studies have shown that Naive Bayesian classifier and decision tree algorithms are insensitive to the class rebalancing, so the performance of your sample merging may also be dependent on your sampling method. You can try several strategies to determine which one works best among them. (You can also get more details on this topic from this pdf on imbalanced learning .)
