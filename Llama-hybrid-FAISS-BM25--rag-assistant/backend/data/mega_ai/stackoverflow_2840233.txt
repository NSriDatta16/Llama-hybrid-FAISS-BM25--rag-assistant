You have to be very careful with any widening conversion and numeric promotion, but the code below converts 4 byte into int : byte b1 = -1; byte b2 = -2; byte b3 = -3; byte b4 = -4; int i = ((0xFF & b1) See also Java code To convert byte to Hexadecimal Pay attention to the need to mask with & 0xFF -- you'll probably end up doing a lot of this if you're working with byte since all arithmetic operations promote to int (or long )
