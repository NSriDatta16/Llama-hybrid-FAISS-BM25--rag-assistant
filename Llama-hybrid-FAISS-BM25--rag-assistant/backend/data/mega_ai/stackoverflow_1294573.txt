IMO it is not a bad idea at all to embed user controls. In fact, that is exactly what they were meant for. Because every control inherits from the same base class you can build a tree structure of controls using the Composite pattern . This will allow you to create just about anything you would like. If you think of a basic web page, this is actually what you are doing anyways: placing one element in another, or embedding them. You can have multiple divs in other divs etc. This is essentially what you are doing when you embed user controls as the user controls render to basic HTML. Hope this helps. EDIT: To address the concerns in your comment... I don't think you will have a problem from the data entry standpoint. The reason why is because you are using different user controls for your enrollment control and search control. I'm assuming you are overriding the OnLoad event in each of those user controls right? What happens on post back is that the Search's OnLoad will be hit if the search control was loaded, while the enrollment's OnLoad will be hit if that was loaded. Because of the polymorphism of the user controls, you can handle the data for those controls separately.
