The more of problem would be from PHP->.NET/C# as PHP offers too much flexibility, that's why everyone seems to be good at programming in PHP, but trust me, the software monsters that I have seen in my life are 80% on PHP. Advice from a 70% PHP - 30% Java developer: keep the standards and everything will be allright. PHP can trick you with it's flexibility: loose typed, built-in template engine, Objects that are basically associative arrays, odd error handling, strings that can be treated easily as class,variable and function names. If I would make a comparison: Java = Military Dictatorship (That is why Java is my favourite programming language) PHP = Hippie Haven (Where I do my best to be a standard technological tyrant), where there are no laws you must rely on "common sense", if you lack "common sense"... well, it results in chaos. To see a small comparison I recommend that you take a look in the sources of eFront elearning platform (it's an open source eLeraning solution with excellent business needs coverage and horrid coding) To see the opposite take a look at Joomla or Magento sources. (they have great business coverage also in their field). If you get on PHP make sure you stay on the bright side.
