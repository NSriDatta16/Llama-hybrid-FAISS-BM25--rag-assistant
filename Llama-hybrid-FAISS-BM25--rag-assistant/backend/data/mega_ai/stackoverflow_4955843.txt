PHP: calculating the average 3

Im working on a star rating (5 stars is best, 1 is bad), and i have 4 records of 4 users voted. user1: 3 user2: 4 user3: 5 user4: 3 How can i calculate out the average of this in php? Is it just simple math, $count = $user1 + $user2 + $user3 + $user4/4 ? I tried: echo round(3+4+5+3/4); and got the number "13" which is not right
