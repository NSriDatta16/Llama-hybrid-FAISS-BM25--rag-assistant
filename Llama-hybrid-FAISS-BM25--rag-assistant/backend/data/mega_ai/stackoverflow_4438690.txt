RaphaelJS - Finding a point in a path while animating

Let's say I have an ellipse e that I wanted to animate along path p. If I began to animate the ellipse, but then decided to stop the animation, is there any way I could restart the animation from it's current point? I haven't been able to find a way to determine the ellipse's current point along a path after stopping the animation. Here is my animation code (all standard): e.attr({ rx: 15, ry: 5 }).animateAlong(p, 15000, true, function () { e.attr({ rx: 10, ry: 10 }); clicked = false; });
