I'd try not to think of it as x causes m causes y; rather, there are relationships (positive or negative) between all 3 variables, and we may hypothetically predict these relationships based on theory and literature. So for your proposed mediation: 1) people with low trait mindfulness experience greater anxiety (X-Y). 2) we may suggest that low TM predicts negative beliefs (X-M); and 3) negative beliefs may predict greater anxiety (M-Y). Is the relationship between TM and anxiety better explained by negative beliefs? While you are correct that the IV has to precede the mediator temporally in the causal sequence (see MacKinnon, Fairchild, & Fritz, 2007). One might argue that depending on what the belief is, it developmentally occurred before mindful awareness and attention. I don't know how trait mindfulness is measured, but it may be hard to explain the variability between trait mindfulness vs. skilled practice? Something to think about. You could think of trait mindfulness as a moderator in the relationship between dysfunctional beliefs and anxiety. Whereas trait mindfulness interacts with beliefs on various levels and perhaps provides a buffering effect for anxiety. Ultimately I think you can make a case for any of these models. It comes down to what variable you believe better explains the existing relationship :) Good luck!
