Disable drag&drop in solution explorer

Is there a way to disable the drag&drop functionality for Solution Explorer? Why would you ask? I'm using an wacom pen tablet for quite some years and I love it. But when you use it in solution explorer in combination with a source control like TFS or AnkhSvn it's a disaster when you accidentally move a file into an different directory. I currently set visual studio to prompt when files are wanted to check out, but when a solution/project file already is checked out then the above problems still exist.
