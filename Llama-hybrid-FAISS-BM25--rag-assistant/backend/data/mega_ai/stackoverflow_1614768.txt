According to MSDN , it will always start by the application directory (unless you modify it with the alternate search order method...) so it seems to be difficult. You can still copy the executable and its other dependencies elsewhere. It is not that elegant though. Or you can launch the executable that you have copied elsewhere along with the new DLL, from the original directory. According to the search order it should work too, though I must admit I have never tried.
