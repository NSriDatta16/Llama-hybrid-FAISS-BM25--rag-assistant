In machine learning, what is the difference between a probabilistic approach and a geometric approach?

For example: The probabilistic approach of logistic regression involves the MLE (maximum likelihood estimation) maximizing the likelihood function, or in other words, finding the best parameters for the best fit line using partial derivatives. These parameters are then used in the logit and sigmoid functions for the final binary classification. The geometric approach involves assigning +1 and -1 to the classes 1 and 0 respectively. A random line is fit to the data. The distance between the points and the line is calculated, and the correct and incorrect misclassifications are identified based on the y*d formula. This process continues till we find a line with the least number of misclassifications. These classification approaches are completely different from each other. So, which one does logistic regression use? And why do we have two different approaches?
