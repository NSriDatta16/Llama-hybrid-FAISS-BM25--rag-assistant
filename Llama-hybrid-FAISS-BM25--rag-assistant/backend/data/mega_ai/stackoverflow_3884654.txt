One solution would be: $this->Post->find('all'); And your relationships are setup as you say above, the comments will already be returned with this information, you just need to run a count on them and handle the processing from there... something like: $posts = $this->Post->find('all'); count($posts[0][Comment]); There will likely be a more elegant way - as I'm new to CakePHP myself, but hopefully this has some value.
