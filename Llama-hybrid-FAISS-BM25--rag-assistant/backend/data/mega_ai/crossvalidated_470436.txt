Variable selection/ Classification time series binary outcome

I have a dataset of subjects with a binary outcome (1=disease, 0=healthy), and a column with the time in which the levels of several biomarkers (continuous values) were measured at each time point for a given subject. The number of time points corresponds to the number of samples. For example, if I have 50 samples there are also 50-time points. There is a problem with p>>n. In fact, the number of predictors (biomarkers) is much higher than the number of samples (n). Finally, the samples of the two classes have a common time series (only one column). For example: My questions are: 1) it is possible to build a classifier to distinguish the two classes and considering that the levels of biomarkers show decreasing or increasing trends with the time? I donâ€™t want to build a model without taking into account the information of the time. Because as said, it is possible that there is a relation between time and level of biomarkers. 2) I would like to identify the most important variable derived from 1) What is in your opinion the best model that can I use to analyze my data? I have found that could be useful approaches based on time series analysis (e.g. Arima) but I have also seen the application of machine learning approaches (e.g. random forest). I am looking mainly for something that I can implement in R. I am sorry If I have used some incorrect terms or I have explained not well some concepts. I really appreciate in advance any kind of support.
