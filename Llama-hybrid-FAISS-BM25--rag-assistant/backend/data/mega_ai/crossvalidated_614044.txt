Confidence Intervals for Population Estimates: Just In Case?

I was thinking about the following question today: Suppose I visit a university and want to determine the average height of a student at this university. Let's say I spend the whole week at the university and measure the height of every student on the entire list of students at the university (i.e. population). By the end of the week, I have measured every student on this list - I then take the average height from all these measurements. In this case, I have was lucky enough to access the population of students instead of a random sample of students. Therefore, in a theoretical sense, there should not be any "risk" or "uncertainty" associated with my average measurement. However, in reality, there is likely always going to be some source of error. For instance, it's possible that I might have made some measurements incorrectly, I didn't notice that some students were wearing shoes thus adding to their height, perhaps in reality the list might only contain 99% of the students and some students were not on this list, etc. Thus, in such instances, even though I believe I am dealing with the population, there still might be errors associated with my data - some of these errors might be related to sampling errors because I might be only dealing with 99% of the population whereas some of the errors might be caused by other reasons (e.g. experiment related, measurement error, etc.). This leads me to my question: In such cases when you think you are dealing with the entire population, does it still make sense to calculate the Confidence Interval for what you believe to be the population estimate ... as doing this might serve to somehow add a useful level of uncertainty to your knowledge? Or would calculating a Confidence Interval in such an example still be meaningless and this sense of uncertainty would be both misleading and meaningless as Confidence Intervals do not "magically safeguard" your estimates from all possible sources of error? Thanks! References : Confidence interval for a proportion when sample = entire population?
