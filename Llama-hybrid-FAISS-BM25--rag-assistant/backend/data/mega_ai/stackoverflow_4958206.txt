Creating articles on Joomla

I don't know if it has been asked before... Anyways, I want to create a site for an online magazine in which editors can write and post articles, e.g. BBC, CNN, The Guardian, etc. Is that possible with Joomla? Or do I need a plugin for that. I really don't want wordpress as it is for blogging. I'm very new with Joomla... Also if there are alternatives to Joomla for writing articles then let me know as well, please. Many Thanks
