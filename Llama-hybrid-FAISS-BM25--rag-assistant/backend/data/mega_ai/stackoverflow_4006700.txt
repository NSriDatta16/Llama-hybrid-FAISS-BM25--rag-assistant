You could switch to a vector that indirectly holds the strings. Then the strings aren't copied on every resize of the storage, only the "handles" are copied. So instead of std::vector &words , something more like std::vector > &words . Then see this Dr. Dobb's article for more about counted_ptr<>. Also, to avoid a potential Heisenbug chase, auto_ptr<> is not what you want to use for this sort of thing in an STL container.
