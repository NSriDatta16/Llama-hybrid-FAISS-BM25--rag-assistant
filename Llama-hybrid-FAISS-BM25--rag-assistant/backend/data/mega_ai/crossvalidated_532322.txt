Paper which used PCA without standardizing the variables

I bet I had seen a paper which used PCA and obtained a "curious" result, only later it was discovered that they didn't standardize the variables before the PCA. It had to do with the weather if I am not mistaken. Do you know that paper, or know some examples of papers in which PCA was misused in this way, without standardizing the variables first?
