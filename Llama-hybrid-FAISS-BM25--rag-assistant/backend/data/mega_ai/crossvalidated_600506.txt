How does he differentiate the function $F(\phi)$ with respect to a whole vector and get a real number insted of another vector? (In other words: How does this differential work?) Often this means a gradient, i.e., $$\frac{\partial F(\phi)}{\partial \phi}\Leftrightarrow \nabla F(\phi)=\left( \frac{\partial F(\phi)}{\partial \phi_1},..., \frac{\partial F(\phi)}{\partial \phi_k}\right)$$ In the current context it is however likely a typo, instead of $\frac{\partial F(\phi)}{\partial \phi_i}$ . Regarding the first question - this could be simply a typo, but it could be also due to the conventions stated prior to this equation (possibly orally) - e.g. the data could be shifted to the origin $$x_t \longrightarrow x_t-x_0, y_t \longrightarrow y_t-y_0,$$ which would avoid the need of dragging everywhere the constant term in regression (i.e., assuming that $\phi_1=1$ and considering only $i=2,...,k$ .)
