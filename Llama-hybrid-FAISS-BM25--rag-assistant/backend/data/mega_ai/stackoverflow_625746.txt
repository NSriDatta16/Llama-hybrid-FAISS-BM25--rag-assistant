Because arrays are pointers, this also works: a = ["hello", "to", "you", "dude"] a.select {|i| i.length ["hello", "to!", "you!", "dude"] In the loop, make sure you use a method that alters the object rather than creating a new object. E.g. upcase! compared to upcase . The exact procedure depends on what exactly you are trying to achieve. It's hard to nail a definite answer with foo-bar examples.
