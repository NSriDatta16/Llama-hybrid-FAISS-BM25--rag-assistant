What makes this equation "exponential of quadratic", and how is this distribution derived from it?

I am studying machine learning and I am confused by one of the derivations in our textbook. I have two questions: what makes equation 3.10 a "exponential of a quadratic function of w"? How is the distribution of p(w) derived here? Here is the relevant excerpt from my textbook: We begin our discussion of the Bayesian treatment of linear regression by introducing a prior probability distribution over the model parameters w. [...] First note that the likelihood function p(t|w) defined by (3.10) is the exponential of a quadratic function of w . The corresponding conjugate prior is therefore given by a Gaussian distribution of the form (equation 3.10):
