Sample time series to equal interval

I have data with timestamp and associated values. time interval between two consecutive data is not constant. How to standardize the the time series and associated value ? eg- Input data is Timestamp value 01-03-2015 00:01:18 450.25 01-03-2015 00:04:19 450 01-03-2015 00:06:42 440.75 I want the output with constant time interval (eg-2 mins), then values should also change. How to achieve this in R or Python ?
