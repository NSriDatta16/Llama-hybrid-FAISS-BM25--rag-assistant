How does one know when burn-in doesn't need to be discarded from an MCMC simulation?

I'm reading a paper about Bayesian model calibration ( https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/docs/McFCalib0307.pdf ). The authors fitted a Bayesian Gaussian process model and sampled from the posterior distribution of the model parameters using a Metropolis algorithm. I'm all good with this, but the following jumped out at me (p. 30) For each case, 25,000 random samples were generated for the calibration inputs,and no burn-in samples were needed. Wow! No burn-in required? How would one know a priori that an MCMC algorithm requires zero burn-in?
