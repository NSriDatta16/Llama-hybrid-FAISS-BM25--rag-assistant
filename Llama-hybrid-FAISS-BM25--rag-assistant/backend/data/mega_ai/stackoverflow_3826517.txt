Assuming the whole thing is a layout view script, here are my opnions: There is no correct answer, it really depends on the scope of the project. I typically use a single view script, but depending on complexity shift some of the complex areas to partial view scripts or even view helpers. Iterating over data makes sense; if content comes from an external source, you do not want to hardcode it. Simple output doesn't matter... consider the input (content). Form elements are typically closely related to business logic... It lets the back-end developer control certain aspects of them that aren't design-related. IMO, this question may be better suited towards the guys that coded what's currently there... ZF is very open ended, and it does not force you to use any specific organization methods. I'd give the view helpers documentation a quick read-over as it may help shed some light upon certain view helpers that are used, as well as others you may want to use. http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html
