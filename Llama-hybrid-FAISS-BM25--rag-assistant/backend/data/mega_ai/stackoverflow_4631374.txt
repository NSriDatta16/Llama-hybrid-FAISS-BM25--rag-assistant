The install instructions for mysql suggest copying /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.1.54/com.mysql.mysqld.plist to ~/Library/LaunchAgents so that Mac OS X will automatically launch mysqld when you login. If you've set up mysqld this way then the launchd process, which controls LaunchAgents in Mac OS X v10.4 and above, will automatically restart the mysqld process as soon as it is being killed by the mysql.server stop command. This might be the reason for the error message, because the server is being automatically restarted. Just tested this on my Mac. Ran the mysql.server stop command ten times and each time 'launchd' restarted the msyqld process after about a second. Six times the command ended with a "SUCCESS!" message. Four times it ended with the "ERROR! Manager of pid-file quit without updating file" message. UPDATE: Just realised I didn't mention how to stop the mysqld server if it is being started by launchd. Here is the command to stop the mysqld daemon. launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mysql.mysqld.plist
