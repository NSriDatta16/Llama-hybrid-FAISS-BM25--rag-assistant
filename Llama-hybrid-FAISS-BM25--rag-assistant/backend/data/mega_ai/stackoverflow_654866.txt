In addition to the previous comments: There is a really neat way to export using TortoiseSVN. If you right click and drag/drop your SVN folder, when you release the mouse button you will be prompted by a menu including these entries SVN Export to here SVN Export all to here The latter also copies files not placed under SVN control. This right click trick can also be used for dragging files and folders around within a repository (simultaneously with editing the working copy), to achieve moves and copies that are otherwise tricky.
