ASP.NET equivalent of this PHP code?

We have a flash developer who uses calls a file called proxy.php with the querystring ?url="http://feedburner/whatever" to access external data from rss feeds from domains that not by default accessible from swf code. for example I could have the following in the browser: http://localhost/proxy.php?url=feedburner.com/a_feed and the browser would display the page as if I'd put the feedburner url directly in the browser address bar. The PHP code in this proxy.php file is below. $header[] = "Content-type: text/xml"; $header[] = "Content-length: ".strlen($post_data); $ch = curl_init( $_GET['url'] ); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 10); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $header); if ( strlen($post_data)>0 ){ curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $post_data); } $response = curl_exec($ch); if (curl_errno($ch)) { print curl_error($ch); } else { curl_close($ch); //$response=split("iso-8859-2",$response); //$response=join("UTF-8",$response); print $response; } It works fine but because of hosting limitations we need to replicate the functionality in asp.net. I don't know PHP and despite efforts to understand the code I am failing miserably. I need to be able the duplicate the functionality I described in the first paragraph with asp.net but despite googling and trying a technique with XmlTextWriter inside a ashx file I have failed. What am I missing here? I'm guessing a response.redirect would not work as it tells the source to go to the external domain itself and we want to avoid that. How would I achieve this PHP code functionality in ASP.NET?
