You've definitely given this some thought but I would like to throw one more consideration into the mix. If you are writing a web application, you should construct it in such a way that you can install it into any sub-directory in the future and it will continue to work with little change. This means that href's, src's, action's and even HTTP Location headers will need to be aware of such a change. That's why I recommend prepending your uri's with or whatever you want to call it. Debate can rage on as to whether SITE_BASE should contain a trailing slash.
