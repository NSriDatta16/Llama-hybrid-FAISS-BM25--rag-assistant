Based on the comments and responses, it is unclear if noise is to be added to the features (some of which are categorical) or to the output preds. In case it is the former, I would strongly advice against pertubating the features directly, instead pertubate/add noise to the intermediate embeddings generated. There are libraries which do so. If it is generating distributions around the preds, you are looking at a PMMI models. Basically the embeddings (from a deep layer) are fed to the probabilistic model which then uses some priors to return the final preds.
