In general, these are not equivalent. Intuitively, if we assume $p_1$, $p_2$ are known, we should have less posterior uncertainty about $p_3$ and $p_4$. Another way to look at it is this: given that we know $p_1$ and $p_2$, we also know $p_3+p_4$. The only free parameter is equivalent to $p_3/p_4$, so $n_1$ and $n_2$ are not useful to us in any way. Here is a little simulation bearing that out. (Note that I used Jeffrey's prior, $\operatorname{Beta}(0.5,0.5)$ and plots are facetted by sample size and method.) The first plot shows that the posterior expectation has a similar sampling distribution and the second shows that the posterior standard deviation is larger using the marginal method as compared with the ignoring method. library(MCMCpack) library(plyr) library(ggplot2) results
