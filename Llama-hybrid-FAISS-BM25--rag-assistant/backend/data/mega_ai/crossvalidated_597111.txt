Optimization of Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson Log-Likelihood function

This question is a continuation of this question: Derivation of Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson Log-Likelihood Functions . In order to derive the maximum lambda value in log-likelihood objective function for both Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson power transformation, the Scikit-Learn PowerTransformer implementation uses Brent method (optimization method without derivatives), which should only apply to unimodal function, that is, unique local maximum is also global maximum. However, can these two objective functions be proved to be unimodal function?
