Encoding is the process of transforming data so that it may be transmitted without danger over a communication channel or stored without danger on a storage medium. For instance, computer hardware does not manipulate text, it merely manipulates bytes, so a text encoding is a description of how text should be transformed into bytes. Similarly, HTTP does not allow all characters to be transmitted safely, so it may be necessary to encode data using base64 (uses only letters, numbers and two safe characters). When encoding or decoding, the emphasis is placed on everyone having the same algorithm, and that algorithm is usually well-documented, widely distributed and fairly easily implemented. Anyone is eventually able to decode encoded data . Encryption, on the other hand, applies a transformation to a piece of data that can only be reversed with specific (and secret) knowledge of how to decrypt it. The emphasis is on making it hard for anyone but the intended recipient to read the original data. An encoding algorithm that is kept secret is a form of encryption, but quite vulnerable (it takes skill and time to devise any kind of encryption, and by definition you can't have someone else create such an encoding algorithm for you - or you would have to kill them). Instead, the most used encryption method uses secret keys : the algorithm is well-known, but the encryption and decryption process requires having the same key for both operations, and the key is then kept secret. Decrypting encrypted data is only possible with the corresponding key .
