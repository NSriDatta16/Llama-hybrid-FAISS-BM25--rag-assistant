Software engineering is ultimately about psychology, how humans manage complexity. So software engineering principles are far more like education and management theories than physical principles. Some software engineering has solid math behind it: O(n log n) sorts are faster than O(n^2) sorts, etc. But mostly software engineering is about how humans think about software. How to organize things so that maintainers don't go crazy, anticipating what is likely to change and what is not, preventing and detecting human errors, etc. It's a branch of psychology or sociology.
