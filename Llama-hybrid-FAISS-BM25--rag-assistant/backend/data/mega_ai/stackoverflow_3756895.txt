How can I make a Magento site wide search?

Okay. This is propably very basic and noobie, but I have about 20+ stores inside one Magento site. I want to make the default search not only search the current store, but all other stores that are in the systems aswell. Kinda like the global search in backend. The frontend search should search those 20+ sites which are under the same site. I have tried many things, but it doesn't seem to work. Please help me â€” if someone knows something, because I really need to make this search work. Big site Store Store 2 Store 10 Store 20 I need to do a search in Big Site and display all the results. Big thanks!
