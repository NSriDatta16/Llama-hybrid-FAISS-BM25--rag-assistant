Heading I couldn't find the solution following the way I describe above, but I made it through writing a Android.mdk file and by using the ndk-build of android NDK. I put the libpcap direcotry into the android-ndk-r5b/samples, I modified a bit the Android.mdk and the structure of the direcotry, so as to look like the other ones inside the samples dir and I used the ndk-build command inside the android-ndk-r5b direcory: ndk-build -C samples/android-ndk-r5b All worked fine! I was able to produce a libpicap.so file, and put it in the phone using the commands: in android (phone): $ su # mount -o,rw remount /dev/block/mtdblock4 /system/lib in my Desktop: $ adb push libpcap.so /system/lib/ I made a simple sniffer, I compiled and linked with the libpcap.so and works perfectly in my HTC Hero! ;)
