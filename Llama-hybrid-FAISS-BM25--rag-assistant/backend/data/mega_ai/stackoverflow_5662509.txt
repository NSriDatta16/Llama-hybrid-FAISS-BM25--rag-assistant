Drag and drop files into WPF

I need to drop an image file into my WPF application. I currently have a event firing when I drop the files in, but I don't know how what to do next. How do I get the Image? Is the sender object the image or the control? private void ImagePanel_Drop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { //what next, dont know how to get the image object, can I get the file path here? }
