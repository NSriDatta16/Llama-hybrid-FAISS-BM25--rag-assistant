I realise this was asked 7 months ago so you will have found a solution by now, but solution I've come across is a combination of Skip32/Skipjack cipher + a base32 encoding. The perl example (since that's where I know of one) shows: use Crypt::Skip32::Base32Crockford; my $key = pack( 'H20', "112233445566778899AA" ); # Always 10 bytes! my $cipher = Crypt::Skip32::Base32Crockford->new($key); my $b32 = $cipher->encrypt_number_b32_crockford(3493209676); # 1PT4W80 my $number = $cipher->decrypt_number_b32_crockford('1PT4W80'); # 3493209676 I don't know of a c# implementation, but a perl one is http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Crypt::Skip32::Base32Crockford and the two constituent parts for a ruby one are https://github.com/levinalex/base32 and https://github.com/patdeegan/integer-obfuscator . Between the two of them you should be able to port it to any language you need.
