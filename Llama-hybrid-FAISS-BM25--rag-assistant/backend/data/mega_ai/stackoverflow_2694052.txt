ADO.NET Data Services for MySQL

Hey! I've searched high and low for this, and no luck. Is there a way that CRUD methods for a MySQL install (Linux box) be exposed via ADO.NET WCF Data Services? I would really love to leverage this in my WPF app :) Thank u! EDIT: :D I am aware that it's called Windows Communication Foundation, but just thought I'd put it out there and hope that it is possible
