Had you initialized final.tip to point to an "empty" tip...? Otherwise you're copying into uninitialized memory. Maybe you mean final.tip = new pTip(iter->second) , i.e., a copy constructor into newly allocated storage? Also be careful about that char name[] construct -- without a length there, an automatically generated copy constructor may be in trouble doing things right, so you may need to explicitly code the copy ctor you need!
