sample size to estimate mean of zero modified log normal variable

I would like to estimate the average value of a variable "A" in a population. I think only 5% of the population has a figure of A > 0, 95% has A = 0. Using a previous non random sample, I believe the distribution of A (when its >0) is lognormal. How do I calculate an appropriate sample size to estimate the average value of A with an acceptable level of error? I could calculate the required sample size to estimate the average value of A when A > 0 then divide by the p(A) but this could lead to a very large sample size. Do I use the variance of a zero modified log normal given by (I think 1 ) Var[log(Y)] = (1 - p) σ^2 + p (1-p) μ^2 and then apply a typical sample size calculation?
