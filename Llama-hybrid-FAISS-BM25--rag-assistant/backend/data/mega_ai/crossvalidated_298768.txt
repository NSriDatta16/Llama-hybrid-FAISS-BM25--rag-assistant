Searching for a mathematical tool to study relationships between time series

I have three kind of time series data. Traffic flow data (jam factor, average speed) Weather data (for example temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, wind direction) Pollution data (PM 2.5, PM 10) Data will certainly contain nonlinear characteristics. I mean, for example, in the case of traffic data, there will be a daily cycle (the biggest traffic during the day is 7.00-18.00). There will also be seasonality of data (traffic in the holiday will be smaller) I would like to extract knowledge from these time series. For example, I would like to know whether increased traffic causes increased pollution. I would like to extract as many of these relations/assosiations as possible. I'm interested in what kind of mathematical tools can be used to extract needed knowledge using accessible data. I don't have a long experience in maths. I made some research and I have found some tools, but I'm not sure they are suitable for my problem. Distributed lags models Granger causality Threshold autoregressive models The main questions are. Are these three tools suitable for my problem, and my data? What other tools can be helpful during solving my problem?
