I was able to get around items 1 & 2 as indicated in the comments of the original question. For item 3 I decided to leverage the fact that MDS caches the user supplied credentials and uses that to re-authenticate the client on future visits to the same site, the cache expiration policy can be set in the BES to force expiration if desired, also if the user's NT password is changed, the cached credentials are invalidated and the user is presented with a challenge response to re-authenticate once again.
