You should apply the same plan that you used to extract times to categorize those times: Start with a rule-based system Then try a machine learning approach In order to build a machine learning, you'll need a collection of text labeled as "start-time", "end-time", or "neither". You can first try traditional algorithms like logistic regression or naive bayes. Given this a relatively nuanced problem since you doing conditional classification, you might have be to build a more complex system that uses contextual information like a conditional random field (CRF).
