Error using a base class field in subclass unique_together meta option

Using the following code: class Organization(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length="100",) alias = models.SlugField() ... class Division(Organization): parent_org = models.ForeignKey(Organization) class Meta: unique_together=['parent_org', 'alias'] ... Trying to syncdb give me this error: Error: One or more models did not validate: organizations.division: "unique_together" refers to alias. This is not in the same model as the unique_together statement. Any help is appreciated, Thanks, Eric
