Building an index as dep. for regression

I have two dependent variables: the health and the environmental impact of individuals’ diets. Both variables are continuous but on different scales/ranges. For both high values/impacts are bad. I want to merge the two towards an index depicting healthy and sustainable eating patterns, and then to run regression on the index variable to explore the aspects that fosters/hinders healthy & sustainable eating.I see a few options for this: sum the z-values of both variables and divide by 2, then run OLS linear regression sum the z-values of both variables and divide by 2, compute the ranks for Healthy&Sust. eating, then run ordered logistic regressions compute ranks for both – sum up in a new variable and compute rank orders again -> perform ordered logistic regression. Maybe somebody has a good argument in favor of one of the propositions, or even any better? Many thanks, Ivo
