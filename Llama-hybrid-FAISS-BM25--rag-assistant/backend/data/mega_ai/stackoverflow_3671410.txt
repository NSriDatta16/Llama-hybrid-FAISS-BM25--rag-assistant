Is there a way to make a GET request without getting the body of the content?

I'm trying to do HEAD requests to follow 302 links, however this link: http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&usg=AFQjCNGrJk-F7Dmshmtze2yhifxRsv8sRg&url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1647243/20100907/story.jhtml is troublesome because a HEAD request returns a 200 OK and a GET request returns the expected 302 Status code. So I'll need to do a GET request but I'd rather not have to pay for the extra bandwidth times that will come from getting the entire HTML document. Anyone know a hack to do a GET without getting the body returned? UPDATE: took David's advice to do a Range header but they seem to still be ignoring it GET /news/url?sa=t&fd=R&usg=AFQjCNGrJk-F7Dmshmtze2yhifxRsv8sRg&url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1647243/20100907/story.jhtml HTTP/1.1 Range: bytes=0-10 x-ms-range: 0-600 Host: news.google.com Connection: Keep-Alive User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1) HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Location: http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1647243/20100907/story.jhtml Content-Length: 258 Date: Wed, 08 Sep 2010 20:28:16 GMT Expires: Wed, 08 Sep 2010 20:28:16 GMT Cache-Control: private, max-age=0 X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block Server: GSE Set-Cookie: PREF=ID=ef5f1bc768645c5e:TM=1283977696:LM=1283977696:S=5n26IrEDpcQTJIb1; expires=Fri, 07-Sep-2012 20:28:16 GMT; path=/; domain=.google.com 302 Moved 302 Moved The document has moved here .
