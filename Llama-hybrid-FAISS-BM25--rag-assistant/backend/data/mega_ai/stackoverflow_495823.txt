How to get started with GRAILS on an existing Java EE app?

I'm new to grails. I'd like to give it a whirl by implementing a new feature or two into an existing Java EE application. The current Java EE app is a fairly standard Spring MVC/Hibernate app running on Tomcat. Looking through the documentation, it looks like I should be able to leverage all of the current business logic that's written in Java. I've only been able to find tutorials on creating new grails applications. Does anyone know of a tutorial for integrating with an existing Java EE app? If not a tutorial, any recommendations or suggestions on where to start? Whether or not those features go live would depend on my experience with Grails and if I think it's worthwhile using it going forward. The goal would to either: Decide Grails isn't for me (and not deploy grails). Decide it is for me, and all future development on this app would be in Grails with a full eventual port over.
