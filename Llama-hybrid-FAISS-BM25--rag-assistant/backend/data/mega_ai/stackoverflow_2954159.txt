the user will be clicking a link from an email and will want to see the hash mark rendered in the email You need to encode the link to what Ben quoted before you stick it in the e-mail. What you currently have is not a URL at all. You can optionally encode a space to + instead of %20 in the context of query parameters but you absolutely cannot include a raw space, because it is a defining characteristic of URLs that they don't have spaces in. If you type a space in a URL in a web browser it will quietly fix up the mistake, but an e-mail client can't pick out a URL from plain text if it's full of spaces. There is sometimes an alternative function which encodes spaces to + instead of %20 . Normally this is best avoided as + isn't valid in all circumstances, but if prefer: index.php?name=Ben&address=101+S+10th+St+Suite+%23301 then you'd use PHP's urlencode function instead of the more standard rawurlencode . Either way, you must encode the hash to %23 , because otherwise a hash in an HTTP URL means the fragment identifier (the part of the page to scroll the browser to). This is not part of the address of the page itself; it is not even passed from the browser to the server, so you certainly cannot retrieve itâ€”from $_GET or any other interface. There are many other characters in a component like an address that must be %-encoded before being inserted into a URL string, or they'll leave you with an invalid or otherwise non-functional URL. If all that %23 business looks funny in a URL... well, you'll have to live with it. That's what URLs have always looked like.
