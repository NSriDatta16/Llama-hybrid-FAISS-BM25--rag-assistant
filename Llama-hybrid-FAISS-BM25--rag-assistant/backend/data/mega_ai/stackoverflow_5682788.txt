Write-once read-often distributed file storage for .NET?

I have a C#/.NET application that needs to store variable-sized binary blobs (10KB - 100MB) in a central repository. MogileFS meets my needs exactly (write-once, highly available, transparent horizontal scalability, optimized for commodity hardware) but the lack of .NET bindings suggests there's some other more .NET-ish way of doing this. Or should I just be writing those bindings?
