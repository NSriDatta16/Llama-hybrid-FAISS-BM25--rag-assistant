Extract Pattern using Short Text Processing

We are facing issue in our project. We have a data set of around 25000 rows, we have a column name title, it contains text data and we have a score column in the data set.We want to use Machine Learning techniques to know what are the factors that make the label High, by factor i mean what are the key words etc.., as use can see we have a short text so what is the most proper technique to extract the maximum knowledge related to the label from this short text,I did some pre processing on the text by cleaning it then extracting ngram features using tf-idf weighting function, then i tried using decision trees algorithm for classification of text For example: Score Label Tactic Title 1. High Opportunity Movement. 2. Low Partner Launch. 3. High Implement Mix panel stories. 4. Low Improve app performance and reduce multiple API Calls. 5. High Review Comments. 6. Low Support SimpleStarta Team Goal.
