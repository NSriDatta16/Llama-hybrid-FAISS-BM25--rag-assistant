Dimensionality Reduction of Curved Structural Data

I have been using PCA dimensionality reduction on datasets that are quite linear and now I am tasked with the same on datasets that are largely curved in space. Imagine a noisy sine wave for simplicity. Is PCA still useful in this scenario? If not, what is a more appropriate dimensionality reduction method?
