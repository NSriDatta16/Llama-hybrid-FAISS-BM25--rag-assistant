Automatic Set Japanese on Textfield focus

I have a web application. It is running on struts framework but i dnt think it's relevant to my question. :) I want that when I click or put my cursor on my textbox I can directly type japanese katakana, hiragana and kanji characters. Windows has this IME which enables you to type these characters by enabling japanese or any language by pressing alt + ~ or depending on your setting. What IO want is I dnt have to do this. IT should be automatic. Is this possible with javascript or any technology? PLease help
