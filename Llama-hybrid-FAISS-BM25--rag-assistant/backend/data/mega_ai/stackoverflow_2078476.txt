How to share Eclipse configuration over different workspaces

I'm using Eclipse (PDT) as primary IDE on different machines. (like at home, laptop, in office, etc.). How could I share the Eclipse and project configuration pragmatically between multiple computers? Should I version control them, or is there any easier way to do this? How do you ensure to use the same good and old even so up to date config all of your computers?
