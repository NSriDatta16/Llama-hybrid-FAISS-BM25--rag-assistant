I've closed debugging screens but I don't know how to re-open them

Once I've, while working with VS, I saw several screens popping up in a disorganized fashion. Since I didn't try know what were them, I just close them all. Now, it looks like I closed what I closed were debugging screens. In fact, when I start an application in debugging mode (f5), I don't see any of them. I'd like to how I can get them back (where to look for). I want especially the screen that allows me to check the value of local variables. Thanks for helping
