Is GridFS fast and reliable enough for production?

I develop a new website and I want to use GridFS as storage for all user uploads, because it offers a lot of advantages compared to a normal filesystem storage. Benchmarks with GridFS served by nginx indicate, that it's not as fast as a normal filesystem served by nginx. Benchmark with nginx Is anyone out there, who uses GridFS already in a production environment, or would use it for a new project?
