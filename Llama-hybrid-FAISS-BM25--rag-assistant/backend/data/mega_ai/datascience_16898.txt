Basically this is a classification problem. You would want to model y(rank) ~ x(Document). And when you get a new document you need an estimated rank. Things you may want to consider. Do in need 2000 class labels, or is there any way to reduce the class labels to 3 classes etc. (class labels == score) How do I represent my documents. In short they must be numerically represented. (Approaches - One Hot Encoding, TFIDF, Embedding etc) Finally the last question which classification model should I use?. Linear Algebra followed by Andrew Ngs ML course is a good starting point.
