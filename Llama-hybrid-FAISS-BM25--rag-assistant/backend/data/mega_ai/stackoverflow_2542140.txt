Hashmaps have average case better performance for access (O(1)), but worse worst case performance (O(n)). Maps are always O(lg(n)). Maps are ordered by their key, hashmaps are not. Hashmaps generally use more memory than maps. Maps typically allow for faster iteration. Good hash functions are harder to write than good ordering functions (and more difficult to analyse). I don't believe there's anything that a hashmap can do that a map can't.
