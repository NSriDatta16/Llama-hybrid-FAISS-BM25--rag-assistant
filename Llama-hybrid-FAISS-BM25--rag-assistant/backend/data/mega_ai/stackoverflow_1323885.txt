Cannot read True Type Font FIle in my WPF APplication!

i'm developing a project in Wpf with Vista Sp1 on my laptop ,in this project i add some True Type Font that Windows Xp did not get and when i debug my project on Windows XP i cannot see the True Font File,so i wish add in my project those fonts as resources but i cannot work out this step. I followed all advices of MSDN but not luck...for example i added a Font File "INFROMAN.TTF" (this Font is a original Font File of Vista and stays in this directory C:Windows/Font) and in the textBlock i declare this line: Test.... but i cannot see the right font. Do you have any advice how i can add those True FOnt FIle as Resource in my project so when i run my project on the WIndows XP i can see the right fonts??? Thanks for your attention. Cheers
