a) Here https://rpubs.com/kaz_yos/pscl-2 is a nice example of how to interpret the results of a ZINB model. b) Obviusly you have to present both blocks. Note: ZINB regression model two separate processes so they produce two sets of coefficients: one for the count part of the model and the other for the logistic part of the model. A common way of interpreting logistic regression models is to exponentiate the coefficients, which places the coefficients in an odds-ratio scale. With zero-inflated models the logistic part of the model predicts non-occurrence of the outcome. Here you can fins another example https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/dae/ .
