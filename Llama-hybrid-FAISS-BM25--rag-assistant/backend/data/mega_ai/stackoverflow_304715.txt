I researched a bit about this and the bad news is that from WCF point of view the request and response MUST use the same enconding. So yeah, the answer above is quite correct. You have to organize with service provider to enable MTOM on both request and response. The MTOM request will not have any impact on his application, apart from changing the SOAP mime-type, as far as I know.
