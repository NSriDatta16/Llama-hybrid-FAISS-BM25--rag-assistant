How to control order of doxygen documentation sections?

I added my documentation as follows: brief description, parameters, and return value get explained in the header, details about the implementation get explained in the source. However, when I generate the doxygen documentation, instead of having the brief description, the details, then the parameters and lastly the return value, I get these sections in another order: brief, params, return, and details. I guess this has to do with the order in which doxygen finds the doc comments in the source code. Is there any way I can set the order of the sections to whatever I like, regardless of how the documentation is organized?
