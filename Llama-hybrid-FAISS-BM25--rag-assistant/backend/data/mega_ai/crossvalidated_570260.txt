In a CNN layer, the number of parameters is determined by the kernel size and the number of kernels. The size of the input and output in the dimensions being convolved do not affect the number of parameters. So, in a standard 2-D CNN layer with 3-D input/output, only the 3rd dimension (often referred to as the channels) of the input/output matters. The number of input channels determines the 3rd dimension size of your kernels and the number of output channels is the number of kernels. The number of parameters in each kernel is simply the specified kernel size times the number of input channels (then $+1$ for the bias if using it), then multiply this by the number of kernels to get the total number of parameters. In this case, your convolutional kernels are $3\times3\times128$ and you have $256$ of them, so: Without bias: $$\begin{aligned}\#params&=kernel\_size\times|input\_channels|\times|output\_channels| \\&=3\times3\times128\times256 \\&=294912\end{aligned}$$ With bias: $$\begin{aligned}\#params&=(kernel\_size\times|input\_channels|+1)\times|output\_channels|\\&=(3\times3\times128+1)\times256\\&=295168\end{aligned}$$
