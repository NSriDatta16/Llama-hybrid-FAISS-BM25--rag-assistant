No cubic, quartic , quadratic et al terms should ever be used as they fail to deliver reasonable forecasts .... see some salient quotes from opionated SE members. How to extrapolate this simple trend line into the future for the purpose of forecasting in Matlab? and here Why is my high degree polynomial regression model suddenly unfit for the data? Deterministic time trend series that are useful are described here Auto-regression versus linear regression of x(t)-with-t for modelling time series and here Time series trend Differencing a series is often incorrect as de-meaning might be more appropriate in order to achieve stationarity of the model's error process. Often times time trend variables are more appropriate than differencing models with one or more drift parameters.
