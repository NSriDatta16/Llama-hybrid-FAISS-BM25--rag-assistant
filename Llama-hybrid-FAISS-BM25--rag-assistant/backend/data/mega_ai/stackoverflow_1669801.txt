I ended up solving my problem using a subcube. by creating the subcube, I was able to filter for the distance - and then after that just did a select for the dimension that I was looking for. Here's what I ended up with... create subcube MyCube as select Filter ( ( [DimLocation].[Latitude].[Latitude], [DimLocation].[Longitude].[Longitude] ), ( ZipCalculatorLib.GetDistance( 43.474208, [DimLocation].[Latitude].CurrentMember.MemberValue, 96.687689, DimLocation.Longitude.CurrentMember.MemberValue)
