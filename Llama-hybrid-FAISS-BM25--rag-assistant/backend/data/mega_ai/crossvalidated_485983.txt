Another solution is to use robust classification. For instance, you can look at RANSAC techniques (which is kind of a downsampling technique) or techniques from scikit-learn-extra. For instance this example (which implement something similar to logistic regression), this type of technique will not eliminate the outliers, it will take them into account but in a very downweighted way so as not to perturb the prediction too much.
