Fancybox for .flv

Is there a way to manipulate jquery Fancybox plugin to display flash video files (.flv)? I mean making it behave like Malsup's Media plugin that can handle both .swf and .flv Putting my question in context: I have a php file that works dynamically to read the videos: if($ext=="flv"){ $fileSize = filesize($file); header("Expires: Mon, 20 Dec 1980 00:00:00 GMT"); header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT"); header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate"); header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false); header("Pragma: no-cache"); # content headers header("Content-Type: application/x-shockwave-flash"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"" . $path . "\""); header("Content-Length: " . $fileSize); } readfile("$file"); then my markup is as follows "> where $row['video'] is the name returned from an database query. Now what I want is that when a client clicks on the thumbnail a fancybox with my video would display. It works well with .swf and other extensions explicitly noted in the fancybox documentation but not with .flv. Help will be greatly appreciated
