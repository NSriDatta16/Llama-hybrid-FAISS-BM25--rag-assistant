What you need to do is make your window that it cannot be activated. This is quite easily done by overriding CreataParams . Then you can use SendKey.Send to send key presses to the currently active window, your window will never become active. Here is a simple example public partial class Form1 : Form { const int WS_EX_NOACTIVATE = 0x08000000; public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); } protected override CreateParams CreateParams { get { CreateParams param = base.CreateParams; param.ExStyle |= WS_EX_NOACTIVATE; return param; } } private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { SendKeys.Send("A"); } } One strange thing you will notice is that since your window never becomes active it does react rather strang when you drag the window. Basically the dragging works, it just does not give the visual feedback during the drag. You can address this by overriding WndProc and handling the WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN and WM_MOUSEMOVE messages.
