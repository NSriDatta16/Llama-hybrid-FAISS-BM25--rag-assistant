Use the contents() function. For example, if you have an XML fragment like: var root = $(' text1 text2 more text here '); Then you can get at the text via: var txt = root.contents()[2] That is assuming that the text node is always the 3rd child of . Otherwise, if you do not know the position, or may have a node that contains multiple text nodes, you should collect all of the text nodes by filtering: var textList = root.contents().filter(function() { return this.nodeType == 3; }); This returns an array of text nodes that are found in the XML fragment. To get at the strings in the list, just access the array slice: var txt = textList[0];
