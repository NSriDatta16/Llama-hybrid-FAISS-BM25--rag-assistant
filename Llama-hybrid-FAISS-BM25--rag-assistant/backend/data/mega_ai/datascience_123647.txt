Is SVM is a good choice for large dataset?

With my limited knowledge of SVM, I am following a tutorial on YouTube to create an End-to-End multi-class ML model . There the person is using SVM on a dataset with 9 images dataset, but the dataset I am working on is of around 12,000 images. I am doing all my work on Google Colab, When I tried to fit my model, it has been processing since then(1h 30 min). That's why I am wondering if SVM will be good for my case or maybe some else model I should try. Is there a chance this is happening due to the fact that I am using free version for google colab.
