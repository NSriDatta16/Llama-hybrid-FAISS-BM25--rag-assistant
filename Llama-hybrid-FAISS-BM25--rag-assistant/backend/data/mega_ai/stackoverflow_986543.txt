Replicating String.split with StringTokenizer

Encouraged by this , and the fact I have billions of string to parse, I tried to modify my code to accept StringTokenizer instead of String[] The only thing left between me and getting that delicious x2 performance boost is the fact that when you're doing "dog,,cat".split(",") //output: ["dog","","cat"] StringTokenizer("dog,,cat") // nextToken() = "dog" // nextToken() = "cat" How can I achieve similar results with the StringTokenizer? Are there faster ways to do this?
