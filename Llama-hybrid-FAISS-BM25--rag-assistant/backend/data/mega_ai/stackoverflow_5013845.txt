Tweak Informix query

I have a bunch of Informix queries and I need to verify the performance of each query. All these queries are long and contain a lot inner SELECT and JOINs. So I am wondering if there is any tool which can assist me to check which fragment in the query affects the whole query performance? It would help a lot because it's hard to check only by eyes.
