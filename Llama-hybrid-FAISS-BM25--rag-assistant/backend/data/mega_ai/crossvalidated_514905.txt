Logistic regression with two variables, one is derived from other, is not coming out statistically significant

I have two variables in a dataset. First variable has a continuous value ( AHI ) and other one is a binomial variable ( OSA_status ) which I have created based on the value of my first variable ( AHI ). i.e. if AHI> 5 then OSA_status = 1 else OSA_status = 0 . I am trying out a logistic regression with dependent variable, OSA_status (0/1) and independent variable, AHI . I was expecting AHI will be significantly associated with OSA_status as it is derived from the independent variable itself (AHI) . But my result is as follows. Can someone please explain me why i got this result. Call: glm(formula = OSA_status ~ AHI, family = "binomial", data = pre_surgery) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -5.277e-04 -2.000e-08 -2.000e-08 2.000e-08 5.818e-04 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
