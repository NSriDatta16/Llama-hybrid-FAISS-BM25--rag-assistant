SAS has extensive documentation on all their procedures. Please see here for the syntax for PROC ARIMA . As you noted p is for autoregressive and q is for moving average in an arima model. In proc arima if p or q is separated by a bracket then it means that there is a seasonal autoregressive model.For your example, what p = (2)(12) means is that current day of SUM_of_Total_Revenue2 is related to 2 days (nonseasonal ar) before and also related to 12 days (seasonal ar) before the current day. Mathematically using back-shift notation this could be represented as follows. I'm following the notation used in Makridakis et al : $(1-\phi_1B^2)(1-\Phi_1B^{12}) Y_t = (1-\theta_1B-\theta_1B^3)e_t$ Left hand is non seasonal and seasonal ar(p) and right hand side is the nonseasonal ma(q) . Hope this helps.
