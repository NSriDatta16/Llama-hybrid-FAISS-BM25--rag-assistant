What is the mean and variance of an MA(4) process with time drift?

For a project I need to simulate a relatively smooth time series with an upward drift. This is what I came up with: $$y_t = \mu + \alpha t+ \sum_{j=0}^{q=4} \theta_{j} e_{t-j}$$ where $\theta_j = 0.2^{j}$ , $\mu = 1$ , $\alpha=0.01$ and I seeded the errors to be $e_t \sim N(0, 1)$ How would one estimate the mean and variance for this? I believe it is weakly stationary but not sure how to estimate it at a particular time point. Here is a graph of one realization with T=100:
