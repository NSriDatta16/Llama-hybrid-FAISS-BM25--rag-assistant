I believe that the current reward given the current state is independent of the next state (i.e. uncorrelated). This seems to be at the core of your intuition about the next state not providing any additional information about the current reward (so it seems like they should be uncorrelated). However, the unconditional current reward obviously is not independent of the next state, because both depend on the current state. Thus, if you look at a time-series of (state[t], reward[t+1]) it is certainly possible to observe a correlation, and the conditions required to ensure that there is no correlation would presumably be some pretty convoluted conditions on the Markov transitions. To re-phrase one more way, the next state doesn't provide us with additional information about the current reward only because we already know the current state. If we didn't know the current state, then knowing the next state would give us information about the current state, which we could leverage to learn something about the current reward.
