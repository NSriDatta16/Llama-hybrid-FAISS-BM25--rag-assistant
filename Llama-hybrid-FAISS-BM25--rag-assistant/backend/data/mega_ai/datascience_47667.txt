Are there any public datasets about mental health of patients containing physiological and psychological symptoms?

I would like to segment mental illnesses with clustering using machine learning. To do so I need training dataset which contains physiological and psychological symptoms of an subject. The closest public datasets which I found are on this page https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/ . However the tests were designed to fit current classification of mental illnesses like anxiety and depression, so it is not very useful for making new classification. I am searching for dataset where would bee patients symptoms prior to diagnosis and then the final diagnosis. What I would like to find out by this data analysis is wherever the clusters match current diagnoses like anxiety or more interestingly what are the alternative classifications of psychosomatic illnesses. Note I am not an researcher, I just want to learn data clustering on an interesting problem.
