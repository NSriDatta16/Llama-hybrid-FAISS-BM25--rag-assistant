There are tree possible approach to organize unit tests: TestMethod in test class per testing class. The most popular one. TestMethod in test class per test fixture. Allow to minimize text fixture/tear down code. TestMethod in test class per system under test(subsystem, module, couple of classes). Usually there are needs to keep several automated test assemblies: Unit test Assembly - with pure unit test, that is testing each unit using mocks, test dumps. Integration/Consumer test assembly - intended to check integration of system units, checks that consumer critical functionality work properly.
