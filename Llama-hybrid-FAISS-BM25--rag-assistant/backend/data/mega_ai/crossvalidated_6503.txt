My suggested reading for an intro to ARIMA modelling would be Applied Time Series Analysis for the Social Sciences 1980 by R McCleary ; R A Hay ; E E Meidinger ; D McDowall This is aimed at social scientists so the mathematical demands are not too rigorous. Also for shorter treatments I would suggest two Sage Green Books (although they are entirely redundant with the McCleary book), Interrupted Time Series Analysis by David McDowall, Richard McCleary, Errol Meidinger, and Richard A. Hay, Jr Time Series Analysis by Charles W. Ostrom The Ostrom text is only ARMA modelling and does not discuss forecasting. I don't think they would meet your requirement for graphing forecast error either. I'm sure you could dig up more useful resources by examining questions tagged with time-series on this forum as well.
