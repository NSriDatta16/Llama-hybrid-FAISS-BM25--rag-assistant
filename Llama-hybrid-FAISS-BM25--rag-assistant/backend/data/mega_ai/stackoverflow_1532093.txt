Is there an AJAX service for doubleclick (DART)

I'm trying to put some ads on my site and would like to load them after the page has loaded. We're using Doubleclick DART (please, don't tell me to use Google AdSense. I know, but that's a battle for another day). Doubleclick currently recommends embedding inline script tags like so: This returns a document.write with the ad html. Does anyone know of a way to request the ads with an AJAX call so that only HTML is returned, thus allowing me to place the ads at my discretion? I've seen this done for mobile ads, but haven't found anything for websites yet.
