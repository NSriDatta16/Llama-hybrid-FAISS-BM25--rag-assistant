You are better off using a NSColor object if you can. However, to your original question one of my first questions is where do you want to create this array. When you say put it in a header do you mean as a member of a class or as a global array, you certainly can do both however there are some serious gotchas with putting globals in headers. If you need that follow up and I can explain it better. If it is in a class then you can just declare it like any other member field. If you say CGFloat color[4]; then the space for the array is allocated in your object itself. You can also just use a CGFloat *color; or its moral equivalent to refer to an array that is stored outside of the object. You do need to manage that storage appropriately however. This matters in the case you hinted at where you use a constant array object and cannot later change it. That can happen but is rare, since it cannot happen with the first approach, you don't see it in the wild very often. There is a whole dissertation on the corner cases in here, I am sure it is not helping to go into it. Just use CGFloat color[4] in your object and it won't matter, by the time you see things they will be mutable and you can just use them the way you expect.
