What you did is not going to work. A database context is a connection to a single database. You should not attempt to add tables from other databases to a particular context. In fact, this probably simply won't work. If you find yourself dealing with multiple databases, you are going to need to have multiple database context objects, one for each database. BTW, I think you'll find you will get more answers to your questions, if you accept more of the responses to your questions as answers. Your acceptance rate is only about 25%. This might discourage people from responding to you.
