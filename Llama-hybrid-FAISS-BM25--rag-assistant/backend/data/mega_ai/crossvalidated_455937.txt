After training an XGBoost classifier on a set of features, (how) can I use it to make new predictions based on one of those features?

Forgive me if this is a somewhat na√Øve question. I have trained an XGBoost classifier that uses COVID-19 patients' age, sex, location, etc. to predict their mortality risk (here is the dataset ). The model did a pretty decent job. Now if we only know a new patient's age, can we use the trained model to predict their risk? If so, how can I implement it using scikit-learn? Thanks for your suggestions in advance! Let me know if I should be more specific! Thanks!
