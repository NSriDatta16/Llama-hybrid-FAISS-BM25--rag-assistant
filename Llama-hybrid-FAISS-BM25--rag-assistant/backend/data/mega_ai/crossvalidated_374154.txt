What is the optimal sampling rate / window size for Word2Vec Continuous Bag of Words?

What is the greatest number of embeddings you can average for the Word2Vec Cbow algorithm before measures of quality start dropping? For skip-gram I've seen window sizes up to 20 work, but I imagine this range may be lower for Cbow since the embeddings are averaged, which may make for difficult optimization.
