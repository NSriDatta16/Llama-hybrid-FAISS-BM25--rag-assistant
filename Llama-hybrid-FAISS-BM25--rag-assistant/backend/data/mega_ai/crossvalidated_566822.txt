In machine learning, for a kernel function k, is sqrt(k) also a valid kernel function?

For some kernel function k which by definition has a symmetric and positive semidefinite kernel matrix K, is the new kernel function sqrt(k) also a valid kernel function? If we use Mercer's theorem, it is easy to show that the new kernel matrix is symmetric. The confusion is regarding checking if the new kernel matrix is also positive semidefinite, since the root computed at each element can also have negative values.
