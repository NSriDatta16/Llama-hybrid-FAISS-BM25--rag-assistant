Both approaches are possible. For approach #1 (Silverlight direct access): Azure table storage is accessed via REST API calls, which you can access from an out-of-browser Silverlight app with elevated permissions, without worrying about cross-domain issues. However, this has risk, as you'd be embedding the certificate into your Silverlight app (so you'd want to use a Shared Access Signature). See this MSDN post on this topic as well. So, as Henrik said, a good practice is to go through a service tier. I'd absolutely recommend approach #2 and avoid all risk associated with local keys. But... I just wanted to clarify that you can go with direct calls from Silverlight.
