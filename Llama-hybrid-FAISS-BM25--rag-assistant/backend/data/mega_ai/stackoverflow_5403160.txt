I can't imagine why you object to using final, but here's a class that will get the job done. I know there are subtleties regarding serialization and reflection, but this can't be changed without special shenanigans: public class Immutable { private int value; public Immutable(int v) { this.value = v; } public int getValue() { return this.value; } }
