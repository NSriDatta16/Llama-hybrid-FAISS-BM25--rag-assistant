ANOVA vs logistic regression on this problem

I have 1 cohort of patients, each and every one having suffered an outcome event Y. I split this cohort into two groups of patients, both with the same disease but different variations (so say cancer size small vs. cancer size big). I want to know whether a set of variables increase the odds of having outcome Y, in cancer size small vs. cancer size big. I.e. does smoking (for example) in those with small cancer size increase their risk of outcome Y, vs those with big cancer size. I'm a bit lost as to whether to use ANOVA or logistic regression as my model. I've usually used logistic regression so I don't want to get stuck thinking everything should be modeled with logistic regression.
