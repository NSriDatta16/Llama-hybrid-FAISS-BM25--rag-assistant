Java applet for Tower of Hanoi

I am planning to write a Java applet for Tower of Hanoi similar to link( http://www.mazeworks.com/hanoi/index.htm ) Can you suggest how should I start and proceed. And, btw, does it require multi threading? And also, major part of my doubt is to make a disc being clickable and being able to drag and drop the disc on a tower. detect a tower (if a disc is being dragged using mouse)
