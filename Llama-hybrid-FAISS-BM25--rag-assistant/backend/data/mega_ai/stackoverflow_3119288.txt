Why would a class implement IDisposable explicitly instead of implicitly?

I was using the FtpWebResponse class and didn't see a Dispose method. It turns out that the class implements IDisposable, but does so explicitly so that you must first cast your instance to IDisposable before calling Dispose: // response is an instance of FtpWebResposne ((IDisposable) response).Dispose(); Why would the designer of a class such as this one choose to implement IDisposable explicitly? As Anthony Pegram says , doing things this way masks the fact that the object should be disposed for the average developer who is not consulting the documentation every time he/she uses a class.
