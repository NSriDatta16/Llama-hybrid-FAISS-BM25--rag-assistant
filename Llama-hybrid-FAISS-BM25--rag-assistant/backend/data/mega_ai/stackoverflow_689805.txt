Under number 4, I think you may be missing that this is where the program is copied from some physical storage, e.g. a disk or a server, into the operating system's memory. That isn't quite the same as what you state since the physical and virtual memory are part of the operating system to my mind. On the first doubt, not necessarily, I think. Consider how if I start running a game that there is an inital time spent loading files that is part of the same executable and so there is something running to tell the O/S to load files.
