A solution could be using a bayesian approach, by putting a weakly informative prior on the estimates; specifically, a prior which gives very low probability to extremely positive or negative values to the log of the Odds Ratio (remember: Odds Ratio [0; Inf] -> log Odds Ratio [-Inf; Inf]) . Without going full Bayesian, I often use a semi-Bayesian (aka penalized maximum likelihood estimate) estimation for the log odds ratio, imposing a Cauchy prior (see Gelman http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/priors11.pdf ), which is actually a T distribution with df = 1. Here's what I would do in R (with arm library): mod Of course, the analysis shows the total lack of information in the data regarding the phenomenon; it just put real numbers to uncertainty instead of infinite values, but nonetheless a quite uninformative interval! In summary, the interpretation is that this data cannot tell you whether A is different from B. You need more data and you need to observe at least few cases! Than Bayes or semi-Bayes methods can help you with lack of stability in the case or rare events by shrinking estimates to more credible values.
