The main issue is that there exists a linear seperation of both classes without any loss. The correct support vectors should be S, T, A, D with a linear kernel. I do not see any inconsistency with E not beeing a support vector. The plot illustrates the proper linear seperation of both classes (roughly, not done with svm), support vectors marked in red.
