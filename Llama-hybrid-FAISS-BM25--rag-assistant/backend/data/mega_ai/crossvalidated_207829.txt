How to model timeseries temperature data?

I would like to model a timeseries consisting of internal temperature data of a greenhouse, collected at 15 min interval and then use it to make predictions in the future. This is how my data looks like: The graph shows seasonality (day/night). I've been thinking about regression models (specifically polynomial regressions) to obtain some sort of function but so far I haven't obtained satisfactory results. I am not an expert in machine learning. Any ideas on how to approach this?
