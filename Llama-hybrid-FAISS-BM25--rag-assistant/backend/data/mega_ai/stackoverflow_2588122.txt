I can't think of anything at the top of my head that would do that to your specifications. You could try the Stanford NLP Java package or OpenNLP. However that might be a sledgehammer solution to what your trying to do. Alternatively you can try parsing it yourself. Use JFlex to scan the input and tokenize and CUP to create a grammar if you want to handle more input.
