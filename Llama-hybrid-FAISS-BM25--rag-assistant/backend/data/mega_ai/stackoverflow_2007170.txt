I would take another look at SSIS. While there is a learning curve, it can be quite flexible. It has support for a lot of different ways to manipulate data including stored procedures, ActiveX scripts and various ways to manipulate files. It has the ability to handle errors and provide notifications via email or logging. Basically, it should be able to handle just about everything. The other option, a custom application, is probably going to be a lot more work (SSIS already has a lot of the basics covered) and is still going to be fragile - any changes to data structures will require a recompile and redeployment. I think a change to your SSIS package would probably be easier to make. For some of the more complicated logic you might even need to use multiple stages - a custom C# console program to manipulate the data a bit and then an SSIS package to load it to the database. SSIS is a bit painful to learn and there are definitely some tricks to getting the most out of it but I think it's a worthwhile investment. A good reference book or two would probably be a good investment (Wrox's Expert SQL Server 2005 Integration Services isn't bad).
