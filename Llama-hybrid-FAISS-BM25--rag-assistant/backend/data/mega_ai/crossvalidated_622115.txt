If your goal is to create a predictive model, evaluating variables one at a time is a very bad approach. For multiple reasons, one of them being that this completely ignores the covariance between the predictors. Instead, consider using a model with all predictors and some regularization . The LASSO or elastic net are common ways to do this. Another way to go about this is to use a machine learning model (again, with all predictors). Perhaps the simplest way to do this is to use a random-forest , because it requires less 'tuning' than almost any other machine learning method.
