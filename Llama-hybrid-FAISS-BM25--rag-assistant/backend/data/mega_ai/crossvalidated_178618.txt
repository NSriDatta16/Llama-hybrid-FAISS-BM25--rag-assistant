I think that the best way to keep track of the latest developments in Machine Learning is to follow the Reddit feed: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/ Many researchers post some comments about the papers they recently submitted to different venues. You might also follow what is submitted to Arxiv here: http://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent Most researchers submit pre-print versions of their papers to Arxiv before publication. Also, you might want to have a Twitter account and follow particular researchers/professors who work in machine learning. However, the people you might want to follow really depend on your area of interest. A good starting point might be following the hashtag #machinelearning Also remember that the terms machine learning, data mining, knowledge discovery in data bases, data science are sometimes used interchangeably. In order to find some interesting developments in machine learning you might look at news in those other areas as well.
