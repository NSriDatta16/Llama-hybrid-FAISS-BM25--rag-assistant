Tree-based models consider variables sequentially, which makes them handy for considering interactions without specifying them. Interactions that are useful for prediction will be easily picked up with a large enough forest, so there's no real need to include an explicit interaction term. If you believe that the interaction is important, you could manually create the interaction term (for example, defining your formula within the model.frame function, which will create new columns for your interaction terms). Yet in your case this would nearly double the number of variables, as you're creating interactions between rad and every other feature, so it's probably ill-advised. See also Including Interaction Terms in Random Forest which demonstrates Random Forests' inherent ability to detect interacting variables compared to linear methods.
