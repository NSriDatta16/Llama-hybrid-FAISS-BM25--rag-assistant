This is the default behaviour of BizTalk working this XML schemas and, as far as I know, there is no builtin way to change this. What you really want, however, is that outbound messages conform to a cleaner and more liberal format than what is used by BizTalk. You can do this by using a custom pipeline component (and a custom send pipeline) to process the outgoing message before it leaves BizTalk. The idea is to change the namespace prefix as part of sending the message outside BizTalk. The transformation happens during the processing of the send pipeline. Nic Barden has blogged and provided some source code about this here . You can use his sample as the basis for performing replacement of namespace prefixes, rather than replacing namespaces themselves. I strongly encourage you to check out the whole series of posts he's done about Developing Streaming Pipeline Components. Nic has made an extensive and thorough job of describing all that's needed to author robust and enterprise-class pipeline components. Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5
