Go for XMPP. Out of the box, ejabberd has support for all your requirements. You won't need to see any erlang and write custom modules for ejabberd. And with Strophejs, XMPP in the browser (which is what you are apparently doing) is great. For your last question about pubsubhubbub replacing XMPP, don't count on it. XMPP is over 10years old, solid open source and proprietary interoperable implementations both on client and server, and is elegant so it won't go away. And you are developping a chat application which is what XMPP was made for.
