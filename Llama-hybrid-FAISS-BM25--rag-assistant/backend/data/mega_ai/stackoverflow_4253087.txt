HTML troolean form element

What's the best way to simulate a troolean variable with an HTML form? Specifically, I've got a column that is to be sorted, so it can have three states: unsorted, ascending, and descending. I want to store the state in a form so it is recovered after page submission. Is there an elegant way of doing this? EDIT Javascript is encouraged here. Right now my solution is a hidden input, with a value of 0,1, or 2. The value is changed when the sort button is clicked, and submitted with the form. But perhaps there's a better way? EDIT This question has apparently already been asked: Tri-state Check box in HTML? . Voting to close.
