In logistic regression binary variables may be standardise for combining them with continuos vars when you want to give to all of them a non informative prior such as N~(0,5) or Cauchy~(0,5). The standardisation is adviced to be as follows: Take the total count and give 1 = proportion of 1's 0 = 1 - proportion of 1's. ----- Edit: Actually I was not right at all, it is not an standardisation but a shifting to be centered at 0 and differ by 1 in the lower and upper condition, lets say that a population is 30% with company A and 70% other, we can define centered "Company A" variable to take on the values -0.3 and 0.7.
