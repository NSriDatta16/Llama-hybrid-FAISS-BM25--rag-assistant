What is my model learning- Linear vs Non-Linear

I am trying to validate if my understanding of the topic is right. Linear Models pick up on a single representation of a class (read can only pick one) whilst a Non-Linear Model like a Neural Network is able to learn multiple representations of each class. If that is the case then doesn't that make linear models less effective then their counterparts, albeit model computation times will be much slower. PS: I have been referring to the material from Stanford cs231n to arrive at this conclusion.
