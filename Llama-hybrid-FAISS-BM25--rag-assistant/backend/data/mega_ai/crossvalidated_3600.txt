@Jeromy Anglim specified this correctly. Having the extra information when only one of the time series existed would provide no value here. And in principle, the data should be sampled at the same time for it to be meaningful using conventional correlation measures. As a more general problem, I would add that there are techniques to deal with irregularly spaced time series data. You can search for "irregularly spaced time series correlation". Some of the recent work has been done on "Realized Volatility and Correlation" (Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold, and Labys 1999) using high-frequency data.
