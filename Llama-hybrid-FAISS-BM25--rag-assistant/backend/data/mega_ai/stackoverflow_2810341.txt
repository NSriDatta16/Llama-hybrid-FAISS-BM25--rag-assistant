Drupal 6 / Views2 Grid style: whole cells link to nodes

On my Drupal site, I have made a Users page using the Views module, which is simply a nicely styled grid (HTML table) of users. I'm displaying a few fields for each one, and both the name and the profile picture have been set to link to the user node. What is the best way to change it so that the whole cell (HTML td) links to the user node? EDIT: I'm not concerned with adding the HTML link tags, but with accessing each profile page's URL. I've looked into modifying the theme of the view (over-riding the Style output e.g. views-view-grid--users.tpl.php), but cant see an elegant way to get the URL of the user node. EDIT: I've implemented a temporary solution in javascript which looks into the HTML of each cell, extracts the first link's URL, and uses that, but is there not a better way of doing this using the Drupal variables somehow? Thanks for your help.
