magento Baseurl from helper function

I want to get custom URL from magento helper in this way: About Us about About Us 1 So what I did is define a function getAboutUsUrl() under local directory within Customer Helper Directory. But it does not return the base url as I expected. What do I have to do to get the baseurl with about us link? Thanks
