Thank you very much for quick responces! Actually, both comments by hop and Charlie Martin were useful. lettrine.sty is a fantastic package, and it works if scaleable fonts are used. So, the solution was to force Type 1 CM fonts instead of default CM and use lettrine.sty . lettrine.sty documentation suggests to \usepackage{type1cm} . This works: \documentclass[12pt]{article} % works with pdfLaTeX \usepackage{type1cm} % scalable fonts \usepackage{lettrine} \usepackage[papersize={12cm,4cm}, left=0.5cm,right=0.5cm, top=0.5cm,bottom=0.5cm]{geometry} \begin{document} \lettrine[lines=3,slope=-4pt,nindent=-4pt]{W}{ith} a drop cap, the initial sits within the margins and runs several lines deep into the paragraph, pushing some normal-sized text off these lines. This keeps the left and top margins of the paragraph flush. In~modern browsers, this can be done with a combination of HTML and CSS by~using the float: left; setting. \end{document} And this is the result: Thank you! PS. dropping does not work correctly even with type1cm . UPD. This example also works with xelatex .
