Granger causality is essentially usefulness for forecasting: X is said to Granger-cause Y if Y can be better predicted using the histories of both X and Y than it can by using the history of Y alone. GC has very little to do with causality in Pearl's counterfactual sense, which involves comparisons of different states of the world that could have occurred. So Peeps Granger-cause Easter, but they do not cause it. Of course, the two will overlap in a world where there are no potential causes other than X, but that is not a very likely setting and a fundamentally untestable one. Another less restrictive way they can coincide is, if, conditional on the realised history of Y and X, the next realisation of X is independent of the potential outcomes. This point is made in Lechner, M. (2010), "The Relation of Different Concepts of Causality Used in Time Series and Microeconometrics," Econometric Reviews , 30, 109-127 ( WP link ), which is written in the potential outcomes framework, rather than Pearl's DAGs. Addendum : Let me make an implicit assumption more explicit. The crucial ingredient for my claim is that Easter does not have a fixed date. Suppose you knew nothing about Easter and wanted to forecast its date next year. From historical data (history of Y), you can see that Easter takes place in the spring. But can we do better than that? Using Peeps sales or marketing data (X) from near the holiday, we can see that peeps do Grange-cause it since that data is useful for forecasting Easter more precisely. The corollary is that Christmas trees sales do not Granger-cause Christmas since if you know that Christmas took place on December 25th for centuries (adjusting for various calendar reforms and church schisms), tree sales do not help.
