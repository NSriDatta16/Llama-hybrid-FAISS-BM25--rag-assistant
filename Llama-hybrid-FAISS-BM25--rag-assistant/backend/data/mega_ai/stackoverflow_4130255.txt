For very large allocations you may be running into fragmentation issues: the heap may have, say, 600mb of memory left, but chopped up into 100mb chunks, so that you can't allocate a single 500mb block. Some implementations of new (which really calls malloc() in most cases) are not very smart about failing gracefully when this happens. With such big allocations, you might have more luck using OS-specific functions like VirtualAlloc() and HeapAlloc() on Windows.
