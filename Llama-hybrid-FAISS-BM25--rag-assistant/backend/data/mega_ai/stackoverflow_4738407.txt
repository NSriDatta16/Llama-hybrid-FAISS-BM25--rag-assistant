Pure java, by itself, does not have a notion of a key input. You usually get them from a specific IO module (e.g., console based, AWT based, Swing based, etc.). You would then check for the condition or break. If your notification of a press is asynchronous, you would probably set some flag (e.g., breakRequested), and check for this flag and break if it has changed. For Console access, take a look at http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/Console.html but pay attention to the many questions about this facility here on Stackoverflow.
