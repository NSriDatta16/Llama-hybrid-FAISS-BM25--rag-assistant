Feature selection before ML (RF and SVM)

I am new to machine learning and have to work with big data (lots of OTUs along with clinical) which I will input into 2 different machine learning models ( RF and SVM ) that will be used for prediction ( classification ). The number of samples is around 500. My questions are: Will it make sense to apply a feature selection step for RF and SVM? Feature selection algorithms that come into mind are RFE and LASSO â€”planning to compare how well the two do. Will other techniques be better given the data and ML algorithms that will be used
