How can I parse this syntax to an array in Perl?

I have a file that contains parameters using this syntax RANGE { | - } [ , ...] where value s are numbers. for example, all these are valid syntax RANGE 34 RANGE 45, 234 RANGE 2-99 RANGE 3-7, 15, 16, 2, 54 How can I parse the values to an array in Perl? For example for the last example, I want my array to have 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 15, 16, 2, 54 . The ordering of elements does not matter. The most basic way is to check for a - symbol to determine whether there is a range or not, parse the range using a loop and then parse the rest of the elements my @arr; my $fh, " ) { if ($_ =~ /RANGE/) { if ($_ =~ /-/) { # parse the range for($lower..$upper) { $arr[++$#arr] = $_; } } else { # parse the first value } # parse the rest of the values after the comma } } I need help parsing the numbers. For parsing, one way I can think of is to use successive splits (on - , , and ). Is there some better (clean and elegant, using regex maybe?) way? Also, comments/suggestions on the overall program structure are welcome.
