Is there an existing way to find out if there is an association between two words in a sentence using NLP

So, I was working on word2vec , playing with it and although it's a great tool for finding similarities between two words,But when we come to finding a semantic association between two words it cannot be used. It would be interesting to know if there's an existing way, if yes how accurate is it and what principles does it work on?
