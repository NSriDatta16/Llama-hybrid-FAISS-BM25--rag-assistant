A "solution" in Visual Studio is a collection of projects. Each project is independent of all the others. The solution is just a convenient way of organizing projects and opening them all together. If one project is going to use the public objects defined in another project, then it must be compiled with a reference to the other project. This is true whether the projects are part of a single solution or not. To signal to Visual Studio that the EXE must be compiled with a reference to the DLL, you must add the DLL to the EXE's list of references in the Solution Explorer.
