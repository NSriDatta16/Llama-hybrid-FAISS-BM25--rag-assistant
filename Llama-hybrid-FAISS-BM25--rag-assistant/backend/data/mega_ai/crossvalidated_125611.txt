Quick Exploratory Analysis of Categorical Data

Does anyone know of a tool (preferably free) that does quick analysis of exploratory data mainly categorical with date. Using R and Python I can create time series and histograms, perform tests such as z and t. However a quick drag and drop tool would take away the coding aspect. I like Tableau and MiniTab but they are expensive. Thanks!
