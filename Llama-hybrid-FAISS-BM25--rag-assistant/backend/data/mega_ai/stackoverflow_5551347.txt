EF 4.0 Hibernate like saveupdate

I have silverlight application, where I use Entity Framework(PostgreSQL) and WCF(not RIA). Here is the problem: in database I have table organization and table of contacts. Organization has set of contacts. EF entity is not a data contract used by wcf. I use convertor to make datacontract from entity and vice versa. So my question is how to save related entities like hibernate saveupdate(cascade="save-update")?
