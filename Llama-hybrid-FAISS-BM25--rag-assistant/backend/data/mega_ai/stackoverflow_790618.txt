I upvoted @zoul , but you should take it one step further. Write Tests You should have your code covered with tests, and you should run some of those tests with use warnings FATAL => 'uninitialized'; declared in the test-case itself. Its the only way to address the concern you have with developers not checking things in advance properly. Make sure their code is tested. And take it another step further, and make it easy to run your tests under Devel::Cover to get a coverage report. cover -delete PERL5OPT='-MDevel::Cover' prove -l cover -report Html_basic And then check the lines of code and statements are being executed by the tests, otherwise making those warnings fatal will just make code die at an unexpected time later.
