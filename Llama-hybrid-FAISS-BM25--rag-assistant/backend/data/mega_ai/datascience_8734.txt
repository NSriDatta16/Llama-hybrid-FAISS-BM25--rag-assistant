PCA on MNIST dataset results in very poor performance

I am trying to build a model for classifying MNIST dataset using SVM. With raw features I am getting accuracy of around 94% (using linear kernel). When I tried it with PCA, with different number of components (35,50,250,500) I am getting accuracy around 11%. What can possibly the reason for this?
