Bayesian inference - conjugate priors and MAP

I came across a exercise on Bayesian inference with conjugate priors and MAP estimation: When you pet your cat, she might scratch you with probability $p$ or start purring with probability $1-p$. You estimate prior on $p$ to be distributed as $Beta(2, 2)$. Within one evening, your cat has scratched you 6 times and only 2 times she purred. What will be the parameters for posterior distribution over $p$? What is the MAP-estimate for $p$? My idea: Prior: $P(p) = p^{2-1}(1-p)^{2-1} = p(1-p)$ Likelihood: $P(x|p) = p^6(1-p)^2$ (Bernoulli) Posterior $P(p|x) \propto P(x|p)P(p) = p^6(1-p)^2p(1-p) = p^7(1-p)^3 = Beta(8,4)$ And for the MAP estimate: $\hat{p} = \underset{p}{\arg\max}~p^7(1-p)^3 = \frac{7}{10}$ Is this correct? Edit: corrected error: Beta(6,2) -> Beta(8,4)
