Appropriate Method To Compare Groups

df=data.frame("var1"=sample(1:3,100,r=T), "var2"=sample(1:7,100,r=T), "var3"=sample(0:1,100,r=T), "group"=sample(1:2,100,r=T), "idweight"=sample(20:40,100,r=T)) This is my sample data. I have various categorical measures and I intend to test if there are statistically significant differences in their proportions by group (1 or 2). All of the students come from the same school but some of them opted for summer immersement programs. We are interested to see what factors are different among those who did and did not wish to do so. In my education program I learned about logistic regression but we did not cover any basic descriptive analysis...so I am wondering 2 things. First is, what is an appropriate descriptive analysis to conduct? Second is, is it possible to estimate the p value from the descriptive analysis simultaneously for all of the different variables? I shall also add, our schools use student weights to make our locality representative of the larger 'county'
