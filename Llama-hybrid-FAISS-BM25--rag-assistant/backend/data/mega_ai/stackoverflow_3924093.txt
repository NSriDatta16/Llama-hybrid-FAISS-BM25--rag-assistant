Why does Magento use 2 cookies per session?

For data security and privacy reasons I want to know why Magento uses two cookies for one frontend session. All I know is that one of them is being set in Mage_Core_Model_Cookie::set(..) and the other one in Zend_Session::expireSessionCookie() , but still I can't seem to figure out what they are used for. I just can't think of any reason why one would need a second cookie for the same domain.
