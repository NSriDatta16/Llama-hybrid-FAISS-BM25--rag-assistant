Umh, I don't fully understand why you put the 'Ensures' also in the default c'tor. Because it calls the main c'tor, which already does implement the full contract, the default c'tor does that as well - by definition. So this is a logical redundancy, and therefore a big 'Don't'. Maybe it could have pragmatic implications, like you say - don't know Code Contracts that good... Regarding literature - the best sources are: Design By Contract, by Example (Book, Addison-Wesley) Wikipedia article on the issue An introduction to Design by Contract (Eiffel series, but the DbC principles are not language-specific) HTH!
