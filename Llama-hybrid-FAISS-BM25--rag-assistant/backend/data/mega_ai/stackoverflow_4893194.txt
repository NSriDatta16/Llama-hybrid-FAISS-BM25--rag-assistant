Handling drag and drop of files inside Eclipse Package Explorer

I'm trying to create an Eclipse plugin to support a proprietary project file format. My goal is to be able to drag and drop a file in the Project Explorer (any type of file) onto a file of the type I support, and have the name of the file being dragged appended to the end of the proprietary file. Right now, I have a custom editor that can parse out some data from an existing file in a manageable way. This means that I have an editor associated with the file type, such that my special icon shows up next to it. I don't know if that's relevant. I'm attempting to use the extension point "org.eclipse.ui.dropActions" but I'm not sure how to register my DropActionDelegate (implements org.eclipse.ui.part.IDropActionDelegate) such that it will be called when a file is dropped onto one of my type within the Project Explorer. Anybody have any ideas? Am I even on the right track with the DropActionDelegate?
