Best way to add video uploading, encoding and streaming functionality to my Rails app?

What is the best way to add video uploading, encoding and streaming functionality to my Rails app ? I'm thinking about a mix as : Rails app + Video Online Encoder + Amazon S3. What do you think ? For the Video Online Encoder (VOE), which one is the easier to use with Rails : heywatch, panvidea, encoding.com, pandastream, ... ? By the way, the application will allow users to play streamed videos with dynamic Texts, Schemas and Sounds added to them at the run time. There's an example : in rails app (backoffice or frontoffice) : Video upload (.mov, .avi, ...) VOE : video encoding in FLV format + storage in Amazon S3 in rails app, backoffice : in a home-made Flash application, "add" to the video a Text and a Schemas showed after 1 minute for example (informations stored in the Rails app DB). in rails app, frontoffice : play the streamed video from Amazon S3 (+Cloudfront) in a home-made Flash player which show dynamicaly the Text and the Schema over the video after 1 minute of playing. The part I really don't understand is the FLV video Stream. I was thinking that Cloudfront could do that. I hope I'm clear enough ;-) Thank you all for your answers !
