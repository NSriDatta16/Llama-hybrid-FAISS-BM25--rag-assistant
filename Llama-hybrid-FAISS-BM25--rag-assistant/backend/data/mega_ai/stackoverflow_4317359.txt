I think the biggest problem with the first way is: If the mtl authors (or whatever transformer library you use), decide to stop exporting the data constructor for ReaderT then it will stop working. This happened with the State monad in the version bump from mtl 1 to mtl 2 and it's quite annoying. Whereas, ask is part of the official api of Reader and you should plan on it sticking around. On the other hand, I wouldn't consider the first way wrong.
