You should be able to take care of this in your REST resource name design. You'd start with something like: /widget/12345 (the representation of widget 12345) /widgets (the list of all widget resource names, ie links) You might quickly decide that "/widgets" will be a humongous list and decide to support pages, something like /widgets/page/43 (this could have links to the 4200th to 4299th widgets, and additional information like the total number of pages or a count of the widgets.) In other cases you can subdivide a large set into a natural hierarchy: /widgets/mahogany, /widgets/oak, ... /movies/drama, /movies/romance, ... /computers/harddrives/seagate, /computers/usbdrives/kingston And you can define queries too: /widgets?maxprice=200&maxweight=4
