I started typing as a comment, but it didn't work out... I was in the same position one year ago, and I learned OLS by signing up for this Coursera course . And, yes, you can still take it for free. Two important caveats: The course is disorganized in its presentation and you may want to skip the math lectures. Of course the math is the fun part, but they try to avoid linear algebra and even the lecturer seems disappointed. More on this later... I would recommend using R (the course is in R), and downloading and doing the guided complement of the course in the GitHub swirl repository. This is even better than the course, and I have gone back to it many times. So, about the math, I did go through the MIT course by Professor Strang, and got his book. Finally, there is no better learning place than this site. So post questions, and try to answer other people's questions - don't worry about making mistakes, there are many eyes on the posts, and they typically get corrected.
