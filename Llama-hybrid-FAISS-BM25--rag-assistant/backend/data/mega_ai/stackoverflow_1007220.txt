I actually just took a class that perfectly fits your description (OS Design using linux) in the spring. I was actually very frustrated with it because I felt like the teacher focused too narrowly for the projects rather than give a broader understanding. For instance, our last project revolved around futexes. My partner and I barely learned what they were, got it working (kinda) and then turned it in. I came away with no general knowledge of anything really from that project. I wish one of the projects had been to write a simple device driver or something like that. In other words, I think it's good to make sure a good broad overview is presented, with as much detail as you can afford, but ultimately broad. I felt like my teacher nitpicked these tiny areas and made us intensely focus on those, while in the end I did NOT come away with that great of a general understanding of the inner-workings of Linux. Another thing I'd like to note is a lot of why I didn't retain knowledge from the class was lack of organization. Topics came out of nowhere any given week, and there was no roadmap. Give the material a logical flow. Mental organization is the key to retaining the knowledge.
