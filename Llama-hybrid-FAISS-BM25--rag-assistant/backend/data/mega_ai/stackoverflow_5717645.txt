Here are steps to get API token: Register APP w/ facebook and get app id Have your friend click this link https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth ? client_id=[your app id here]& type=user_agent& scope=email,read_stream,,,user_about_me,offline_access,publish_stream& redirect_uri=http://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html Then record that token for future You can now use any available python FB lib to post and manage that FB page.
