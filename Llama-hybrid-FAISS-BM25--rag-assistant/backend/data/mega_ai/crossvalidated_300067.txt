It sounds like your best bet is to use the event data, but supplement it with lagged covariates. For example, if you want to investigate the effect of the previous order value on some characteristic of the current order, then add a column PreviousOrderValue . Or you could add a column for the total order value over all the subject's orders in the previous 30 days. There's a lot of possibilities here; books on the analysis of longitudinal data or time series are good places to get an overview.
