What is the most elegant way to validate the presence of ONLY one out of two attributes using Rails?

class Followup This model needs to only have either a post or a comment, but only one of the two. Here's the rspec for what I'm trying to do: it "should be impossible to have both a comment and a post" do followup = Followup.make followup.comment = Comment.make followup.should be_valid followup.post = Post.make followup.should_not be_valid end I can see a bunch of solution to do this, but what would be the most elegant way of doing this?
