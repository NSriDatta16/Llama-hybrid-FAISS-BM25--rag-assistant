Cause of Intermittent SSIS Job failure with exit code -1073741819?

I am relatively new to SSIS. In the environment I am working in, I have access to a Dev database only. I create and test packages, then send these to a DBA to execute on our UAT environment. One of these packages, which is importing XML files, is intermittently failing when run as an SQL Server Agent job. This is a problem, as the end solution is for a high-reliability system. The test load is approximately 46000 files, and the import is variously failing after 1000-2000 files imported. The very informative error message is shown below. I've done a little research, and the only information I can locate on this error (which is sketchy at best) talks about concurrency problems. So, I ratcheted back the maximum executions to 1...still the same issue. Executed as user: \. Microsoft (R) SQL Server Execute Package Utility Version 9.00.4035.00 for 32-bit Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1984-2005. All rights reserved. Started: 2:19:57 PM. The return value was unknown. The process exit code was -1073741819. The step failed. Can anyone suggest a cause or solution? Or even a method for obtaining more diagnostic information?
