From draft n1256 of the C Language Standard, ยง 7.19.1, paragraph 2: The types declared are size_t (described in 7.17); FILE which is an object type capable of recording all the information needed to control a stream, including its file position indicator, a pointer to its associated buffer (if any), an error indicator that records whether a read/write error has occurred, and an end-of-file indicator that records whether the end of the file has been reached; and fpos_t which is an object type other than an array type capable of recording all the information needed to specify uniquely every position within a file. The exact contents of the FILE type are implementation-dependant, and are not meant to be accessed directly.
