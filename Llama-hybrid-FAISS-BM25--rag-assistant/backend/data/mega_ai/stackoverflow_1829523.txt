Have you looked into an event based approach? That way you will get real-time behavior, save resources and save you the need for coming up with a smart polling interval. If for whatever reason you need to use polling I would go with a short start-interval which is about double the length of time that you expect a notification to occur on average and then increase the interval from time to time if there was nothing new to avoid hammering your server unnecessarily. Though in general a good answer really depends on what your system does. For chat, event based is the ideal way to go imho.
