For y, use the quick sort ideas, picking a random number and partition it into 2 parts. Part1(smaller) and part2(bigger). If length of Part1 y, then do the partition in Part1 with y' = y If length of Part1 == y, then sort Part1. For partitioning, average should be almost in O(n) ( I can't approve it now, but it is very quick)( I will try to find some material for this part ).. Sort for y requires ylog(y) 1/2 * sqrt(x) * log(x) 1/2 x.
