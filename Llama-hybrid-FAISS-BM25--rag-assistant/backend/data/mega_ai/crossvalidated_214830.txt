2 Dimensional Random Walk Simulation

I am trying to simulate random diffusion of particles using a random walk diffusion model. I have used probabilities of movement of particles in a 2D area, to be 1/4 in all 4 directions. The confusion that I am having is whether to assign the corner probabilities as still 1/4 in the available directions (picture 1) or increase it, as the number of directions has decreased e.g. if 2 available directions then, 1/2 probability as shown in picture 2?
