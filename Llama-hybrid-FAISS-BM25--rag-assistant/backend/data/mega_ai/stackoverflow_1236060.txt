Compiling python modules with DEBUG defined on MSVC

Python rather stupidly has a pragma directive in its include files that forces a link against python26_d.lib when the DEBUG preprocessor variable is defined. This is a problem because the python installer doesn't come with python26_d.lib ! So I can't build applications in MSVC in debug mode. If I temporarily #undef DEBUG for just one file I get many complaints about inconsistent DLL linkage. If I change the pragma in pythons include file I get undefined references to various debug functions. I have tried compiling my own version of python but its somehow different enough from the python that gets distributed that I can't use my modules with apps built with the vanilla version of python Can anyone give me any advice on how to get round this?
