Is there a TFS check-in policy to prevent check-ins across team projects?

I'm having some trouble with some team members accidentally checking in code across (usually unrelated) Team Projects. I could flog them for not being careful or try to find an easier way to bring this to their attention. We are running TFS 2010 & VS 2010. Is there a TFS check-in policy to prevent check-ins across team projects?
