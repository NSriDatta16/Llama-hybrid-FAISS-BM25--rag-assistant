Solving optimisation problems is difficult, and finding a closed-form solution that finds the optimal point for the cost function is complicated. Consequently, optimisation problems are solved using iterative steps. This means people choose solutions which are guaranteed to decrease the cost or objective function with each step. This idea is somehow used in neural networks.
