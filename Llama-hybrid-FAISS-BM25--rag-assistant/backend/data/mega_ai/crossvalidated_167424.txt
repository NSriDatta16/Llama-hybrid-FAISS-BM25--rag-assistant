In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes." --Ben Franklin If an event has any non-zero probability of occurring, then it will almost surely happen if you keep doing it. As @mandata pointed out above, you can use the geometric distribution to calculate the probability of seeing one "success" (here, a medical failure) in $k$ trials. Alternately, it's easy to show that the expected number of trials needed for one success is $1/p$ . The Center for Disease Control estimates that the surgical site infection rate was around 2%. I have no idea how effective antibiotic prophylaxis is, but I am certain that post-op antibiotics cannot drive the infection rate to zero. Even if we assume that they're highly effective and reduce the infection rate by 100-fold, we'd expect an infection after 5,000 surgical sites, which doesn't seem like very many for a big hospital. However, the insurer isn't exactly demanding a zero error rate. It might be fairer to think of them as 'fining' the hospital the cost a procedure for each adverse event to encourage them to take steps to prevent post-operative infections, which are a pretty substantial cause of death. More cynically, you could also accuse them of cutting their reimbursement rates by $p \cdot \textrm{price}$ dollars. Even services that are largely automated and easier to test, backup, etc. don't have 0% error rates, though they're close. Amazon's cloud computing platform was up for 99.9974% of 2014.
