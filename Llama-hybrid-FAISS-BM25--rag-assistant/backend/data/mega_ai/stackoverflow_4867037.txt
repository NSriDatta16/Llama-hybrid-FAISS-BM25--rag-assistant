Django: css referencing media in static files (django dev / 1.3 / static files)

Like any other user of django user I serve static files. I've chosen to use django-staticfiles to be ready for django 1.3 which will basically integrate it into the core . My question is pretty simple really - this works great for pulling together multiple media sources and referencing them in a uniform way in django templates. However, I often use image backgrounds in Css like so: #itemname { background-image: url('/path/to/image.png'); } My question is simple - if I use absolute names, I have to hard code them. If I use relative names, moving to "subdirectory" urls messes up the resource location for these items and they can't be loaded. So, how do I extend this solution to CSS? Said solution must avoid: Embedding css in html . I personally avoid this. Using hardcoded urls . This does not work very well because on my local setup I typically use 'localhost/project' with apache for testing (mod_wsgi) whereas I tend to use project.com for deployment. Ideas?
