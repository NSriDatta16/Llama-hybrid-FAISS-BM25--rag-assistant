How do I take this ratio of two means, then normalize according to another mean while maintaining a correct measure of spread?

I have been trying to figure out how to correctly calculate the standard deviation for the ratio of two protein expressions as measured by ELISA, so that I may then run a hypothesis test, similar to this figure in this paper with the IL-1ra/TNF-alpha ratio. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24013843/#&gid=article-figures&pid=figure-1-uid-0 I am seeing how expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1ra change according to two factors: the type of particle used, and the concentration of each particle. I have 2 particles, 3 concentrations each, therefore 6 treatment groups plus one contrl group. I have 7 data sets of n=6 technical replicates each for the IL-1ra, 7 data sets of n=4 technical replicates each for the TNF-alpha. I am worried that it is incorrect just to divide the respective average concentrations and propagate their standard deviations. I additionally want to normalize these ratios according to percentage cell viability data that I obtained at each concentration. Please let me know if this is the appropriate place to ask this question, or where else I could ask.
