The appropriate way to read text files in Cocoa/Objective-C is documented in Apple's String programming guide. The section for reading and writing files should be just what you're after. PS: What's a "line"? Two sections of a string separated by "\n"? Or "\r"? Or "\r\n"? Or maybe you're actually after paragraphs? The previously mentioned guide also includes a section on splitting a string into lines or paragraphs. (This section is called "Paragraphs and Line Breaks", and is linked to in the left-hand-side menu of the page I pointed to above. Unfortunately this site doesn't allow me to post more than one URL as I'm not a trustworthy user yet.) To paraphrase Knuth: premature optimisation is the root of all evil. Don't simply assume that "reading the whole file into memory" is slow. Have you benchmarked it? Do you know that it actually reads the whole file into memory? Maybe it simply returns a proxy object and keeps reading behind the scenes as you consume the string? ( Disclaimer: I have no idea if NSString actually does this. It conceivably could. ) The point is: first go with the documented way of doing things. Then, if benchmarks show that this doesn't have the performance you desire, optimise.
