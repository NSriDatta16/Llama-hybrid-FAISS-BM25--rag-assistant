JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data storage language, a bit like XML, but uses a more familiar "dictionary" style syntax and semantics. For example, I can store an address book in JSON: [{"Name": "Jane", "Address": "28 Seventh St", "Age": 27}, {"Name": "Steve", "Address": "14 Ninth St", "Age": 25} ] Notice that it looks a lot like a Python or JavaScript dictionary and list syntax. That's basically all it is: a serialisation of these six basic data types: Object (or a "dictionary") Array (or a "list") String Number (integer and float) Boolean ( true and false ) null More information at json.org . Note that although it has "JavaScript" in the name, it is really easy to read and write JSON data from any language, though the data structure is best represented in dynamic languages like JavaScript and Python. The website has a huge list of implementations in various languages.
