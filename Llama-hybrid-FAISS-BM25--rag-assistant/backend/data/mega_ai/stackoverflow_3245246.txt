By default when you pass ActiveRecord::Base#joins a named association, it will perform an INNER JOIN. You'll have to pass a string representing your LEFT OUTER JOIN. From the documentation : :joins - Either an SQL fragment for additional joins like " LEFT JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = id " (rarely needed), named associations in the same form used for the :include option, which will perform an INNER JOIN on the associated table(s), or an array containing a mixture of both strings and named associations. If the value is a string, then the records will be returned read-only since they will have attributes that do not correspond to the tableâ€˜s columns. Pass :readonly => false to override.
