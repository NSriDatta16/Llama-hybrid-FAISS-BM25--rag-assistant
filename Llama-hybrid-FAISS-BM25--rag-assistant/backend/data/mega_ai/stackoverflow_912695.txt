So you need someone to tell the other developers that they must label their code every time a build is done and increment a version counter. Why can't you do that? You also need to tell management that you believe the level of testing done is not sufficient. This is not a unique problem for an organisation and they'll probably say they already know. No harm in mentioning it though rather than waiting for a major problem to arrive. As far as individuals doing builds or automated build processes this depends on whether you really need this based on how many developers there are and how often you do builds.
