How can probability be equal to pdf times volume of area?

I'm studying pattern recognition and I'm at the part about Kernel density estimators. During the introduction of the subject, the book I'm studying ( Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning by Bishop ) takes for granted something I'm not sure I can understand. Say we have an unknown pdf $p(x)$ in some D-dimensional space and let us consider some small region $R$ containing $x$ . Then, if we make the assumption that $R$ is small enough so that the pdf is roughly constant over the region, we have $$P \approx p(x)V$$ where $V$ is the volume of $R$ . I'm completely unaware of how this formula was derived or how the volume $V$ appeared there. Any help woud be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
