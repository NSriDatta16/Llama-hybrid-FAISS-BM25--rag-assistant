Any research on relationship between the dimensions of a (word2Vec) space and how the human mind constructs meaning (or reality) through language?

Neuroscience is still trying to "find" how the mind (and language) somehow "works". Is there any theory linking a (low-dimensionality) embedding space (like word2Vec) to a mind (linguistic) model? Any Cognitive Linguistics theory?
