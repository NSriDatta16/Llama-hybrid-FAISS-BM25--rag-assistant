The image shows the shapes of area occupied by L1 and L2 Norm. The second image consists of various Gradient Descent contours for various regression problems. In all the contour plots, observe the red circle which intersects the Ridge or L2 Norm. the intersection is not on the axes. The black circle in all the contours represents the one which interesects the L1 Norm or Lasso. It intersects relatively close to axes. This results in making coefficients to 0 and hence feature selection. Hence L1 norm make the model sparse. More Detailed explanation at the following link: Click Post on Towards Data Science
