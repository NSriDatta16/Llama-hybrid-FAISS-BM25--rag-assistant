I need advice about files and categories in asp.net

I am working on a project for files upload and storage. One of the tasks is to be able to select in which category you want to upload the documents, for example: "work", "private", etc. As it is now, I have folders for each user, and each user has one folder for all the documents. I was thinking to create a sql table and have the categories there, but any idea how to reference them. If anyone else have some better idea, it would be appreciated. Thanks
