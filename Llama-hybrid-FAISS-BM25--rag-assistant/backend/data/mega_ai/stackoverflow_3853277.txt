There's a couple of options: Hosting a git repository on the server to push to, which automagically checks out the latest version. More on this here , also check out this detached git tree solution, too. Use something like fabric with rsync or similar. Typically I would have an inline git repo with the post-update hook setup for a specific branch (usually "live"). Then it's a matter of git remote add -t live live ssh://... on my laptop and a git push live to get things pushed. You'll also need something to restart the Django server for the new code to take effect (could do this inside the hook, or ssh/fabric). For future projects, I'm experimenting with the detached git tree (seems more elegant) combined with fabric.
