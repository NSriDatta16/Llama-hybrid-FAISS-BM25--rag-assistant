If you have the two original datasets, I recommend aggregating $5290$ copies of the first population and $500$ copies of the second population to get a new dataset with $3830\times 5290+500\times 5290=22\,905\,700$ datapoints. You can estimate the percentiles from that. If you don't have the two original datasets, you'll have to guess. If we call the given percentiles $q$ (for quantile), we might try the assumption that each pdf is a piecewise-linear function between the points $(q_0,0)$ , $(q_{10},f_{10})$ , $(q_{25},f_{25})$ , $(q_{50},f_{50})$ , $(q_{75},f_{75})$ , $(q_{90},f_{90})$ , $(q_{100},0)$ , and zero elsewhere. We can calculate the mean and the six areas separated by those five percentiles in terms of $q_0, f_{10}, f_{25}, f_{50}, f_{75}, f_{90}, q_{100}$ , and solve the resulting seven equations for the seven variables. A reasonable solution would have $q_0\le q_{10}\le q_{90}\le q_{100}$ and $\min(f_{10},f_{25},f_{50},f_{75},f_{90})\ge0$ . The first dataset has exactly one reasonable solution. By contrast, the second dataset is so highly spiked between the 50th and 75th percentiles that it has no reasonable solutions of this form. (See update below.) But there is one solution for the second data set satisfying the inequalities on the $q$ 's, and we can work with the negative $f$ 's. Here are the graphs of the two piecewise-linear functions, scaled up by 3830 and 500 to give approximate formal histograms for the two datasets. Obviously the orange graph goes negative and is not a reasonable histogram! We can still plot the sum of the two graphs, and fortunately the result is positive from 46286 to 498411, and a plausible-looking histogram for the mixture. Similarly, using the combined pdf of (3830/4330) times the first function plus (500/4330) times the second function, we can estimate the quantiles of the mixture as: 10th quantile: $\ \,$ 62780 25th quantile: $\ \,$ 83090 50th quantile: 120350 75th quantile: 153520 90th quantile: 178910 Perhaps these estimates, even if calculated via some not-very-meaningful negative numbers, are good enough for your purposes. Perhaps fitting the data to a wider class of models would be better, even with more difficult calculations and maybe arbitrary choices between multiple solutions. Or perhaps a simple calculation with 23 million datapoints looks pretty good. Update: By examining average pdfs over three regions, we can prove that reasonable models of this type can not fit the second dataset. In this model $$\frac{f_{25}+f_{50}}{\phantom{1}2^{\phantom{2}}}=\frac{\int_{q_{25}}^{q_{50}}f(x)dx}{q_{50}-q_{25}}=\frac{0.50-0.25}{q_{50}-q_{25}}$$ and similarly for other pairs of neighboring quantiles. So a reasonable solution would satisfy $$\frac{f_{25}+f_{50}}{2}+\frac{f_{75}+f_{90}}{2}\ge \frac{f_{50}+f_{75}}{2}$$ and $$\frac{0.50-0.25}{q_{50}-q_{25}}+ \frac{0.90-0.75}{q_{90}-q_{75}}\ge \frac{0.75-0.50}{q_{75}-q_{50}}$$ But in this case that would give $$\frac{7.3}{10^6}+\frac{6.3}{10^6}\ge\frac{25.6}{10^6}$$ which is false.
