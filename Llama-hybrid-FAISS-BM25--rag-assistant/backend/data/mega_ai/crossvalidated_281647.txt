I do not know about T-SNE at all, but each of the other three could be the "best one," depending on the assumptions you make on the way your data are generated. PCA is often used when we believe that the items make up the composite variable. This would be an example like socioeconomic status: Items like education, salary, job prestige, etc., are constituent parts of socioeconomic status. EFA is often used when we believe that the items are generated from a latent construct. This would be an example like happiness: We cannot physically measure happiness, so we ask people a number of questions that we think are outcomes of how happy people are. Those items don't make up happiness; instead, we assume that happiness is affecting these. CFA makes the same assumption that EFA does (this is called the "common factor model"). While EFA is unsupervised—it does not assume a structure for the data (i.e., you could get one factor, two factors, three factors, whatever)—a CFA assumes that there is a structure to your data. The researcher specifically says what items load on what factor. You can get model fit statistics that tell you how much this model-implied covariance matrix actually maps onto the real covariance matrix, but you must first start with a theoretical structure in mind. You say that "I would like to obtain one combination that describe the maximum information," which sounds like PCA is what you want. You also say that you wish to do this "in order to get a score of the importance of each variable." This is tricky. How do you define importance? Is it predictive validity? Then dimension reduction may not be what you are at. But a PCA can tell you how much that item loads—or contributes to—that component. It depends on your theoretical assumptions for how you think the data were generated and if you have a factor structure already in mind. But it seems to me from the limited information given that you are after a PCA. I describe more on the difference between PCA and PAF (a type of EFA) here.
