A Nokia research team did something similar to this and used a gateway, which was mapped to the public URL with DNS, to provide a means of always accessing the phone (which had an app to then send the HTTP message to the Mobile webserver). I would imagine this would also have the advantage of allowing you provide some sort of controlled response from the gateway itself even if the phone is not switched on/in coverage.
