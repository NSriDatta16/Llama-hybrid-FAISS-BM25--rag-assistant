The number of features you should use in your model depends on several factors, including the complexity of your problem, the amount of data you have, and the computational resources at your disposal. Few points that you could consider while choosing your features: Overfitting vs. Underfitting : If you have too many features relative to the number of observations, your model may overfit the data, meaning it will perform well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. On the other hand, if you have too few features, your model may underfit the data, meaning it will not capture the complexity of the problem and will perform poorly even on the training data. Curse of Dimensionality : As the number of features increases, the amount of data needed to generalize accurately grows exponentially. This is known as the curse of dimensionality. If you have numerous features but not much data, your model may struggle to learn. Computational Resources : More features require more computational resources to process. If you're working with a large dataset and have limited computational resources, you may need to reduce the number of features. Domain Knowledge : If you have a good understanding of the problem domain, you can use this knowledge to select the most relevant features. This can often lead to better performance than simply throwing in as many features as possible. Feature Selection Techniques : Techniques such as mutual information, chi-square test, correlation coefficient, recursive feature elimination, etc., can help in selecting the most relevant features. Model Complexity : Some models can handle high dimensional data better than others. For example, tree-based models like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting can handle high dimensional data quite well, while linear models may struggle. You can create a random forest model and select the top 50 or 100 features (depends on you about how many features that you need) from the model. This could work as well. In your case, with time series data, it's important to consider the temporal aspect of your features. Some features may be highly correlated with each other due to the temporal nature of the data, which can lead to multicollinearity issues. Feature selection techniques that take into account the temporal aspect can be beneficial. Finally, there's no thumb rule answer to this question. It's often a good idea to start with a larger set of features and then use feature selection techniques and cross-validation to get down the number of features to a manageable size.
