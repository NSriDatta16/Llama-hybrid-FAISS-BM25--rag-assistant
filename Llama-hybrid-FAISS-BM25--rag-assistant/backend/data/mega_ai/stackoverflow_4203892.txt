How does Google Static lib for iOS NOT need "other linker flag" (OTHER_LDFLAGS)

As we know, a compiled static lib * .a adds to a project, the project should config the "other linker flag" (OTHER_LDFLAGS) to add value "-ObjC" and "-all_load". But as I see, the Google libs for iOS do NOT need that, it just simply drag in and use. Do I miss something? thanks in advanced. and sorry for my English epxress. Travis
