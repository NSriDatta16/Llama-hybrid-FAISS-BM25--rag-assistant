How to deal with multicollinearity on categorical dataset with ordinal and nominal variables in ordinal Logistic regression to get odds ratios?

My dataset consists of ordinal and nominal variables for independent variables and an ordinal variable for the dependent variable. I have been trying to get odds ratios using the coefficients of independent variables to interpret their impact on the dependent variable. However, there is a strong multicollinearity among ordinal variables. Please find the correlation matrix attached. I have read two related posts . But, I am not sure how to deal with it. I think I cannot remove all of them except a few. My current option could be using LASSO to penalize the variables based on this answer . Any help is appreciated.
