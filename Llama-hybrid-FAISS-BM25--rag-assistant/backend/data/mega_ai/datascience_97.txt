Depends on the user's intent , for starters. Users normally only view the first set of links , which means that unless the link is viewable, it's not getting clicks; meaning you'd have to be positive those are the best links, otherwise the clicks are most likely going to reflect placement, not relevance. For example, here's a click and attention distribution heat-map for Google search results: Further, using click frequency to account for relevance is not a direct measure of the resource's relevance. Also, using clicks is problematic, since issues like click-inflation, click-fraud, etc. will pop-up and are hard to counter. That said, if you're interested in using user interaction to model relevance, I would suggest you attempt to measure post-click engagement, not how users respond to search results; see " YouTube's head of engineering speaking about clicks vs engagement " for more information, though note that the size itself of the content is a factor too. Might be worth noting that historically Google was known for PageRank algorithm though it's possible your intent is only to review click-streams, so I won't delve Google ranking factors ; if you are interested in the Google's approach, you might find a review of Google's Search Quality Rating Guidelines .
