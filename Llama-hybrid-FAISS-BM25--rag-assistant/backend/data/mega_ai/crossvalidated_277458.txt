You are framing this question as though feature selection and PCA are exclusive alternatives - pick one and you can't pick the other. This is not the case. Feature selection is critically examining your features and deciding that one or more don't contain useful information. PCA is an algorithm which can be used to transform two or more features that perform badly in your model due to possible mutual correlation into a single feature that performs more effectively. Twenty-one features is a large enough set of features that when you examine them you could find instances where each is appropriate. Hence it is more a case of understanding your features, how they relate to each other and the dependent variable before deciding the correct next step.
