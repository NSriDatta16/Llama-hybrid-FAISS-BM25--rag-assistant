There are some circumstances where such a speed is normal yes. First, using FindFirstFileA instead of FindFirstFileW is going to incur overhead for the conversion from UTF-16 to ANSI. Second, if you are going through directories that have not yet been accessed by the operating system, you will incur at least one seek penalty (about 16ms for most consumer hard drives), limiting your enumeration to well under 100 directory checks per second. This will get worse if the Master File Table on the given drive is badly fragmented. Regarding number of files, it's going to depend more upon the number of files per directory than the number of files themselves.
