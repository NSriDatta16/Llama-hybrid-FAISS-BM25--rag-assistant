Machine Learning works if there is a correlation between given data and class. For what I can discern here, you are trying to infer 4 value at the same time using the same values of measured on previous intervals. I could be wrong but I think you are missing some information because how can you predict the number of reads at time 61 if you don't know what the machine is actually doing? If there is no pattern in time 1-60 then in my opinion you can't do much. Anyway, for the fluctuations of data i think that the best way to handle them is to normalize every column with values between 0 and 1 (see: How to normalize data to 0-1 range? ) so that you can measure the real fluctuation. You can try to normalize them and then again your algorithms, let us know! I hope it somehow helped Best of luck
