Transactions are not limited to MySql - most RDBMS use them. They are useful when you are doing several related operations and need them to behave atomically - that is, either all of them happen or none. For example - you want to save an Order and all of the OrderItems. This is best done in a transaction, as one doesn't mean much without the other. The wikipedia article is quite informative. Transactions provide an "all-or-nothing" proposition, stating that each work-unit performed in a database must either complete in its entirety or have no effect whatsoever. Further, the system must isolate each transaction from other transactions, results must conform to existing constraints in the database, and transactions that complete successfully must get written to durable storage.
