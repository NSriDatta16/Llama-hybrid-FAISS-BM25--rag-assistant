Arima_model=sm.tsa.arima.ARIMA(train_df,order=(0,0,0)) This line creates an ARIMA(0,0,0) model, i.e., there is no autoregression (the first zero), no integration (the second zero), and no moving average component (the last zero). Your model is an intercept-only model, so forecasts are naturally flat. Try pmdarima.arima.auto_arima for automatic order selection. Don't forget to specify a possible seasonal cycle length of 7 for your time series, since car requests probably have an intra-weekly seasonality.
