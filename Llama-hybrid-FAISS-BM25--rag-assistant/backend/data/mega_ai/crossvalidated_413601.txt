There's very little use in ML if that's all you have on accounts. ML has a chance when you get a lot of features of individual accounts. Otherwise, advanced time series analysis plus manual adjustments (using product managers' input and utlooks) will do the job. In any case, if your boss is pushing to do ML, make sure that you have a baseline forecast using time series methods to compare performance of ML models with. I bet that time series will beat ML every day.
