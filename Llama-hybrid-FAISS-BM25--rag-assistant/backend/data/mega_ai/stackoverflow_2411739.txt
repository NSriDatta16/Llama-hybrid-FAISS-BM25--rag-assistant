Maybe you have some variable named test in $_SESSION , and have register_globals enabled ? In which case, the $_SESSION['test'] variable will be created as a global $test variable by the call to session_start() , overridding any existing $test variable of your script. This would also explain why this is happening on some servers and not some others : register_globals is Off by default -- and has been for many years, but some hosts keep it enabled :-( (When people say register_globals is evil, it's not without a good reason...) For more informations, you can read the [Using Register Globals][2] page of the manual -- there is even a paragraph about `$_SESSION` and some problems that `register_globals` can cause. Now, on how to fix this... Well, I suppose the fastest way would be to make sure that `session_start()` is called before you set `$test` to what you want it to be : session_start(); $test = new test(); $test->load("email"); This way, even if a $test is created because of register_globals , your variable will override it -- and the last one is the one that's right ^^ But the best solution would be to turn register_globals Off : that's a reliquate from the past... That should probably never have existed :-( (There are some bad things in PHP ; that's one of them, in my opinion)
