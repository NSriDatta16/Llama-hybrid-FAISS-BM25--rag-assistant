Yes, you can use PCA retaining only certain components as pre-processing step for classification. It is actually pretty common in chemometric classification. However, I prefer PLS as it also uses your class labels and tries to find good separation (which PCA doesn't). In both cases, keep in mind that this is a data-driven pre-processing and validation of the final model needs data independent also of these pre-processing steps.
