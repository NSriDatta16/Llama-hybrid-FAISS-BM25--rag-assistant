It's not so much a question of available hosted services as of what setup you want for your standard development environment. If one of the cloud datastores doesn't work for you, you can always get a virtual server and install whatever you need. However, you may want to rethink the idea of putting dev databases in the cloud. Performance will not be as good as something running locally (particularly if you are working with things like bulk import), and turning a dev database into a production database isn't a particularly good idea. I think what you are really looking for is a combination of easy backup, schema management and data setup. Backup on a live server is easy enough - either you are backing up the entire server or have a script that uploads the backup file somewhere. For dev I don't bother as I prefer to set up disposable environments - have code that can set up the database if it doesn't already exist and add any necessary default data. Most apps don't need much data unless there is some sort of import process involved, and the same code works quite nicely when you first set up the live environment. Schema management is one of the more painful aspects of working with SQL and where NoSQL systems can make life a lot easier as most have the schema defined entirely by the code that is using it - I mostly use redis myself, but whether or not it is appropriate for you will depend on the type of project you work on - if you need a lot of joins or transactions you probably need SQL, but if you just need basic data storage most NoSQL platforms would be better.
