@category The @category tag is used to organize groups of packages together. This is directly applicable to the XML:DocBook/peardoc2 Converter, and can be used by other converters. Other Converters packaged with phpDocumentor ignore the category, but this may change in future versions. It is also possible to dynamically specify category using the -dc, --defaultcategoryname command-line switch http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_tags.category.pkg.html @package @package can only be used to document procedural pages or classes. Packages are used to help you logically group related elements. You write classes to group related functions and data together, and phpDocumentor represents the contents of files (functions, defines, and includes) as "Procedural Pages." A package is used to group classes and procedural pages together in the same manner that a directory groups related files together. http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_tags.package.pkg.html
