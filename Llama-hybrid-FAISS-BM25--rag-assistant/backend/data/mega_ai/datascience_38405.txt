This question is way too vague, you just describes pretty much a standard situation. Which algorithm / method you use depends entirely on your objective and data. You should provide more information if you want a specific answer. Since your dependent variable is binary you are interested in classification, popular algorithms are Random Forests, Logistic Regression, K-means, etc.
