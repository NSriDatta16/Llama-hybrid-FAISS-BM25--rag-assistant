Magento API: Assigning preexisting simple products to configurable products

I've got a client database with a large range of stock items, which are being uploaded to Magento as simple products. Now I need to group them up and assign them to configurable products with their size and colour being their configurable attributes. The Magento API has a Product_Link class, with a promising looking method: catalogue-product-link.assign ( link ), but I can't for the life of me figure out what arguments I need to make it work with configurable products, providing this is how assign was meant to be used.
