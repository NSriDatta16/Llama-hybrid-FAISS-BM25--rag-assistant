omemuhammed's answer is an excellent coverages of localization in the mobile space. I've only had to support EFIGS (English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish). We stored all strings in XML, had an XML pack for each language. We would then compile these XML packs into proprietary binary data and had the ability to build either all 5 languages into a build, have only one language for the build in cases where the application size was tight, or download the binary from a server. Other considerations with localization is screen layout. I also recommend custom fonts in order to have better control of the display across many different devices. You will need some auto-wrapping code to be able to adjust to different screen resolutions and aspect ratios and you will need a way to handle strings that run off the screen on some devices. Either paging or or scrolling would be a good solution. Finally, just know that German will screw up your formatting. Try to allow 20-30% padding in English for menus and other UI elements as the German translations will be much longer than the other languages.
