The error seems to come from a curl command : $ch = curl_init ($src); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 15); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1"); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $src); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, TRUE); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, FALSE); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0'); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_FILE, $fh); if (curl_exec ($ch) === FALSE) { if (file_exists ($local_filepath)) { unlink ($local_filepath); } display_error ('error reading file ' . $src . ' from remote host: ' . curl_error($ch)); } curl_close ($ch); fclose ($fh); It could come from the timeout. You may change it @ line 607 EDIT : Alright, I tested it (since someone don't think pointing out the code doing the error and having guesses isn't enough) it works flawlessly on my server. So it can be : The timeout The directory './cache' (that you can change in the class if needed @ line 17) not created/not with the good chmod so the fopen doesn't work. It is used to save the distant image on your server; if there's nowhere to save, then the curl command fails.
