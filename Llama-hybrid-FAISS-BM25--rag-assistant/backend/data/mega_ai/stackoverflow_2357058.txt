How do I create an element on a page which always stays visible but moves out of the way of other elements?

I have a HTML page which a pretty complex layout ( see here ). I need to put an image on that page which the visitor can drag anywhere so she can remember where she was. I've implemented the bookmark feature but now I need to place the image somewhere where she can easily grab it. Basically, I'd like the element to stay below the ToC on the right but it shouldn't scroll out of view. I guess I could use JavaScript to move the element as soon as it starts to scroll out of view but is there a better option? Can I say "float right and below the ToC div or view.top, whichever is greater"? Or maybe I should create a fixed header (with the links and the maybe the ToC)? Any other ideas?
