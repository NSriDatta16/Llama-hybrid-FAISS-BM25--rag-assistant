MySQL Table Loop using PHP

I have an online form which collects consumer data and stores in a dedicated MySQL database. In some instances, data is passed in the URL under the "RefID" variable which is also stored in the database and attached to each registration. I use the 'mysql_num_rows ($result)' to fetch all agent details on another page but this only returns ALL available details. My goal is as follows: GOAL I want to create an HTML table in which rows are automatically generated based on the list of all registrations on my site. A new row is created IF and ONLY IF a unique RefID is present on that particular record. In the event the field is NULL, it is reported on a single line. In short, the HTML table could look something like this: RefID - Number of Enrollments abc123 - 10 baseball - 11 twonk - 7 NULL - 33 Where abc123 is a particular RefID and 10 is the number of times that RefID appears in the DB. If a new registration comes in with RefID = "horses", a new row is created, showing "horses - 1". The HTML table will be viewable by account administrators needing to see the number of enrollments for a particular RefID (which they won't know ahead of time). Anybody have any suggestions?
