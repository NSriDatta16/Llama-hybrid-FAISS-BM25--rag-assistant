Why predicted values differ among methods?

I am using the dataset Orthodont from nlme to simplify my example. library(nlme) fm1 First, I created the predicted values based on the traditional package stats: # Method 1: Using stats package newdata Second, I obtained the residuals manually and averaged them: # Method 2: Extracting information from model d The residuals from method 1 differed from method 2: merge(newdata, newdata2, by=c("age","Sex")) I am guessing that the problem is the average of the extracted residuals. How could I obtain the corrected predicted values using the manual approach?
