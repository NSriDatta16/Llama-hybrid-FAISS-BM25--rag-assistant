Having a quick look at the wikipedia page I'm not sure what the fit is here with MCMC/Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The models described there look like continuous time Markov chains. If that's right then you can get analytic results, and wouldn't need to resort to MCMC. Essentially the analytic solution is to do the eigendecomposition of Q into $VLV^T$. The pmf of the process at $t$ is, then $p_i(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{4}c_i v_i e^{\lambda_i}$ where the constants, $c_i$ are obtained by solving for some initial probability vector $b$ the equation $Ec=b$. I suspect this has arisen due to some of the terminology being the same. Unless I've misunderstood the question and the wiki reference is just a jumping-off point!
