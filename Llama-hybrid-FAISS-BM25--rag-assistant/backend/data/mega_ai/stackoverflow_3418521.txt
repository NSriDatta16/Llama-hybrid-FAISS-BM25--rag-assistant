Well, here's the simplest answer I can think of: string[] bits = Request.Form["seatsArray"].Split(','); for (int i = 0; i It's not terribly elegant, but it'll get the job done, I believe. You may want this afterwards to finish off the current line, if necessary: if (bits[i].Length % 5 != 0) { sw.WriteLine(); } I'm sure there are cleverer ways... but this is simple. One question: are the values always three characters long? Because if so, you're basically just breaking the string up every 20 characters...
