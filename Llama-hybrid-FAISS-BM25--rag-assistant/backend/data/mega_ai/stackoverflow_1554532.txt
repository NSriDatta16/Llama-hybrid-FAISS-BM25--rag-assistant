Primitive MailMerge using just delimited field names

Obviously the correct way for our app to generate a Word document based on a template is to encourage the admin users (who will look after the templates) to embed the correct merge fields or bookmarks in the template document. However in the past we have found our typical admin user who ordinarily doesn't use MailMerge or any of the other "advanced" features in Word is significantly put off by having to use merge fields. We have tried doing it for them, producing documentation, lots of screenshots etc. But it's all "fiddly" for them. They have dozens of templates (all just different kinds of really simple letters), and will want to modify them reasonably frequently. What they would really like is to be able to just mark fields with a simple delimiter like a curly brace, which effectively marks a homemade merge field to our app (though Word is oblivious to its significance) as in: Dear {CustomerSurname} Then we can just pick up the field(s) with several lines of code as in: w = New Word.Application d = w.Documents.Open(...) Dim mergedContent As String = d.Content.Text mergedContent = mergedContent.Replace("{CustomerSurname}", Customer.Surname) mergedContent = mergedContent.Replace("{CustomerPostcode}", Customer.Postcode) d.Content.Text = mergedContent This feels crude, but beautifully simple (for the end user). Has anyone else gone down this route? Anything wrong with it? We would advise them not to use the "{" and "}" character elsewhere in the normal text of the document, but that's not really a significant limitation. Speed? Wrapping the merge field across two lines? Other problems?
