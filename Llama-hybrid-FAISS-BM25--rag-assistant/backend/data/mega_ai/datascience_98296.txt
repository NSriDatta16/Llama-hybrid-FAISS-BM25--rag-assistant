I do not know the nature of words you have, but you could start with cosine similarity. It is based on the number of common words between 2 sentences/documents. You could then extend this to include syntactically similar words using word embeddings which would translate words into numeric vectors and then perform operations on them. If simple cosine similarity doesn't work, you will have to read about other measures of similarities or word embeddings.
