To answer this: A small side question; is it bad practice to expect that browser will only post the parameters which I expect or there's a chance that browser will post unnecessary/unexpected parameters like in this case. It is a bad idea to trust input coming from an untrusted source, and a user agent on the Internet is an untrusted source. You should assume you can receive: parameters that you expect with values that you expect parameters that you expect with values that you don't expect parameters that you don't expect with values that you don't expect You should also assume that you may not receive the parameters you expect.
