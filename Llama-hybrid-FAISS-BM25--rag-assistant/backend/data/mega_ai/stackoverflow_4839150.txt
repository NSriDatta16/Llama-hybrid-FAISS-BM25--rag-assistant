Just delete that folder (/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.2.1), connect your device again, go to the XCode Organizer and it will ask you to collect the symbols from the device. After a couple minutes it will be done collecting and processing the symbols off the device, and you should be good to go. You can also see this thread for more solutions if this doesn't work.
