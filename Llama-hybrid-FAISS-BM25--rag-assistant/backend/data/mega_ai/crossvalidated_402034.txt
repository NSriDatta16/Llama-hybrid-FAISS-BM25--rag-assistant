Stationary time series but the mean is not constant

I am trying to do time series analysis in R (I am new to the concepts). So first I tried t generate my own synthetic data and check if I am well using the functions in R. I generated a time series data by only taking white Gaussian noise, I took about 100 points. This time series should be stationary, however when I computed the mean and the variance for the first 50 points it is not equal the mean of the second 50 points, doesn't that contradicts the fact that our series is stationary ?
