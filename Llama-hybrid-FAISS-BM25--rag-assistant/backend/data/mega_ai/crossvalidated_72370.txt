How to perform unsupervised Random Forest classification using Breiman's code?

I am working with Breiman's random forest code ( http://stat-www.berkeley.edu/users/breiman/RandomForests/cc_manual.htm#c2 ) for classification of satellite data (supervised learning). I am using a training and test dataset having sample size of 2000 and variable size 10. The data is classified into two classes, A and B. In supervised learning mode, the algorithm is performing well with very low classification error ( DESCRIBE DATA 1 mdim=10,ntrain=2000,nclass=2,maxcat=1, 1 ntest=2000,labelts=1,labeltr=1, SET RUN PARAMETERS 2 mtry0=3,ndsize=1,jbt=500,look=100,lookcls=1, 2 jclasswt=0,mdim2nd=0,mselect=0,
