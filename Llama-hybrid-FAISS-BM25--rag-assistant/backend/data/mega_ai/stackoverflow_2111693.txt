"I can try an enforce this in the front end, but I would really prefer a way in the database to enforce this constraint." The only existing DBMS that can do this for you, is my own : http://shark.armchair.mb.ca/~erwin Constraining aggregations (and doing it at the highest possible level of efficiency/performance) is (and I'm putting it mildly) one of the more trickier problems in constraint enforcement, and there is not a single person in the world except I who knows how to do it. You can believe me or not, you can find me arrogant or not, but what I'm telling you is that you won't be getting "a way in the database to enforce this constraint" from any of the major DBMS vendors in any of the earliest decades to come. They don't have a clue and it is even a fact that they don't really care about this problem. If you're stuck with the crap DBMSs from the majors, read the other solutions and implement something like "just mark records as not adding to 100% and refusing to apy commisions until the problem is manually cleared up.".
