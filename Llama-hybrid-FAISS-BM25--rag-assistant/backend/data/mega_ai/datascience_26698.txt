Classification of jumbled images

I want to be able to create a model that would be able to classify an image that has been split into 9 parts and jumbled around. I did see a paper on it but it is quite old (7-8 years old). Could anyone point me towards any resources? Is building a CNN the best approach? Any help is appreciated.
