How can I prevent the googlebot from crawling Ajaxified Links?

I've got a bunch of ajaxified links that do things like vote up, vote down, flag a post - standard community moderation stuff. Problem is that the googlebot crawls those links, and votes up, votes down, and flags items. Will adding this to robots.txt prevent the googlebot from crawling those links? Or is there something else I need to do? User-agent: Googlebot Disallow: /item/*/flag/ Disallow: /item/*/vote/ Thanks! EDIT: changed method to post and googlebot is still flagging posts. syntax is: any thoughts?
