How can the xor function be formed with a single hidden layer of neural network?

I was recently viewing Andrew Ng's deep learning specialization lectures and I came forward to the following image It is pretty obvious how the above function( x1 XOR x2 XOR x3..... XOR xn) can be implemented using multiple layers of a neural network. Ng told in the lecture that it is also possible to implement the above function using just a single hidden layer of NN. Is it possible ? If so , how? Also , what will be the time complexity difference between a single hidden layer of NN vs multiple layers of NN for the above function?
