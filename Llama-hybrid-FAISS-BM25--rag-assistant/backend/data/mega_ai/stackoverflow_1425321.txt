Performance Since you have 100,000 lines of code, executing the code on a VM that is 10x faster (as adobe says) will definitely enhance performance. But how is the performance of the current app? if it's good enough, then you really shouldn't consider this pro. Maintainability and Reusability If the current code base is hard to maintain and is not reusable then it needs refactoring, not rewriting in a new language. AS3 does encourage coding practices that helps in maintainability and reusability, but that doesn't mean you and your team will follow them. It is also possible that with AS3 you will end up with a code base that is hard to maintain. It is also possible to refactor your AS2 code in a maintainable and reusable manner. New Technology I believe this is the only real pro here. Flex/AS3 is a new technology. It's a nice and clean one. A lot of people are strongly supporting it. Adobe is pushing everyone to switch from AS2 to AS3. It will become harder and harder to hire new AS2 developers. There will be less development tools that support AS2. And my guess you will have to make the switch sooner or later. So, IMO, with all the pros and cons everyone listed here, you need to let your client understand that this has to be done sooner or later if you are going to keep updating the app regularly. And I think you shouldn't rush doing that.
