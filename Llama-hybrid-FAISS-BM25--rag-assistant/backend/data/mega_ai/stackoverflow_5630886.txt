Are you bug tracking or project planning? FogBugz has better bug tracking features. FogBugz has better e-mail integration, state tracking and triggers. FogBugz is easier to drill down to an individual task without needing to apply a lot of filters. For project planning, however, OnTime is the superior tool. The monte carlo estimation feature in FogBugz is cool--don't get me wrong--but honestly, getting the project entered into FogBugz so you can actually use the estimator is such a pain in the rear it can be downright frustrating. The scrum planning board in OnTime is really sexy. If you're used to using whiteboards or sticky notes, it's a breeze to enter and visualize. OnTime provides better project overview information and custom reporting; this is better for managers. FogBugz provides better drill-down information; this is better for implementers. FogBugz has more features; this is better for tech-centric users. OnTime is more graphical; this is better for non-engineers (project planners, artists and other people who often have to use scheduling tools). Other factors: Some people have mentioned speed issues. I haven't noticed speed issues with either, but my only experiences have been local installs. OnTime is expensive for mid-sized teams; it's free for a single user and by the time you get to 10+ users the price is average, but for 3-6 man teams it's expensive especially if you want the pivot charts. Quite honestly if you can afford it, it would not be stupid to consider both. Use OnTime for writing quotes, and FogBugz for tracking defects. They are radically different tools, and neither one excels in all areas but both are very good at select tasks.
