Interaction Term Interpretation

I am working through the ISLR book and wanted help with an exercise question since the solutions are not provided in my copy. 3.7 Exercises: 3 - Suppose we have a data set with five predictors, $X_1$=GPA, $X_2$=IQ, $X_3$=Gender (0 for Male, 1 for Female), $X_4$=Interaction between GPA and IQ, and $X_5$=Interaction between GPA and Gender. The response is starting salary afer graduation. Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get $\hat{\beta}_0$=50, $\hat{\beta}_1$=20, $\hat{\beta}_2$=0.07, $\hat{\beta}_3$=35, $\hat{\beta}_4$=0.01, $\hat{\beta}_5$=-10. Which answer is correct, and why? i. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, males earn more on average than females. ii. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, females earn more on average than males. iii. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, males earn more on average than females provided that the GPA is high enough. iv. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, females earn more on average than males provided that the GPA is high enough. My answer: I first think of the full formula of the regression equation: $Salary \approx 50 + 20(GPA) + 0.07(IQ) + 35(Gender) + 0.01(GPA)(IQ) - 10(GPA)(Gender)$ This means that the effect that GPA has on starting salary is complicated. For a male it seems simple, start with 50k and each GPA point adds 20k, and IQ points add a bit. But for females there's a negative takeaway of added GPA. Yes it adds 20k but it also takes away 10k. And an extra 35k is added to the female salary. I don't know what to make of this result. If I had to guess, I would say the answer is 3. But the interactions are confounding. Any help is appreciated.
