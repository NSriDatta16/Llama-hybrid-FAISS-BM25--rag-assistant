I don't think that there is a single feature selection method that works best with a specific algorithm, what they do is selecting the best features based on various criteria. These features can be useful or not to the algorithm that does the classification, regardless what this algorithm is. Without knowing anything about your data or their distribution, you can simply try a lot of those methods to see which produces the best results, and see if these generalize with the test set. Also, SVM itself can be used for feature selection, since it finds the optimal coefficient for each feature. I don't know if you can access those coefficients through Weka (sorry, not familiar with the software), but if you could they can be an indicator of how important each feature is.
