Magento: Getting a shipment collection containing only shipments that contain a comment that contains a certain piece of text

I need to query for a collection of order shipments ( Mage_Sales_Model_Mysql4_Order_Shipment_Collection ). I only want to see the order shipment on which a comment has been written that matches a certain piece of text. In non-EAV SQL, it would look something like this: SELECT shipments.id FROM shipments JOIN comments ON ( shipments.id = comments.shipment_id AND comments.content IN('Possible comment', 'Another possible comment') ) GROUP BY shipments.id Obviously I want to use Magento's native model methods to accomplish it: $shipments = Mage::getResourceModel('sales/order_shipment_collection') ->addAttributeToSelect('*') // ?? // ?? ->load(); Is this possible?
