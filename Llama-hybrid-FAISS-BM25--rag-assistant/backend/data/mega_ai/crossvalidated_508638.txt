Actually that plot is kind of an approximation of your sample data. If you run the code below you will get a much more intuitive version of your case. truehist(df[which(df["Key"]=="one"),"Value"], prob=TRUE, col="lightblue", nbins=15) lines(density(df[which(df["Key"]=="one"),"Value"])) abline(v = 0, col="red", lwd=3) The resulting plot is: You could interpret the probability of a value in time series "one" being negative as $P(X where $n$ is the number of negative data points in time series "one". The same idea can be applied to the time series "two".
