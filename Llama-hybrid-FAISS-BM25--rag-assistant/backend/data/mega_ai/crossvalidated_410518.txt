These techniques are not exclusive, and they can be complimentary. PCA is a dimension reduction technique. The number of dimensions in your dataset corresponds to the number of observations you have per case. For example, imagine your data is survey data, and you administered a 100 item questionnaire. Each individual who completed the questionnaire is represented by a single point in 100 dimensional space. The goal of PCA is to simplify this space in such a way that the distribution of points is preserved in fewer dimensions. This simplification can help you to describe the data more elegantly, but it can also reveal the dominant trends in your data. A great explanation of PCA can be found here: Making sense of principal component analysis, eigenvectors & eigenvalues Hierarchical linear regression is used to determine whether a predictor (or set of predictors) explains variance in an outcome variable over and above some other predictor (or set of predictors). For example, you may want to know if exercising (IV1) or eating well (IV2) is a better predictor of cardiovascular health (DV). Hierarchical linear regression can help answer this question. If your data is complex (i.e. you have many variables) you can apply PCA to reduce the number of variables/find the "latent variables". These latent variables can then be used in the hierarchical linear regression. Best of luck!
