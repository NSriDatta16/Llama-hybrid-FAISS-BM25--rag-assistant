jQuery UI Sortable problem on IE6

first question here from me. We have a users customization page which gives them the possibility to relocate different modules () into three different content blocks. There is two space content, and a four space content, then a pool of unused modules to use. I'm using Sortables to be able to drag & drop these modules into place (back and forth the three content divs). I even have the logic to remove items from the contents if their numbers or combined widths exceed the contents available slots/width. All this is working fine in FF3, IE7, Safari ... but, is there a known problem with this library with IE6? I mean, items gets invisible, gets moved to a side when dragged, drops the helper in the wrong place .. and my client has asked specifically to make it work on IE6. Have any one experienced this kind of behaviours before using this library? Thanx in advance. (I would have pasted the code, but all references and variables are in spanish .. i'll translate them if needed)
