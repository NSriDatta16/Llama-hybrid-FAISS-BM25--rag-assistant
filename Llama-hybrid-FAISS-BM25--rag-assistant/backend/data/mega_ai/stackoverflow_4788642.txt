Your choices are: Using CSS3 : background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) . Live Demo Absolutely position two tags on top of each other. One of them is the background, and has the opacity setting. The second one has the text in it, and a transparent background. As you hinted at in your question, you could use a .png file with 30% transparency. I knew I'd read about a way to make the rgba work in IE. See: http://robertnyman.com/2010/01/11/css-background-transparency-without-affecting-child-elements-through-rgba-and-filters/ .alpha60 { /* Fallback for web browsers that doesn't support RGBa */ background: rgb(0, 0, 0); /* RGBa with 0.6 opacity */ background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6); /* For IE 5.5 - 7*/ filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#99000000, endColorstr=#99000000); /* For IE 8*/ -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#99000000, endColorstr=#99000000)"; }
