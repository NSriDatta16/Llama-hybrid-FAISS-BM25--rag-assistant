Fairly simple, though not exactly efficient. This function will hide any anchor that has p_text inside it. Simply call hide('Find my Location') to accomplish what you want. var hide = function(p_text, p_elem) { var elem = (p_elem) ? p_elem : document, anchors = elem.getElementsByTagName('a'), i = 0; for (i = 0; i = 0) { anchors[i].style.display = 'none'; } } } As for the user-agent, feature detection is the way to go, but if you're not browser-detecting to use different features, you may have to actually sniff the UA. Feature detection is great. It really is. When you're using the features you're detecting. But user-agent sniffing has its place, and this may be one of those cases. [waits for the flame] Edit: Added optional "p_elem" argument. If you have a container element, you can search that element only by calling hide('Find my Location', containerElement) where containerElement is a DOM node.
