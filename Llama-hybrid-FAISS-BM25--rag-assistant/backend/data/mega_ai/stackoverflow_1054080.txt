CSS Image Gallery Float BUG

This is new one, I'm having problem with an Archive page i've made. It seems like a fairly straight forward floated div image gallery... but for some reason the there's a bunch of line breaks randomly throughout the divs. I thought it may have been a problem with Cufon or IE.JS etc but I disabled all JS and it still bugs out. Seems a bit long to post the code here, and I've thrown a bunch of unnecessary divs and clear fixes in but nothing seems to be working. I'll post and organize a proper report after I've figured it out.
