You can make this much easier on yourself by doing: #!/bin/bash cat /myspecialdir/foo > /httpd/foo.html printf "Location: /foo.html\n\n"; This sends a header to the browser telling it to redirect to /foo.html instead of having to load and parse the tags. Edit: You should only send 1 \n at the end of each header. After the entire request, you send 2 of them, like this (broken out for clarity): #!/bin/bash cat /myspecialdir/foo > /httpd/foo.txt printf "Pragma-directive: no-cache\n"; printf "Cache-directive: no-cache\n"; printf "Cache-control: no-cache\n"; printf "Pragma: no-cache\n"; printf "Expires: 0\n"; printf "Location: /foo.txt\n"; printf "\n"; (Also note that the Content-Type header isn't included)
