Multi-level Bayesian hierarchical regression using rjags

I am trying to to implement a Bayesian hierarchical Model in R. I have a few predictor variables (2 metric and one categorical) and am trying to predict quarterly home sales in the US. Each sales observation is for a state that is a member of a region, which in turn make up the population as a whole. I am using the rjags package. I want to implement the model so that the coefficients for individual states are drawn from distributions determined by their region, which in turn are determined by the population. Essentially, I want to model this as a three-level hierarchy. However, I only understand how to implement the two-level hierarchy, i.e., state-level coefficients are a function of the population. I have prepared an example that highlights my question and (hopefully) provides a framework for an answer. Below is my code that generates dummy data and implements my model. I would appreciate any insight into how to accomlish this as well as other suggeestions on how to improve my code, model structure, or anything else. # load rjags for modeling library(rjags) # data Nregion
