Sure sounds like firewall issues. Try stopping iptables, and running again. Also, RALUS can dump a log file - which may give some more to go on. I use the older UNIX agent myself, which uses port 6101 IIRC - but I believe that the newer client uses tcp/10000 for control and 1024-65535 for transfer. Last resort is to fire up a network sniffer. ;)
