In general you need to think about how your data behave. If your data depends on its neighbours, CNN could be a solution. If itâ€™s like a sequence and closely relate to its neighbours then RNN could be good. If you instead see you need longer memory across, then LSTM is required. So it all depends on what you are working on.
