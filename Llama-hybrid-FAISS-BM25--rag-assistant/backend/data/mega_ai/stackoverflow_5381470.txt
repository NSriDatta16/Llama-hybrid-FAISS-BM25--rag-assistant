This depends solely on the packer and the algorithms its using pack and/or virtualize code. Seeing as you are using ollydbg, i'd suggest checking out tuts4you, woodmanns and openrce, they have many plugins (iirc there is one designed for finding oep's in obfuscated code, but i have no clue how well it performs) and olly scripts for dealing with unpacking various packers (from which you may be able to pick up hints for a certain type of packer), they also have quite a few papers/tutorials on the subject as well, which may or may not be of use. PC Guard doesn't seem to get much attention, but the video link and info here should be of help (praise be to Google cache!)
