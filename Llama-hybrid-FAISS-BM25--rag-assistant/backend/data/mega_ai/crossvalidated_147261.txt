The terms supervised classification and semi-supervised classification refer to classification based on machine learning methods. Machine learning models are trained with labeled data or partially labeled data. Supervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms analyze training data and produces inferred functions. And rule-based classification are considered to belong to unsupervised classification. No labeled are needed to infer the classification rules mathematically. The "small" dictionary does not provided formal labeled data, and it is also part of the rule-based classification model.
