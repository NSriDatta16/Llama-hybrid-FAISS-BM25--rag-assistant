sorry to be late on this - I am interested in the alternative suggestions of Bland Altman or equivalence of the mean. I would have thought equivalence of the mean was less appropriate as the measuring devices might well measure the same on average but one measures low when the other measures high and vice versa so they don't agree at all. I agree this is an extreme example but even so we can have poor agreement of the paired values but overall equal means. In such a case the SD of the differences would be high but with a big enough sample size equivalence of means can be shown.
