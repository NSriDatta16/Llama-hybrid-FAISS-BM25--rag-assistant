Your procedure works if the group sizes are equal. If they are not then you need $$ \frac{n_1 \bar{x_1} + n_2 \bar{x_2}}{n_1 + n_2} $$ where $n$ is a sample size and $\bar{x}$ is a mean. But note that if you use this as a moderator in your meta-regression it is only an ecological analysis, you are looking at the effect of being enrolled in a study of people of a certain average age not the effect of age itself.
