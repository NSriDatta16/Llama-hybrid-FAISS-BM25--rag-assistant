(iphone) how to set view.center when detaching a view from scroll view and adding it to another view?

I'd like to move a view from a scrollview to a uiview. I'm having trouble changing it's center(or frame) so that it remains in the same position in screen (but in a different view, possibly the superview of scrollview). How should I convert the view's center/frame? Thank you. EDIT: CGPoint oldCenter = dragView.center; CGPoint newCenter = [dragView convertPoint: oldCenter toView: self.navigationView.contentView]; dragView.center = newCenter; [self.navigationView.contentView addSubview: dragView]; I can also use (NSSet*) touches since i'm in touchesBegan : I was having hard time to make it work but the doc wasn't so clear to me.
