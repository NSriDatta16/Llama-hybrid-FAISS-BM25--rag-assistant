How to interpret insignificant intercept in logistic regression with orthogonal polynomial encoding

I have conducted a logistic regression. Model The dependent variable is binary (1,0) The sole independent variable is ordinal with 3 levels. I've included the relevant parts of the summary below. coef se(coef) Chisq p (Intercept) -0.05 0.36 0.023 0.87 C.L 1.6 0.74 6.67 0.009 C.Q -0.2 0.51 0.31 0.57 Please note here L and Q refer to linear and quadratic effects. This is a polynomial contrast. The independent variable is ordinal with 3 levels low How can I interpret this summary? As I understand it the log odds of a "success" linearly increase by 1.6 with the independent variable "C". However what are the log odds of a success when my independent is at its lowest level, if the intercept is insignificant? EDIT to include info from comment > contr.poly(3) .L .Q [1,] -7.071068e-01 0.4082483 [2,] -7.850462e-17 -0.8164966 [3,] 7.071068e-01 0.4082483 EDIT 2 More info from comments > head(Data) C A 1 Medium 0 2 Medium 0 3 High 1 4 High 1 5 Medium 1 6 Medium 0 #note C is 3 levels - Low, medium, high. Low simply isn't shown at the top of the dataframe.
