101 Rx Examples

EDIT: Thanks for the link to the wiki, I think that since its already started there, its easier to go there to check it out. However the question here is also good, so people who are not around the msdn forums get to know about the wiki and where it is. Short Question: Do you have a Sample of Rx Code that could help people understand it better? Long rambling with hidden question: Now that the Rx framework has been released, I think that many of us are interested in getting the bits and trying them out. Sadly there really aren't many examples out there (after an exhaustive search I'm almost convinced Rx was meant only to do easy Drag on wpf apps). I can't recall exactly where it was that I read or heard (I've been looking at many blogs and videos) that the Rx team seems to be interested in doing the 101 series...when they get enough time to do it... which pretty much sucks for those who want to understand it and play with it now (and I mean, what self-respected developer doesn't feel like a kid with a new toy when a new tech. like this comes up). I've personally been giving a try now, but wow there are some crazy concepts in it... just to have methods names like Materialize and Zip makes me think of Teleporters and stuff from Back to the Future . So, I think it would be nice if the ones with greater understanding, helped to build a collection of examples, ala 101 Linq Examples that goes from basic usage to more complex stuff, and pretty much cover all of the methods and their use, in a practical way (perhaps with a little bit of theory too, specially since these kind of concepts probably required it) I think its great that MS devs take time to give us material like that, but I also think this community is good enough to start building our own material, dont you?
