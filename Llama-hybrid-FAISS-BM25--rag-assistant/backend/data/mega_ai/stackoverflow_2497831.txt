Suggest joomla html editor extension/software

I've started using Joomla 1.5 recently and am using the TinyMCE online WYSIWYG editor that comes with the package to edit articles. I tend to write direct html and javascript rather than use the WYSIWYG functions, I find that after the first time the changes are applied(page updated) most of your html becomes 4-5 separate big paragraphs. Its very hard to find stuff in there cause the content has no formatting -- eg: Psychometric Assessment Emporkommen uses Psychometric assessment as a tool in order to gain insight into a person’s personality and psychological thinking. It can help develop team spirit in t he workplace and assess an individual’s priorities. Plus obviously there is no code highlighting in the editor so you can't figure out what is what. My question is, do you guys know of good(preferably non-commercial) extensions or other softwares or techniques that can make editing html code in Joomla 1.5 articles easier even after applying changes several times.
