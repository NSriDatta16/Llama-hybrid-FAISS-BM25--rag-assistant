I am an R user but I think Python is the future (I don't think it's the syntax) Python is the future The benefit of Python is as other people have already mentioned the much wider support, and, for programmers, more logical syntax. Also the ability that you can translate findings from your analysis into a production system is much more straightforward. Maybe it's because of Python being general purpose and R is not but even I raise my eyebrows when I see a productionized R pipeline. But not only that, even for Advanced applications Python is quickly catching up (Scikit-learn, PyBrain, Tensorflow etc) and while R is still the lingua franca in academics on how to implement statistical methods Python has gotten huge in the professional sector due to the advent of advanced specialized libraries. But R is not bad Many people seem to like to jump on the "R has bad syntax" bandwagon. I wish to propose the syntax of R to be a good thing! Assignment functions, lazy evaluation, non standard evaluation and formulas are huge benefits when using R. It just saves so much time not to have to worry about escaping variable names referenced in your summary or how to construct the logic of what is modeled against what or looking at names with names() and then assigning new names by adding . When people complain about R's weird syntax they look at it as a programming language, not as a data science tool. As someone coming from R and loving dplyr I find pandas' syntax a bit clumsy in comparison. Yes it is a bit more flexible, but for most tasks you take a lot more keystrokes to perform a simple command than in R that are merely there to satisfy Python's parser, not to express your idea. In summary Of course it is wise to know both and while Python is getting there R's domain specific design choices just make it simpler for ad hoc work. The huge drawback of R is that it's difficult to leave its domain, which you basically have to do once you try to implement your findings in a sustainable way.
