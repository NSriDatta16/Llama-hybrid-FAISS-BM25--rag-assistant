Where's the definitive resource online about how to carry out Agile development?

I want to start Agile practices in a team. I'm assuming the information is available for free online about how to specifically carry it out. Online I can locate the manifesto, the alliances and corporations involved but where is the actual central guide or root instruction set about how to do it? (Maybe the practices themselves are more ethereal or subjective than I expect and it's found in multiple places?) Edit to summarize solutions: Agile is a concept so that's what's to be found online about it. However specific processes or methods of Agile development have been created like Scrum and Extreme programming to provide concrete solutions to teams who want to adopt Agile and reap its proposed benefits. Find the shoe (or method) that fits best. Maybe create it. If looking for solutions online to implement Agile development in your organization or for your project, seek out the specific methods too and decide among them.
