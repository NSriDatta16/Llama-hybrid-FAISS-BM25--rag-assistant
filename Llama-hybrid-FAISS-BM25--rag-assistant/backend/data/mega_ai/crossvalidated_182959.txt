How to unmix a known combination of signals to obtain principal components?

I am working on Principal Component Analysis as part of my project. I am constructing 3 sinusoidal signals with white Gaussian noise added to it and creating 3 more signals by linear combination of the constructed signals. I have to use Matlab PCA command to and need to unmix the signals and remove the noise. Kindly please provide an example or any reference code to unmix the combined signals using Matlab PCA command.
