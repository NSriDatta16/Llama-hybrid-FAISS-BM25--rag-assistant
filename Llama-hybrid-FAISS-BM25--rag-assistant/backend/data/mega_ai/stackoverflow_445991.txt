If you check the Views\Web.Config you will notice that all HTTP requests will be passed of to the System.Web.HttpNotFoundHandler. You can of course "hack" your way out of it by modifying this (of course strongly discouraged!), but another issue you might experience is that your "CSS" request could risk being mapped to a controller action (depending on your routes and web server setup) so that you would also have to modify the routes collection on global.asax.cs All in all: to make you get to where you want you would have to (heavily) modify the way ASP.NET MVC is working/structured which is probably not a good idea...
