I guess you know that the kernel for logistic regression is a non parametric one, so first of all you have that restriction. Regarding the R package the one I know and works pretty well is np : Nonparametric kernel smoothing methods for mixed data types This package provides a variety of nonparametric (and semiparametric) kernel methods that seamlessly handle a mix of continuous, unordered, and ordered factor data types. Regarding the state of the art kernell I can recomend to experiment with the ones described in this paper from 2009. Read it carefully to choose the one that is best and more actual for you.
