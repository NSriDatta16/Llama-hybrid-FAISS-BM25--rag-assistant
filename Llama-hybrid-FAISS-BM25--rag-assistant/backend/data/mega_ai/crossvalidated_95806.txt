How to whiten the data using principal component analysis?

I want to transform my data $\mathbf X$ such that the variances will be one and the covariances will be zero (i.e I want to whiten the data). Furthermore the means should be zero. I know I will get there by doing Z-standardization and PCA-transformation, but in which order should I do them? I should add that the composed whitening transformation should have the form $\mathbf{x} \mapsto W\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$. Is there a method similar to PCA which does exactly both these transformations and gives me a formula of the form above?
