It sounds like you have common business logic, that applies the your organization in general, and more specific logic per section or department. You could set up your code in a way so that each dept. only depends on their specific logic, which behind the scenes uses any generic functionality in the "base" logic. To that end, you could set up the following projects: Business.BLL Business.Finance.BLL Business.IT.BLL (etc, ad infinitum, and so on...) Note that each of these can be a separate project, which compiles to its own assembly. A department would only need to use their own assembly. As far as data access goes, you can have generic data access routines in your base BLL. Your specific BLLs can have their own specialized data queries that are funnelled to the base BLL, which in turn uses the generic DAL and returns results back up the chain.
