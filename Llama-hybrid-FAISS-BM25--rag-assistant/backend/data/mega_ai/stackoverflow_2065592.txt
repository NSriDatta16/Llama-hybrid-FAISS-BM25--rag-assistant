Alternative to Process.Start()

I'm just finishing off coding a a document storage solution and I've run across the following issue. Within the UI the user can press a button to open a file: try { Process.Start(file); } catch (Exception ex) { //Error handling code } My issue is that if the user has no application associated with the file type a componentmodel exception is thrown with a message to that effect. What I'd rather do is have the "Open with" dialog pop-up in that situation, is there a method call I'm missing?
