Random forest is robust. Think of it as an ML analog to the median. If you remove one point in an ensemble, it doesn't impact the median much. How do you measure your importance? If you have many thousand rows, and a p of 1%, then you might have a problem. I would look at the plot of importances, and cluster within it. It may be that the "important" variable can be, in a moneyball sense, "reconstructed in the aggregate" from other columns that are noisier. Those columns will show up as less important by themselves, but when the most important is missing, they will be brought into play. If you can give a little detail on how you determined importance, that might help.
