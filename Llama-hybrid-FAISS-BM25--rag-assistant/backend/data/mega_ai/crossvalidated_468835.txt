It's not generally a good idea to model interactions without the corresponding "main effects." This page goes in to extensive discussion on the matter. So your first approach, with the full model, is best. With the full model you're not really "missing" those interaction terms. The interaction terms represent the differences from the effects that would be predicted based solely on the coefficients for the main effects themselves. The intercept for that model represents the prediction for condition=0 , size=0 , and stimulus='visual' (the reference level of that factor). The slopes for condition and size are those for stimulus='visual' . The interactions represent the differences from those slopes under the other stimulus values. So all the information you need is included within that model. If there are particular comparisons or predictions that you want to make based on the model, or you want to compare particular scenarios to some type of average response (e.g., comparing each stimulus type to the average among all stimulus types for some values of size and condition ), the simplest approach would be to learn to use software that does that for you based on the model you have built. The emmeans package in R does this quite well, with many worked examples and a package author who visits this site.
