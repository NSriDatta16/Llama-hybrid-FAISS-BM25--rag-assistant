Based on Dan North's initial vision of rbehave and utilizing the behavioral domain specific language (DSL) of Behavior Driven Design (BDD) we created the NBehave framework. The primary goal of NBehave is a framework for defining and executing application requirement goals. These characterizations are modeled after the Behavioral Driven Design (BDD) terms Story, Scenario, Given, When, Then. Relying on a syntax that is lightweight and targeted at product owners (a few "quotes" mostly), the code becomes an executable and self-describing requirements document. The definitions within the actual unit test of the application coupled with the organic nature of the architecture and ubiquity of the domain model translates these concepts into becoming one cohesive amalgam. With the help of Domain Driven Design, the code actually becomes what we have always wanted, living requirements that are constantly asserted on to ensure their viability and accuracy from inception to implementation. Example Code NBehave V0.5, C#, NUnit V2.4.3 using NBehave.Narrator.Framework; using NBehave.Spec.NUnit; [ActionSteps] public class UserLogsInSuccessfully { // some code to setup _currentPage // ... [Given("I am not logged in")] public void LogOut() { _currentPage.click("logout"); } [When("I log in as $username with a password $password")] public void LogIn(string username, string password) { _currentPage.click("login"); } [Then("I should see a message, \"$message\"")] public void CheckMessage(string message) { _currentPage.ToString().ShouldContain(message); } } Along with a scenario: Given I am not logged in When I log in as Morgan with a password SecretPassw0rd Then I should see a message, "Welcome, Morgan!" And running the sceanrio as: >NBehave-Console.exe NameOfDll.dll /sf=user_logs_in_successfully.feature Produces the following output: NBehave version 0.4.5.183 Copyright Â© NBehave 2007-2009 All Rights Reserved.
