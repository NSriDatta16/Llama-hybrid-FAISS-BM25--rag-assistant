Deleting/Removing Group in Xcode

I seem to be having a very odd problem with my iPhone project in XCode4. By accident, I seem to have dragged a new group I created out of my main project group: When I try to move the group back into the project group, XCode crashes. When I try to delete the group by dragging it to the trash can, no such luck either. Is this because it's an iPhone project, and I somehow have messed up the entire directory of groups?
