You need to learn about texturing. See NeHe's tutorial on the subject as an example. However, that tutorial is a bit old (as is your code, since you use glVertex(), so it might not matter to you right now... :). Anyway, starting from OpenGL 3.1 and OpenGL ES 2.0, you should do it with using GLSL, fragment shaders and samplers instead. See another tutorial for that. It's actually simpler than learning all the fixed function stuff.
