It's very common for those '-able' names to be interfaces in Java, but there is no official convention for interface naming that I've found that suggests that '-able' names should be interface names, though typically that is the case. Official Java naming conventions can be found here - it's pretty lean, there really aren't any restrictions for class or interface naming: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-135099.html#367 As to your Throwable question, James Gosling once answered why it's a class rather than an interface, even though the name was more fitting for an interface. Unfortunately, the original article from Sun/Oracle's site has vanished into the internet ether, so I can only provide indirect attribution: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JavaExceptionQuestion http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=58994&tstart=45 edit: Since I continue to get upvotes to this question, I found the link to the Sun discussion via the Wayback Machine , here: http://web.archive.org/web/20071013225816/http://java.sun.com/features/2002/03/gosling.html?source=jdc_news&date=20020430 JDC: Why is Throwable not an interface? The name kind of suggests it should have been. Being able to catch for types, that is, something like try{}catch (), instead of only classes. That would make the Java programming language much more flexible. JG: The reason that the Throwable and the rest of those guys are not interfaces is because we decided, or I decided fairly early on. I decided that I wanted to have some state associated with every exception that gets thrown. And you can't do that with interfaces; you can only do that with classes. The state that's there is basically standard. There's a message, there's a snapshot, stuff like that that's always there. and also, if you make Throwable an interface the temptation is to assign, to make any old object be a Throwable thing. It feels stylistically that throwing general objects is probably a bad idea, that the things you want to throw really ought to be things that are intended to be exceptions that really capture the nature of the exception and what went on. They're not just general data structures.
