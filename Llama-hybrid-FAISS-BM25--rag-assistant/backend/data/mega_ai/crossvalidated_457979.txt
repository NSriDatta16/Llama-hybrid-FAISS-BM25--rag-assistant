Misleading Estimated Marginal Means in Zero-inflated Mixed Models

I am working with a number of zero-inflated poisson and nbinomial mixed models (with an offset), but when I produce estimated marginal means from them they are sometimes many orders of magnitude larger than without zero inflation (e.g. 3.0 vs. 0.0052), and are quite unexpectedly high given their actual biological meaning in the system I am studying. Should I be concerned, and if not how should I report these results in a way that draws attention to their estimation from zero inflated data (so that they do not look unnatural in terms of the sample size I'm presenting)?
