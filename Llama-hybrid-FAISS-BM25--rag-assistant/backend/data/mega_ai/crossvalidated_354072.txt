How to deal with semi-discrete regressors?

I've aggregated a dataset based on some research I've done regarding Battery Electric Vehicles. Three of my regressors however are throwing me off: Available BEV models in the market, Estimated Average BEV purchase price, and Estimated_Average_purchased_BEV_range. Because these numbers didn't change very often from quarter to quarter, I get QQ-plots that look step-like. I tried including an image, but I'm guessing I can't post images just yet. From my reading, it seems like normalizing discrete variables isn't necessary. I don't think these are truly discrete variables, but since they resemble them should I treat them as such? Thank you, and sorry that I'm terribly confused!
