If you want something of the order of millisecond accuracy (which is comparable to what the linux/unix time would give you) then timeGetTime() is what you need. It returns the number of milliseconds since the system was booted. include mmsystem.h and link against winmm.lib . However, all this would just give you a time value, you'd either need to put in a system() call in between or do something like dump the start time out to a file when called for the first time, and then read it the second time. More pragmatic solutions, which may be more useful depending on your circumstances: Write a batch script to call the program you wish you benchmark and wrap it so that it writes to a file: echo "start" >> log.txt do_my_stuff.exe echo "stop" >> log.txt and then use a tool as the excellent LogExpert to look at the timestamps Install the cygwin tools and use the time that comes with that. If you only need to do this on your own machine, and the benchmark program doesn't require complex setting up (command line parameters, environment variables, etc) then this may be the easiest approach.
