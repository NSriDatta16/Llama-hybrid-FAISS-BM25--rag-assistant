The reason that Crockford et al. discourages the use of ++ / -- is that they introduce side-effects. There is virtually no reason to use i+=1; instead of i++; because both are single statements, but there are lots of reasons to have a statement do only one thing and ++ makes it easy to violate that rule. Discouraging use of ++ means we don't have to keep the distinction between i++ and ++i in our heads. It means we're less likely to try to use them in clever but confusing ways. It's good practice not to use them, imo, for those reasons.
