Giving an NSTextView some padding/a margin

How would I give a NSTextView some padding/a margin to the left? I know how you do it in a NSTextField (by subclassing NSTextFieldCell) but how do you do it in a NSTextView? EDIT: A bit more info: 1. The Text View just has plain text no rich text and no other fancy stuff like a proper text editor (e.g Paragraph insets). 2. Is it possible to use setTextContainerInset: for this?
