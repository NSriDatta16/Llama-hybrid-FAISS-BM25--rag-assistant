Learning to write organized and modular programs

I'm a computer science student, and I'm just starting to write relatively larger programs for my coursework (between 750 - 1500 lines). Up until now, it's been possible to get by with any reasonable level of modularization and object oriented design. However, now that I'm writing more complex code for my assignments I'd like to learn to write better code. Can anyone point me in the direction of some resources for learning about what sort of things to look for when designing your program's architecture so that you can make it as modularized as possible?
