Representation of enums

How do enums work 'behind the scenes' in programming languages? I am guessing that each language has a different way of representing these datatypes. In java you can use the == operator, for example: public class TestEnum { private enum Test { foo, bar } public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(Test.foo == Test.foo); // returns true } } Is an enum type converted to a primitive during the ==? Or is the enum value a Singleton? Does C# leverage enums in the same manner as java? Are database enum types treated differently compared to programming languages?
