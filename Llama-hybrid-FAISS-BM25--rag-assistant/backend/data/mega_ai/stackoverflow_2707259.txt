Without platform information, it's difficult to make a specific recommendation. The general advice is match some string in the User-Agent that tells you it's a mobile browser (probably multiple patterns will be required) and generate a redirect response. EDIT: A google search turns up this very comprehensive page on User-Agent strings for mobile devices. Suffice to say, you probably want to restrict your list of patterns to devices you specifically intend to target, and let the rest fall back to your main site.
