Drag and Drop an object on an image and get location

I'll be starting a new project and I need some help from experienced developers to prevent upcoming problems with the technology. I'll be doing a website which will include image drag and drop on top of another image and get relative position of the moved object (startx,starty,endx,endy). For such a task, I'm in between JQuery and Silverlight. Which one would you go with? I have no experience with any of the languages but I know c#, asp.net have done some Jquery but not enough to make my mind. Thank you.
