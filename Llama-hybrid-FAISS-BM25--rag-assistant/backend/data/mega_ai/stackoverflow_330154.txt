In this case I would consider storing the attachments in some type of temporary storage, be it Session State, a temp directory on the file system, or perhaps a database. Once the bug has been saved, I would then copy the attachments to their actual place. Careful with session though, if you let them upload large attachments you could push memory issues depending on your environment. One approach I saw before was as soon as the user opens the new bug form, a new bug is generated in your database. Depending on your app this may or may not be a good thing. If your collecting data from a user for example, this is useful as you get some intelligence even if they fail to enter the data, and leave your site. You still know they started the process, and whatever else you collected like user agent etc..
