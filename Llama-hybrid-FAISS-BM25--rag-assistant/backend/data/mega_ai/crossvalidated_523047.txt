One approach is a scatter plot matrix with jittering of points given over-plotting of identical values. Refinements might include, depending partly on taste: Bubble plots, where bubble size encodes frequency. Hinton- or Bertin-type twoway bar charts, where bar height encodes frequency. In this case visual patterns can be supported by measures of agreement ( not correlation) such as Lin's concordance correlation: Rating_1 Rating_2 0.633 Rating_1 Rating_True 0.630 Rating_2 Rating_True 0.839
