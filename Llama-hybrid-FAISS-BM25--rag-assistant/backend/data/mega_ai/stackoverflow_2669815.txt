You can also use the CCK Fieldgroup module to create a fieldgroup in the same interface you create new fields. Go to the fieldgroup settings page to make it collapsed by default. Then drag-n-drop fields to be under a given fieldgroup. Fieldgroup is part of the CCK project, just turn it on in the modules page. Using hook_form_alter() is a cleaner solution but technically a bit more difficult.
