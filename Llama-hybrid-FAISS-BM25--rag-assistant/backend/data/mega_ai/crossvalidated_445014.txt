How to set (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q) for SARIMA time series model

I have a time series dataset of monthly average temperature in Cayman from year 1823 to 2013, with dickey-fuller test = 0.008275 (I assume the series to be stationary since the test doesn't exceed 0.05). Link to dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T2dk5ii7Dp7SHxMOyN8L0wZb2xDK3gCM/view?usp=sharing The plot below shows the series: The ACF and PACF plots are shown below: The ACF clearly shows yearly seasonality (12 periods). However, how do I interpret the PACF plot since it changed suddenly from high positive autocorrelation (lag 1) to high negative autocorrelation (lag 2)? I have tried to use first-differencing and second-differencing (in case either one or both are needed), below is the respective ACF and PACF plot: My question is: How to interpret the PACF plot of original time series? Due to the existence of seasonality, I choose to use SARIMAX(p,d,q)(P,D,Q,12) model. I know in Python there is auto_arima model available so that I can get the best hyperparameters. However, if I were to deduce based on ACF and PACF plot (or other plots, if required), how do I set the values of p,d,q and P,D,Q?
