Your problem has nothing to do with IIS. It is a classic database datetime formatting issue. More than 12 gives you the answer: there are only 12 months in the year! So: Do NOT format the date in the "insert code" to anything other than US format, as your database storage will expect the dates in US format. I have seen this time and again with MS Access databases. The simple solution is ALWAYS ensure that the dates you use in your Edit and Insert code have been formatted for US culture, ie, mm/dd/yyyy. Darin Dimitrov is right about the Model Binder practice he mentions. But the more serious issue here is a square peg in round hole one: As Microsoft is a US company, their databases want dates in US format. In MS Access, if the data input goes through a form, you are fine just relying on your PCs culture settings. However, if you insert data using VBA code, you need to explicitly format dates in US format. That is exactly what is happening here.
