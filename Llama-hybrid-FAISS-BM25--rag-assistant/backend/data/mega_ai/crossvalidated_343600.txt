temporal disaggregation time series using regression

I originally posted this question on stackoverflow and was recommended to post here instead. I am trying to derive high frequency data from low frequency data. I also have a number of other related datasets at this higher frequency that I am trying to use to assist with the temporal disaggregation. I am not sure what the best way to approach this is! For example: Suppose you are trying to convert from: annual volume of gas used (for heating) to monthly volume of gas used. You also have temperature, population, etc. on a monthly level. You know that there will be a relationship between these independent variables and the dependent variable that you are trying to estimate at a higher frequency (monthly volume of gas used). Does anyone know the best approach here? For example, can you average/aggregate your independent variables to the lower frequency (say annual level), perform a regression, and then reduce the dependent variable to the higher frequency subject to this relationship ? Any help would be greatly appreciated !
