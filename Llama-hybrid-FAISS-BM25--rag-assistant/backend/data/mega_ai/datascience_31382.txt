Binary classification of every time series step based on past and future values

I'm currently facing a Machine Learning problem and I've reached a point where I need some help to proceed. I have various time series of positional ( x , y , z ) data tracked by sensors. I've developed some more features. For example, I rasterized the whole 3D space and calculated a cell_x , cell_y and cell_z for every time step. The time series itself have variable lengths. My goal is to build a model which classifies every time step with the labels 0 or 1 (binary classification based on past and future values). Therefore I have a lot of training time series where the labels are already set. One thing which could be very problematic is that there are very few 1 's labels in the data (for example only 3 of 800 samples are labeled with 1 ). It would be great if someone can help me in the right direction because there are too many possible problems: Wrong hyperparameters Incorrect model Too few 1 's labels, but I think that's not a big problem because I only need the model to suggests the right time steps. So I would only use the peaks of the output. Bad or too less training data Bad features I appreciate any help and tips.
