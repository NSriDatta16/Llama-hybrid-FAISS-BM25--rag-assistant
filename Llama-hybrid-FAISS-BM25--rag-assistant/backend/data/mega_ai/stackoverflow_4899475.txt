The anser for me was simply delete the debug.keystore file. The default storage location for AVDs is in ~/.android/ on OS X and Linux, in C:\Documents and Settings\.android\ on Windows XP, and in C:\Users\.android\ on Windows Vista. In Eclipse I "cleaned" the project, uninstalled the App and the TestApp from the emulator and - voila everything ran fine again.
