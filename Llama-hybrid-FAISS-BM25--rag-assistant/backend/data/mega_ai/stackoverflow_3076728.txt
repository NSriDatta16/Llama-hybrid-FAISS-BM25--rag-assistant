Trying to build ConnectionKit example (but failing)

I've got the latest(?) ConnectionKit library by doing: svn co http://opensource.utr-software.com/source/connection/tags/1.2.3/ Then went into the dir (1.2.3), opened Connection.xcodeproj with Xcode, set Mac OS X 1.5 | Release | Framework to build the framework -> Build successful. Then went into 1.2.3/Example, opened ConnectionApp.xcodeproj with Xcode, but whatever I do the build fails. All I'm getting is: 'Connection/Connection.h: No such file or directory' on: #import And I'm guessing that the rest of the 43 errors I'm getting are all coming from here. I tried adding the framework but I'm still getting said error - although I'm not sure that I'm doing this right. I tried the following: To use the new method, choose the desired Target (not File Group) and select “Existing Frameworks…” from the “Add” contextual menu. In 3.0 this will give you the same file dialog as before, but in 3.1 it will bring up the Target’s Get Info panel to the General tab. The bottom portion of this pane shows the Target’s Linked Libraries. Clicking the “+” button beneath the list will bring up a list of known frameworks for the active SDK. Also tried dragging and dropping to no avail. Same error. What am I doing wrong?
