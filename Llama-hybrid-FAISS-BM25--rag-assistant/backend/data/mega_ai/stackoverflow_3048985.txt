I'm not a batch file expert, but I think you could: Store repeated paths in variables: set STRINGS="N:\Scripts and Reg Frags\FindEmbededFlashFiles\strings.exe" set OUTFILE=N:\output.txt Replace repeated commands with a FOR loop, e.g.: for /r z:\ %%f in (*.xls *.ppt *.doc *.xlsx *.pptx *.docx) do ( %STRINGS% -q "%%f" | findstr \.swf >> %OUTFILE% ) (Note that this loop also replaces @cd /d "z:\" and the -s parameter of strings.exe.) Disclaimer: I'm writing this off the top of my head, so the suggested code may not work or may need additional fine-tuning. Anyway, I hope this will give you the idea.
