Detecting steps in time series

I've attached a picture of the time series I'm talking about. The top is the original series, the bottom is the differenced series. Each data point is a 5 minute average reading from a strain gauge. This strain gauge is placed on a machine. The noisy areas correspond to areas where the machine is turned on, the clean areas are when the machine is turned off. If you look at the area circled in red, there are anomalous steps in the reading that I would like to be able to detect automatically. I'm completely stumped on how I might be able to do this - any ideas?
