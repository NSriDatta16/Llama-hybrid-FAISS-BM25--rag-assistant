JRuby gem problem

I am trying to run a rails application in Netbeans with JRuby as the underlying Ruby. When I try to run the server, I got an error like this, Missing these required gems: libxml-ruby So I tried installing the libxml-ruby gem, but I cannot install it because its a native version and jruby would not support it. Thats fine. (in /home/braga/prj/eschool/trunk) jruby -S gem install libxml-ruby ERROR: Error installing libxml-ruby: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension. Building native extensions. This could take a while... /home/braga/netbeans-6.9/ruby/jruby-1.5.0/bin/jruby extconf.rb WARNING: JRuby does not support native extensions or the `mkmf' library. Check http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/Home for alternatives. extconf.rb:23: uninitialized constant CONFIG (NameError) So, I had to install an alternative and I installed the libxml-jruby gem. And I started the server again. But still I am getting the following error, Missing these required gems: libxml-ruby
