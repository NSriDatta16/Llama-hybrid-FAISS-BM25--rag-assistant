BIO Tagging : Common tagging format for tagging tokens in a chunking task in computational linguistics. BIO / IOB format (short for inside, outside, beginning) is a common tagging format for tagging tokens in a chunking task in computational linguistics (ex. named-entity recognition). The B- prefix before a tag indicates that the tag is the beginning of a chunk, and an I- prefix before a tag indicates that the tag is inside a chunk. The B- tag is used only when a tag is followed by a tag of the same type without O tokens between them. An O tag indicates that a token belongs to no entity/chunk. You can use flair library ( https://github.com/flairNLP/flair ) to learn your own custom NER model, which is also called sequence tagging in literature.
