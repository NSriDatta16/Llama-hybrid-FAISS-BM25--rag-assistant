I am a bit hesitant to address this question, as I have a conflict of interest and the product is not Open Source (a version of the product is available on the marketplaces of the three major CSPs, though). WURFL is an API that can be used to turn HTTP user-agent strings (and, more generally, HTTP requests) into device properties, a technology generally called (Mobile) Device Detection. With WURFL, data scientists can map user-agent strings to device data and greatly reduce cardinality in the process. Thousands (or even hundreds of thousands) of different UA strings can be translated into a few hundreds make and models. OS, browsers and their respective versions can be consolidated and easily aggregated. Correlations are more easily explored and determined. Of course, variance can be reduced along a whole lot of different dimensions (i.e. all the properties (AKA capabilities) offered by WURFL), not just model, OS and browser. The following article shows a practical example of how WURFL can be used for that purpose from within Python, but all major platforms and programming languages are supported. https://www.scientiamobile.com/wurfl-and-machine-learning/
