The first time I learned the F-test, it was in the context of comparing the variances of two groups, analogous to how a two-sample t-test compares the means of two groups. If we wanted to know if the two groups had unequal variances, regardless of which variance was higher, we would do a two-sided test. If we only wanted to know if one group had higher variance than the other, we would do a one-sided test. The F-test of nested regression models does the same, comparing the variances of the error terms in each model. With that in mind, we are not interested in detecting if the complex model has a larger variance, so we focus all of our attention to the other tail to maximize our power to detect the difference of interest: if the complex model has a smaller variance. Thus, the usual F-test of nested regression models is one-sided.
