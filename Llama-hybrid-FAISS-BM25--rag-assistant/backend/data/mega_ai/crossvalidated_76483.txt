Regression through PCA

I am working with principal component analysis (PCA) to have a regression model. Let's say we have 3 variables that we get every month, and so far we gathered 10 months of data. We have built the PCA on the raw data matrix. p = prcomp(na.omit(rdatat), center=TRUE,scale=TRUE) loadings=p$rotation[] pca=cbind(p$x[,1], p$x[,2], p$x[,3]) Now we can put p$x[,1] as input of the regression and the result will be in the form of $Y=$ intercept$+ K\,$Component1, where $K$ is a coefficient from regression. How can I build Component1 the month after in order to predict $Y$? I have the raw values of the 3 variables I use in PCA, but how can I use them?
