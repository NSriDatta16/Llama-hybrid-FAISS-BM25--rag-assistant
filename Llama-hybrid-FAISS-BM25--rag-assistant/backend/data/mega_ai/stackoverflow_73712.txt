I have only used the Ferret/acts_as_ferret combo (legacy decision) on a client project. I strongly recommend looking at the other options first. aaf is very fragile and can bring your Rails app to a screeching halt if you make a mistake in the config or if for some reason you hit a bug in aaf. In such a case, instead of simply having the search functionality crapping out, any controller action touching an indexed model will completely fail and raise an exception. Which is baaad, hmkay?
