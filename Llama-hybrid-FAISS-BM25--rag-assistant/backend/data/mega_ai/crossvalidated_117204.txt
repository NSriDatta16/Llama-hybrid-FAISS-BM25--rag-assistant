Help with regression

I have a dichotomous variable, "know" and "not know". This refers to a participant knowing the meaning of a word or not. Then I have another variable as "fixation duration" which is continuous. I want to know if participants have higher fixation durations (look more) on the words whose meaning they do not know. In other words, I hypothesize that knowing a meaning of a word predicts fixation duration. So my outcome is continuous and the predictor is dichotomous. Which statistical test should I use: linear regression, logistic regression or what?
