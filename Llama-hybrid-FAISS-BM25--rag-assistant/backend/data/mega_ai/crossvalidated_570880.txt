For some link function $g$ , let the GLM model be $ g\left(\mathbb E\left[Y\vert X\right]\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 +\cdots +\beta_px_p $ . When you get an "overall significance: of the model, the standard hypothesis test is: $$ H_0: \beta_1 = \cdots = \beta_p = 0\\ H_a: H_0\text{ is false} $$ When you get an "insignificant" result of this hypothesis test, it means that there is insifficient evidence to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_a$ , so insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of all non-intercept parameters being zero. In your logistic regression, changing a feature by some amount makes no statistically significant change in the log-odds. This is equivalent to saying that the odds ratios are not statistically significantly different from $1$ . $$ \log\left(\dfrac{p_1}{1-p_1}\right) = \log\left(\dfrac{p_2}{1-p_2}\right)\\ \log\left(\dfrac{p_1}{1-p_1}\right) - \log\left(\dfrac{p_2}{1-p_2}\right)=0\\ \log\left(\dfrac{\dfrac{p_1}{1-p_1}}{\dfrac{p_2}{1-p_2}}\right) = 0 \\ \dfrac{\dfrac{p_1}{1-p_1}}{\dfrac{p_2}{1-p_2}} = 1 $$
