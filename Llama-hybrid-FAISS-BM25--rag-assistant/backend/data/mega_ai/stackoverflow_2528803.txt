Adding outlets to UIButton

For quickly mocking up UI, I'd like to be able to drag buttons onto a view in interface builder, then drag a connection from that button to the view that should appear when you click it. A subclass of UIButton is a little inconvenient to use in IB, so I'd prefer to add the behavior to UIButton itself. Unfortunately, it seems like outlets created in a category aren't visible in IB: @interface UIButton (myextensions) { IBOutlet UIView *outletDestination; } @end Can extra outlets be added this way?
