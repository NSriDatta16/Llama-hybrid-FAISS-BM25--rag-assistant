General Best Practices As code quality/readability/maintainability cannot be "benchmarked", I suggest reading books about proper code structuring and best practices. Maybe Code Complete book from Steve McConnell? Consider using Suitable Patterns and Frameworks It's also worth mentioning the use of a well defined pattern like MVC and build your project with some Framework like Zend , as this will encourage you to put each piece of code where it belongs.
