What knoweldge framework supports this type of query?

I have knowledge that is organized as in the example below, where items or nodes can belong to multiple hierarchies and can have arbitrary numbers of children and parents: sports golf baseball tennis equipment golf clubs club1 baseball bats bat1 tennis racket racket1 I need to be able to run queries like "Show me all sports that use clubs or rackets, and their associated equipment." The queries do not need to be posed in natural language, but the results must be displayed in a hierarchy: sports golf club1 tennis racket1 I'm going crazy trying to figure out what I need. It doesn't seem to quite be a relational database, an ontology, or a taxonomy. Or maybe I don't quite understand how to use one or more of those to do what I need. What standard approach is most similar to what I'm trying to do? As always with stackexchange questions, I'm utterly terrified of asking a question that doesn't fit the exact requirements of a particular forum. I tried to make it as specific and answerable as possible. I BEG YOU PLEASE, do not delete or lock this question without at least explaining why it is unacceptable or offering a suggestion for making it acceptable. Thank you!
