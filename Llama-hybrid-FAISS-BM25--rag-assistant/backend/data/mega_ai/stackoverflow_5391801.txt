Change VisualStudio Auto-generated Code

I have created myself a new TextBox control which inherits from the default System TextBox. If I add a datasource to my designer and in the DataSource view I can see my new text control in the list of controls I can drag onto the designer. My Issue is when I drag the control onto the designer VS goes and creates the following code. this.someValueTextEdit1.DataBindings.Add(new System.Windows.Forms.Binding("EditValue", this.myViewModelBindingSource, "SomeValue", true)); I instead would like it to use some custom code when I drag the control onto the designer. If your wondering why I want to do this, is so I can change the binding so that it uses linq and expression trees rather than string property values. Something like Bind(this.someValueTextEdit, c => c.EditValue, v => v.SomeValue);
