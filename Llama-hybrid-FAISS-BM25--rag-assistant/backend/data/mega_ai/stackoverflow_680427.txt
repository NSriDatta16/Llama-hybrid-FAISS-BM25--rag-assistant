Wrap your panel container in a wrapper element that has fixed positioning, e.g. Header Hello, this is my awesome panel. Footer Construct your panel without the fixedcenter configuration property, and center the panel immediately after you render it, e.g. var panel = new YAHOO.widget.Panel("parameters", { constraintoviewport: true, underlay: "shadow", visible: false, close: true, draggable: true, width: "350px" }); panel.render(); panel.center(); The panel should now stay in the same position when the window is scrolled. I only tested this in Firefox 3.0 and Internet Explorer 7 and 8. I've posted the source of a self-contained example that will demonstrate this working.
