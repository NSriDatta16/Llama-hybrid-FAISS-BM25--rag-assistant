A lot of the functionality provided by google-gears is becoming part of html5 - firefox has implemented local storage since 3.5. Modernizr provides api detection - but not abstraction - I imagine there may be some out there on the internet (Google Gears / HTML5 has only recently appeared on my radar). So far I've not found any way for an html5 app to create a desktop shortcut though.
