I don't think there is a way to make the thread live longer on a shared host where you don't have access to the cf admin. I think the cf admin limit always overrides the cfsetting requesttimeout value when it's activated, so I think your hands are pretty much tied on that front. My advice would be to change the strategy from creating all the PDFs within the current page to instead launching another request for each PDF that needs to be created. Non-displaying iframes while inelegant may be the simplest solution. You can simply output one iframe for each PDF that needs to be generated and that way it should never run into the timeout issue since each individual PDF should generate within the time limit set by the host.
