rails 3 json custom json formatting

I have a collection of @clients with attributes id and email I want to render this json format [ {"id":" 1","label":"johndoe@yahoo.com","value":"1"},{"id":" 2","label":"paulsmith@gmail.com.com","value":"2"} ] in clients_controller I defined the following method def search @clients = Client.where(:user_id => current_user.id).select('id','email') render :partial => "clients/search" end and here is the view _search.json.erb [ ] this is working, but I found it fugly...is there a more elegant way to generate a custom json format in a view?
