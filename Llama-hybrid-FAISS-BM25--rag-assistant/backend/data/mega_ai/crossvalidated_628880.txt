rank-sum test vs. anova

I have a set of data looks like this: hwid freq code output 101 5150 764 24 101 5170 768 24 101 5190 764 24 102 5150 752 24 102 5170 760 24 ... ... ... 24 The data represents "power level" (decibel) of the radio transmitter hardware, where hwid column identifies the hardware, freq is the frequency of transmission in MHz, and code represent the "instruction" for a specific hardware to emit the desired dB level, which is the output column. We have to test 24 frequency points for every hardware unit, which is very time consuming. The idea now is trying to find out "patterns" via statistical methods so that we can just test a few frequency points and guess the code for all 24 points for a specific unit. For example, at 5190MHz, a unit's code is 10% above average, can we assume that for all frequency points that unit is 10% above average? Apparently that is too simplified and virtually can't be true. But what if we can also found out the relationship between error and frequency and use it as function to calculate codes? The above is background of my question (to avoid X-Y problem ). For now, what I am doing is trying to find out: whether the difference in code has some relationship with frequency, or they are purely random ? I extract the code for every frequency point into multiple series, so there are 24 series. Then I try to use rank-sum test for every two of them and found that some frequencies are different and some are not... i.e. I try to "cluster" the frequency points into groups so that I can reduce the actual tests required. I have two questions for now: Of course I am just doing some research trying to get something out of raw data. If you have any suggestion for the original problem, I am very appreciated to hear. Just for the sake of my little test, I learned that rank-sum test are only for two data series, while for more than 2, we should use "ANOVA". Is that true? If so, the null-hypothesis for (one-way) ANOVA is that the mean of all samples are same, or, they come from the same big population. What else can ANOVA do? Can it tell me the outlier, for example: series a,b,c are same while series d differs from them, etc.
