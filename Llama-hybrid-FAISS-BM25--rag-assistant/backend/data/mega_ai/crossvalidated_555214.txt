How to combine NER with sentiment when fine-tuning BERT

I'd like to fine-tune Google's BERT model for entity-level sentiment, similar to Google's Natural Language API ( demo ). I'm using a sample fine-tuning Colab implementation found here . My current approach is to fine-tune BERT for span detection along with its property by creating tag subclasses with labelled sentiments. Here's the first sentence: | | Sentence # | Word | POS | Tag | |---:|:-------------|:--------------|:------|:------| | 0 | Sentence: 1 | Thousands | NNS | O | | 1 | nan | of | IN | O | | 2 | nan | demonstrators | NNS | O | | 3 | nan | have | VBP | O | | 4 | nan | marched | VBN | O | | 5 | nan | through | IN | O | | 6 | nan | London | NNP | B-geo | | 7 | nan | to | TO | O | | 8 | nan | protest | VB | O | | 9 | nan | the | DT | O | | 10 | nan | war | NN | O | | 11 | nan | in | IN | O | | 12 | nan | Iraq | NNP | B-geo | | 13 | nan | and | CC | O | | 14 | nan | demand | VB | O | | 15 | nan | the | DT | O | | 16 | nan | withdrawal | NN | O | | 17 | nan | of | IN | O | | 18 | nan | British | JJ | B-gpe | | 19 | nan | troops | NNS | O | | 20 | nan | from | IN | O | | 21 | nan | that | DT | O | | 22 | nan | country | NN | O | | 23 | nan | . | . | O | Where B-geo for London would be -0.3, Iraq -0.1, and British 0.0, where -0.3, -0.1, and 0.0 are arbitrary sentiment values that I assigned. Would appending these sentiment values to Tag be the right approach? The only related question I could find was this , asked 8+ years ago.
