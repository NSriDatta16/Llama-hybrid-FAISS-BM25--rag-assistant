Answering the Right Question ok, the means are different but does that really matter as the distributions share a significant overlap? Any test that asks whether group means are different will, when it works right, tell you whether means are different. It will not tell you that distributions of the data itself are different, since that is a different question. That question certainly depends on the whether the means are different but also on many other things that might be (incompletely) summarised as variance, skew, and kurtosis. You correctly note that certainty about where the means are depends on the amount of data you have to estimate them, so having more data will allow you spot mean differences in more nearly overlapping distributions. But you wonder whether such as small p-value is really representative of the data Indeed it is not, at least not directly. And this is by design. It is representative (approximately speaking) of the certainty you can have that a particular pair of sample statistics of the data (not the data itself) are different. If you wanted to represent the data itself in a more formal way than simply showing the histograms and testing moments of it, then perhaps a pair of density plots might be helpful. It rather depends really on the argument you are using the test to make. A Bayesian Version In all these respects, Bayesian difference 'tests' and T-tests will behave the same way because they are trying to do the same thing. The only advantages I can think of for using a Bayesian approach are: a) that it will be easy to do the test allowing possibly different variances for each group, and b) that it will focus on estimating the probable size of the difference in means rather than finding a p-value for some test of difference. That said, these advantages are pretty minor: e.g. in b) you could always report a confidence interval for the difference. The quote marks above over 'tests' are deliberate. It is certainly possible to do Bayesian hypothesis testing, and people do. However, I would suggest that the comparative advantage of the approach is in the focus on building a plausible model of the data and communicating its important aspects with appropriate levels of uncertainty.
