(Rails) Managing USER PREFS with a MASTER PREFS fallback...?

I'm looking for a mechanism by which to facilitate user preferences. I also want to have a set of "master" prefs that are used if the currently logged in user doesn't have a specific pref set. I see several questions similar to this, but they seem to get into theory instead of simply proposing a quality solution. Basically I'm looking for input on management as well as storage -- models, controllers, etc. Initially I was considering simply going with a normalized table of 50+ columns (for performance etc.). However, I plan on adding various, unknown preferences in the future and, performance aside, I could imagine multiple columns getting out of hand. Thoughts?
