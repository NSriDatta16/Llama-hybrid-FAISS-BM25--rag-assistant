The dll should go in the /bin directory, one down from where the aspx page is. Also, the name of the project doesn't necessarily correspond to the name of the assembly. If you right-click the project and go to properties, you can change the assembly name. Thirdly, (and not directly related to the issue at hand, but good to know nonetheless), the solution name and the class name have nothing to do with one another. In fact, the solution has nothing to do with the actual output of the build; it is strictly to help you organize projects (which become assemblies) logically while developing.
