An error in the gradient of marginal likelihood in "Gaussian Processes in Machine Learning"?

Could there be a mistake in Rasmussen & Williams 2006: Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning? It seems to me that ${\partial W \over \partial \hat{f_i}} = - \frac{\partial^3}{\partial f^3_i}\log p(y|\hat{f})$ , so the minus sign in the last term should change to +. Or am I wrong?
