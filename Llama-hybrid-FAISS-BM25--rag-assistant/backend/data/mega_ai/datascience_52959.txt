When is bias set to False?

I have been working with DC-GAN to generate pairs of images based on WGAN paper . For which I referred fastai notebook on WGAN where the bias in the network has been set to False . Jeremy Howard in his video regarding the notebook asked the viewers to figure out the reason which remains unsolved for me. Please explain why the bias has been set to False and when should bias be set to False .
