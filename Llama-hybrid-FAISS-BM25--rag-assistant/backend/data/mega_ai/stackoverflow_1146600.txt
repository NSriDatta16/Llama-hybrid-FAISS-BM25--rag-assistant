I would suggest trying the following code: vec = ...(the 100-element vector of digital values)... dur = ...(the time required to collect the above vector)... edges = find(diff(vec)); % Finds the indices of transitions between 0 and 1 period = 2*mean(diff(edges)); % Finds the mean period, in number of samples frequency = 100/(dur*period); First, the code finds the indices of the transitions from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. Next, the differences between these indices are computed and averaged, giving the average duration (in number of samples) for the lengths of zeroes and ones. Multiplying this number by two then gives the average period (in number of samples) of the square wave. This number is then multiplied by dur/100 to get the period in whatever the time units of dur are (i.e. seconds, milliseconds, etc.). Taking the reciprocal then gives the average frequency. One additional caveat: in order to get a good estimate of the frequency, you might have to make sure the 100 samples you collect contain at least a few repeated periods. Functions of interest used above: DIFF , FIND , MEAN
