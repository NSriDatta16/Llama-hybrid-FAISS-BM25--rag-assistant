WP7 Navigation - NullReferenceException

I need to navigate to a certain page the first time my app is run, to gather login details etc. I'm using IsloatedStorageSettings to save a value to determine if this is the first run of the app or not, which works fine. My problem is actually navigating to my 'first run' page when the app is run for the first time, using NavigationService, it seems NavigationService is not created at this point so is still null. When is NavigationService created or how can I work around this? My code (in the constructor of my main page: if ((bool)settings["firstRun"]) { if (NavigationService != null) { NavigationService.Navigate(new Uri("/FirstRun.xaml", UriKind.Relative)); } else { MessageBox.Show("Navigation service must be null?"); //always prompts } } else { InitializeComponent(); }
