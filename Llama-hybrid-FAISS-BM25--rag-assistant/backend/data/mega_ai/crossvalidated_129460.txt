How to combine clinical variables?

I am dealing with several clinically used variables that are not linked to each others. Those variables are correlated to worsened prognosis (some are numeral and asymmetric, therefore correlations were considered using Mann-Whitney-U, others were nominal variables). All of these variables do have statistical significance and some even high sensitivities, specificities and positive predictive values. But as human lives are considered, there's always need for perfection. Therefore, I would like to test several combinations of variables. How do I do that elegantly?
