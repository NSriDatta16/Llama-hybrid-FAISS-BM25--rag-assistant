I'll lead off with the start of the description from the API entry for DataHandler : The DataHandler class provides a consistent interface to data available in many different sources and formats. It manages simple stream to string conversions and related operations using DataContentHandlers. Admittedly, that's not the clearest description. DataHandler has to do with XML and SOAP, which you can see from the the use tab of its API page . Like you, I've used it to represent data about an uploaded file as it's being sent from one web service component to another for processing. The Transferable interface that DataHandler implements is not exactly referring to "transfer" of the kind serialization deals with. It's about transfer of information between separate components in a program, or separate programs, not saving an object for later use. See the API entry for Transferable for more. You'll notice that it links to the Drag 'n' Drop Java Tutorial , which has little to do with DataHandler but does illustrate a use of Transferable .
