As far as I know, the only programatic access to PS 2003 is through PWS. I don't know if it would work, but you could try writing a managed extension for Microsoft Project 2003 (The client application) .There is a managed API for MS Project 2003 , and you might be able to leverage that to communicate with the server, get a project and update it all in code. Good luck!
