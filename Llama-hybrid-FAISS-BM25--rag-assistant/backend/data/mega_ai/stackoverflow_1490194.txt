I believe feedback is stored at the 'screen' level not the 'state' level I suppose you have 3 choices: Instruct your users to list the steps they did before they add their feedback Change your states to different screens instead (they can still look like the same screen for the end user, but in your application they will be different screens) Have your user submit screen shots instead of just .feedback files The second option will allow you to organize your feedback better. In short I think you're expecting more than they offer ;)
