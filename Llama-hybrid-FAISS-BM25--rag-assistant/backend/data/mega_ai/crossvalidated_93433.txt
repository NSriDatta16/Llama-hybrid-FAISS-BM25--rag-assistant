Since this appears to be count data (Poisson) and repeated measures I would use glmer in the lme4 package: d I believe these tests are asymptotic results requiring large sample size. Given that the p-value is so small it doesn't bother me too much, but you could look into bootstrapping methods with the lme4 package to get the p-value. Bootstrap methods also require you to get a good sample of the space of potential values so still might not be great. The best would be to use a Bayesian approach which doesn't make asymptotic assumptions. These are things you might pursue under review... Congratulations on the great results!
