Note that on debug mode the compiler binds many bytes from the stack, on every function, to catch buffer overflow bugs. 0043E003 sub esp, 0E4h ; Edit: the OP Harvey found the pragma that turns on/off stack probes. check_stack Instructs the compiler to turn off stack probes if off (or –) is specified, or to turn on stack probes if on (or +) is specified. #pragma check_stack([ {on | off}] ) #pragma check_stack{+ | –} Update : well, probes is another story, as it appears. Try this: /GZ (Enable Stack Frame Run-Time Error Checking)
