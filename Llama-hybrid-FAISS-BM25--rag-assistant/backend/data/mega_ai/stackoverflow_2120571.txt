Robert Sedgewick's "Algorithms in $language" are a nice source. http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/ And of course, Cormen et. al.'s "Introduction to Algorithms" for a more abstract view http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=11866 Oh, and of course, can't forget Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming", the definitive compendium... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming
