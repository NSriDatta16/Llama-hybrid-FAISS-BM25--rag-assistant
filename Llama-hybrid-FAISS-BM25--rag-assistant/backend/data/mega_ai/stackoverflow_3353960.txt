Spring Build Problem - Can't Find Beans Schema

I'm using Maven2 and Spring 3, when I run my project in Eclipse everything works fine, but when I use assembly:assembly, the resultant jar throws the following Exception: Exception in thread "main" org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanDefinitionStoreException: Line 4 in XML document from class path resource [beans.xml] is invalid; nested exception is org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: cvc-elt.1: Cannot find the declaration of element 'beans'. my beans file looks something like this: this file is stored in src/main/resources my pom.xml has the following dependency for spring: org.springframework spring-context 3.0.3.RELEASE jar compile any ideas why this is happening? how to fix? UPDATE: further probing Google turns out that Spring and Maven don't get on too well with the following in my pom.xml, although no solution is forthcoming: org.apache.maven.plugins maven-assembly-plugin 2.2-beta-5 org.robert.xclades.Main jar-with-dependencies
