Redirect Traffic from NIC to Another NIC On Separate Networks While Using Remoting

The project I'm working on is to handle data capture from scan guns (Pocket PC 2003) and process this data on a host (Win XP) then into our inventory database on a separate server (Win 2000). This is all driven by the Remoting framework provided by MS and As Good As It Gets ( http://gotcf.net ). The application is complete enough for a general proof of concept with both the client and server working properly while in the emulator. All is well until I began to test using actual scan guns. Due to security concerns, the scanners are on a separate network (for clarification the 10 network) than the server (the 15 network). My development machine has dual NIC connected to both networks and can communicate with both independently. However, I am having issues with my application receiving information from the 10 network using .Net Remoting, and then sending out information to the server on the 15 network via a third party app (Combination of ODBC, Btrieve, and OLE). Is there anyway to process information from one network then update the server on another? Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated! Note: I'm not very familiar with networking, thus I may be calling it the wrong name but the gun IP's start with 10. . .* and the server IP's start with 15. . .*
