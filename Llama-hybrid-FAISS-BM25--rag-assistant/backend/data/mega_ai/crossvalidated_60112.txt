Simple method for cluster analysis

One of the academic's at the university where I am studying has conducted research on organisational sustainability. He approached me to turn his research into software that can be used for consulting purposes. The general idea is that the members of an organisation sign up and take the survey online. The survery has 8 dimensions (diversity, innovative potential, conplexity and so on), and each dimension has 10 questions. Each question must be answered on a scale of 1 -5 agree/disagree. There are no averages/totals or calculations taken on the scores. I then need to do a cluster analsysis of some sorts. The requirement is that the number of clusters can be selected, and then a nice diagram is presented showing the clusters, and this will then be used to show if there is divergence/convergence in the organisation, and as a basis for further consulting (i.e remedies if there are clusters of differing values on say diversity). What I need is a suitable simple and mainstream method for the cluster analysis. The academic suggested neural networks but this seemed to be really difficult to use for cluster analysis (statistics is not my major so I am skating on thin ice here). Wikipedia throws up things like K Means and so on, but I am too green in stats to decide what is what. The only requirement that I have is that it must be mainstream and give results that are easy to visualize using a javascript library such as D3.
