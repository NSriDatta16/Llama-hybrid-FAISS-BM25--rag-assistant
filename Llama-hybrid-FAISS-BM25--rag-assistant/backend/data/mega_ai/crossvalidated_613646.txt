Expectation of energy-based model

An energy-based model parametrized by $\theta$ is defined as $$ p(x; \theta) \propto \exp(-f(x; \theta)) $$ For my specific case, it is that $f(x; A, y) = - \langle x, Ax \rangle - \langle x, y \rangle$ and $x$ is over the hypercube $\{ -1, +1 \}^N$ . I am looking for an efficient way of computing the expected value (barycenter) of this model without MCMC/sampling . Is it possible to do so?
