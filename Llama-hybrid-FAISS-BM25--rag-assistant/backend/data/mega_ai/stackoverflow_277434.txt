Since the "time" ints can be close to each other, try to only store the first and after that save the difference to the int before (delta-coding). You can try the same for the second int, too. Another thing you can try is to reorganize the data from [int1, int2, double], [int1, int2, double]... to [int1, int1...], [int2, int2...], [double, double...]. To find out the compression range your result will be in, you can write your data into a file and download the compressor CCM from Christian Martelock here . I found out that it performs very well for such data collections. It uses a quite fast context mixing algorithm. You can also compare it to other compressors like WinZIP or use a compression library like zLib to see if it is worth the effort.
