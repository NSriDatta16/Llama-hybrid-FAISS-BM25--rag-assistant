Sequence Embedding

Is there a way to get embedding for an ordered sequence of vectors? I want to get embeddings to feed them further into net i.e. train it to arbitrary loss function simultaneously for embeddings and other parts so that similar items get similar embeddings. Data is not descrete so it's not a word embedding.
