@Lea Cohen: I found this plugin for TinyMCE -- http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2800315&group_id=103281&atid=738747 -- which sounds like it should do what you wish, perhaps even in a more "user friendly" way than making the user enter widths manually: Adds the ability to resize a tables' cell borders by dragging the mouse .. The way I see it working is resizing the first cells acting as the "column" headings which should see subsequent cells in that column inheriting the width settings, e.g. Col 1 Col 2 Width 300 Width 200 Update If that plugin doesn't work for you, you should also have a look at the Table plugin which seems to have options for controlling rows/cells as well: http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/wiki.php/Plugin:table
