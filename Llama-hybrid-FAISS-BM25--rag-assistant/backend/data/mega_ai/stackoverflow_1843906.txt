I only use php for the following reasons: The software I'm using that solves my problems is written in it (like Wordpress . Don't try to program everything, sometimes you have a lot of good stuff in php); I need/want to run in a lot of different server configurations (a lot of people use shared hosting, and can't install/don't have support to python, but php is a default in any web hosting company); When I can choose (I have server environment control and I don't mind factor 2) , I choose Python. Just because you can write good code in php doesn't mean you should . I miss a robust language, with good Exception handling and a lot of other advantages. The language is clean and you can even use Google App Engine for free if you want to learn Python. You can write almost everything you write in Python with PHP. But I dislike PHP because a lot of times you use a feature, and you know that you have to configurate your php.ini, or use an obscure function just after having a lot of headaches with the feature. IMHO, at least in my experience, PHP is something you get used it. And Python is something you just fall in love: because it just works. I know these last paragraphs may be a personal opinion, but the first two factors aren't. Just choose the language what you think it's worth in that case.
