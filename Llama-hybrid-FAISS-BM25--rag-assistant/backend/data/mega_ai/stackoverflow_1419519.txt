CSS, nested divs & margins vs. padding

i totally understand the box model. this question is more about trying to pin down a semantic methodology regarding when to use margins and when to use padding. here is a typical example, first, in plain English: situation: we have a container div, inside of which there is a paragraph element. goal: to have a 12px space between the inside of the div and the outside of the paragraph. option a) apply 12px of padding to the container div option b) apply 12px margins to the paragraph element or, if you prefer, HTML: Hello World! and, CSS: option a) div#container {padding: 12px;} option b) p {margin: 12px;} Cheers!
