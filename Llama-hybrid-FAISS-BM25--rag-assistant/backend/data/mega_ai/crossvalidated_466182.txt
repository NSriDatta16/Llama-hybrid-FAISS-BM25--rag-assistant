I think you are correct: strictly speaking there should be no $\mathbb{E}$ before the integral term (which, by the way, also appears in equation 1.2, but not in equation 2.1). There is one way to see it: the best estimate $\hat{\theta}$ of the ground truth value $\theta$ will be the one that will minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the estimated distribution $f(x|\hat{\theta})$ and the true distribution $f(x|\theta)$ : $$ D_{KL} = \int_x f(x|\theta) \log f(x|\theta) - \int_x f(x|\theta) \log f(x|\hat{\theta}) $$ The second integral in the right-hand side is the only one that depends on $\hat{\theta}$ , and it needs to be maximized to minimize the $D_{KL}$ , hence the statement prior to equation 1.1. But adding the $\mathbb{E}$ symbol is not wrong in itself. Indeed, the integral $\int_x f(x|\theta) \log f(x|\hat{\theta})$ is only a function of $\hat{\theta}$ and $\theta$ (and not of $x$ ), so averaging over $x \sim f(x|\theta)$ is going to leave it unchanged. I would be happy to see if someone has a different opinion on this.
