Weights in binary logistic regression

I am conducting a vote-counting meta-analysis where the only information I have from each study is the direction of the treatment effect (positive or negative) and the sample size. My plan is to fit a binary logistic regression with treatment effect direction as the response variable and several study-level characteristics as the predictors. I would like to weight the studies by their sample size (i.e., give more weight to larger studies), but I'm not sure how to do this in a binary logistic regression. With a continuous response variable, it would be possible to add weights like this in R using glm : glm(y ~ x, weights = sample_size, family = gaussian) However, for a binary response ( family = binomial ), the weights are treated as the number of trials, which does not make sense in my situation (each study is a single Bernoulli trial). Is there a reasonable way to assign weights to observations in a binary logistic regression?
