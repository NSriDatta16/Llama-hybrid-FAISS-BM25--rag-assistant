Book recommendation for probabilistic networks

I'm a student interested in learning about probabilistic networks â€” Bayesian Networks Markov models etc. I have a good background in probability, statistics and Markov chains. Some good introductory books I found are the one by Jensen and Nielsen "Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs", Springer and "Probabilistic Networks and Expert Systems" by Cowell et al., Springer. Which one (of the above or not) would you recommend as a first read?
