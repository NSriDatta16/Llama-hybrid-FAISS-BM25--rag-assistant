Neural network sometimes predicting only one class: suggestions?

When training a neural net on a (somewhat balanced) dataset, the neural network will occasionally (1/3 of the time) get locked in predicting only one class. I've reduced the size of the layers as much as I can, so I'm looking for some suggestions as to The type of optimizer and learning rate (I've tried SGD, Adam, Adadelta, etc. at varying learning rates) What initializers I should try for each layer (e.g. glorot normal, random, etc.) Any other learning strategies you can think of The networks takes in a matrix of data as primary input and a vector as auxiliary. It outputs one of four classes. Thanks so much!
