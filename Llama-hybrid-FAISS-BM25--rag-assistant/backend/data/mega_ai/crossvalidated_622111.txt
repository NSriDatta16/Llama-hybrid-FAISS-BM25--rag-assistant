If you are looking to analyze spatio-temporal data in Stata and want to estimate models with spatial-temporal data, there are some valuable resources you can explore. Here are three articles and one book that provide insights into the latest advancements in this field, offering both theoretical explanations and practical examples using empirical data: Causal Inference with Spatio-Temporal Data: Estimating the Effects of Airstrikes on Insurgent Violence in Iraq" by Papadogeorgou, Georgia; Imai, Kosuke; Lyall, Jason; Li, Fan (2022) in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B: Statistical Methodology. DOI: 10.1111/rssb.12548 How to Make Causal Inferences with Time-Series Cross-Sectional Data under Selection on Observables" by Blackwell, Matthew; Glynn, Adam N. (2018) in the American Political Science Review. DOI: 10.1017/S0003055418000357 Toward Causal Inference for Spatio-Temporal Data: Conflict and Forest Loss in Colombia" by Christiansen, Rune; Baumann, Matthias; Kuemmerle, Tobias; Mahecha, Miguel D.; Peters, Jonas (2022) in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. DOI: 10.1080/01621459.2021.2013241 Furthermore, there is a book that might be of interest: Causal Inference: What If" by Hernán, M. A.; Robins, J. M. (2020). This book delves into causal inference and could be a valuable resource for understanding the topic in-depth. All the mentioned articles can be traced back to the gformula by Robins. For those interested in applying the gformula in Stata, there are packages available for R and Stata. These packages can be used to estimate causal effects in the presence of time-varying confounding or mediation.

Gformula: Estimating Causal Effects in the Presence of Time-Varying Confounding or Mediation using the G-Computation Formula" by Daniel, Rhian M.; Stavola, Bianca L. de; Cousens, Simon N. (2011) in The Stata Journal. DOI: 10.1177/1536867X1201100401
