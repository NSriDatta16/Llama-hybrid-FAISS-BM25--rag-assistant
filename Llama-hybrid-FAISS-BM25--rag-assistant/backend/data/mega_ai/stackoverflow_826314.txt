Most complex thing about this kind of simulators is not how to implement it, but how you model your creatures, and their interactions with each other and environment. Just use those tools that you are most comfortable with. I wouldn't most likely use any kind of database in the beginning, I would use datastructures that my programming language uses and maybe write and read the datastructures to plain files when persistance is needed. Here are few links about this kind of simulations. Most of them are not human level, instead they work on a bit "lower" level, think of insects, bacteria and DNA.
