Objects Being Attached to their Creator Question

I am working on a rails application where one user class named (submitters) are able to login and once they are logged in they create videos. My videos controller is here: class VideosController 'index' else render :action => 'new' end end def show @video = Video.find(params[:id]) end def destroy @video = Video.find(params[:id]) @video.destroy flash[:notice] = "Successfully deleted the video." redirect_to root_url end def update_date @video = Video.find(params[:id]) @video.update_attributes(params[:video]) flash[:notice] = "Successfully added a launch date!" redirect_to @video end end As you can probably see, I am trying to construct the controller so that when a video is created, it is created as belonging to the submitter who upload the video (via the video new view). I am using a auth system with a current_submitter method written in the application controller. Now it lets me upload a video fine when I am logged in as a submitter. The trouble for me is working out how to display information in my view. If I want to display some columns with information about the video and then others with information about the submitter who uploaded the video, how do I go about doing that from the controller (index action), into the index view. My current view which does not work in below: Title Film Type Premiere Company Name Premiere 'Are you sure?', :method => :delete %> Any suggestions or tips from rails developers would be much appreciative... I am new and trying to learn. Video Model: class Video :video, :storage => :file_system, :max_size => 50.megabytes end Submitter Model: class Submitter Schema: create_table "videos", :force => true do |t| t.string "title" t.text "description" t.string "state" t.datetime "created_at" t.datetime "updated_at" t.string "content_type" t.integer "size" t.string "filename" t.string "film_type" t.boolean "premiere", :default => false t.date "preferred_date" t.text "reason" t.integer "submitter_id" t.date "actual_date" end create_table "submitters", :force => true do |t| t.string "name" t.string "company" t.string "email" t.string "username" t.string "crypted_password" t.string "password_salt" t.string "persistence_token" t.datetime "created_at" t.datetime "updated_at" t.integer "video_id" end
