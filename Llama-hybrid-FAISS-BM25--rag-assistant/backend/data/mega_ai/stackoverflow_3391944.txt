jQuery 1.4.2 resizable div stops working once it fits in browser window

I have a 'toolbar' div that I made resizable via jQuery UI. The weird thing is, I cannot drag the div unless the div is so long it extends past the viewable page, making the scrollbars appear. I can then drag the div anywhere I like. However, if I drag the div so it fits in the page without scrollbars, and I drop, I cannot resize it again (unless I make the page smaller so the scrollbars appear again!). Here's the html: play stop --> fit to screen status stuff goes here Here's the CSS: #toolbar { display: none; width: 300px; height: 45px; z-index: -999999; } Here's the jQuery: $("#toolbar").resizable({ handles: "se", maxHeight: 45, minHeight: 45, minWidth: 400 }); Any ideas? The toolbar is located in an iFrame.
