Gapless looping of mp3's is not trivial due to the way the format works. To simplify a bit; the sound is fitted to a number of frames, this number cannot be chosen arbitrarily, instead some padding (with silence) is required. Mp3 has no way of storing how much padding was added, so this information is lost once the file is encoded. The flash IDE get's around this by embedding this metadata, and you can too. You just need to know how much delay is added by the encoder. Andre Michelle explains this way better than I can on his blog .
