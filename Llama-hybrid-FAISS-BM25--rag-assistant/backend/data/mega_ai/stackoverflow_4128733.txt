Using external files in WebView

Is it possible to refer to an external file [not present in the res/raw folder of the app] in a WebView? The documentation [and the StackOverflow questions] I've read so far doesn't deal with this question. Can I load an image on external storage, say /sdcard/abc.jpg using the img tag and the loadData() method of a WebView? I've tried doing that, but the image is not displayed. Another example would be a .js file on external storage being used with a WebView. Is this possible, or is WebView restricted to referring only to local files? Thanks in advance
