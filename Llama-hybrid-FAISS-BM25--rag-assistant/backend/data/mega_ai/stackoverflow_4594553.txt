This isn't a standard capability of UITableView, but actually isn't that hard to implement. What you need to do is: Create a custom UITableViewCell (perhaps called 'OutlineTableViewCell'). It should have a disclosure indicator Create a class which implements the UITableViewDataSource protocol to manage the tree structure of the rows. It should manage the indent level and disclosure state. Implement methods to expand/collapse sections of the tree (triggered by tapping the disclosure indicator) Finally, subclass both of these to add the storage and display of your own data in the view
