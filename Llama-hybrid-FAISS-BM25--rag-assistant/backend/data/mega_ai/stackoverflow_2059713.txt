Similar language features to compare with Perl and Ruby __END__

Background Perl and Ruby have the __END__ and __DATA__ tokens that allow embedding of arbitrary data directly inside a source code file. Although this practice may not be well-advised for general-purpose programming use, it is pretty useful for "one-off" quick scripts for routine tasks. Question: What other programming languages support this same or similar feature, and how do they do it?
