Machine learning issue for negative instances

I had to build a concept analyzer for computer science field and I used for this machine learning, the orange library for Python. I have the examples of concepts, where the features are lemma and part of speech, like algorithm|NN|concept. The problem is that any other word, that in fact is not a concept, is classified as a concept, due to the lack of negative examples. It is not feasable to put all the other words in learning file, classified as simple words not concepts(this will work, but is not quite a solution). Any idea? Thanks.
