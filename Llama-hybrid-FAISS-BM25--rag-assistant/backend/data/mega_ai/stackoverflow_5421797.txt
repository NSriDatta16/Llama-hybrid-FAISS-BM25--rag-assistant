I don't know a library that does this, but using reflection, it is not too hard to implement by yourself. You can easily loop over getter methods of a class and decide whether the instance has a value set, you can further decide the outcome depending on the getter's return type. The hard part is to define which members of a class you consider being "useful data". Just leaving out Lists, Maps and Arrays probably won't get you far. I would actually consider writing your own Annotation type in order to "mark" the appropiate "useful" members (which could then be noticed+handled by the reflection code). I don't know if this is an elegant approach to your problem, since I don't know how many classes are affected.
