Constrain loss function based on input variables

I'm doing a simple regression task using a neural network with two inputs ( x1 and x2 ) and one output ( y ). I want to add an additional term to my loss function such that when x1=0 we always get y=x2 . How would I formulate an additional term to account for this?
