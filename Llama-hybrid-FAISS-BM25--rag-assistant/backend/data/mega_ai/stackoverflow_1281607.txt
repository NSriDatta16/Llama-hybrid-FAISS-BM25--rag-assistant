How to modify, without any loop, a collections values to get a new collection?

How do I, without using any loop, modify the values in a collection to get a new collection with the modified values? For example, I'm having a Collection and want to surround all Strings by parentheses. With a loop I would do this: Iterable collection = getCollection(); ArrayList newCollection = new ArrayList (); for(String str : collection) newCollection.add("(" + str + ")"); There has to be a more elegant solution. EDIT: Use of third party utilities is allowed :)
