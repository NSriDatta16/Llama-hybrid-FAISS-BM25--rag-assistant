The function you have plotted is the kernel of a beta density function (i.e., it is a positive multiple of the beta density). Since you have really just plotted the binomial likelihood function for a particular observed outcome, from a Bayesian perspective your plotted function is proportionate to the posterior density that emerges from using a uniform prior for $p$ . In Bayesian modelling terms, what you have illustrated here is that: $$\underbrace{\text{Beta}(p | 15, 28)}_\text{Posterior} \ \propto \ \underbrace{\text{Bin}(14|41, p)}_\text{Likelihood} \times \underbrace{\text{U}(p|0,1)}_\text{Prior}.$$ (Note also that your last plot just appears to be a repetition of the first plot. Your code for the beta distribution uses the wrong parameters; see the parameterisation of the beta distribution to see why the parameters should be as shown here.) To plot the posterior density in this problem we can use the following R code: #Plot posterior density library(ggplot2) XX
