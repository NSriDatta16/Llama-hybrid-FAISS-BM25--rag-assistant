Congratulations on doing stand-ups. It's a good first change. That you're asking suggests that you or the team would like to be better at this. In that case, you can go one of two ways: Huge change, or Incremental improvement If you decide you'd like a huge change, you'll probably need some books, training and maybe a coach or experienced practitioner around. This is often successful if people higher up in the organisation are invested in the change too. If you decide you'd like to improve incrementally, it's worth reading around Agile just to get some ideas. I recommend "XP Explained". There are a lot of blogs out there, too, as well as posts here. The two things you'll need to do are: Try to deliver some software, or at least get feedback from the stakeholders Work out why that was hard and what you can do to make it easier. We normally do the first with showcases and the second with retrospectives. I recommend having retrospectives at least every two weeks, even if it's really hard to showcase working code. Things I often see flagged up quickly as problems include: Team not co-located ("Team" includes BAs and QAs) Environment not suited Lack of visibility of work in progress or overall goals Too much work in progress - things started but not finished Projects in progress that nobody really cares about Project progress makes it obvious that it's not worth doing Codebase is really hard to change Blame culture discourages collaboration. Whatever you find out, you won't be the first. Note that Agile is a transparent methodology, whichever version you use. A lot of people get scared by transparency. This is normal. Sometimes managers higher up have a vested interest in not allowing things to be transparent. This is also common, and at that point you might need external help. Delivering working software can be very persuasive, though. Good luck!
