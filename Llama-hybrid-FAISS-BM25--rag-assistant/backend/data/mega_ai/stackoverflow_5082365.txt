As far as I know the so-called "fragments" of the URI (everything behind those #s) are important for SEO. They usually point to a direct spot on a page where you can get your information from, which is especially useful at sites that contain much information on one page and you would need to scroll down to get your information. Then again, if you can't follow those links and they do something if JavaScript is enabled only, search-engines won't care, because they can't exactly follow the links. Always remember, search-engines don't parse JavaScript, for them those are plain URIs that lead to nowhere (or to the same page they're already on, which would be bad for the SEO) You can parse those fragments with PHP, though, and show the right tab if it is clicked, so if JavaScript is turned off, the user as well as the search engine get the right content, anyways.
