I have not full internalized the issue of matrix interference but here is one approach. Let: $Y$ be a vector that represents the concentration of all the target compounds in the undiluted sample. $Z$ be the corresponding vector in the diluted sample. $d$ be the dilution factor i.e., the sample is diluted $d$:1. Our model is: $Y \sim N(\mu,\Sigma)$ $Z = \frac{Y}{d} + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2\ I)$ represents the error due to dilution errors. Therefore, it follows that: $Z \sim N(\frac{\mu}{d}, \Sigma + \sigma^2\ I)$ Denote the above distribution of $Z$ by $f_Z(.)$. Let $O$ be the observed concentrations and $\tau$ represent the test instrument's threshold below which it cannot detect a compound. Then, for the $i^{th}$ compound we have: $O_i = Z_i I(Z_i > \tau) + 0 I(Z_i \le \tau)$ Without loss of generality let the first $k$ compounds be such that they are below the threshold. Then the likelihood function can be written as: $L(O_1, ... O_k, O_{k+1},...O_n |- ) = [\prod_{i=1}^{i=k}{Pr(Z_i \le \tau)}] [\prod_{i=k+1}^{i=n}{f(O_i |-)}]$ where $f(O_i |-) = \int_{j\neq i}{f_Z(O_i|-) I(O_i > \tau)}$ Estimation is then a matter of using either maximum likelihood or bayesian ideas. I am not sure how tractable the above is but I hope it gives you some ideas.
