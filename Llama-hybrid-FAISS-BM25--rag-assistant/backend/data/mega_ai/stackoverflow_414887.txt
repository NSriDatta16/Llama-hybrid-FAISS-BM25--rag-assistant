Don't miss this one: http://ajaxpatterns.org/ It contains a comprehensive coverage of all of the concepts and design patterns that you might use in AJAX development in any lib. It also includes a review of all the AJAX libraries. This site will give you the big picture rather than just teach you one specific lib. Personally I like ExtJS AJAX Lib http://extjs.com . I used it for 6 months on a research project after reviewing the market place. I particularly liked its excellent suite of UI widgets. Check out their demos. This library was originally based on Yahoo UI but now has much more. They've now integrated it with Google web toolkit (which I nearly chose but for lack of decent widgets). Libs like jQuery look tiny and incomplete beside this one. Dojo has some great stuff but is not as integrated and the code quality is not as high (IMHO). Downside for some might be the GPL / Commercial license terms (was orginally LGPL and the switch to GPL caused some controversy). Checkout the rest of my AJAX resource links at http://delicious.com/tohagan/ajax ... Enjoy!
