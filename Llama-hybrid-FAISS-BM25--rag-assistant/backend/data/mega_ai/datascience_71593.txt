Does save_best_only in Keras prevents overfitting?

I'm training a CNN and using: model_checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(os.path.join(output_artifacts,'weights.h5'), monitor='val_acc', save_best_only=True) I trained the network for 70 epochs, but the validation accuracy flattened on good value (90%) after 20 epochs remaining pretty constant. I would say that after epoch 20 (more or less 20:00 in the graph) the network is overfitting. My question is, does save_best_only takes this into account or just save the weights at epochs 1:00 am which is the overall best (but overfitted)? Should I use earlystopping to stop the training or is not necessary? I don't want to stop the training too early..
