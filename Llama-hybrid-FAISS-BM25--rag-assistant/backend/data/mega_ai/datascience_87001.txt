Is there a good alternative to XGBoost for learn to rank?

My problem with XGBoost is that when I load the train dataset into the XGBoost DMatrix, there is a memory spike that is unavoidable, and I can't get my dataset loaded into RAM without crashing first. I am trying to predict rankings over time, similar to a search engine query problem. XGBoost has produced good results using the pairwise objective but I have reached my limits due to the memory spike issue.
