Should I use a difference-in-difference method for migration flows and average unskilled worker incomes or a lagged DV?

I am using data from a variety of sources to measure if migration inflows lead to an increase in unskilled worker wages. I am controlling for number of illegal immigrants, migrant unemployment, etc. I think that I will see results that show that an increase in migration will lead to an increase in average unskilled worker wages in relation to the median income because I think they will be filling gaps in the work force. Anyway, would I want to lag my dependent variable in this analysis? Or use the difference-in-difference statistical test? Thank you!
