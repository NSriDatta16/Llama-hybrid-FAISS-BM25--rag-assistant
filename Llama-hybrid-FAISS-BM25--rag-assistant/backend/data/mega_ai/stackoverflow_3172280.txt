Code coverage features, as well as programmable API's, come with Visual Studio 2010. Sadly, the only two editions that include the full Code Coverage capabilities are Premium and Ultimate. However, I do believe the API's will be available with any edition, so creating code coverage files and writing a viewer for the coverage info would likely be possible.
