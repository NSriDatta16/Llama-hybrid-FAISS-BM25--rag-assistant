By choosing alternating indices serial correlations are broken in forming test and validation sets, so Option 3 is not advised. Option 1 and 2 are actually close to identical, only swaps the test and validation segments. More rigours approach would be doing temporal cross-validation : Rob J Hyndman's evaluation on a rolling forecasting origin is preferred in doing cross-validation. See Cross-validation for time series A bit more sophisticate approach is using secondary model in reconstructing missing points at random, to generate k-fold temporal cross-validation. See Generalised learning of time-series: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes But for basic sanity check both Option 1 and Option 2 are acceptable, given that series are stationary.
