UILabel with custom font displays *wrong* custom font

I'm using this method to embed custom fonts in my iPhone app. The embedding works: When I run the following code, the fonts are listed. (Currently, I'm embedding all family members of Myriad Pro in OTF format) for( NSString *familyName in [UIFont familyNames] ){ for( NSString *fntName in [UIFont fontNamesForFamilyName:familyName] ){ NSLog(@"%@", fntName); }} When I try to set the font of a label to MyriadPro or MyriadPro-Bold, this works just as expected. However, when I set the font to MyriadPro-BoldCond, the label is still set in MyriadPro-Bold instead of the condensed version. (The font names are correct, I checked.) My Code: [recommendationLabel setFont:[UIFont fontWithName:@"MyriadPro-BoldCond" size:140]]; recommendationLabel.adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth = YES; What's the deal? Edit: In addition to Ingve's solution below, I have found out that – at least for Myriad Pro – the correct font variant gets displayed as soon as I remove unused fonts from the plist. In this case I needed to remove MyriadPro-SemiBold. Mindboggling.
