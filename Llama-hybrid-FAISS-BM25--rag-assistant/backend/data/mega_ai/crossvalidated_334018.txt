I use choiceModelR package in R for my conjoint analysis. Check the documentation for this package to see if it can work for you. There is also a great demonstration of this package in this book by Chris Chapman and Elea Feit: https://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Research-Analytics-Use/dp/3319144359 You can also look at mlogit , conjoint , and bayesm packages, which also can work with choice data, but I have never used them. I suggest looking for something that performs Hierarchical Bayesian (HB), as it is generally viewed as the most robust for conjoint data. If you want to get away from scripting languages to perform conjoint analysis, I suggest purchasing Lighthouse Studio or CBC/HB from Sawtooth Software: https://www.sawtoothsoftware.com/ . Sawtooth also has a great technical paper on HB models for conjoint data that is relatively easy to follow: https://www.sawtoothsoftware.com/support/technical-papers/hierarchical-bayes-estimation/cbc-hb-technical-paper-2009 If when you say that the sample is "split" you mean that there are subgroups of respondents that performed the same conjoint exercise (i.e. they looked at choice sets with the same attributes/levels being tested), AND you assume that these subgroups have significantly different preference structures from other subgroups, then you should add the split variable as a co-variate to your HB model. The HB model will give you individual-level part worth scores, so as long as you've defined significant subgroups, you can split your model results however you think is appropriate.
