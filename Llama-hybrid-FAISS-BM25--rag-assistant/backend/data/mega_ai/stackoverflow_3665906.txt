We wrote a library just for this purpose, that offers a fluent-syntax to embedding JavaScript in C# code. You can read more about it here . In short, your example would be written as: var function = JS.Function("foo").Do( JS.Var(JS.Id("bar").AssignWith(blah))); string someJavaScript = " " + function + " "; For one, it will make sure that the contents of the blah variable is properly quoted, if it contains special characters, for example.
