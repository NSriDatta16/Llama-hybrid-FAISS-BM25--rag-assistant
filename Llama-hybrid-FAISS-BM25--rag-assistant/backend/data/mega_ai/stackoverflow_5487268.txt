Yep, any stylesheets in a link element will be downloaded and the media queries evaluated dynamically. For instance your stylesheets ipad-landscape.css and ipad-portrait.css would need to be applied when someone turns their device round, you don't want to wait until they do that to start downloading the stylesheet and any referenced items, it should be ready right away. The only exception is (or could be) alternate stylesheets. The processing model for this is discussed in the HTML5 spec : The appropriate time to obtain the resource is when the external resource link is created or when its element is inserted into a document, whichever happens last. If the resource is an alternative stylesheet then the user agent may defer obtaining the resource until it is part of the preferred style sheet set.
