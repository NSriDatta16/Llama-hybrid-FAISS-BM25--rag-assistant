If you plan to use the Outlook 2007 COM object Model I suggest you start with this article: How Do I ... in Outlook Look specifically for "Folders and Stores", "Search an Filter", "Solution Storage". Aside from this, the PST format is now documented here: PST File Format SDK but this is an unmaged C++ API, hard to use in .NET. There was a .NET port project initiated here: http://pstsdknet.codeplex.com/documentation but it seems quite dead (or not yet born)... so it's a difficult road to head for.
