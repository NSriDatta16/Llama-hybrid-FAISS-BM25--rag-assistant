What effect repetitive data will have on the performance of the model

I understand that my question is very broad and that the correct answer may depend on various things. I want to get an idea in general what we may expect if we have repetitive data in our dataset. Lets say we are trying to do a sentiment analysis and that there would be a class associated to each text (pos, neg, neu). I intentionally chose samples that the label associated to them may vary for example Are you there. and are you there?? with label pos and neg respectively. This is the example: text. sentiment Are you there. pos anyone there. pos are you there. pos Is anybody here? pos are you there?? neg Hello. neu Hello????? neg agent. neu agent please. pos get me an agent neg human. neg agenttttt. neg agent. neg Is it common to get rid of duplicates in our dataset? if so what would be the reason? How about the samples that conceptually are the same but do not follow the same word/order (for example agent and agent please ) I appreciate it if you can share your thought on this.
