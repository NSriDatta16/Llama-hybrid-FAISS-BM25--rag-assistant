e, most voice assistants have the option to be engaged by a physical button (e.g., Siri with a long press of the home button) rather than solely by wake word-based engagement in a smart speaker. While this distinction increases the privacy by limiting when the microphone is on, users felt that having to press a button first removed the convenience of voice interaction. This trade-off is not unique to voice assistants; as more and more devices come online, there is an increasing trade-off between convenience and privacy. Security concerns When configured without authentication, smart speakers can be activated by people other than the intended user or owner. For example, visitors to a home or office, or people in a publicly accessible area outside an open window, partial wall, or security fence, may be able to be heard by a speaker. This may allow others to access personal information of the owner without the owner's permission. One team demonstrated the ability to stimulate the microphones of smart speakers and smartphones through a closed window, from another building across the street, using a laser. Smart speakers are typically forgotten about when it comes to home network security concerns because of their convenience and simplicity. However one in three breaches now involves an IoT device. The risk of getting hacked through a smart speaker can be greatly mitigated by following some simple steps. For one, it is necessary that a trustworthy brand is chosen when purchasing a smart speaker. Doing research to find a brand that aligns with your needs/wants while being secure can relieve stresses in the long run. It is also extremely important to keep your smart devices up-to-date to the latest firmware version as these updates will have patches for any known exploits. Deliberately going through the settings once the device is up-to-date will allow you to turn off settings you don't need or want to use further minimizing security risks. Usage statistics As of summer 2022, it is estimated by NPR and Edison Research that 91 million Americans (35% of the population over 18) own a smart speaker.
