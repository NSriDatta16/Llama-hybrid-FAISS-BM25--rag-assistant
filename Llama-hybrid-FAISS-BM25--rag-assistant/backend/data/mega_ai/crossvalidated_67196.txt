Using a general linear model to perform z-test

I am trying to perform a z-test with a brain-imaging software. I was told that the best way was to use a general linear model with one subject in one group and the rest in the other group. Using this method gives results that look identical to calculating the average and standard deviation of the control group and performing a specific z-test. Is it accurate to use a general linear model in this way? What statistical test might it be using?
