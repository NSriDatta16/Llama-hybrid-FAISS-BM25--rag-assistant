To add on Gilead's answer, they are computationally less expensive algorithms for truncated PCAs. NIPALS is indeed very popular, but I have had a lot of success with approximate methods that perform a succession of fits on partial data (what is often called PCA by random projection). This was discussed in a metaoptimize thread. As you mention Python, let me point out that the algorithm is implemented in the scikit-learn : the PCA class. In particular, it is used in an example demonstrating eigenfaces .
