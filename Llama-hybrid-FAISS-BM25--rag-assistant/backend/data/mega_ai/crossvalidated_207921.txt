Finding a pattern in time series data

I have time series data. I am looking for a procedure to find if a particular pattern exists in the time series. To make it more clear, suppose I have a base time series in which the check for the input pattern is done. I give a part of some time series as input to the system and check the base time series if there is an approximate match for the input in the base time series. I am performing this action in Knime . I cannot understand how HMM can fit into the problem. Is there any approach to achieve this task?
