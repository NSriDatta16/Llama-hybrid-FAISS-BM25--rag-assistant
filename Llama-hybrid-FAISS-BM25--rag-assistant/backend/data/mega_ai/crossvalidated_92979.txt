Principal component analysis performs high-dimensional rotation of the source data to maximize its variance. The singular vectors represent the basis of the rotated coordinate system and the principal components are the source data projected onto this basis. The singular values represent the variances of the principal components. I'd say that PCA-based prediction should look like extrapolating the principal components and projecting them back to the original coordinate system. I don't know PCA-based prediction methods exactly, but I can point you to two related (via SVD) prediction methods: Kumaresan-Tufts linear prediction ( ref. ) SSA forecasting (N. Golyandina et al.)
