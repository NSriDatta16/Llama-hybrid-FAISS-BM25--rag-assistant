If you have thread-local storage, you could do something like: #undef printf #define printf(fmt, ...) fprintf(my_threadlocal_stdout, fmt, __VA_ARGS__) and likewise for all the other stdio functions you intend to use. Of course it would be better not to try redefining the same names, but instead perform search and replace on the source files to use alternate names. BTW even without thread-local storage extensions to the compiler, you could use a function call that returns the right FILE * for the calling thread to use.
