Logistic Regression - Intervals on Predicted Number of Cases

We have developed a logistic regression model for predicting the attendance at an event for registrants. We can use this model to predict the probability of attendance at future events for new registrants (a new sample). One of the things of interest is predicting the total attendance at the event which we can do by summing the predicted probabilities for the sample. We would also like to have an interval on this predicted total attendance. Another thing we are interested in is predicting the effect of changing an inducement provided to registrants to attend the event. Doing this provides us with 2 predicted total attendances and a difference in attendance depending on the inducement provided. We would also like to calculate an interval on the difference as to whether it is statistically significant. We are looking for advice on techniques we could apply to develop these intervals.
