Probability of a claim being rejected or accepted using binomial distribution

I am self-learning statistics. I was going through Probability and Statistics For Engineering and the Sciences by Jay L. Devore and stumbled upon the following example: An electronics manufacturer claims that at most 10% of its power supply units need service during the warranty period. To investigate this claim, technicians at a testing laboratory purchase 20 units and subject each one to accelerated testing to simulate use during the warranty period. Let $p$ denote the probability that a power supply unit needs repair during the period (the proportion of all such units that need repair). The laboratory technicians must decide whether the data resulting from the experiment supports the claim that $p \leq 0.10$. Let X denote the number among the 20 sampled that need repair, so $X \sim \text{Bin}(20, p)$. The explanation given is as follows: Reject the claim that $p \leq 0.10$ in favor of the conclusion that $p>.10$ if $x \geq 5$ (where $x$ is the observed value of $X$), and consider the claim plausible if $x \leq 4$. The probability that the claim is rejected when $p=0.10$ (an incorrect conclusion) is $P(X \geq 5 \text{ when } p=0.10) = 1-B(4; 20,0.1) = 1-0.957 = 0.043$ The probability that the claim is not rejected when p = .20 (a different type of incorrect conclusion) is $P(X \leq 4 \text{ when } p=0.2) =B(4; 20,0.2) =.630$ The first probability is rather small, but the second is intolerably large. When $p=0.20$ , so that the manufacturer has grossly understated the percentage of units that need service, and the stated decision rule is used, 63% of all samples will result in the manufacturerâ€™s claim being judged plausible! I am not being able to understand how the solution connects to the given problem. Also what does the last paragraph mean? Why has $x$ been taken as 5 to reject the claim, shouldn't it be $x=2$ since if more than 2 out of 20 components fail then the claim fails? Why has a value of $p=0.2$ been used in the second case? Could someone please explain it clearly?
