To answer this question, you need to understand why catching System.Exception is a bad idea, and understand your own motivations for doing what your propose. It's a bad idea because it makes the statement that anything that could have gone wrong is okay, and that the application is in a good state to keep running afterwards. That's a very bold statement to make. So the question is: Is what you are proposing equivalent to catching System.Exception? Does it give the consumer of your API any more knowledge to make a better judgement? Does it simply encourage them to catch YourWrappedException, which is then the moral equivalent of catching System.Exception, except for not triggering FXCop warnings? In most cases, if you know there's a rule against doing something, and want to know if something similar is "okay", you should start with understanding the rationale for the original rule.
