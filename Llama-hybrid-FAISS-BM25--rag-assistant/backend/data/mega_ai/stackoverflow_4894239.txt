You could also test the agent type in an if / else set, and run different actions on logout based on the browser type. Like IE 6 I think you could unset the session and exit() the processing completely: unset($_SESSION['variable']); .. I believe this is also a header control you can run in IE6 like Response.CacheControl = "no-cache" .. Not sure if this at all helps or answers your questions, but there certainly is some way to control this. Good luck!
