Arrays do implement IEnumerable , but it is done as part of the special knowledge the CLI has for arrays. This works as if it were an explicit implementation (but isn't: it is done at runtime). Many tools will not show this implementation, this is described in the Remarks section of the Array class overview. You could add a cast: return ((IEnumerable )_array).GetEnumerator(); Note, older MSDN (pre learn.microsoft.com) coverage of this changed a few times with different .NET versions, check for the remarks section.
