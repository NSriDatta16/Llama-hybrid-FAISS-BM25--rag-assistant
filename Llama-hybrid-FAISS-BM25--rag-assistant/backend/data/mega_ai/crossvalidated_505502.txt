You could approach this as a machine learning problem as follows. The dataset consists of three features: algorithm 1 predictions, algorithm 2 predictions, and the ground truth label representing which prediction was closer to the true speed. Train a decision tree classifier, setting sensible values for the max depth or minimum number of samples per node or leaf. This will produce a decision tree which divides predictions into quadrants (or smaller squares, depending on settings) based on which algorithm is favoured within each region.
