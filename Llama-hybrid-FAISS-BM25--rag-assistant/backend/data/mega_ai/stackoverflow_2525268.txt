You should have a CommentPeer::doSelectJoinArticle() method, which can use to do this. If you don't, then you're probably not using MySQL's InnoDB storage engine or foreign key references in your database schema, which is something I highly recommend - not only will it allow Propel to add these extra JOIN methods to its generated model code, but you will gain many benefits from an ACID-compliant database. The alternative is to write the CommentPeer::doSelectJoinArticle() method yourself - this link will describe the process, but the length of the process may make you choose the first option :)
