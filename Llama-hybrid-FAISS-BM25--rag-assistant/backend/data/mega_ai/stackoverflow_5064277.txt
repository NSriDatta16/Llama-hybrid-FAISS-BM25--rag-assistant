Instead of selecting all the comments (including subcomments) maybe, select only parent comments first... (where parent_id=0). select * from comments where parent_id=0 and author_id IN ('".implode("','",$all_friend_id)."' order by datetime desc limit 0 , 20 Then foreach parent, go and get the subcomments, that way when fetching the older comments from ajax, you will not get fragments of subcomments without their parents. It might be slower though...
