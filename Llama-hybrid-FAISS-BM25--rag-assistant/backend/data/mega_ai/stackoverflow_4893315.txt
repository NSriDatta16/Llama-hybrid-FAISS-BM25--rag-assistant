Java is a great language to learn, and I highly recommend it, but since ActionScript is based on ECMAScript, its syntax is about all they have in common. They're really totally different languages, and you use them in very different ways. One of the biggest differences is that ECMAScript uses prototypal inheritance. Java was my first language, and I had to spend a week or two to learn how to effectively leverage the unique features in ECMAScript-based languages instead of trying to do things the same way I would in Java. That being said, I have always found that the more I learn about other languages and paradigms, the better my code is in all languages!
