What can we do with the visualization/understanding of the deep neural network

As far as I know, there is subfield of deep learning that attempt to use gradient to understand what a deep network is learning (e.g., what a filter is detecting). My question is after we know what they are learning, what can do we with those new information (e.g., change architecture design, etc)? Is there any literature on that? A good Stanford video about visualization deep network. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wcs6szJWMY
