Is there a Python module/recipe (not numpy) for 2d arrays for small games

I am writing some small games in Python with Pygame & Pyglet as hobby projects. A class for 2D array would be very handy. I use py2exe to send the games to relatives/friends and numpy is just too big and most of it's features are unnecessary for my requirements. Could you suggest a Python module/recipe I could use for this. -- Chirag [Edit]: List of lists would be usable as mentioned below by MatrixFrog and zvoase. But it is pretty primitive. A class with methods to insert/delete rows and columns as well as to rotate/flip the array would make it very easy and reusable too. dicts are good for sparse arrays only. Thank you for your ideas.
