If you want to disallow Google from indexing pages, you should add a robots.txt file to the root folder of your website. You could then put something like this in the file: User-agent: * Disallow: /thisisnotwanted I assume you want to disallow the page from all search engines, but if you only want to disallow Google, the you should change the first line to User-agent: Google . You can tell Google explicitly to remove the links using Webmaster tools . It could take a few days before Google will accept your request and remove the pages from their index.
