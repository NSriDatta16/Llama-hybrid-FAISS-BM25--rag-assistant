Testing & Code coverage tools - you want to include as many of these in your suite as make sense without bogging down your build cycles. e.g. if you add too many and your build times go beyond a few minutes, then it won't be productive to continue to build after every commit. Build after every commit, IMO, for both your central and staging locations. You may get double-coverage here, but if you have the bandwidth and CPU for it, why not? I agree with using a dual-slice setup, and yes one of the reasons is that it allows you to use the second slice as a staging/final testing area. Plus then if you deploy from your staging slice to your production slice, you get to take advantage of their local network while transmitting information between slices. It's much faster to do it that way. Hope that helps :-)
