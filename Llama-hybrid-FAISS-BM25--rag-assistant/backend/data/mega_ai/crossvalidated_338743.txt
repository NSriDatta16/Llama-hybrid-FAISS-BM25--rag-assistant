I agree with F Tusell, Statisticians try to avoid these questions since they are not relevant to the field. But, in my opinion, Statistics in general and PCA in particular are conducted in Hilbert Spaces. Here is why: In statistics you're working in a vector space with variance/covariance as defined inner product . Uncorrelated variables have Pearson corelation coefficient 0 because the covariance is zero or in other words, their inner product is 0 meaning orthogonality. Does Variance/covariance satisfy the properties imposed on the inner product in a pre-Hilbert/Hilbert space? Yes, it does: Commutativity: $\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \operatorname{Cov}(Y,X)$ Linearity: $\operatorname{Cov}(aX+bY,cW+dV) = ac\operatorname{Cov}(X,W) + ad\operatorname{Cov}(X,V) + bc\operatorname{Cov}(Y,W) + bd\operatorname{Cov}(Y,V)$ Norm is always real valued, positive and fininte: $\operatorname{Cov}(X,X) = \operatorname{Var}(X,X) = \sigma^2$ (standard dev squared) > 0 real and finite The Cauchyâ€“Schwarz inequality holds: $\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) So a vector space formed by a set of finite dimensional random variables equiped with Variance/Covariance as inner product is indeed a Hilbert Space.
