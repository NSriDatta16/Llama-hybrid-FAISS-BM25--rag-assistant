Time series modelling peaks for hydrology

In your opinion/ based on your experience, what is the best time series model (AR,ARMA,ARMAX,ARIMAX,ARCH,GARCH, or others) that is able to better reproduce the peaks of a time series. And if so, could you please suggest me a R/matlab/phyton package to do so? I'm dealing with an hydrological time series: predicting the discharge peaks is the most important thing when we are dealing with flood forecasting. Thank you in advance.
