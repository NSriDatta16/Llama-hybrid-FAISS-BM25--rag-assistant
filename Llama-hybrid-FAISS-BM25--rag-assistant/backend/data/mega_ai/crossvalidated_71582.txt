Traditionally, we don't worry about non trading days and count this as regularly spaced data. There are however two possible effects that you'd have to worry about. The first is the effect of time on momentum and interaction with leading indicators. If you have a lagged variable that is a good leader - let's say it's mean temperature - then some of your data points will be lagged to the next day (Friday -> Thurs) while others are lagged three days (Monday -> Friday). There's likely to be spurious results because of that. The second issue is activity that happens when markets are closed. After hours trading, options pricing, etc. If those are a factor, you may be better off calculating a regularly spaced time series and interpolating or accounting for non-trading days some other way.
