In C, you have to provide the space of where to store something yourself. "md5 " has only room for 4 characters (+ a nul terminator). There is not enough space to append "blah" there. More important, you cannot modify a string literal. They are usually read only. So, you have to: Provide storage where you can store the new, concatenated result. Makes sure there's enough room in that storage for the resulting string. E.g.: char result[9]; //the result here needs 8 characters + a nul terminator strcpy(result,"md5 "); strcat(result,"blah" Or, e.g. const char *a = "md5 "; const char *b = "blah"; char *result = malloc(strlen(a) + strlen(b) + 1); if(result == NULL) { out of memory return; } strcpy(result,a); strcat(result,b);
