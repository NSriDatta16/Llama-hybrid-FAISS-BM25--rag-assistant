 Wearable Devices to Detect Symptoms of COVID-19 Smart lenses On-teeth sensors Face masks Smart textiles Electronic epidermal tattoos Micro needle patches Wristbands Smart rings Smartwatches Smartwatches Wearable technology such as Apple Watches and Fitbits have been used to potentially diagnose symptoms of COVID-19. Monitors within the devices have been designed to detect heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level, etc. The diagnostic capabilities of wearable devices proposes an easier way to detect any abnormalities within the human body. Estimation and prediction techniques of wearable technology for COVID-19 has several flaws due to the inability to differentiate between other illnesses and COVID-19. Elevations in blood pressure, heart rate, etc. as well as a fluctuation in oxygen level can be attributed to other sicknesses ranging from the common cold to respiratory diseases. The inability to differentiate these illnesses has caused "unnecessary stress in patients, raising concern on the implementation of wearables for health." Remote monitoring devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems are also being progressively deployed for managing chronic illnesses through remote patient care and shared decision-making. However, more policy and implementation efforts remain vital to fully harness digital health potentials while ensuring equitable access. Smart Masks In addition to wearable devices such as watches, professionals designed face masks with built in sensors for individuals to use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The built in sensors were designed to detect characteristics of exhaled breath such as "patterns and rates of respiration, biomarkers of inflammation and the potential detection of airborne pathogens." Smart masks "contain a sensor that monitors the presence of a SARS-CoV-2 protease in the breath." Contained in the mask is a blister pack, which, when broken, causes a chemical reaction to occur. As a result of the chemical reaction, the sensor will turn blue if the virus is detected from an individual's breathing. Issues occur however with the amount of protease needed to warrant a correct result from the sensor. An individual's breath only contains protease once the cells die. Then they make their way out of the body in fluids such a saliva, and through breathing. If too little protease is present, the mask may not be able to detect the protease thus causing a false result. Smart Lenses Smart lenses have been developed to record intraocular pressure. The lens conforms to the eyeball and contains sensors in which monitor glucose levels, eye movement, and certain biomarkers for particular diseases. Built into the lenses are micro electronics and processing units that are responsible for data collection. With the innovation of technology, smart lenses have the potential to "incorporate displays that superimpose information onto what the wearer sees." Smart Textiles Smart textiles have been developed to monitor skin temperature and metabolites. These textiles contain sensors which are composed of three basic parts: "containing substrate, active elements, and electrode/interconnect." Although smart textiles can provide a way for individuals to diagnose abnormalities about their body, there are a multitude of challenges associated with the usage. Economic burdens to patients and hospitals as well as the high cost of purchasing and upkeep provide a hinderance to the application of smart textiles. The development of these sensors also face many challenges such as "the selection of suitable substrates, biocompatible materials, and manufacturing techniques, as well as the instantaneous monitoring of different analysts[sic], the washability, and uninterrupted signal display circuits." Smart Rings Smart rings have been developed to monitor blood pressure. Micro Needle Patches Micro needle patches have been developed to monitor metabolites, inflammation markers, drugs, etc. They are also very advantageous for various reasons: "
