The pacakge leaps in R has functions, like regsubsets , that do this. Essentially, what this functions do is they compare different models with criteria that you can choose and take the model that does the best according to the criterium chosen. Please note that keeping the model with the highest $R^2$ is not a very good criterium, as models with more variables will always have higher $R^2$. The criteria that regsubsets can use are adjusted R^2 and Bayesian Information Criterion , among others.
