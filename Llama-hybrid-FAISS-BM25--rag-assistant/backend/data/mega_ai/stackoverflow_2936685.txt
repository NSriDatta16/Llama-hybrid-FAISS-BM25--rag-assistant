JPQL: What kind of objects contains a result list when querying multiple columns?

I'm trying to do something which is easy as pie in PHP & Co: SELECT COUNT(x) as numItems, AVG(y) as average, ... FROM Z In PHP I would get a simple array like [{ numItems: 0, average: 0 }] which I could use like this: echo "Number of Items: " . $result[0]['numItems']; Usually in JPQL you only query single objects or single columns and get Lists types, for example List or List . But what do you get, when querying multiple columns?
