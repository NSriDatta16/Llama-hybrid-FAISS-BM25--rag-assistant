Why is regression line represented as $y = b0 + b1 * x$?

I am new to Data Science and ran into Regression Line formula which is $ y = b0 + b1 *x $ (where x is dependent variable, y is predicted variable) I understood the meaning of this formula as a linear graph. However, I did not get this part: $b1 = \frac{\sum (x*y - \bar x*\bar y)}{\sum (x^2 - \bar x^2)}$ How can $b1$ be calculated like so?
