How to create a simple Custom Container control with 2 Divs inside?

Im looking to create a custom ASP.NET container control that will allow me to drag further controls into it within the VS designer. The final HTML that im looking for is very simple.. With additional controls being able to be dragged into panels 2 and 3. Im sure its very simple but im struggling to find examples that will help. Any pointers or ideas are appreciated! Cheers Stuart
