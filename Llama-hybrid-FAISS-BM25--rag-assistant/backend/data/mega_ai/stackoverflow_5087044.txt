I was able to get this working using Adobe's File Packager Tool which Samuel described. I didn't use the NetStream object but I used the OSMF Sample Player which I assume uses this internally. Here's how to do with without using FMS: Get Adobe's File Packager for Http Dynamic Streaming from http://www.adobe.com/products/httpdynamicstreaming/ Run the File Packager on an existing MP4 file containing H.264/AAC like this: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Flash Media Server 4\tools\f4fpackager> f4fpackager.exe --input-file="MyFile.mp4" --segment-duration=30 This will result in 30 second long F4F files, also F4X and a F4M file. The F4F files are your correctly segmented (and fragmented) MP4 files that should play. If you want to test this using the OSMF Player also do the following: Get Apache Server Get Adobe's Http Origin Module for Apache from http://www.adobe.com/products/httpdynamicstreaming/ Install the module according to http://help.adobe.com/en_US/HTTPStreaming/1.0/Using/WS8d6ed60bd880807c48597a9e1265edd6cc0-8000.html Put the F4F, F4X and F4M file into the vod directory under httpdocs Get the “OSMF Sample Player for HTTP Dynamic Streaming” from http://www.osmf.org/downloads/OSFMPlayer_zeri2.zip Put the Sample Player in the httpdocs directory Load the html file from the Sample Player in a browser eg http://localhost/OSMFPlayer.html Press the eject button and put in the URL of your F4M file, it should play So to answer the original question Adobe's File Packager is the file splitter to use, you don't need to buy FMS to use it and it works for FLV and MP4/F4V files.
