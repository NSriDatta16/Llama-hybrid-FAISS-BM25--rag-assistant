A common complaint about Python’s syntax is that it’s impossible to generate Python code on the fly, from a program. If you want, use Rcmdr (R pkg) to do your analysis and machine learning. You can export the output AND THE CODE. I use since long time the two languages. Python is powerful but it has this black point.
