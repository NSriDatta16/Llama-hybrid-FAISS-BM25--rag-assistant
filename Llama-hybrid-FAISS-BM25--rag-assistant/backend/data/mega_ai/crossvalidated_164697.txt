I guess your question is how to decide whether we need log transformations in the regression: Including all the variables in the same step does not help. However, the specification you have is not quite rite. ( X and XlogX will give you complicated partial derivatives) Simple way to do this is: Run the logistic regression with original variables Y=β0+β1X1+β2X2+... Run the logistic regression with log transformations Y=β0 +β1lnX1+β2 lnX2+... And choose the one with better performance.
