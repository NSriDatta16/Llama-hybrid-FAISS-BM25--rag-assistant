Creating chess GUI in WPF

Firstly: apologies if this is a duplicate post. Things got a bit confusing as I'm trying to post/register at same time. I started investigating running UCI chess engines from a simple WPF window, got the hang of having the chess engine running onf a different thread to the interface, and have created a reasonably servcieable text-based front end. I'm getting a bit more ambitious now, and would like to start building a GUI with chess pieces on it that will feed the player's moves to the chess engine, and represent the engine's moves on the board as well. I'm aiming for draggable pieces rather than clicking squares. My current attempts involve using draggable user controls for the pieces on a element. I'd be really interested to hear how other, more experienced WPF/.NET programmers would approach this, as I'm not entirely convinced I'm on the right track. For example: would it be better to use a uniform grid and drag piece data between child elements? Should I create an abstract 'piece' class from which pieces such as pawns could derive? That kind of thing. Any thoughts? This isn't a homework assignment or anything, just something I'm noodling around with in my spare time as an exercise.
