Nope, there is no time interval data type in MySQL. There is a feature request for one though, but apparently it hasn't gotten much attention. The time type can be used for such a purpose though, as suggested by the documentation MySQL retrieves and displays TIME values in 'HH:MM:SS' format (or 'HHH:MM:SS' format for large hours values). TIME values may range from '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'. The hours part may be so large because the TIME type can be used not only to represent a time of day (which must be less than 24 hours), but also elapsed time or a time interval between two events (which may be much greater than 24 hours, or even negative).
