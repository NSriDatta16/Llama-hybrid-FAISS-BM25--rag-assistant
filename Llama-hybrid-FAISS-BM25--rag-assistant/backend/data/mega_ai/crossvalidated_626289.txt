Is bayesian updating framework a valid concept?

When I google search for the term, only 6 pages showed up. There is no authoritative paper on this, except https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6430 which argues for using informatics concepts to generalize a prior. It seems an attempt to reconcile Bayesian inference with machine learning concepts. Is bayesian updating framework a valid concept in the statistics community?
