This link should help: Best HTML Editors Here is a complete list: List of HTML Editors I use mainly visual studio 2010 for my html but I guess if your more geared towards ui you can aim for Expression Web or Adobe Dreamweaver. HTH I Recommend you use Visual Studio or Expression Web because they contain a toolbox with drag and drop html and asp.net controls that generate html code. Really you could possibly do everything in design view without ever having to write html code.
