It does allow you to write efficient/tight programs. Partly because the ability to define defining words (words executing at compile time) can have the effect of effectively defining a Domain Specific Language (DSL). Forth also encourage refactoring (otherwise the stack stuff simply becomes incomprehensible ...) and thus the code will be tight.
