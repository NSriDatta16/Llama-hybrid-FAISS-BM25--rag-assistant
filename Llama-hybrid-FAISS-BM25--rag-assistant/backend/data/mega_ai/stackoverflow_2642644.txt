Rails: validates_acceptance_of acting crazy

Whats wrong with this picture? Model: validates_acceptance_of :terms_of_service, :on => :create, :accept => true, :allow_nil => false accessor :terms_of_service View: "margin-left:0px"}, 1, 0 %> And in the DB I have organisations.terms_of_service. Every time I get "Terms of service must be accepted" If I use "margin-left:0px"}, true, false %> The validation still fails. If I turn off :accept => true, It the validation seems to pass but when I look at postgres it says false. Isn't Rails supposed to be casting this stuff? Why don't I seem to be able to say: Model: validates_acceptance_of :terms_of_service, :accept => true view: check_box blah, blah, options, true and see a true in my database? Any ideas on whats going on? Pertinent info: DB is Postgres and running Rails 2.1
