Advantages of setting up a dedicated data science as an independent discipline, which I can think of: There would be more and more data scientists who can cater to the growing demand for them, in companies and industries in almost every domain. The concept of statistics, algorithms (ML would be included in this), and Big Data don't need to exist as chapters in separate domains. Now, they can exist as part of the data science workflow in this program. Data Scientists would be more aware how data science would be applicable in the domain of business. The concepts of business knowledge for data scientists is often found wanting. Data scientists with a knowledge of Business Statistics is in huge demand, and a domain dedicated program would help serving the needs.
