How to solve (or even effectively think about) a complex real-life multivariate problem

In my work, we get estimates. An estimate may include up to 12 different categories of costs (Development, Legal Travel, etc.) to produce any number of assets/deliverables from dozens of different deliverable categories (TV Spot, Radio, Podcast, Talent Session, etc.). Each estimate will come with a quantity (simple integer count) of each type of deliverable received for the sum of all the costs in the estimate. I am attempting to derive a decent/ballpark (not perfect) "cost per" model or function for deliverables. "I want to produce 5 Videos and 4 Radio Spots and 6 Digital Banners....about how much can I expect this to cost?" The problem is that estimates almost always contain multiple types of deliverables , and you do not have the pleasure of seeing which costs within each estimate apply to which deliverable. Some costs might seem to match a deliverable. For example, you might have an estimate with "Video" deliverables and a "Video Production" cost, but you can't assume any cost applies to a specific deliverable. You simply have a TOTAL for the estimate, and a count of each deliverable asset that you get. Of course, the cost to produce a Video is almost always going to be higher than the cost to produce a photograph, and so I'm hoping that over many samples, I can take advantage of those generalities. But there are many variable. We do not have enough samples (under 10k) to build a neural network or for this as the dimensions and feature set are simply far too wide. We can't use a regression effectively for the same reason - too many dimensions for the sample size. So I'm trying to think about this algebraically. Is there a system of equations and/or matrix method I can use, over thousands of estimates like these, to derive a "cost per" for a given deliverable type? How should I be thinking about this problem, or is this a dead end exercise given the number of unknowns?
