I'm Looking for dataset with Name, Father's Name, Mother's name, Age, Gender, Ethnicity, ~Birthplace

I am new to Data Science and I don't know where to find datasets, I Google searched, Asked ChatGPT and friends, but couldn't find what I was looking for. My project is to generate new names based on the data I mentioned in above title of this question using GANs. I really appreciate any help regarding this. Thank you. P.S. Since "normal" people's data might not be public but Celebrities data is public, my last option would be web scraping that data. I also looked at Kaggle, data world and other places...
