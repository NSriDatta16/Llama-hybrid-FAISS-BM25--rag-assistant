For projects with a lot of javascript, I use a build system (makefiles) with a javascript minimizer . As the jsmin author notes, stripping comments "encourages a more expressive programming style because it eliminates the download cost of clean, literate self-documentation." The bonus is that jsmin also strips comments from CSS - so you can start commenting freely there as well. (I find that using css classes is crucial for writing clear javascript.) It's an interesting idea to use PHP to dynamically strip out the code and organize javascript files. Keep in mind that an important optimization for web apps is to reduce HTTP requests so it is often wise to join smaller javascript files together. (I've found that simply concatenating minimized js files into a single file, works great.)
