My personal favorite is this one: http://fgelinas.com/code/timepicker/ This works great and is really fast to work with - three clicks to set the time. And it's elegantly written, with code that closely resembles the jQuery UI date-picker approach and style. It does minutes in 5-minute increments, however - not sure if that's precise enough for your purposes.
