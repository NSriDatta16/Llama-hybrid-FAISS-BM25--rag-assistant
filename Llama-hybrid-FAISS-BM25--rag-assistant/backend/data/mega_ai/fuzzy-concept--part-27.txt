standard way, so that the same sorts of cases and the same sorts of circumstances are treated equally. Otherwise one would be accused of arbitrariness, which would not serve the interests of justice. Consequently, lawmakers aim to devise definitions and categories which are sufficiently precise, so that they are not open to different interpretations. For this purpose, it is critically important to remove fuzziness, and differences of interpretation are typically resolved through a court ruling based on evidence. Alternatively, some other procedure is devised which permits the correct distinction to be discovered and made. In administration, archiving and accounting, fuzziness problems in interpretation and boundary problems can arise, because it is not clear to what category exactly a case, item, document, transaction or piece of data belongs. In principle, each case, event or item must be allocated to the correct category in a procedure, but it may be, that it is difficult to make the appropriate or relevant distinctions. In everyday online Internet use, almost all search queries by employees, citizens and consumers are processed/solved with software partly based on fuzzy concepts, fuzzy logic and fuzzy ontologies. All the hi-tech corporations, companies and state-owned organizations use fuzzy string searching algorithms in the digital services they supply. Generalities Many concepts which are used fairly universally in daily life (such as "love", "God", "health", "social", "sustainability" "tolerance" etc.) are considered to be intrinsically fuzzy concepts, to the extent that their meaning usually cannot be completely and exactly specified with logical operators or objective terms, and can have multiple interpretations and personal (subjective) meanings. Yet such concepts are not at all meaningless. People keep using the concepts, even if they are difficult to define precisely. Multiple meanings It may also be possible to specify one personal meaning for the concept, without however placing restrictions on a different use of the concept in other contexts (as when, for example, one says "this is what I mean by X" in contrast to other possible meanings). In ordinary speech, concepts may sometimes also be uttered purely randomly; for example a child may repeat the same idea in completely unrelated contexts, or an expletive term may be uttered arbitrarily. A feeling or sense is conveyed, without it being fully clear what it is about. Happiness may be an example of a word with variable meanings depending on context or timing. Ambiguities Fuzzy concepts can be used deliberately to create ambiguity and vagueness, as an evasive tactic or a ruse, or to bridge what would otherwise be immediately recognized as a contradiction of terms. They might be used to indicate that there is definitely a connection between two things, without giving a complete specification of what the connection is, for some or other reason. This could be due to a failure or refusal to be more precise. It could be academic bluff or pretense of knowledge. But it could also be a prologue to a more exact formulation of a concept, or to a better understanding of it. Efficiency Fuzzy concepts can be used as a practical method to describe something of which a complete description would be an unmanageably large undertaking, or very time-consuming; thus, a simplified indication of what is at issue is regarded as sufficient, although it is not exact. Popper There is also such a thing as an "economy of distinctions", meaning that it is not helpful or efficient to use more detailed definitions than are really necessary for a given purpose. In this sense, Karl Popper rejected pedantry and commented that: "...it is always undesirable to make an effort to increase precision for its own sake – especially linguistic precision – since this usually leads to loss of clarity, and to a waste of time and effort on preliminaries which often turn out to be useless, because they are bypa
