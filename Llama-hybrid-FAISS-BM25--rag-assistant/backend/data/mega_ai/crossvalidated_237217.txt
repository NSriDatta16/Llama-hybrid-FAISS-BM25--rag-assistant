How do I calculate the structure-matrix and standardized discriminant coefficients from a Linear Discriminant model in R?

First post here, but long-time lurker. I'm working on a batch of multivariate data and want to make comparisons between the standardized coefficients generated by an LDA and the standardized loadings generated by a PCA. I've read through the posts ( and here ), where ttnphns and Etienne had a great exchange about PCA and LDA. I'm looking for some code in R to calculate what ttnphns describes as the standardized discriminant coefficients and pooled within-groups correlations between variable and discriminants. I know that ttnphns offers the formulas for how these are calculated, in the posts above but it would be great to get some snippets of code that the community can use to generate these super-useful sets of values! Does anybody have any experience with calculating these from the lda function in MASS? Cheers!
