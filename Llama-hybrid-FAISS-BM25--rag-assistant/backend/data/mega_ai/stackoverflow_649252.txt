Flickr API Key storage

I have a C# application that I want to use Flickr's API . I received my API key and shared secret, but when receiving the key it explicitly mentions not giving out the API key we were provided. Since the app is open source and also easily viewed with Reflector, I don't think storing it as a string is really secure. I could encrypt it with a symmetric key, but that is just obfuscating it since the password for the key will be provided in the code. My question is, is securing the API Key from Flickr actually necessary? If so, are there any recommendations for properly securing the key?
