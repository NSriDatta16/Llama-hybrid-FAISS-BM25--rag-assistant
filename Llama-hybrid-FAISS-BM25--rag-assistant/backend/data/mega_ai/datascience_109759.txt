Generate paragraphs from given words

I am trying to build a ML model that. will take a list of words and will try to produce sentences with those words, based on a language model on an existing corpus. Example: (freenode, today, neural networks) -> (Today I joined the freenode channel for neural networks....) What will be the right (and easiest) approach to do this? I was trying to find an LSTM RNN based solution, but things get trickier once I feed more than one word to the network.
