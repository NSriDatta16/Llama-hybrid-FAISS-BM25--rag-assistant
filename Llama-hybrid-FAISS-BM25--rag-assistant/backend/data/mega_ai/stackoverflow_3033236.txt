The script doesn't support chrome. Read through it in most of the functions like checkForUrlChange() it looks at the name of the browser to decide what to do. Because chrome and safari are both based on webkit, you can try to change the line useragent.indexOf("safari") != -1 to useragent.indexOf("safari") != -1 || useragent.indexOf("chrome") != -1 to see if that works. If not, try using unfocus history keeper. It supports Chrome. ( http://www.unfocus.com/projects/historykeeper/ )
