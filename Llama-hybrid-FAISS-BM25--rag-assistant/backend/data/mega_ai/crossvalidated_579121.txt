To be strict, your data is a time series of count data and thus cannot be handled by most of the standard models like ARIMA. However, it is very often done nonetheless and then considered as an approximation. Yet, there are libraries that provide models for time series of count data, e.g. the R package tscount . It provides forecasting which could be used for outlier detection. Another approach that I would suggest is transforming your time series $y_t$ into: $$ z_t := \log(y_t+s), $$ where $s$ is some small number, e.g. $0.1$ , added only to make sure that your data never becomes zero. Then you do ordinary time series analysis with this new time series which doesn't have any constraints anymore. This has the advantage of being straightforward and you can immediately apply standard libraries for detecting outliers in time series as e.g. tsoutliers . Last but not least, there are also more sophisticated ways of analyzing positive time series in general, like e.g. PTSR . However, as far as I can see, here you have to do the outlier detection part of the task yourself.
