Take one MemDC for main dialog A and Combined MemDC for B & C. Now when u drag C , you are supposed to combined these 2 MemDC depending on current position by using BitBlt function and then finally you have to do bitblt of combined memDC on actual DC of the dialog. Along with this you have to override onerasebackground method , so flicker wont be there.
