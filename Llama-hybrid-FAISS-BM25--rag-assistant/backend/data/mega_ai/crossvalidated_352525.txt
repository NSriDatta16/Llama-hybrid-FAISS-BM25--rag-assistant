Pearson Correlations in time series between time and value

I'm wondering if it make sense, or simply your opinion about this: I have a dataset with a value, and a time variable. let's suppose that the time variable is month, like time = c(1,2,3,4,5 ), and the value = c(2,3,5,2,4) . In this case: time = c(1,2,3,4,5) value = c(2,3,5,2,4) In your opinion (if months increase more than 12 in the next years), is it correct and does it make sense to calculate the Pearson Correlation cor(time,value) [1] 0.3638034 between time and value to see if there is positive, negative or not correlation (in this case positive)? I think that as a formula could works, but I do not know it's an error to force the month a qualitative ordinal variable, to months in number, a quantitative interval variable and use them to Correlation. EDIT I've thought this because: I have a big quantity of"moving" small time series (add one incoming month, remove first month) long 6 months. I need to see,for each of these time series, if the trend is growing or decreasing without an inferential point of view (think about the small time series as is, not a sample of a stocastic process, I suppose). I've thoght that the Correlation could help to see if there is a linear relationship between time and values, but reading all those answer, it does not seems the best way.
