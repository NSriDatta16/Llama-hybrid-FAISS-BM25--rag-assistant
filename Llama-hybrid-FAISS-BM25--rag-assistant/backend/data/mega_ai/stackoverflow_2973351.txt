Can you try by setting the system property in your code like System.setProperty("javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory", "net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl"); do this before getting an instance of TransformerFactory. Note: this will force all the webapps on your Tomcat to use saxon - so you have to make sure any other webapps which were using the default are okay.
