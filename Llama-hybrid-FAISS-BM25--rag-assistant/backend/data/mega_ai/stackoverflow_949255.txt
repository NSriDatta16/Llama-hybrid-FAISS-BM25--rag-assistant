scala Map filterKeys: Projection cannot be assigned to a Map reference

The following code: var m: Map[String, Int] = Map("A" -> 1, "BB" -> 2, "CCC" -> 3) m = m filterKeys { s => s.length Does not compile. I get the following error: error: type mismatch found: collection.this.Map.Projection[scala.this.Predef.String,scala.this.Int] required: collection.this.Map[scala.this.Predef.String,scala.this.Int] m = m filterKeys { s => s.length I don't really understand this as according to the scaladoc a Projection[A,B] extends the trait Map[A,B+] . That is, a Projection is a Map . I thought it might be something to do with the contravariant type B but if I use Any instead of Int , it still doesn't compile. What am I missing? The solution is to do: var m: Map[String, Int] = Map("A" -> 1, "BB" -> 2, "CCC" -> 3) m = Map(m filterKeys { s => s.length but this seems inelegant to me.
