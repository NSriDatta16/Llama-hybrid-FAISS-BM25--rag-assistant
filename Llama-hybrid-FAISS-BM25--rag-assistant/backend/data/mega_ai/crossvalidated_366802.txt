Perhaps you mean binary classification, to do this for multi-class classification would not be straightforward. The answer is no. Formulating as a classification task in general will optimise separability, while regression will optimise line fit. Think about a simple SVM classifier as an example - the decision boundary will be based on the observations nearest to the boundary, while regression will have to model all the observations. Another argument - if you have different costs of missclassification for different classes, then formulating the task as a classification task can optimise for minimising those costs directly, while formulation as a regression will optimise a non-cost sensitive fit, and it would not be straightforward to include discrete costs into the optimisation criteria.
