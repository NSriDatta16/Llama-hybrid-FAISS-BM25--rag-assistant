Yes, the normal distribution is somewhat 'natural' due to its finite variance, but perhaps more of a general averaging construct. To quote a source : The average of a sequence of values from any distribution will approach the normal distribution, provided the original distribution has finite variance... The condition of finite variance is true for almost all systems of practical interest. And further: What is the engineering significance of this averaging process (which is really just a weighted sum)? Many of the quantities we measure are bulk properties, such as viscosity, density, or particle size. We can conceptually imagine that the bulk property measured is the combination of the same property, measured on smaller and smaller components. Even if the value measured on the smaller component is not normally distributed, the bulk property will be as if it came from a normal distribution. So, per the question, 'Does a Normal distribution imply a natural process?', my answer is that [EDIT], at least,[END EDIT] it is certainly consistent with naturally occurring bulk processes. [EDIT] Further, I would argue that the question is clear, not even a repeated human orchestrated homogeneous reaction system with varying parameters, but, as occurs in nature, so-called heterogeneous chemistry . So particle sizes, for example, are further averaged over many compounds. To claim such a natural heterogeneous system is not at least consistent with a so-called normal distribution associated averaging process is suspect in my view.
