How to get .gcda files when the process is killed?

I have a binary build with -fprofile-arcs and -ftest-coverage . The binary is run by a process monitor which spawns the process as a child process. Then, when I want the process to exit, I have to go through the process monitor. It sends a SIGKILL to the process. I found out that .gcda files do not generate in this case. What can I do? EDIT: Actually the process monitor first tries to make the process exit. However, the ProcessMonitor library (used in each process) calls _exit instead of exit when the user issues a command to stop the process. This is the cause of all trouble.
