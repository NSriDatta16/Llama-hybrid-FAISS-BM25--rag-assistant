Indeed most penalized regression methods correspond to placing a particular type of prior to the regression coefficients. For example, you get the LASSO using a Laplace prior, and the ridge using a normal prior. The tuning parameters are the “hyperparameters” under the Bayesian formulation for which you can place an additional prior to estimate them; for example, for in the case of the ridge it is often assumed that the inverse variance of the normal distribution has a $\chi^2$ prior. However, as one would expect, resulting inferences can be sensitive to the choice of the prior distributions for these hyperparameters. For example, for the horseshoe prior there are some theoretical results that you should place such a prior for the hyperparameters that it would reflect the number of non-zero coefficients you expect to have. A nice overview of the links between penalized regression and Bayesian priors is given, for example, by Mallick and Yi .
