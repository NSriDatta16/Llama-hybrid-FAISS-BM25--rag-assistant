JFreeChart Boxplot appearance

I'm need to create boxplots to analyse and evaluate test results. Since I program in Java this answer convinced me to use JFreeChart. The BoxAndWhisker chart seemed similar to what I wanted. I spent the day to implement and create the dataset and the plot, but I'm confused with the result and also not very satisfied. This is what I expected (the appearance/style not the values): This is what I got: Honestly, all these colorful circles remind me of Micky Mouse, but not of a scientific boxplot. Could you explain to me what all these circles and arrows mean? My guess is the black circle is the average, but I don't know about the two empty circles and the arrows. Also is it possible to change the appearance so it's more similar to the above figure? I saw some options in the BoxAndWhiskerRenderer, but they didn't seem to be what I want.
