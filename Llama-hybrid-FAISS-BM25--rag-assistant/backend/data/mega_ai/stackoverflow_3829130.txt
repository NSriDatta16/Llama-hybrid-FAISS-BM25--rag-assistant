ThreadStatic vs. ThreadLocal Performance: speedups or alternatives?

I recently read this post about poor performance of fields marked ThreadStatic - they're apparently 60x slower than normal field access. Does .NET 4's ThreadLocal perform any better? Are there any alternatives that offer high performance thread-specific storage?
