I hope it's ok if I provide an answer for my own question. While I totally agree that this is a mis-specification problem and the data can't be modelled with a GP appropriately, I just realized that when initially asking the question I had a wrong understanding of how to interpret the variance. So the idea that I initially had, was that the variance given by the GP at a location is the variance of the data at that point. Which is not the case. So there ware basically two things that are essential to understand here: the variance only depends on the location x and not on the target y. (see "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning" page 35 formula 2.26) adding samples to the data set will always decrease but never increase the variance (or stay the same) (see page 31) So all in all: the variance will never increase when adding data. Note: the proof for that is left as an exercise in the GPML book (exercise 2.9.4), which I wasn't able to follow through, so if anyone did the proof, it'd be great if you could add it.
