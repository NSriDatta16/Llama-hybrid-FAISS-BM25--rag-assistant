Is it possible combine polynomial regression terms?

I am dealing with a time series problem and one of the transformations that I am using is a moving slope of a line fit by linear regression on the last $w$ data, which is the window size. However, my data is not always linear, so I thought of using a polynomial regression, but then I would have two terms representing what before was the slope: $a + bx + cx^2$ Is there a way to combine $b$ and $c$ ?
