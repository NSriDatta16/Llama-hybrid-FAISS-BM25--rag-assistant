Access methods of a class from a control template in a resource dictionary

I want to make a WindowBaseClass that derives from Window but has a few custom functionalities. Such that WindowStyle would be none, I have my own color scheme applied and also have a resize logic. Here is a snippet of the XAML that contains one of the 'borders' that has a MouseMOve and PreviewMouseDown events. In my code behind I have methods such as resize, drag etc. When it is all contained in a Window1.xaml/.cs it's all working nice. Now I want to create a custom template (in a resource dictionary for example) with my color schemes and I want the PreviewMouseDown from the rectangle to point to the method defined in a class that extends Window. Can it be done? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
