Converting app to MVC and running it in both console and gui

I have a simple java gui calculator, with 3 number systems (there are some bugs but that doesn't matter now). Currently all code is in one file. My task is to rewrite it as MVC, and add possibility to run it in either gui or console mode. How should I divide this program to organise it as M-V-C ? Is it written properly enough to add console functionality to it? (guess I'll have to change all methods invoking to JLabel Output to something simply storing an output String as a model argument and then having View to get it). Here's the starting code : http://paste.pocoo.org/show/224566/ Here's what I already have : Main : http://paste.pocoo.org/show/224567/ Model : http://paste.pocoo.org/show/224570/ View : http://paste.pocoo.org/show/224569/ Controller : http://paste.pocoo.org/show/224568/ I don't have view in my model so I can't call to Output. That's the first problem I can see.
