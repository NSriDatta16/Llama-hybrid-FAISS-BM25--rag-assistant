A good reference article on this topic can be found here . Note: This is a very OLD article dating back to the days of .net 1.1 but the general principles about projects / solutions still very much remain the same and still apply, IMO Note that this article is talking about how to structure solutions and use with VSS but the general principle of how to organize the projects and solutions apply to any source control system (i will take a leap of faith and assume that you do not use VSS :-)) Folder structure, specifically, is something that different projects may even organize differently based on their logical architecture. However, this article will also give you a point of reference to make your point about solutions being at a higher level than the projects in general. This blog is also discussing overall solution / project structure and you might want to use some of the points made here if they are relevant to your code.
