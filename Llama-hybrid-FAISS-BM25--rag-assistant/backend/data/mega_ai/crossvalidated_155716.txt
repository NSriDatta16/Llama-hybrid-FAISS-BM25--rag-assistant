Logistic Regressions require different diagnostics: http://www.r-bloggers.com/residuals-from-a-logistic-regression/ You can used an offset to help with a label imbalance: Using offset in binomial model to account for increased numbers of patients Additionally, when you evaluate the quality of your prediction, I would recommend a Mathews Correlation Coefficient rather than AUC. AUC tends to overestimate given a label imbalance while MCC is normalizes for the label imbalance and will give you a more appropriate answer.
