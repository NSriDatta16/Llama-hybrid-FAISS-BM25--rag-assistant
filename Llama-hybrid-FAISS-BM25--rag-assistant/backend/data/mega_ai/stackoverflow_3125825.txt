What is the relative processing speed of manipulating data with XML or OOP techniques? (i.e. XProc or XSL vs C# or Java)

What is the difference in processing speed for executing a process using XML manipulation or using object-oriented representation? In general, is it faster to maximize or minimize the reliance on XML for a process. Let it be assumed that the code is highly optimized in either circumstance. A simple example of what I am asking is which of the following would execute faster, when called from a C# web application, if the Thing in question were to represent the same qualified entity. // XSL CODE FRAGMENT or // C# Code Fragment void iterate(List things){ List newThings = new List (); things.ForEach(t=>newThings.Add(t)); } A complex example of might be whether it is faster to manipulate a system of objects and functions in C# or a system of xml documents in an XProc pipeline. Thanks a lot.
