Pre-post treatment design: accounting for reduced effect of treatment in baseline high scorers

I'm planning a study in which I want to test the effect of a treatment on a dependent psychometric variable. I expect subjects who score lower at baseline to benefit more from the treatment (larger score difference pre-post), and I expect the treatment to have less of an effect on subjects who score high at baseline (smaller score difference pre-post). This is not due to a shortcoming of the psychometric measure but due to the underlying psychometric construct. I have empirical data of a small ( n = 10) pre-study with identical design that I could use to quantify this effect. Is there a more elegant solution to test this than to perform a median split?
