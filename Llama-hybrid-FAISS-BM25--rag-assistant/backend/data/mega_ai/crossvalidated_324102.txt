SVM: can you determine the which kernel function is the best to use given the margins length?

This is a bit of a theoretical question that I thought about the other day... Assuming I got 2 SVM classifiers that were obtained by using different kernel functions, can I determine which one will perform better by just seeing which one has the widest separation margins?
