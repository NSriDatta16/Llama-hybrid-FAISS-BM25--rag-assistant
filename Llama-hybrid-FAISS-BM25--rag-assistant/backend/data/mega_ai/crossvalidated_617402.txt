As I lay out in this answer , doing hypothesis tests on simulated data doesn't make much sense (other than as a way to evaluate a statistical method). To quote that answer: The null hypothesis of no difference between treatments is false by design . The p-value is therefore meaningless to begin with. Note that you can still use the ANOVA framework to partition the variance explained by the different factors - it's the p-values that are useless. If you were working with numerical predictors and were concerned about nonlinearities in the data, you could use flexible methods like GAMs or random forests to describe variation in the data. Since all your predictors are categorical (if I understand correctly), this would not be very useful to you.
