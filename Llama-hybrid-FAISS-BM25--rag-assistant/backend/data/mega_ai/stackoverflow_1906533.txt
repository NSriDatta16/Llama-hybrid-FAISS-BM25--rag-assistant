Finding WndProc Address

How can I find the address of a WndProc (of a window of another process ). Even if I inject a DLL and try to find it with either GetClassInfoEx() or GetWindowLong() or GetWindowLongPtr() I always get values like 0xffff08ed, which is definitely not an executable address. It is according to MSDN: "... the address of the window procedure, or a handle representing the address of the window procedure." Unfortunately that is not good enough for me I need the actual address. Spy++ does the job right most of the time (but even that sometimes fails). So it should be be possible. Thanx. [EDIT:] Kudos to Chris Becke for providing a super fast, and correct solution to my little problem!
