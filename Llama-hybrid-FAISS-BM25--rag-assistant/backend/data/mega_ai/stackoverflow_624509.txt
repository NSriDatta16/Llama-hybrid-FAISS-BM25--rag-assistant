Cannot install components that worked under D7 in D2009

I have lots of components that worked perfectly under D7. I managed to compile and install them by dragging them into the Delphi 2009 IDE. However, when I try to use those components in a project, the compiler says it cannot find the source code of them. Where I can enter the path to that library? Solution: I dragged and dropped the old DPK file in Delphi 2009. Then in project manager I choose “Build” an then “Install”. Everything worked smoothly except that the applications that used the controls couldn't see its source. Problem solved by adding the path into the Tool-Options-Library Win32. Thanks to everybody and especially to Mohammed.
