What are the most effective R packages for classification problems?

Let's say we have data of the following form: a categorical response $y$ and covariates $x_1,x_2,...,x_p$ that can be either categorical or continuous (a very common scenario). Further, let's say the covariates are noisy, and there are a lot of them (high dimensionality). What machine learning / R-packages are surprisingly effective/robust at solving this kind of problem? I find randomForest to be surprisingly effective in that it handles noise and high-dimensionality very well. What other techniques/packages are there with this property. I know this question may seem to be opinionated. But I am just asking based on your experience what technique/package have you found that handles high noise and dimensionality robustly? This can be useful to everyone looking to try out new techniques and packages (and also, I believe that is where a lot of the power of R comes from).
