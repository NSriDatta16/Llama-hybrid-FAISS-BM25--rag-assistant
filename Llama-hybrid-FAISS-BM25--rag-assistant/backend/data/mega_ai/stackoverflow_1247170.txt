Files are in app/layout/default/default/templates/page/ I've not got a dev copy of magento at home, thats all I can remember off the top of my head - will try and remember to confirm when at work. If you want to swap the templates, you need to look in app/layout/default/default/layout/page.xml, plus some of the other xml files - the templates are defined there. (Yes, magento's layout/templating system is complicated, and has a steep learning curve, but its worth it!)
