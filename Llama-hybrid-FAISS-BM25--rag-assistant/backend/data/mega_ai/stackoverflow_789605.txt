spender is correct, but he didn't explain it much. wmode is an attribute that gets set in the html when you embed the swf, and it needs to be set to transparent. So if you were using AC_RunActiveContent you'd add "wmode", "transparent" as arguments to the embedding function, or in swfoject you'd add so.addVariable("wmode", "transparent");
