Depending on how you access stored fields, they may all be loaded into memory (basically, if you use a FieldCache everything will be cached into memory after the first use). And if you have a gig of storage which is taking up memory, that's a gig less to use for your actual index. Depending on how much memory you have, this may be a performance enhancement, or a performance detriment.
