Weighing groups when there is a significant difference in sample sizes

Let's say I am trying to compare average scores between three different groups. Group A contains 20 cases, group B contains 40 cases, and group C contains 300 cases. What I originally wanted to do is weigh the cases so that each group receives equal representation, based on this: Total cases = 360 Subgroups = 3 Weight assigned to each subgroup = 360/3 = 120 Therefore, a case in group A will be given a weight of 120/20, while a case in group C will be given a weight on 120/300. However, since group C is an order of magnitude greater than group A, it seems that the cases in group A will be strongly overrepresented compared to what was actually sampled. The question: is this acceptable, or is it something that needs to be accounted for? If so, then how? I considered randomly sampling a group of 40 cases out of group C, and then using them for the analysis (with the same weighing as described earlier).
