How do I enable code-completion in Netbeans 6.8 for facelets in JSF 1.2?

I'd like to enable code completion for facelets + JSF 1.2 in NetBeans 6.8. I'd prefer to enable it for a free-form project that I build using my own Ant build.xml, but I see no options to enable that, so I'm willing to go with a "Web Application with Existing Sources". Sorry for all of the screen-shots. I just want to show what I did. Project Setup Project Configuration After setup and configuration, code-completion within facelets still doesn't work. Am I missing something? Am I going about this in the wrong way? Solution Here's what I ended up doing: I switched from a Standard Java project to a Web project (duh!) I took Awano's advice and switched the MIME type for xhtml files back to text/xhtml. I added the tld file from the facelets site to the meta-inf directory in the jsf-facelets.jar and included it in my project. I added the rendered attribute to the fragment tag in the jsf-ui.tld file. It was missing for some reason: rendered false false Renders the contents of this tag if the attribute resolves to true.
