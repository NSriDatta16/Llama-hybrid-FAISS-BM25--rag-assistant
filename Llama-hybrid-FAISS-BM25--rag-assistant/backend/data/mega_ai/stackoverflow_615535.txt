I'm going to second the use of GWT . I've used it for several projects and, when used in combination with a modern editor like Eclipse or IDEA , it really makes the mess manageable. It's important to note that not only does it allow you to write in Java and have that transformed into optimized and obfuscated Javascript it also comes with a substantial subset of the core Java API. In addition to this they provide lots of additional classes for doing things like parsing and working with JSON and XML and communicating with a server via asynchronous HTTP . You can check out the docs to get an idea of what else they offer. Another feature that might be of special interest to you for implementing drag and drop functionality is it's integration with javascript libraries like Ext and scriptaculous . Either through pre-built interfaces or via JSNI
