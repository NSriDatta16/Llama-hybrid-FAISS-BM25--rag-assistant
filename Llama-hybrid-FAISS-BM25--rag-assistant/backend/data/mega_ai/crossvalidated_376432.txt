For your 4th question: I don't think you can conclude much from this plot beyond the fact that a two component reduction of your data doesn't seem to allow a good categorization. For your 1st and 2nd: It still could be that, on your original 300 variable data set, linear models work well (or not), nonlinear models work well (or not). For your 3rd: I don't understand. Data can't be linear or nonlinear - that's a characteristic of models, not data - and, since you've shown nothing about the full data set, you can't draw conclusions about it. If you had found that the two components extracted 90% of the variance, then the above would have to be amended. But you haven't told us how well the PCA worked.
