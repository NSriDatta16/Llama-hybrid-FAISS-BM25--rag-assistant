Statistical test for preference data through average differences or is other method more suitable?

I need your help. I'm designing a questionary and there I want test which version the people prefere. Which of the following methods is better and which statistical test for significance in each method is most suitable? Method 1: Rating of each version and calculation if the averages of each version are significantly different. How do you like the following versions? 1-5 scale with 1: poor and 5: good, each version is rated version 1 version 2 version 3 So in the end each version will have a rating average and then I can calculate if the averages are significantly different but with which statistical test and is method 1 even a good choice? Method 2: Which version do you prefere the most? single choice, so one can choose only single version of three version 1 version 2 version 3 So in the end I will have votings for example: 10 for version 1, 20 for version 2 and 30 for version 3 (total 60 votings). Which statistical test is suitable to tell if version 3 is significantly more desirable than version 1 and 2 and is method 2 a better choice than method 1?
