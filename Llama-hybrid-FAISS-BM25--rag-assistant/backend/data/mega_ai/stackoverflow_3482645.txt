I'm not sure if it's the method itself that is increasing the memory usage but likely your view controller that's being loaded in? Also try adding these lines in your animation block as I think it's encouraged (please correct me if I am wrong) [currentView viewWillAppear:YES]; [currentView viewDidAppear:YES]; [mainView viewWillDisappear:YES]; [mainView viewDidDisappear:YES]; Also I believe setAnimationTransition is now discouraged in IOS4 so maybe try using + (void)transitionWithView:(UIView *)view duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration options:(UIViewAnimationOptions)options animations:(void (^)(void))animations completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion
