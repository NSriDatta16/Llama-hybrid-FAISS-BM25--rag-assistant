Regularization in Statistics and Machine Learning

Reading the Scikit-learn docs on logistic regression ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression ), I came across this note: Note: Regularization is applied by default, which is common in machine learning but not in statistics. Would it be right to say that the idea of regularization (especially the ridge l2 or lasso l1 penalty) is a contribution that came out of the machine learning community? Or were such methods already known to statisticians? For instance, ridge regression and lasso are mentioned in Elements of Statistical Learning , but I am unsure whether the authors are representative of most statisticians, or if they should rather be considered machine learning researchers. Thank you!
