Silverlight Event Log in Isolated Storage

Has anyone written an event log that uses Isolated Storage in Silverlight 3? Any suggestions on implementing one? Specific questions: Should I keep a stream writer open, or should I open,write, and close for each entry? How should I remove items from the log atomically?
