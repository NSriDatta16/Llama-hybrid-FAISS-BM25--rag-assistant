So far the most impressive aspect of AI has been the ratio of promises to deliveries. In my opinion, the only truly viable approach to computer-based intelligence is simulated neural networks, because all of the things in the real world that we consider to be "intelligent" (humans, chimpanzees, dogs, cockroaches etc.) all possess variants of the same basic control system: a big mess of neurons hooked up to input and output devices. Amazingly, despite this apparent truth, the Computer Science field that calls itself "neural networks" has pretty much abandoned the attempt to simulate actual biological neurons and neuronal structures. I couldn't begin to tell you why this is the case, although I suspect it's because programmers in general do not like going outside their comfort zones and learning about topics outside of Computer Science. The only upside to this is that Terminator is still just a movie.
