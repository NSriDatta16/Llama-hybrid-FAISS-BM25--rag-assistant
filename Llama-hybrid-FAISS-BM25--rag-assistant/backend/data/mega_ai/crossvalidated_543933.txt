Is negative log likelihood calculated in log space or exponential space?

I have a question about calculating negative log likelihood in a machine learning model over a dataset which seems simple but I cannot find a solid answer/explanation online. Is the NLL calculated as an average in log space? $$ NLL = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^N \log p(y_i | x_i) $$ or should it be done in exponential space? $$ NLL = -\log \Big(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^N p(y_i | x_i) \Big) $$
