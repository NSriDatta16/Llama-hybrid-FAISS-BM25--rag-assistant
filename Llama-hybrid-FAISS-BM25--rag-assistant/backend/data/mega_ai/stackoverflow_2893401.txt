Python: Networked IDLE/Redo IDLE front-end while using the same back-end?

Is there any existing web app that lets multiple users work with an interactive IDLE type session at once? Something like: IDLE 2.6.4 Morgan: >>> letters = list("abcdefg") Morgan: >>> # now, how would you iterate over letters? Jack: >>> for char in letters: print "char %s" % char char a char b char c char d char e char f char g Morgan: >>> # nice nice If not, I would like to create one. Is there some module I can use that simulates an interactive session? I'd want an interface like this: def class InteractiveSession(): ''' An interactive Python session ''' def putLine(line): ''' Evaluates line ''' pass def outputLines(): ''' A list of all lines that have been output by the session ''' pass def currentVars(): ''' A dictionary of currently defined variables and their values ''' pass (Although that last function would be more of an extra feature.) To formulate my problem another way: I'd like to create a new front end for IDLE. How can I do this? UPDATE: Or maybe I can simulate IDLE through eval() ? UPDATE 2: What if I did something like this: I already have a simple GAE Python chat app set up, that allows users to sign in, make chat rooms, and chat with each other. Instead of just saving incoming messages to the datastore, I could do something like this: def putLine(line, user, chat_room): ''' Evaluates line for the session used by chat_room ''' # get the interactive session for this chat room curr_vars = InteractiveSession.objects.where("chatRoom = %s" % chat_room).get() result = eval(prepared_line, curr_vars.state, {}) curr_vars.state = curr_globals curr_vars.lines.append((user, line)) if result: curr_vars.lines.append(('SELF', result.__str__())) curr_vars.put() The InteractiveSession model: def class InteractiveSession(db.Model): # a dictionary mapping variables to values # it looks like GAE doesn't actually have a dictionary field, so what would be best to use here? state = db.DictionaryProperty() # a transcript of the session # # a list of tuples of the form (user, line_entered) # # looks something like: # # [('Morgan', '# hello'), # ('Jack', 'x = []'), # ('Morgan', 'x.append(1)'), # ('Jack', 'x'), # ('SELF', '[1]')] lines = db.ListProperty() Could this work, or am I way off/this approach is infeasible/I'm duplicating work when I should use something already built? UPDATE 3 : Also, assuming I get everything else working, I'd like syntax highlighting. Ideally, I'd have some API or service I could use that would parse the code and style it appropriately. for c in "characters": would become: for c in "characters" : Is there a good existing Python tool to do this?
