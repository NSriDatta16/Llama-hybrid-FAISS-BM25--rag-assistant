there are MEMORY LEAKS in IE (including 8) when using png 24 bit! please beware. http://robertnyman.com/2009/05/26/serious-memory-leak-issue-with-24-bit-png-images-with-alpha-transparency-in-internet-explorer/ I used pngs with some jquery to slide some text and the script is dead slow! I removed background pngs and the script is fine.
