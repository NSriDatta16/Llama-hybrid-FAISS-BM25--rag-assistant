I've used the controls from both Infragistics and DevExpress and find the DevExpress ones to be far superior. Although, my Infragistics exposure was .NET 1.1 and DevExpress has been 1.1 to current. Edit: The support available on the DevExpress website has also never failed to solve a problem that I have had, I remember having an issue with the Infragistics grid control and not being able to solve it and believe me, I'm doing a lot more complex stuff with the DevEx stuff currently!
