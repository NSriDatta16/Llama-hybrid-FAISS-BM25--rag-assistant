[ 1 ], [ 2 ] and many other references gives conclusion that BLOBs with size less tha 0.3-1 MB should be stored in database while BLOBs larger than 1 MB - in file system (possibly through FILESTREAM). FACEBOOK.com stores 6.5 (30 with thumbnails and size versions) billions pictures in files system [ 3 ]. Randal's white paper [ 2 ] reasons it by: Well, this does not convince me about necessity to store blobs in database but just about the fact that they should not be accessed/streamed externally through T-SQL but rather through Win32. Other reasons, I did read, also do not look as convincing to me. What are your reasons to store blobs in database instead of in file system? [ 1 ] Ray Barley .
