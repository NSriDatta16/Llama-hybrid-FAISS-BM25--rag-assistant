Questionnaire data analysis

I have a questionnaire for different years. The questionnaire layout is the same for every year. The questionnaire has Likert-scale definitely agree to definitely disagree . The questions are the in one column and the number of responses is corresponding with the liker scale, which is in each row from top to bottom. |-------------| Category1| Q1 | q2 | Category2| Q1 | q2 | q3 |-------------| Average | | | Average | agree | 5 | 5 | 5 | 8 | 9 | 6 | 1 | disagree | 4 | 2 | 2 | 3 4 3 3 This an example of the data. Would I use the survey package? what benefits are there? Or should I use a normal association rule and have an association between the question? This is just an example to see any trends and patterns.
