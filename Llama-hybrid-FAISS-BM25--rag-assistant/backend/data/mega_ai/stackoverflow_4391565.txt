Since you've tagged this question with tomcat , I suggest that you: Create a META-INF/context.xml in your own web application. Add the following code line inside the context.xml. Sample: As Michael Barker said, most application servers cleans requests and sessions after a redeployment, by default. To allow Tomcat to store the session, set saveOnRestart="true" . This allows tomcat to store the session using PersistentManager in a FileStore (meaning, use a file storage system instead of a database storage system). Hope this helps.
