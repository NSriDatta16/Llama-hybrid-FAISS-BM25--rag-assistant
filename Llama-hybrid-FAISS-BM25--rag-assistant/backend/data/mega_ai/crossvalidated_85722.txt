How to interpret GARCH volatility forecast?

I am trying to model the volatility of gold using GARCH models and here is the forecast that I obtained. The plot seems to indicate that the volatility decreases as time passes but I was expecting to see something like an increased volatility over time. Can anyone explain why this is the case? Please don't pay attention to the x-axis don't know how to change that, it's like that by default, the real date is 2009-2013.
