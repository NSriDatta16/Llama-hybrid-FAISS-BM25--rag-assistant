Eclipse IDE. See list of all a class's inherited methods

Gonna keep this one short. Is there any way to click on the name of a class in the editor and see a list of all of its methods (inherited and otherwise) in another window? This relates to my other question here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4457751/drag-and-drop-with-andengine-android , where I'm afraid I am overlooking a useful method. Many thanks in advance for any help. -Justian M.
