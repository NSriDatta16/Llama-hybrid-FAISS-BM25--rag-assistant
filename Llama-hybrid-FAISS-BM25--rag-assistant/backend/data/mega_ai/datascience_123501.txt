options for doing future state prediction for a state machine based on past state transitions

I want to predict future state sequence w.r.t. time of a state machine using information of past state transitions along the time axis. Take a state machine of 5 states 0,1,2,3,4 as an example, the past state transitions can look like below: The x-axis is time in some unit. The current state has a large dependence on what the previous state is, but may have some dependence on earlier states as well. An observable thing is that, for every state, the frequency distribution of lengths of time durations of stay in that state is very right-skewed. i.e. vast majority of staying times are much shorter than a small portion that is much longer. I'm new to ML and I'm looking for approaches to this problem. Based on the nature of the problem and my observation, I think this can be modeled as a continuous time (hidden?) Markov Model, probably with Poisson distributed staying time for each state. I have a few questions: Is there a specific name for that kind of CT Markov Model, in which the time of stay in each state is Poisson distributed. If there is, how do I train it and make future state predictions with it? Say I have state transition information of past 2 months and I want to predict state transitions for next 7 days. I'm confused on how to make future predictions with Markov Model in general. Just train the model and let it generate sequence from the last observation to use as future prediction? Can I simply chop each time duration into equally small pieces and apply discrete Markov model on it? What's the essential difference between a CT Markov Model and DT Markov Model of very small state transition time steps? Are there other reasonable models for this forecasting problem? I heard RNN. Thanks a lot!
