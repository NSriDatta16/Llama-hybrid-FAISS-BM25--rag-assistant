Calculate when a browser can slowing down

Is it possible to calculate within a reasonable approximation, how many tabs a browser can open before the system slows down, according to the components of a computer (ram, cpu, video card etc..), to the average thickness of the currently opened web pages, active processes, and system-wide machine usage (i.e. memory, cpu)? A possibile use case could be to show a user, which pages are using more resources than others so she could easily optimize the performances.
