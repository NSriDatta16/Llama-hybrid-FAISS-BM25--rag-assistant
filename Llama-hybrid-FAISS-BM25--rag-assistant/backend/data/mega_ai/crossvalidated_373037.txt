We actually do not need statistics itself to look at stationarity, and the first test for that is common sense. There is no stationarity because there are external factors that have a major influence on the data. For example, the market crash of Sept. 29, 2008 (in gray in the figure below), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average over that period of time. From https://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart'>Dow Jones - 100 Year Historical Chart Certainly, these two markets (Dow Jones and OMSX) are highly correlated. So it is likely more of interest as to which outperforms which than trying to predict either one from auto-correlation. Also, note that Dow Jones has a futures market, so that its futures market may predict the OMSX index futures better than it can be predicted from its own data. I would, as a first step, detrend for external influence, e.g., look at OMSX/Dow Jones, before examining autocorrelation or other trending. For example, one potential way to make money might be take advantage of any reliable ARIMA time delay between the markets. Finally, analyzing this type of data has a lot to do with what the objective of the analysis is.
