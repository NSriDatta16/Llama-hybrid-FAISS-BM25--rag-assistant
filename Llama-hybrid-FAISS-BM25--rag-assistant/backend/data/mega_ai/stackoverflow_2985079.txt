It's true that the convention is to put the "main" function just above the " if __name__ == '__main__' " statement at the end of the file. I think that this is because we usually want functions to be near to their calling sites. As for the called function coming above the calling function, I think that this is just a result of refactoring. At least in my case, I tend to write a function, and then take out bits of code to put into sub-functions, which I put on top so that I can see better. This is just a primitive form of code organization. If there's a stronger cohesive unit, I'd be tempted to pull those functions into their own module.
