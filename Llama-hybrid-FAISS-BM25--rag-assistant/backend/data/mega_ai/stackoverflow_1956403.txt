In the definition of a URL (see e.g. here ): Fragment URLs The URL specification en vigeur at the writing of this document ([RFC1738]) offers a mechanism to refer to a resource, but not to a location within a resource. The Web community has adopted a convention called "fragment URLs" to refer to anchors within an HTML document. A fragment URL ends with "#" followed by an anchor identifier. For instance, here is a fragment URL pointing to an anchor named section_2: http://somesite.com/html/top.html#section_2 The #section_2 part is also called "the fragment". Its interpretation is up to the user agent (AKA client AKA browser), though the universal convention is that it's the anchor of an tag to which the browser is asked to position itself. The Query String, as explained here , is the part of the URL that's passed to the server-side program -- normally after a ? and up to but excluding the # if any. So, in: http://server/path/program?query_string#thefrag the query string would be query_string and the fragment would be thefrag .
