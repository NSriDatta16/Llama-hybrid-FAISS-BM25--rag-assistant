How to dynamic realloc a global variable with C

Ok, this is my first C program since "hello wolrd" and I need some help with realloc. I have a dynamic array defined as a global variable. #include #include #include #include double *close = NULL; unsigned int closesize = 0; And I want to increase the array in a method. But I get a seg fault error. I have tried it like this: void addInputParamReal( OCIExtProcContext *ctx //,unsigned int paramIndex //,OCINumber *value ,double value ) { double dtemp; double **myclose = &close; // last try, make a pointer to my outside array //OCINumberToDouble(ctx,value,&dtemp); dtemp = 12.4; //just now //Not good *myclose = (double *) realloc (*myclose,(closesize+1) * sizeof(double)); close[closesize++] = dtemp; } Can you please help me out? Thanks Chris
