This high variance is with respect to the space of training sets. Here is why the LOOCV has high variance: in LOOCV, we get prediction error for each observation, say observation i, using the whole observed dataset at hand except this observation. So, the predicted value for i is very dependent on the current dataset. Now assume we observe another independent dataset and fit a model on this new dataset. If we use this new model to get a predicted value for the observation i, the predicted value is potentially very different from the one evaluated by LOOCV (although correct on average (unbiased)). This is the intuition behind the high variance of error prediction in LOOCV. However, if you're using LOOCV to compare results of a model with different hyperparameters, I believe you can safely use LOOCV to estimate prediction errors, provided the true value of prediction error is not of your interest, that is, you just want to compare different models having the observed training set and you don't care about the actual true error to be estimated. That said, as a rule of thumb, if you have a small sample, use LOOCV, otherwise, use k-fold CV with a smaller value for k.
