Likelihood A>B, Given Margin of Errors For A and B

Let's say in a video game there are 2 different attacks I want to test, A and B. They have a RNG component so damage varies from one sample to next. Both follow a standard distribution. I test by taking a huge number of samples of each, find the mean, and calculate margin of error. Now I have all this, what do I do with this information? I want to know the chance A deals more damage than B on average. This isn't like polling in a head to head electoral race, where people who actually don't vote for A will vote for B because B is the only other option. True value of A and B are unrelated and just have an average value from running many samples and a calculated margin of error. Thanks
