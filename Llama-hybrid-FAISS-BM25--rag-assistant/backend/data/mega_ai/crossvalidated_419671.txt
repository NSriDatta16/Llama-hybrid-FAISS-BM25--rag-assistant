What is a factorized Gaussian distribution?

I am reading the post Online Bayesian Deep Learning in Production at Tencent about Bayesian deep learning. It mentions that we can approximate a distribution $p_t(w\mid x)$ by a simple distribution $q_t(t)$ . Then it mentions that this distribution can be a factorized Gaussian distribution. What is a factorized Gaussian distribution?
