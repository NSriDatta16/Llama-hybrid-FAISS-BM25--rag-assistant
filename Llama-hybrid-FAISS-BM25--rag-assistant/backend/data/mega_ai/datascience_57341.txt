Regression methods

I want to understand what regression methods exist and their purpose. I know the least squares method with which you can build a linear and non-linear model and make predictions. The ARMA model is used to predict stationary time series, and the ARIMA model is used for non-stationary time series. When many data and signs are used neural networks. For time series, LSTMs are popular. What methods are applicable for solving multiple regression problems? What methods should I use in what cases?
