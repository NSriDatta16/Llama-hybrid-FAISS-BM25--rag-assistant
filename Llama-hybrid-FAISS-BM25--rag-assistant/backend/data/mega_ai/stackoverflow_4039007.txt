Speedup or performance tune any application or server is really hard to get done in my experience. You'll need to benchmark several times with different work models to define what your peak load is. Once you define the peak load for the configuration/environment mixture you need to tune and benchmark, you might have to run 5+ iterations of your benchmark. Check the configuration of both apache/jetty in terms of number of working threads to process the request and get them to match if possible. Here are some recommendations: Consider the differences of the two environments (GC in jetty, consider tuning you min and max memory threshold to the same size and later proceed to execute your test) The load should come from another box. If you don't have a second box/PC/server take your CPU/core into count and setup your the test to a specific CPU, do the same for jetty/apache. This is given that you cant get another machine to be the stress agent. Run several workload model Moving to modeling the test do the following 2 stages: One Thread for each configuration for 30 minutes. Start with 1 thread and going up to 5 with a 10 minutes interval to increase the count, Base on the metrics Stage 2 define a number of threads for the test. and run that number of thread concurrent for 1 hour. Correlate the metrics (response times) from your testing app to the server hosting the application resources (use sar, top and other unix commands to track cpu and memory), some other process might be impacting you app. (memory is relevant for apache jetty will be constraint to the JVM memory configuration so it should not change the memory usage once the server is up and running)
