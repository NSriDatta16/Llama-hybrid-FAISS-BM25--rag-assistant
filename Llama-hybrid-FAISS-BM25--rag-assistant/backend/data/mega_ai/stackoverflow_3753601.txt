Fastest way to perform time average of multiple calculations in SQL?

I have a question about the fastest way to perform a SQL Server query on a table, TheTable, that has the following fields: TimeStamp, Col1, Col2, Col3, Col4 I don't maintain the database, I just can access it. I need to perform 10 calculations that are similar to: Col2*Col3 + 5 5*POWER(Col3,7) + 4*POWER(Col2,6) + 3*POWER(Col1,5) Then I have to find the AVG and MAX of the calculation results using data from a chosen day (there is 8 months of data in the database so far). Since the data are sampled every 0.1 seconds, 864000 rows go into each calculation. I want to make sure that the query runs as quickly as possible. Is there a better way than this: SELECT AVG(Col2*Col3 + 5), AVG(5*POWER(Col3,7) + 4*POWER(Col2,6) + 3*POWER(Col1,5)), MAX(Col2*Col3 + 5), MAX(5*POWER(Col3,7) + 4*POWER(Col2,6) + 3*POWER(Col1,5)) FROM TheTable WHERE TimeStamp >= '2010-08-31 00:00:00:000' AND TimeStamp Thanks!
