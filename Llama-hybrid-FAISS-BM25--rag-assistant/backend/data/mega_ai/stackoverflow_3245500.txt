It turns out that the reason it was exiting earlier was that the prompt pattern that I was matching against matched not only the prompt, but also some of the output from the svn commands I was running. I was matching against only the "username" portion of the prompt pattern (the prompt form was "username@machine:~$"). Once I altered the script to match only "username@" it began to work as expected. p.s. the ssh script that dreeves links to above works very nicely.
