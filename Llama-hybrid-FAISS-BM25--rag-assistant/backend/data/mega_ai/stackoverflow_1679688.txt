I have exactly the same application. :) Our application use to take up to 10GB of RAM. This is obviously bad. After some optimization I managed to decrease memory usage about 50 times, so now same data set takes up to 200MB. Magic? No. :) What I did: Some data was stored in the memory several times (several copies). I made one copy of each bunch of data. Some data was stored as string , but more efficient way is int because those strings contained digits only. The main data storage class was Dictionary . We wrote our own dictionary which do not store any hashes - as the result memory usage decreased 3 times on 64bit systems, and 2 times on 32bit systems. So my question is: what is the main class/object you use to store data? What kind of the data you store?
