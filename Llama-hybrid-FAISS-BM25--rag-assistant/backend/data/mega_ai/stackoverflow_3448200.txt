I guess you are using something which utilizes Jakarta BeanUtils (like Struts) and some method is throwing an exception. Following may be reasons for same : The action attribute of an tag must match exactly the path attribute of the action definition in the struts-config.xml file. This is how Struts associates the ActionForm bean with the action. This error usually occurs when you have specified a form name that does not exist in your tag. For example, you specifiec and 'myForm' is not the name of a form associated with myAction in the struts-config file You get this message when Struts is unable to map the data in the HTML form to the properties in your ActionForm bean . Make sure each of the properties on your bean is either a String or a boolean. Do you have any properties of type java.util.Date or other objects? That might cause this error. Also check to see that you have public getters and setter for each of your properties.
