You have to understand that RNNs deal with "series" of data. It can be time series or it can be sentences which can be thought of as series of words. One thing very powerful about RNNs is that it allows you to deal with series which are of different length. Having said that, any thing that looks like series or time series can potentially be handled by RNNs. Few more examples or applications: Log data analysis (web data) Sensor data analysis (Time series) Translation https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq Named entity recognition (you'll have to use with word2vec) https://github.com/monikkinom/ner-lstm Video classification http://www.ijcsit.com/docs/Volume%206/vol6issue02/ijcsit20150602189.pdf And many others that contain series/time series data.
