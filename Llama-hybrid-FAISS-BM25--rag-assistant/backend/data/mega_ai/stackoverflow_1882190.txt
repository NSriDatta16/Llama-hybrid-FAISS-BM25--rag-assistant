You could make the action with only two params, and inside the action you would check if the 1st param is either "short" or "tall" and set your params accordingly: public ActionResult People(string Height, string measurementLimit) { string searchHigh, searchLow; if (Height == "Tall") searchHigh = measurementLimit; else searchLow = measurementLimit; //Rest of your code } Not as elegant as having the route assign the parameters, but it should work. Hope it helps.
