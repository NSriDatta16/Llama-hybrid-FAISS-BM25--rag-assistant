Here's how you use both heaps. Note that I'm assuming you don't know the number of elements, and this is why we must pop until we pop something from the min heap that is larger than or equal to what we pop from the max heap. Note that we return the average because in the case of a set like {1, 2, 3, 4} the median is actually 2.5 (the average of the two "middle" values). I'm assuming double as the value type, but this can obviously be anything. Here: double min = minheap.pop(); double max = maxheap.pop(); while(min Since popping is O(log n) and we have to pop O(n / 2) values, this is O(n log n) .
