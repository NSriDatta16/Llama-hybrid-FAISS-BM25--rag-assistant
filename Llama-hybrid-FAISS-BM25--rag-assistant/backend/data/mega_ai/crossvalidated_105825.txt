Mixing two linear regression models

In time series analysis, I have one predictor $X_1$ that has a higher $R^2$ when regressed against $Y$ sampled at 10 minutes interval. Another predictor $X_2$ has a lower error when fitted against $Y$ at 20 minutes intervals. The predictors are built from different data sets and unrelated to each other. For example, assuming we run two different regression models for $X_1$ (10 minutes horizon) and $X_2$ (20 minutes): at time $t_0$ the $X_1$ model predicts 10 and $X_2$ 30. Ten minutes later at time $t_1$ model $X_1$ forecasts 100. So now, at time $t_1$, we have $X_1$ predicting 100 and the previous $X_2$ forecast calculated at $t_0$ predicting 30 effectively for the same horizon target $t_2$ 10 minutes out. How do I address the two models overlapping horizons? I don't necessarily need to build two models, I'm trying to understand how this kind of time series problems can be dealt with.
