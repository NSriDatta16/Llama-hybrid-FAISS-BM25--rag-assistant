Complete a Ruby Array

My application needs to deal with arrays of fixed size . The problem is that sometimes elements are nil but nil is a forbidden value. I think an easy way is to replace nil values with an the closest non-nil value (right before or right after). The nil values can be first, last or even multiples. Here are some examples of what I'm looking for: [1,2,3,nil,5] => [1,2,3,3,5] [nil,2,3,4,5] => [2,2,3,4,5] [1,nil,nil,4,5] => [1,1,4,4,5] I am sure there is an elegant way to do this. Can you help?
