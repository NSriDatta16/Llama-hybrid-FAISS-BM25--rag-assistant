Conversion between docx / doc / rtf and lightweight markup

I am looking for a tool or set of tools to convert between file formats D and M where D is a format handled by MSWord, in order of preference, docx, doc, rtf M is a lightweight markup, such as markdown, textile, txt2tags, it can be an esoteric one there is a way to generate html from M conversion is two-way, it's done both from D to M, and from M to D utf-8 encoding is handled properly the content is simple, paragraphs, some simple formatting like bold and italics, maybe lists the tools are platform-independent What I've found so far TeX, LaTeX -- too heavyweight docx2txt -- too lightweight, it supports no formatting at all html -- MSWord produces bloated html a few one-way conversions, like doc to mediawiki , UPDATE: The use case is a document workflow between technical and non-technical people I, the technical guy edit a document in plain text, put it into version control, etc. I send it to my manager or other non-technical people They add comments, make changes to it using their Word, then they send it back to me I want to simply grok their changes, make my changes, put it into version control, without having to use Word
