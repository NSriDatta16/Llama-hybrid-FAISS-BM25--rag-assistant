lass. In the first example above, the F1 score is high because the majority class is defined as the positive class. Inverting the positive and negative classes results in the following confusion matrix: TP = 0, FP = 0; TN = 5, FN = 95 This gives an F1 score = 0%. The MCC doesn't depend on which class is the positive one, which has the advantage over the F1 score to avoid incorrectly defining the positive class.
