Darryl, I would suggest breaking the ad impressions down by day, so that 1 ad -- 5000/(monthsToDisplay/30) This will give you a number of impressions you need to serve per day, and should help distribute things nicely over the weeks. So lets assume you have these variables or database fields: totalImpressions = 5000; dailyImpressions = totalImpressions/(monthsToDisplay/30) Then you could do something like: SELECT * FROM ad WHERE (totalImpressions > used_impressions AND dailyImpressions > used_dailyImpressions) OR impressesions = 0 ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1 Hope this made sense - it's early morning here, but I will check back later!
