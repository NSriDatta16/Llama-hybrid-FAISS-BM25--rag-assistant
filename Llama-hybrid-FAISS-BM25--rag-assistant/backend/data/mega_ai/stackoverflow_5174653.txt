NTFS already tries to allocate your files contiguously, as stated in this blog post of a Windows 7 engineer. Your files will only be fragmented if there is no big enough contiguous chunk of free space. If you believe that it is important for your files not to be fragmented, then I think the best option is to schedule a nightly defragmentation of your disk. That's more of a system administration problem. Finally, fragmentation is irrelevant on SSD disks .
