MKOverlayView and touches

i have an custom MKOverlayView on my map and i would like to detect touches. However, i can't seem to get the overlay to respond. i was hoping it was going to be something as dumb as forgetting to set userInteractionEnabled to YES...but alas, no luck there ....currently, here is how i have it: //map delegate overlay: - (MKOverlayView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForOverlay:(id )overlay { if (_radiusView !=nil) { [_radiusView removeFromSuperview]; [_radiusView release]; _radiusView = nil; } _radiusView = [[CustomRadiusView alloc]initWithCircle:overlay]; _radiusView.userInteractionEnabled = YES; _radiusView.strokeColor = [UIColor blueColor]; _radiusView.fillColor = [UIColor grayColor]; _radiusView.lineWidth = 1.0; _radiusView.alpha = 0; //fade in radius view [UIView beginAnimations:@"fadeInRadius" context:nil]; [UIView setAnimationCurve:UIViewAnimationCurveEaseInOut]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.6]; _radiusView.alpha = .3; [UIView commitAnimations]; return _radiusView; } my custom overlay class simply implements touchesBegan, and extends MKCircleView -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"touch!"); }
