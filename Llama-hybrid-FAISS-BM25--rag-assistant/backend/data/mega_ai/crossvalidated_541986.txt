Determining a sample size

I'm working through Probability and Statistics by DeGroot, and I'm on page 276; reading through the paragraph on 'Determining a Sample Size'. I'm slightly confused here as I'm unsure of the two approaches taken, and why they differ and would really appreciate some clarification! Suppose that a random sample of size n is to be taken from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance 9. We shall determine the minimum value of n for which: $$Pr(|\bar{X}_n-\mu|\le1)\ge0.95$$ The sample mean will have a normal distribution for which the mean is $\mu$ and the standard deviation $3/n^{1/2}$ . Therefore if we let: $$Z=\frac{n^{1/2}}{3}(\bar{X}_n-\mu)$$ Q. Why is the standard deviation given in that form? I understand that $Var(\bar{X}_n)=\sigma^2/n$ , but to me it would make sense if it was given as $\left(\frac{3}{n^{1/2}}\right)^2$ , and how did he get $n^{1/2}$ on the numerator? Secondly, he gives another paragraph on the example: Heights of Men and Women. Suppose that heights in inches for women has a mean $65$ and standard deviation 1 and for men a mean of $68$ and standard deviation of 2. Suppose also that one woman is selected at random and, independently, one man is selected at random. We shall determine the probability that the woman will be taller than the man. Let W denote the height of the selected woman, and let M denote the height of the selected man. Then the difference $W-M$ has a normal distribution with mean $65-68$ and variance $1^2+2^2=5$ , therefore: $$Z=\frac{1}{5^{1/2}}(W-M+3)$$ Q. I cannot seem to understand why the form of the standard deviation is given so different here compared to the previous one. Then he provides this: $$Pr(W>M)=Pr(W-M>0)=Pr(Z>\frac{3}{5^{1/2}})$$ Q. Why did the form of Z change here relative to the previous one given?
