How can I estimate the disk size of a string with JavaScript?

I need to try to estimate the DISK size of a text string (which could be raw text or a Base64 encoded string for an image/audio/etc) in JavaScript. I'm not sure how to estimate this. The only thing when Googling i can find is .length so i thought maybe someone on StackOverflow might know... The reason i need to know is i have a localStorage script that needs (or would love to have) the ability to check when a user is nearing his 5MB (or 10MB in IE) quota and prompt them to increase the max size for the domain. So, if a user hits, lets say, 4.5MBs of data it'd prompt with You're nearing your browsers 5MB data cap. Please increase your max data by... [instructions on increasing it for the browser]
