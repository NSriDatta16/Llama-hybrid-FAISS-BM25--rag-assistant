Checking that values are piecewise uniform

I have a set of values and I wish to check if they are piecewise uniform. I hope I'm using the correct terms, but I'll explain what I mean. Consider the following values - 100,105,100,103,98. We can "see" they are close to each other. We can define this uniformity by normalizing the Standard deviation. Now let's look at the following values - 100,105,100,103,98,198,200,203,205,100,105,100,103,98 Standard deviation will not work here, but it's clearly uniform in each segment. To check the uniformity here we can check how many of the sample deviate by no more than d% from their predecessor. This seems to work but (and here's the question) - is there a better approach? I don't even know how to call this test to try and search for articles. This doesn't handle outliers very well. I can use a moving average or a moving median, and again - is there something better? Thanks.
