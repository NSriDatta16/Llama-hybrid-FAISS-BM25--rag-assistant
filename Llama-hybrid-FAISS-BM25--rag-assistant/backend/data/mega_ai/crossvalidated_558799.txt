How to transform this probability equation?

This formula is taken from the book Mathematics for Machine Learning (p. 177, Formula 6.8). I don't know how to transform from the left to the right side. I searched for probabilities rules, I looked through the symbols and I totally don't understand. $$ P_X(S) = P(X \epsilon S) = P(X^{-1}(S)) = P(\{\omega \space \epsilon \space \Omega : X(\omega) \varepsilon S \}) $$
