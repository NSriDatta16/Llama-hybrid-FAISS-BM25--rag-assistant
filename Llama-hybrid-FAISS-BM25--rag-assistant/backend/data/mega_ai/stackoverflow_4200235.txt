Images in android app

I see three folders within my eclipse project drawable-hdpi,mdpi,ldpi Do I need to put images in all three of these folders?Or can I just use one of them.My images seem to scale fairly well.I do not want to have duplicate images if it is uneccessary. I guess what I am asking is will the app be able to find my images if I just use one of the above mentioned folders?
