Is a linear model OK?

I carried out a linguistics experiment where I gave a text for people to comment on. I recorded and transcribed their comments. I would like use the number of utterances per sentence in the text they were given as a dependent variable in a linear model - would that be OK or would a poisson model be more appropriate in this case? A few additional details: (1) Subjects could spend as long as they wanted on the task, i.e. the number of utterances per sentence increases with time and there is no limit; (2) There are no zeros in the data as subjects were required to at least read the text they were given and reading itself is regarded as an utterance in the study; (3) The average number of utterances per sentence is around 5, with a few cases of up to 30 utterances, so I'd probably need to log-transform the data if I were to use a linear model.
