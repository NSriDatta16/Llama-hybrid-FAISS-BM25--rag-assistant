In the penalized version of neural networks, there is a weight on the scale of the coefficients (check the decay parameter in nnet in R). So it is necessary to put the coefficients on the same scale rescaling them. Factor variables are handled in the usual way converting them to dummy variables. Again, if you are worrying about implementation, nnet will do it for you.
