How to exclude columns from auto-resizing in a JTable

I have a JTable with 5 Columns specified in a TableColumnModel. I want the table to use all available horizontal space in the panel (which can vary), but I want to limit the resizing to the last three rows. In more detail: The first two columns are initialized with a preferred width, however the user should be able to resize the column manually by dragging with the mouse. The last three columns should divide equally all the remaining space that isn't being used by the first two columns. EDIT: They also need to be resizable manually. I've tried the following: Setting the table to autoResizeMode JTable.AUTO_RESIZE_ALL_COLUMNS . This suceeded in using up all available space, but (obviously) it also resized the first two columns. I've reacted to this by setting a min and max for the first two columns. That worked, but it violated my constraint of having them resizable manually. Is there a simple way in the JTable -API to achieve this? Thanks in advance!
