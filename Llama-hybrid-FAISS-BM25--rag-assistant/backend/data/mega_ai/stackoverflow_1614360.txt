Paragraph.BringIntoView() works only when focused

I am working on a text editor that is based on RichEditBox. I have implemented functionality "Go to line" which eventually resolves to TextPointer.Paragraph.BringIntoView(); Along with this I also set the caret position. What I found out is that BringIntoView only works when I click on the RichEditBox first (focus it). Otherwise it seems to get ignored. I can see that the caret position has been adjusted by the code around BringIntoView though. Does anybody know what is the reason/nature of that problem? How can I overcome it?
