Correlated features in dataset

I undestand in general that it is important to take correlational structure into account while applying almost any statistical techniques. First question - could you help with the examples why it is so important and what can go wrong? For example, I have vector of correlated random variables, identically distributed. Can I wrongly reject the $H_0 : \{sample \in distribution\}$ not by chance, but because of correlational structure? (i.e., reject $H_0$ much more often than 0.05 with fixed level of significance $\alpha=0.05$). Could you explain it, using the picture (samples are 2D-vectors): Second question : for example, I have two normal distributions with different means $N(0, \sigma), N(-1, \sigma)$. I have a sample of rows of numbers, like $$(0.1, 0.5, -0.3), (-1.2, -1.0, -0.7, -1.1), \ldots$$ $$(0.2, 0.4, -0.2, 0.1), (-1.1, -0.5, -1.0), \ldots$$ $$\ldots$$ $$ \xi_1(i), \xi_2(i), \xi_3(i), \ldots $$ here I denotes "islands" generated by one distribution in brackets, $i$ indicates one of the distributions (so $i$ is choosen randomly fro each $\xi(i)$). I want to determine the borders of the islands, but I know that there is a correlational structure inside each island (may be also a correlational structure between islands, but it does not matter). How should I deal with this problem? Let us assume that it is not enough samples to calculate the whole matrix of covariances (it will overfit the data). The initial idea is to use something like linear discriminant analysis and regularisation for it, but the borders are unknown. How can PCA help in this case? Typically, the strongest correlations arise from random variables that are neighbors in the row, so one of the possible solutions is to use block covariance matrices, but the size of one block can be large enough to cause problems with overfitting. Does HMM takes into account the correlational structure? If so, what if I do not have a set of states (for HMM), but a continuous set of parameters for distributions, which technique is better to use?
