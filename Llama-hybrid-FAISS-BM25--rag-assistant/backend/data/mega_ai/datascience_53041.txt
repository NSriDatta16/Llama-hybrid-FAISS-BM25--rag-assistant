How to find optimized x values (input features) after training in deep learning?

I did deep learning training by Keras. I have done the training part by model.fit If I do model.predict, it only gives me y value. But I want to know x (input features) that gives the best y value, which means the optimized x values after training. Is there any way to fetch the optimized x values (input features) in Keras or else? I really appreciate your help. Thank you.
