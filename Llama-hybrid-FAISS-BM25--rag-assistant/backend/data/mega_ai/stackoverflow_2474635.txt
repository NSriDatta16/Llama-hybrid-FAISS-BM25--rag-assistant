You're trying to make a portable binary on Linux? There's two ways I know. First, arguably the technically correct method, but also quite a pain and probably not worth the time: compile Qt and your app with an LSB SDK. (or just compile your app with an LSB SDK, if the Qt version in LSB is new enough for you.) Second, the pragmatic approach: compile Qt and your app on a machine with the oldest version of glibc you intend to support. For example, instead of compiling on ubuntu and deploying on redhat, try the other way around. If you need to support a wide range of glibc or other system libraries, you'll probably have to compile multiple times and distribute several binaries.
