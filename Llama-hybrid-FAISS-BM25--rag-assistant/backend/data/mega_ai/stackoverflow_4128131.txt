GIT or SVN or... for front-end developers

I recently began importing a number of our projects into a Subversion repository at work and over the next few weeks i'm expecting every one on the team to take responsibility for their own source control management. The reason I chose SVN over GIT is that I want everyone on the team, including designers, frontenders, integrators... to take charge of their own SCM and so i'm expecting things will move quicker if they manage their work using a GUI (Cornerstone for mac and Tortoise SVN for windows). I know there are some GIT GUIs out there, SmartGit looks most appealing at the minute, but none seem as capable as their SVN counterparts. Besides, I feel we'd be losing something in translation by not using the command line to work with a DVCS (whereas i'm significantly happier using a GUI to manage projects in SVN). The problem is that distributed solutions are fast overtaking centralized solutions and so I'm wondering if it would really be worth the extra investment now rather than have to migrate everything 6 months down the line and invest time in a DVCS anyway? The other way to look at it is that SVN would be a relatively painless step in the meantime which would prepare us more adequately should we later decide to migrate to a DVCS. Your thoughts and experiences are appreciated. *Aside: for a number of reasons, I prefer multiple projects per SVN repository. This, though, means less meaningful statistics from Atlassian's Fisheye, as well as being messier. If we did decide to use GIT it would be 1 repository per project.
