We use exactly this model for file storage, along with (shameless plug) SabreDAV to make it seem to the end-user it's a normal filesystem. I think this is a perfectly fine model, as long as looking up the file is documented and easily retrieved there shouldn't be an issue. Just make backups of your DB :) One other advice I can give, we use an md5() on the file-id to generate a unique filename. We use parts of the files to generate a directory structure, for example.. id 1 will yield: b026324c6904b2a9cb4b88d6d61c81d1, the resulting filename will become: b02/632/4c6/904b2a9cb4b88d6d61c81d1 The reason for this is that most stable filesystems can become very slow after a high number of files (or directories) in one directory. It's much, much faster too traverse a few sub-directories.
