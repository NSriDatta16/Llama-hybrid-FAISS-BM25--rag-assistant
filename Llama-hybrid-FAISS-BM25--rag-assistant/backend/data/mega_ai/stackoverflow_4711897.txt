Split a paragraphs using RegularExpression (Regex).?

How can I split a paragraph using following methods First Method = {A-Z} Second Method = {A-Z} Third Method = {A-Z}. Fourth Method = {A-Z}.\r\n > Note: Input may contain combination of all above methods. Please help me to find out correct Regex Formula for splitting below paragraphs. Input paragraphs: {A} Circulation Research. 2000;87:540-542 For a more detailed discussion of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between nitric oxide and telomerase activation, see this study: Farsetti. {B} Chauhan. =&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=c130cff602472f25bd5680ea3047490c" target="_blank">"Aging-Associated Endothelial Dysfunction in Humans Is Reversed by L-Arginine" Journal of the American College of Cardiology Volume 28, Issue 7, December 1996, Pages 1796-1804 {C}.

In Cells, Aging and Human Disease, page 170, Michael Fossel writes: In comparing young normal human aortic endothelial cells to senescent endothelial cells and endothelial cells imoortalized with hTERT, we find differences. Compared to young endothelial cells, senescent endothelial cells show a decreased production and activity of NO, changes critial in atherogenesis and hypertension. Similarly, senescent endothelial cells demonstrate increased monocyte adhesion, again implicated in atherogenesis.
