I have tried several ways to manage a knowledge base in the past. I have a bunch of "knowledge nuggets" (btw, thanks, I like that term a lot) on all sorts of diverse topics ranging from how to set up apache tomcat ssl cert, to checklists for doing a monthly family budget, to keeping a list of weights and reps completed on workouts. I've tried keeping these in a wordpress blog, on a personal wiki, using pen and paper, etc. In the end, emacs and org-mode is the clear winner for me. I love to have the ability to start simple, and build more complex functionality as I need it. I've used a lot of the tips described by Sacha Chua . In my case, I always end up with a bunch of notes (more formal and organized) mixed in with action items (less formal). In general I maintain one master "action item" list and then create a separate file for notes on each topic. So far, grep has worked well for me to quickly find the file containing notes. I'll often create a emacs bookmark C-x r m to quickly navigate to notes files as well. Simple Blogs, CMS, and wikis (like Drupal and Wordpress) are good at classification and retrieval. Maybe you could export org files to html and publish them to a blog, cms or wiki? It might not be too difficult to hook into the blog/wiki/cms tagging capability.
