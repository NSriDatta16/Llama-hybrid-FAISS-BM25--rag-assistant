extract classifier properties from pickled file

I have *.clf file which I get from fit() of sklearn . I fit my data with SVM or KNN and want to show its properties when using it for predictions. For example I open earlier pickled classifier file and when I print it I get something like this: SVC(C=1.0, cache_size=200, class_weight=None, coef0=0.0, decision_function_shape='ovr', degree=3, gamma='scale', kernel='rbf', max_iter=-1, probability=True, random_state=None, shrinking=True, tol=0.001, verbose=True) How can I get the value of, for example, gamma to print out it somewhere else except for traversing it as string ? Because at first I have to define either it's SVM or KNN .
