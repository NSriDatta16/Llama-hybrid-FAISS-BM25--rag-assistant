Validity of replacing q-value with p-values from multiple testing of different tools

In this Science paper , the authors are partly interested in trying to identify genes that cycle (that oscillate through the day in terms with the biological clock). Here's an extract from the methods explaining their method: Time Series Analysis for Circadian Cycling: RNA cycling was assessed by three programs, COSOPT (35), JTK cycle (75) and ARSER (76) with expression level cutoffs, > 0.05 RPKM for intron, > 0.5 RPKM for exon and > 0.0625 RPKM for antisense. For COSOPT and JTK cycle analyses, data was detrended by linear regression. A cycling gene was considered if two out of three programs detected cycling with threshold of p . The period and phase from ARSER were used for further analysis. ForChIP-seq peak analysis, two cycles were concatenated and the cycling was analyzed with ARSER (p My question is, how much is it statistically acceptable/valid to do multiple testing (over 20000 tests) using different softwares and then choosing those that are significant at p-value (not FDR) from all the softwares?
