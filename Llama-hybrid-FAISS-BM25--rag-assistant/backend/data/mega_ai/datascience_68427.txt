I found the accepted answer pretty hard to understand. Here is a simplified version that cleared it up for me: Loss Function : a loss or risk function, $\mathcal{L}(\hat{y}^i, y^i)$ , quantifies how well (more accurately, how badly) $\hat{y}$ approximates y. smaller values of $\mathcal{L}(\hat{y}^i, y^i)$ indicate that $\hat{y}$ is a good approximation of $y$ Empirical Risk : the empirical risk is the average loss over the data points. $$\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \mathcal{L}(\hat{y}^i, y^i)$$ See these Stanford Lecture Slides for more details.
