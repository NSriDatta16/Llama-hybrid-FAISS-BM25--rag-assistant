This is more a comment than an answer, but I can't post it as a comment (requires 50 rep).. Have you tried to use PCA on your dataset? It can help you to reduce the variable space and find a possible direction on which variable exclude from you regression model. Doing so, the model will be easier to compute. Here you can find an interesting discussion on using PCA with categorical variables: Can principal component analysis be applied to datasets containing a mix of continuous and categorical variables? Also, I imagine you're using R for many reasons (I use R too), but it may be easier to use a software like SAS or STATA. They perform better with big data and you don't have to deal with multi-core and parallel computing. Finally, try to think if it makes sense to use as much rows as possible from your dataset. This is a population dataset, a quasi-population dataset or a sampled dataset? You may obtain better results with a good sampling on your dataset than using the whole data. Take a look at this post: Is sampling relevant in the time of 'big data'? Hope this helps
