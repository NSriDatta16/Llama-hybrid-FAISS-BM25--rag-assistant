Well, 60 pedestrians in a year would be a lot, that's right. But you only have a sample of one month, so it would be more appropriate to scale the yearly average number of deaths down , not the observation up : ppois(5,3/12,lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 2.738136e-07 Still unusual, but far less so than 60 over an entire year. And don't forget selection bias . Newspapers by definition report unusual things , because usual things are not news. So if you read something in the newspaper, it would be very unusual for it to be usual.
