How to return all database rows with certain field value

Hey, I have a database table called "projects" with the fields 'id', 'locationid', 'name' and 'year'. I query the database to retrieve all the values and store them in $data, before passing them into the relevant view. In what part of the website, I have created a timeline (made of list items generated with a foreach). In this timeline, I was to associate projects with their corresponding 'year' value. So under 1999, I would find all the projects for 1999. Right now I have an ugly hacked solution where inside the foreach which I use to generate the timeline I have ANOTHER foreach that goes through the projects table and checks to see if the 'year' field matches the current timeline year, and if so adds it. Is there a more elegant way to query the $data I passed into the view (and therefore database field values) based on finding specific strings? Essentially, if I could write it how I want to express it, I'm looking for something like this: $year EQUAL $timeline_year : ?> $name ?>
