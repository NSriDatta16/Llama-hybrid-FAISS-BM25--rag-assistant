Permitting moving only of s within contentEditable

I am struggling to achieve my desired behaviour with a div marked as contentEditable . I wish to allow the user to move an img around within the div and for it to be maintained inline, but not let them resize or otherwise modify that img . They should otherwise be able modify the text within the div . The default browser behaviour may be seen below, with the img being able to be both moved and resized with the drag-handles: Here is some text, and also an image I have been playing around with various client scripts to attempt to achieve the desired functionality, but each combination I attempt seems to run into difficulty. What I can achieve is ultimate lockdown with: $(document).ready(function() { $('img', '#edit').each(function (i, item) { item.contentEditable = false; $(item).bind('mousedown', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); }); if ($.browser.msie) { item.oncontrolselect = function () { return false; } } }); }); but although this prevents any element duplication (a problem I had in Firefox) and resizing using drag handles (in IE), it is not possible to move the img at all. UPDATE: Thanks to you guys, the closest I have got so far is: $(document).ready(function() { $('img', '#edit').each(function (i, item) { attachEvents(item); }); if ($.browser.mozilla) { document.execCommand("enableObjectResizing", false, false); } }); function attachEvents(item) { if ($.browser.msie) { item.attachEvent('onresizestart', function (e) { e.returnValue = false; }, false); item.attachEvent('ondragend', function (e) { // cannot get IE to rebind moved item (toElement or similar is not available until IE9 when using addEventListener) attachEvents(e.srcElement); }, false); } if ($.browser.opera) { // doesn't seem to work at all in Opera 11 } } but the two remaining problems are complete lack of support in Opera (something I can live with) and the problem of how to rebind the events ondragend in IE. Can anyone else assist?
