Ajax not returning values to chrome but is to FF

I am new to Ajax and have been following a tutorial from JQuery.com. I have set up a script that is very simple, when an h2 element is clicked a php script is called that returns some xml which JQuery the uses to replace the current h2 contents. Below is the javascript content: $(document).ready(function () { $('h2').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); var user = $(this); $.post("ajax.php", {id: "1"}, function(xml) { // format result var result = [ "Thanks for rating, current average: ", $("average", xml).text(), ", number of votes: ", $("count", xml).text() ]; // output result $(user).html(result.join('')); } ); }); }); And here is the php script: $av $av "; header('Content-type: text/xml'); echo $xml; ?> In Firefox I get the expected: "Thanks for rating, current average: 5, number of votes: 5" but in Chrome I get: "Thanks for rating, current average: , number of votes: " As you can see, Chrome doesnt recognise anything passed back in the xml. I am running this on a regular dreamhost hosting account with no additions made to the server by me. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Regards Luke
