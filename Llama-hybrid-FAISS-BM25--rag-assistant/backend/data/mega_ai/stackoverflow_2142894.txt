In general: Database more reliable and will survive an app/server restart can be shared across load-balanced servers without having to deal with "sticky" sessions slower to access In-Memory (non-distributed stateful bean) Fast storage and retrieval Less code Will be lost if the app/server restarts Your choice will be totally dependent on your application requirements and environment. All things being equal, I favor the database solution because of the load balancing and reliability benefits, but this can easily be overkill in many scenarios.
