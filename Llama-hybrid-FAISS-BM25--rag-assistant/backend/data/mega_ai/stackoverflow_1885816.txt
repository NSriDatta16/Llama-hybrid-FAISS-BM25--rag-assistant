RESTful Service Method in WCF

I am not sure what is wrong with my JSON response from WCF but it is not being parsed properly. I probably made a simple mistake, hopefully someone can spot it. I am using VS 2008 Pro SP1. When I navigate directly to the url Chrome thinks it is a file download. When I hit say flickr's service it returned a string inline in the browser body, which makes me think my content is being sent incorrectly. Service [ServiceContract] public interface IFoo { [OperationContract] [WebGet(UriTemplate = "/foos/", ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json] Foo[] GetFoos(); } Model // this is in a separate assembly from the service [DataContract] public class Foo { [DataMember] public int Id { get; set; } [DataMember] public string Name { get; set; } } JQuery $(document).ready(function() { $.getJSON(fooUrl, function(data) { alert(data); // data is an object, but data.items is null // this complains 'length is null or not an object' $.each(data.items, function(i, item) { fooList.append(' ' + data[i].name + ' '); }); }); }); When I look at the response in Fiddler I see: [{"Id":1,"Name":"Foo1"},{"Id":2,"Name":"Foo2"},{"Id":3,"Name":"Foo3"}] Update Here are the raw headers from fiddler for the response comparison (me vs. flickr) Mine HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 162 Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Server: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0 Flickr HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sat, 12 Dec 2009 00:30:36 GMT P3P: policyref="http://p3p.yahoo.com/w3c/p3p.xml", CP="CAO DSP COR CUR ADM DEV TAI PSA PSD IVAi IVDi CONi TELo OTPi OUR DELi SAMi OTRi UNRi PUBi IND PHY ONL UNI PUR FIN COM NAV INT DEM CNT STA POL HEA PRE GOV" Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT Last-Modified: Sat, 12 Dec 2009 00:26:19 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Vary: Accept-Encoding Connection: close Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: application/x-javascript; charset=utf-8 It looks like the big difference is I have application/json and they have application/x-javascript. As I noted above I am using WebMessageFormat.Json on the operation contract. Thanks for any help.
