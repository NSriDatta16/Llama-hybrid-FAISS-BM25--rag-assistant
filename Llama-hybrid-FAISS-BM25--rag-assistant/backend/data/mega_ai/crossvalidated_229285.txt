Percent change for nonlinear data

My professor said that percent change between two data points in a nonlinear data set doesn't make sense, as, it can be shown that the percent change between two adjacent points in a time series is proportional to the slope. I.e, $pc = \Delta y / y_1 = m \Delta t / y_1 \approx m / y_1$, since $\Delta t = 1$ for two adjacent points. Is this correct?
