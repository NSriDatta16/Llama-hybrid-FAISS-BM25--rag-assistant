I have done something similar in the past and used an in-memory XML document as a quick and dirty hierarchical database for storage. You can store each show/season/episode as an element (nested appropriately) and attributes of these things as xml attributes on the elements. Then you can use XQuery to get info back out. NOTE: I'm not a Python guy so I don't know what your xml support is like. NOTE 2: You'll want to profile this because it'll be bigger and slower than the solution you've already got. Likely enough if you are doing some high-volume processing then XML is probably not going to be your friend.
