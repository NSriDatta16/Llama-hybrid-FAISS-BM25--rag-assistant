feature sealection/elimination and multi-collinearity in a Cox proportional hazards models?

I am looking into how differing brain tumor genetics affects patient survival. I have a gene dataset with around 4600 predictors, which are often strongly correlated with each other. Now I want to compute a Cox model using R's survival package, that combines the best genes for overall survival prediction. How should I approach the feature elimination process? So far I thought about using PCA or clustering approaches as a preprocessing step. However maybe there is an established feature similar to Ridge/LASSO for cox proportional hazards models? So far I found but there seems to be no R implementation? https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17661175/
