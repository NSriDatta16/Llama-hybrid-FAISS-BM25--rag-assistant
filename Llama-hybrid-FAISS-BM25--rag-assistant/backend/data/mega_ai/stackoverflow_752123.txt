What is the best way to query data from multilpe tables and databases?

I have 5 databases which represent different regions of the country. In each database, there are a few hundred tables, each with 10,000-2,000,000 transaction records. Each table is a representation of a customer in the respective region. Each of these tables has the same schema. I want to query all tables as if they were one table. The only way I can think of doing it is creating a view that unions all tables, and then just running my queries against that. However, the customer tables will change all the time (as we gain and lose customers), so I'd have to change the query for my view to include new tables (or remove ones that are no longer used). Is there a better way? EDIT In response to the comments, (I also posted this as a response to an answer): In most cases, I won't be removing any tables, they will remain for historic purposes. As I posted in comment to one response, the idea was to reduce the time it takes a smaller customers (one with only 10,000 records) to query their own history. There are about 1000 customers with an average of 1,000,000 rows (and growing) a piece. If I were to add all records to one table, I'd have nearly a billion records in that table. I also thought I was planning for the future, in that when we get say 5000 customers, we don't have one giant table holding all transaction records (this may be an error in my thinking). So then, is it better not to divide the records as I have done? Should I mash it all into one table? Will indexing on customer Id's prevent delays in querying data for smaller customers?
