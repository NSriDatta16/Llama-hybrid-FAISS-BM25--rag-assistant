They are both exact . Exact is a weaker property than you probably think it is. A confidence interval method is exact if the probability of a $1-\alpha$ confidence interval covering the true value is at least $1-\alpha$ . Here's an exact 95% confidence interval method for any real-valued parameter: roll a twenty-sided die. If you get a 20, the interval is the empty set, otherwise it's the whole real line. So, the fact that there's more than one exact interval isn't really surprising. It's still a fair question which one you should use. There are two other useful properties of a confidence interval on top of being exact: it should be short (on average) and it shouldn't over-cover. My stupid all-purpose confidence interval has infinite length; you can do better. The MKmisc::medianCI help says If the result is not unique, i.e. there is more than one interval with coverage probability closest to conf.level , then a matrix of confidence intervals is returned. If minLength = TRUE , an exact confidence interval with minimum length is returned The function looks for all the exact confidence intervals and it tries to get coverage of at least $1-\alpha$ (so it's exact) but not too much higher. The minLength option also allows for the shortest exact interval.
