How to build a chart based on values of textfield inputs?

I have a page with 10 textfields that are filled dynamically depending on what the use has input on a previous page. I want to display these values in a simple bar chart. I have setup jqPlot, yes I cannot seem to get it to work. Is it possible someone could take a look at the 2nd page here and let me know how to call textfield input values to build a bar chart? http://www.beatinganger.com/stress-test It would be much appreciated.
