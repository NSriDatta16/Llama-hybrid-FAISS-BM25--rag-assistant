PCA at it's heart involves diagonalizing a matrix which means solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of said matrix. The whole purpose of the calculation is to find a diagonal representation of your matrix (i.e. only elements along the diagonal of the matrix). If you solve again, you will find that you are trying to calculate the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix, which yields the exact same diagonal matrix. Hence your PC vectors will be the same regardless of how many times you apply the transformation.
