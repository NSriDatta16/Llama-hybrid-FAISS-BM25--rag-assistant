Semiparametric ordinal regression model use the same optimization method as used for binary logistic regression: maximum likelihood. Instead of just having simple probability elements in the calculation of the likelihood as in the binary case (for a covariate-specific P(Y=1) = p you have probability of p if Y=1 and 1-p if Y=0) you have probabilities that Y=j for a whole series of j values. These cell probabilities are computed by differencing the ordinal model's cumulative probabilities.
