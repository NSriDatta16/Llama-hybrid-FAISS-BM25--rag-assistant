There are a ton of PRN generators out there, and you can always get free random bits , or even buy them on CD or DVD. I've used simple sine wave generators mixed together with some phase and amplitude noise thrown in to get signals that sound and look interesting to humans when put through speakers or lights, but I don't know what you mean by interesting. There are ways to generate data that looks interesting in a chart form, but that would be different than data used on a stock chart, and neither would make a nice "static" image such as produced by an analog television tuned to a null channel. You can use Conway's game of life as a PRN, and "listen" to cells (or run all the cells through a logic circuit) to get some interesting time based signals. It would be interesting to look at the graph of DB updates/inserts for Stackoverflow over time, and you could mine that data. There really are infinite ways to generate an "interesting" time series data. Can you narrow the scope of your question?
