Should I decompose time series before applying DTW

I have two time series which I want to compare by using the 'Dynamic Time Warping' technique. However, I am only interested in comparing the trend component of them (i.e. excluding the seasonal and random components from the comparison). I wonder if it makes sense to perform an extra step in which I extract the trend component from the two time series before compare them together by using the dtw package in R, or I would get similar results by directly comparing the original time series via the dtw package.
