Suitable multiple testing procedure for three very correlated phenotypes

I have ran an analysis using polygenic risk scores including genetic variants at different p-value thresholds and have the following outcomes: IQ ages 8 and 9, strengths and difficulties questionnaire points at 9 and 12 years, and educational attainment points at 5 different ages. Firstly, the polygenic risk score includes genetic variants found associated with attention deficit disorder at different p-values. Would I have to correct the exposure for multiple testing? I am assuming not as the PRS at 5x10^-2 would include all the genetic variants at lower thresholds, etc. Furthermore, cognitive test at age 8 and 15 are also correlated etc. How should I go about correcting for multiple testing? independent var is the polygenic risk score examined at different p-value thresholds dependent var is IQ ages 8 and 9, strengths and difficulties questionnaire points at 9 and 12 years, and educational attainment points at 5 different ages. Thanks
