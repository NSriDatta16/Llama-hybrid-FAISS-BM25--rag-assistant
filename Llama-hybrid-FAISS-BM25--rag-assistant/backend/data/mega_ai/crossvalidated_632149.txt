The discovery of physical laws can be aided by ML While ML models can, at this point, not ask the right questions or collect the data etc., it is absolutely possible to use machine learning to aid the (re-)discovery of natural laws. One method that's frequently brought up in this context is symbolic regression, which optimizes model fit to the data by combining well-understood mathematical functions. For an example have a look at this article applying symbolic regression to re-discover Kepler's law on planetary motion. A search on google scholar should give many more methods using Kepler's data and other classical physics-related examples. Apart from that, ML tools are useful in all kinds of function approximation tasks that arise in the context of physics research. For some current examples have a look at this article discussing the usefulness of CNNs for gravitational wave detection, or this article using autoencoders in a similar context.
