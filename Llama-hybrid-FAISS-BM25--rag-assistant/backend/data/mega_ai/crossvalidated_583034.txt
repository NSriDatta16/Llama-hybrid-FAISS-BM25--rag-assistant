As another answer mentioned, logistic regression assumes little to no correlation between independent variables. The report you mentioned says structural equation modeling (SEM) assumes independent variables are correlated, likely referring to software defaults (i.e., many SEM software packages assume you want to estimate correlations between independent variables). However, SEM does not require all independent variables to be correlated; it is simply the default.
