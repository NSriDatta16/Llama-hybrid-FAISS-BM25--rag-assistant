Preventing Memory Leaks with Attached Behaviours

I've created an "attached behaviour" in my WPF application which lets me handle the Enter keypress and move to the next control. I call it EnterKeyTraversal.IsEnabled, and you can see the code on my blog here . My main concern now is that I may have a memory leak, since I'm handling the PreviewKeyDown event on UIElements and never explicitly "unhook" the event. What's the best approach to prevent this leak (if indeed there is one)? Should I keep a list of the elements I'm managing, and unhook the PreviewKeyDown event in the Application.Exit event? Has anyone had success with attached behaviours in their own WPF applications and come up with an elegant memory-management solution?
