Eclipse PHP Zend: running old script even though it has been modified and saved?

i am running eclipse php with zendserver and debugging with zend debugger. that all worked. however, i just reinstalled windows 7 due to a computer crash and dragged over my eclipse folder from my old windows to my new (current) installation of windows. when i edited my old file, index.php, i saved it then ran in debug mode, but it looks exactly the same no matter how much i edit it. what could be the cause of this? thanks!
