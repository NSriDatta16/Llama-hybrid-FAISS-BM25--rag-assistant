If the data have an index ordering you can use white noise tests for time series. Essentially that means testing that the autocorrelations at all non zero lags are 0. This handles the independence part. I think your approach is trying to mainly address the identically distributed part of the assumption. I think there are some problems with your approach. I think you need a lot of splits to get enough p-values to test for uniformity. Then each K-S test loses power. If you are using splits that overlap on parts of the data set the tests will be correlated. With a small number of splits the test of uniformity lacks power. But with many splits the uniformity test may be powerful but the K-S tests would not. Also it seems that this approach won't help detect dependence between variables. @gu11aume I am not sure what you are asking for with a general test for non-time series. Spatial data provide one form of non-time series data. There the function called the variogram might be looked at. For one-dimensional sequences I don't see much difference between sequences ordered by time versus any other way of ordering the data. An autocorrelation function can still be defined and tested. When you say that you want to test independence in sampling, I think you have an order in which the samples are collected. So I think all the 1-dimensional cases work the same way.
