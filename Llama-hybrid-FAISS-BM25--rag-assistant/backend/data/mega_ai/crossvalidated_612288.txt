Analysis for relationship between ordinal and nominal variables

I need to test the relationship between 3 variables. The problem is, one variable is ordinal and the other two are nominal (more precisely, both are from a dichotomous scale). I have already looked for this, but it seems to me that there is no suitable type of analysis. The best way currently seems to me to use a logistic regression, but the ordinal variable does not fit in there. Do you have any ideas which I can search for or a possible solution?
