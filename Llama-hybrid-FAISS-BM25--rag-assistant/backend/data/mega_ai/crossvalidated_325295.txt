If your interests lie in (convex) optimisation applied to deep learning (you mention transfer learning, which is widely used in practice with neural networks) applications, I strongly encourage you to consider reading chapter 8 (optimization for training deep neural networks) of http://www.deeplearningbook.org/ There is a discussion of convex optimisation, and why it has not yet been so successful when applied deep neural networks. Of course, perhaps you could do research in this area that will change the current consensus!
