Make an installer for python project

I downloaded an open source project http://gmapcatcher.googlecode.com/files/GMapCatcher-0.7.2.0.tar.gz and I am trying to modify a few things in the code but don't know how to test the code! I tried to make an installer for the project but nothing worked till now maybe I didn't follow the right steps or I am missing somthing. my question is how can I modify the code and test it ? and how can I make an installer for this project (I know there is an installer already in google but I want to make it myself).
