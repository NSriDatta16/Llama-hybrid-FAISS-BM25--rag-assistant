In some circumstances, noise is needed to prevent the discriminator from having a trivial job. For example if you want a conditional GAN to generate an MNIST digit conditioned on the label, then if you don't use noise you'll fail because the deterministic generator will only come up with 1 digit for each of the 10 labels, which the generator will easily pick out. As the data gets richer, this becomes less of a problem. While you might expect a discriminator to notice that the generator can only produce one image for each digit, it probably doesn't have enough capacity to notice that your SR generator only generates one super-resolution image per low-resolution image -- that would require memorizing pretty much every low-res image in the training dataset, which would be quite difficult. I'm sure there's also some probabilistic or game/information theoretic interpretation of (conditional) GANs under which removing the noise completely breaks the theory. However on a practical level it doesn't cause much problems when what you are conditioning on is sufficiently complex.
