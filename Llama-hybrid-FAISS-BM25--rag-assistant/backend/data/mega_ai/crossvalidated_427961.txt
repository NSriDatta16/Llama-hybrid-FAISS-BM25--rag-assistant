If I understand this correctly, you want to be able to determine which of 2 peaks a new value selected from your horizontal axis corresponds to. A logistic regression model should be able to do that pretty well. Consider each of your peaks to represent 1 of 2 classes, and collect a set of values representing both class membership and the horizontal-axis values, following your example in R: > n1 = 500 > n2 = 500 > classVals set.seed(1) > xVals logisticModel Then you could use this model to predict class membership for a new value along the horizontal axis: > predict(logisticModel,newdata=data.frame(xVals=12),type="response") 1 0.1105621 meaning that if a new case has a value of 12 then it has about 11% probability of belonging to the rightmost of the two classes. That looks pretty close to what one might gauge from your density plots.
