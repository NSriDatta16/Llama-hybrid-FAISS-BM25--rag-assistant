I think this example (which strips out most of the stuff except the languages and the division into tasks) shows that lmer can estimate the difference between language groups (English vs. non-English) even when English is included as a group in the random effect. In your case there would be interactions between task and proficiency, but that shouldn't change the random effects structure. This should work fine with variable numbers of speakers, as few as one per language (in a more extreme situation where most of the levels of the grouping variable have only one observation and a few have two, this is still theoretically possible but I wouldn't expect it to work well), and with a random effect of speaker as well. You should think carefully about the maximal model that applies to this design, but not necessarily try to fit it ... for example, (task|speaker_id) is theoretically estimable (because each speaker sees each task). In principle, you could use (task|language/speaker_id) (because as I understand it, speakers are nested within languages in this case). Make up a data frame with 10 observations each of 15 languages: language 1 is English, corresponding to task 2 dd $task lang)>1,1,2)) Assign uniform values to each language, with 0 for English (the model will assume these values are normally distributed, not uniform, but it doesn't change much) lval Make up a response with an added value of 0.5 for non-English languages set.seed(101) dd $y lang]+0.5*(as.numeric(dd$task=="1")) For more complicated designs, I'd suggest using ?simulate.formula from lme4. Fit the model: m The estimated effect of 'task' is -1.24, which is nearly equal to the true difference of 0.5 between English (0) and the average of the non-English languages (the non-English values range from 0.1 to 1.4, so 1.5/2 + 0.5) Predicted vs observed values by language: pp I'd suggest experimenting with some more complex simulated examples that match your experimental questions more closely and reassuring yourself that the model can reliably extract the effects you're interested in ...
