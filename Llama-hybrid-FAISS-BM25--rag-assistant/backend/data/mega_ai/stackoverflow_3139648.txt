Set Special Price Dates for Products in Magento

I am adding a simple Product in magento, in which I want to set the following, along with others:- Special Price Special Price From Date Special Price To date The problem seems to be the #2 & #3 points. I have been successful in setting the #1 point, but I need help in solving the issues with the last 2 points. I have tried using the following two methods for #2 point:- setData() setSpecialFromDate() But neither of the above 2 methods had worked. Same case goes for the #3 point. Please if anybody can help, it is really appreciated.
