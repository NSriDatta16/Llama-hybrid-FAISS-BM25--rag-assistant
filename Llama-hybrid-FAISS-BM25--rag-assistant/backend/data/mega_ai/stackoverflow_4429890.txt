Since your collection is already sorted, just Insert the new item at the appropriate location which you can discover with a binary search . Unfortunately there is not a built-in binary search on IList but you can easily make an extension method that does the job. Be careful when you implement binary search that you do not introduce a classic bug (the bug is a possible overflow in computing the average of the low and high indexes as low + high might overflow). You could use List .BinarySearch as a template.
