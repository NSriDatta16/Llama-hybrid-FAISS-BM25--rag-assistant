Logistic Regression (or maybe a Hazard Model?) Question

I am trying to predict the probability that a bankruptcy will end in a certain month. As a background, these bankruptcies last 60 months maximum. My Y variable will be 1 if the bankruptcy ended early and 0 if it did not. I have the date it started, the date it ended, and thus I can figure out how long before it ends in terms of months. How do I go about this? Here's an example: The bankruptcy started on Jan 1, 2012. The bankruptcy ended on February 1, 2013. The bankruptcy should typically last 60 months but this one ended early. I need the probability it will end in month 1, 2, 3, ..., 60. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
