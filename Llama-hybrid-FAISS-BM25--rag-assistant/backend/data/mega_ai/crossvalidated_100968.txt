Choosing the right forecasting technique

I'm currently attempting to forecast visitor data for stores. My dataset includes daily visitor totals of three years. Note that the dataset isn't complete (stores can be closed for a few days, etc). I've augmented the dataset with weather data per day and holiday information (I have about 18 features per datapoint, including weekday,month,holiday,weather-data). My computer science background doesn't include a lot of statistical methodology, so I have a hard time figuring out which techniques I can use/should look into. My focus right now is on 1-ahead forecasting with a simple neural network in pylearn2, but the predictions that I'm getting out of it are highly inaccurate. I would like to evaluate some other techniques for comparison and evaluation. I could use some hints in the right directions, so I'm wondering: Which techniques could I look into for forecasting these numbers? And how could I simplify the problem to increase my succes?
