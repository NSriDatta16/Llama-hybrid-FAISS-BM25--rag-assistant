The model is the data access layer, which can just be a wrapper for a few simple queries to an ORM that manages the data entity relationships itself. It handles communication to the data source, retrieves data and usually organizes it into objects defined in your application. The views are just html files with bits of html and css with some templating engine (smarty, mako, etc) code to display the data passed to it the way you want. The controller puts it all together. Requests made to your page will be routed to a controller (class) and an action (method) within the controller. Just like any other application, the action will do what's requested of it, but it's still part of the controller. So, the controller uses the model to query data (users, content, etc), then passes the data to a view to be rendered and displayed the way you want.
