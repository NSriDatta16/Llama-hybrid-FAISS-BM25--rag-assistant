What is the best IDE for developing in Tomcat?

Recently I've been doing a bunch of work developing servlets for deployment in Tomcat 5.5. My current IDE is Eclipse Ganymede with WTP. I've been very unhappy with the Tomcat integration, as the configuration is constantly breaking and needing tweaking. I was wondering if anyone could recommend another IDE that handles this integration better. I am particularly interested in what people think of IntelliJ's support for Tomcat. Note I am also using Maven 2, and it's pretty essential to have Maven support as well.
