Bayesian networks might outperform Neural Networks in small data setting. If the prior information is properly managed via the network structure, priors and other hyperparameters, it might have an edge over Neural Networks. Neural Networks, especially the ones with more layers, are very well known to be data hungry. Almost by definition lots of data is necessary to properly train them.
