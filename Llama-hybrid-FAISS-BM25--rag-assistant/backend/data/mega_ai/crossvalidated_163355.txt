Why CLMM function for ordinal mixed logistic regression changes the means?

I am using CLMM to run the ordinal mixed logistic regression model as the DV is ordinal number from 1 to 9 (rating scale). First I read the file and change the DV into ordinal using these commands: > data1.frame data1.frame$response Then I run CLMM function: > mm1 And because I have three groups and I would like to see all pair contrasts, I run Tukey's pairwise comparison: > lsmeans(mm1, pairwise~group, adjust="tukey") $lsmeans group lsmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL english -0.63348352 0.4555165 NA -1.526388 0.2594206 L2 -0.01566743 0.4424304 NA -0.882920 0.8515852 thai -0.39563590 0.4546666 NA -1.286874 0.4956022 Confidence level used: 0.95 $contrasts contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value english - L2 -0.6178161 0.1564433 NA -3.949137 0.0002 english - thai -0.2378476 0.1873555 NA -1.269499 0.4125 L2 - thai 0.3799685 0.1538963 NA 2.468991 0.0362 P value adjustment: tukey method for a family of 3 means However, as you can see, in the 'lsmean' column, the mean of each group change into minus zero instead of something from 1 to 9. My question is: is this common when I change the DV from 1 to 9 into ordinal numbers? If yes, it seems like when plotting the graph, I have to use the actual means of each group, rather than relying on the means provided by this pairwise comparison.
