Merging two arrays without using extra space

I have 2 sorted arrays, a1 and a2 , of lengths l1 and l2 , respectively. The array a2 has empty space at the end of length l1 , so it can hold all of the elements of a1 in addition to its own elements. Now, I want to merge a1 into a2 so that a2 will contain all the elements of a1 and a2 in sorted order. Ideally this should use O(1) auxiliary storage space. I have the following cod,e but something is going wrong: public static int[] merge(int []a1,int a2[],int l1, int l2){ System.out.println("l1 =" +l1 + " l2=" +l2); int es = l2-l1; int fs = l2-es; System.out.println("es= " +es); System.out.println("fs = " + fs); int j=0; for(int i=0;i p;i--){ a[i]= a[i-1]; } a[p]= key; } Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? I used following data to run the code: int a1[]= new int[]{-1,0,7,8}; int a2[]= new int[7]; a2[0]=1; a2[1]=3; a2[2]=9; Output is l1 =4 l2=7 es= 3 fs = 4 -1 0 1 3 9 0 0
