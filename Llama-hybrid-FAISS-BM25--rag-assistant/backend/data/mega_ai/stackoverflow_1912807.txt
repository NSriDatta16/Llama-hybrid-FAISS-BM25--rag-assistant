Your task is classical for neural networks, which are intended first of all to solve exactly classification tasks. Neural network has rather simple realization in any language, and it is the "mainstream" of "machine learning", closer to AI than anything other. You just implement (or get existing implementation) standart neural network, for example multilayered network with learning by error back propagation, and give it learning examples in cycle. After some time of such learning you will get it working on real examples. You can read more about neural networks starting from here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network Also you can get links to many ready implementations here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_software
