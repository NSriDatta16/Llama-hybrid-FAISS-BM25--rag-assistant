It certainly seems that animal nested within participant is confounded with the residual variance, although it would help to see a relevant descriptive excerpt from the book (those pages aren't available on Google Books). with(dat,table(participant,animal)) shows the lack of replication that you refer to. Another hint that something is wrong with the model: intervals(lme1) ## Error in intervals.lme(lme1) : cannot get confidence intervals on var-cov components: Non-positive definite approximate variance-covariance It's also worth pointing out (I don't know if the authors do) that the estimated among-participant variance is zero, which could be due to a lack of replication or to a negative correlation within individuals (e.g. someone who likes grubs less than average would like stick insects more than average); this could in principle be handled by a compound symmetry correlation structure with a negative correlation. I've posted a similar example .
