Removing the block "Popular Tags" from the index view in Magento

I started working with Magento this week and I'm trying to create a new theme. Following the "Designing for Magento" article of the wiki, I tried to remove the Popular Tags block from the index view, adding this line to local.xml on magento\app\design\frontend\default\mytheme\layout: I don't why, but the tags are still there while if I do the following the language switcher disappears: I also tried this to no effect: tags_popular I even deleted tag.xml and the tags are still there! I know that I can get rid of them disabling the Mage_tag in the backend, buy I want to understand why this is not working. Thanks!
