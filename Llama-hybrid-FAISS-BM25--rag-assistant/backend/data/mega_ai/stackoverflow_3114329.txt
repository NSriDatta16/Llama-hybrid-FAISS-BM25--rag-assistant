Could be an unorthodox suggestion, but I would recommend studying English more deeply (I am also a non-native speaker). Expose yourself to as much English as possible! Watch movies, read English fiction, listen to technical podcasts. Mind you, if you really want to deepen your knowledge of English, you're probably not going to learn a lot watching "Transformers". On the other hand, diving into Ulysses probably is not a good strategy either. If you're feeling adventurous, you could always get a subscription to the New Yorker magazine. It'll do things to you - yes this is flamebaiting. :P
