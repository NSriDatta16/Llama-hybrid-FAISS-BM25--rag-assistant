First the obvious part. Variance and standard deviation are basically the same, the variance is simply the square of the standard deviation. I always prefer to use the standard deviation because it is easier to interpret, since it has the same units as your data. The SEM (standard error of the mean) is the standard deviation of the sample mean. This just measures what is the expected error in your estimation of the mean of the population, since you don't have an infinite number of examples and you are using your sample to estimate the mean of the whole population. You can of course, apply these measures for the same bin of several histograms... The main question that you should answer is: What do you really want to show? Once you know this the choice should be obvious. For example, if you want to show that all samples are very consistent/inconsistent, you could simply calculate the average sample standard deviation as well as the standard deviation of the samples' standard deviations. This could allow you to conclude something like, all samples have a very similar standard deviation of X, or, for instance, that all samples have in average a low standard deviation, but the sample standard deviation changes a lot between samples... From your question I am not sure, but maybe an ANOVA analysis can be interesting for your case. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance There's a nice episode of the Data Skeptic podcast explaining it in very simple terms: https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2016/anova
