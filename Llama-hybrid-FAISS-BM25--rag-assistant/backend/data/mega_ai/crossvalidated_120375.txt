Yes, you can use it. The problem is, that the cosine similarity is not a distance, that is why it is called similarity. Nevertheless, it can be converted to a distance as explained here . In fact, you can just use any distance. A very nice study of the properties of distance functions in high dimensional spaces (like it is usually the case in information retrieval) is On the Surprising Behavior of Distance Metrics in High Dimensional Space . It does not compare Euclidean vs. cosine though. I came across with this study where they claim that in high dimensional spaces, both distances tend to behave similarly.
