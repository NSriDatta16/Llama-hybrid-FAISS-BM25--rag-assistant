Suggestion for dragster/dropzone like dock menu

I'd like to create a dragster/dropzone like dock menu. Looks a bit like a stack with a nsview in it. After a lot if documentation searching and googling I've found a way to determine a dock icon's location. ( http://cocoadev.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1431 ) Is nzbdrop creating a view which just looks like an stack to display it's menu or is there a better way of creating this? Additional info: I'm not looking for the drop like functionality just the nice way the DropBox window is displayed as an bubble/stack menu on top of it's app icon.
