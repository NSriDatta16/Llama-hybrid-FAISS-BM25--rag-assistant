There is a SupportPac that installs a program called "saveqmgr.exe". Here's a link to the download of the Pac: http://shrinkster.com/17kc IBM seems to frequently reorganize its website, so the above link might not work if you check back here after a long while, but the SupportPac can be found easily by doing a search for "saveqmgr" on the Websphere MQ page. Hope this helps! IBM has this to say about the SupportPac: Abstract This SupportPac (saveqmgr) saves all the objects, such as queues, channels, etc, defined in a either local or remote queue manager to a file. Download Description This SupportPac interrogates the attributes of all the objects defined to a queue manager (either local or remote) and saves them to a file. Possible Uses The format of this file is suitable for use with runmqsc. It is therefore possible to use this SupportPac to save the definitions of objects known to a queue manager and subsequently recreate that queue manager.
