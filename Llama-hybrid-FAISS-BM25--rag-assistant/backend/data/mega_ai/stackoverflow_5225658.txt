I think you should not depend on any temporary storage for this -- Viewstate, Session, or otherwise. You seem to be using your .ascx like I would normally use a class... User control's going to be bigger, though, I imagine, since it has lots of html in it (?). Anyway, a generic list of a class would be...smaller, at least. But otherwise, my favorite approach is just to insert each record into a database when it's done (one-by-one) -- at least for manual input, which that's my impression of what you're working with. For example, using a listview, detailsview, gridview, etc.
