You have provided so little details about the problem that is going to be nearly impossible to give you a definitive answer. However, your comment to Allon's answer is interesting. If i run listener in console without WCF, all is fine So your DDE application is listening for something? I now have to assume that you have attempted to create a DDE client that subscribes to an advisory loop via DdeClient.StartAdvise . This method of data retrieval is highly dependent on a message pumping mechanism. When you create an instance of DdeClient it will by default create its own message pump on a separate thread to receive these advisory notifications. That would explain why it works when you leave your code in a basic console application. However, when you mix WCF there may be some adding complexities particularly concerning threads that may have to be dealt with manually. The only way I am going to be able to tell is if you provide more information.
