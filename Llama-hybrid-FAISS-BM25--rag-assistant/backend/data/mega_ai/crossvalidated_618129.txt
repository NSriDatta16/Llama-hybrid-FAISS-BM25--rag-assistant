Approach 1 In this case of a small number of marbles you can compute it by writing out all the possibilities that the marbles can be drawn. There are only ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ situations BBRR BRBR BRRB RRBB RBRB RBBR As strategy it is most efficient to choose the marble that is most abundant among the remaining marbles. Let's assume that for equal cases, when the red and blue marbles are equal in number, we choose blue over red (which is without loss of generality, the case where you choose red over blue is just the mirror image and using a random choice blends the two). The six situations occur with equal probability* and result in the following profits BBRR 1011 BRBR 1111 BRRB 1101 RRBB 0011 RBRB 0101 RBBR 0111 And the expectation value of the wins is the average of these cases $$\frac{3+4+3+2+2+3}{6} = 2 \frac{5}{6} \approx 2.83$$ Approach 2 A method that might be easier to generalize is to consider the distribution of the difference in the marbles each step (which follows approximately a half normal distribution). The expectation value of the profit in a particular turn as function of the total number of balls $n$ left in the urn and the difference $x$ is $$e(x,n) = 0.5 + x/n$$ Then we compute the mean by considering a half-normal distribution for $x$ with coefficient $\sigma^2 = 0.25 \min(n,N-n)$ (where $N$ is the number of balls from the start), which has as mean value $E(x) = \sigma \sqrt{2/\pi}$ and the expectation of all cases for the step when there are $n$ balls left is $$e(n) \approx 0.5 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{n\sqrt{\pi}} \sqrt{0.25 \min(n,N+1-n)}$$ And the total expectation will be $$\begin{array}{RCL} e &\approx &\sum_{n=1}^N e(n)\\ &\approx&0.5N + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left( \sum_{n=1}^{N/2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} + \sum_{n=N/2+1}^{N} \frac{\sqrt{N+1-n}}{n} \right) \end{array} $$ In the case of $N=4$ this approximation is $$2 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \left( \frac{\sqrt{1}}{1} +\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{1}}{4} \right) \approx 2.97 $$ *The draws are similar to randomly shuffling the balls and creating a combination . The probability of any particular combination here is for all six cases $\frac{2!2!}{4!}$ .
