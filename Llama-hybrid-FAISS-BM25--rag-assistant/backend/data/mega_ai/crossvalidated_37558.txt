Investigating the change in a proportion/ratio

I want to apologise in advance if this question seems a bit vague, but I'm not sure how is the best way to ask it. On the other hand I'm pretty sure this must be a common scenario so I hope to get answers ! I have a dataset that looks like this ID time treatment 1 1 A 2 1 A 3 2 B 4 3 A 5 3 A 6 3 A 7 3 B 8 4 B 9 4 A 10 5 A 11 6 B 12 7 B 13 7 A 14 7 A 15 7 B 16 8 A 17 8 B 18 9 B 19 10 B 20 11 A 21 11 A 22 12 B 23 13 B 24 14 B 24 15 A 25 16 B 26 16 A 27 18 B 28 19 B 29 19 A 30 20 B 31 21 B 32 22 B 33 22 A 34 23 B 35 24 B 36 25 B 37 26 A 38 26 B 39 27 B 40 27 B My real dataset is much bigger than this. I am interested in the general question: How has the ratio A/B changed over time ? To Answer this, I thought about just splitting the data into equal time periods, calculating A/B for each period and plotting them. But I noticed there is a big dependence of this on the time period I choose. Maybe that can't be avoided ? What other ways might I investigate this graphically ? The next question is whether the proportion has changed in a "significant" way from one period to the next (or perhaps from the start to the end). If the data were just divided into two, then I guess a simple t test would suffice, but I'm really thinking about many periods - perhaps 5 or 20, but other periods are also of interest - the data spans 5 years, so annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly and even daily periods could be considered. Are time series methods appropriate here ? I know nothing about time series at present - but it's something I am wanting to turn my eye to sometime in the near future.
