I need to find Simplest exercises available for learning neural networks

I'm learning neural networks, and I'd like to give myself simple exercises and try to train neural networks to solve them. I know that classifying hand-written digits is a classic problem, but I'm hoping for something much simpler than that. No image recognition, no thousand of input neurons. One exercise I thought of, is to get a number and find its modulo when dividing by 7. But it was explained to me that this is actually a difficult task for a neural network beginner for various reasons. Does anyone have ideas for a very simple exercise/training idea? Or a link to an existing list of exercises?
