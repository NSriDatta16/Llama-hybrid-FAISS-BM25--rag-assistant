A flash.media.Sound must either be: constructed/loaded with a URLRequest, inherit its data through embedding There currently is no provision for directly piping mp3 (or aac, or video) data to a any "media" object, such as Sound . You can only get the Sound object to download the data for itself. There are people who are upset about this , including myself; you are not alone! I say "at this stage" because it's not unthinkable that Adobe will update the API to make this possible in a future version. For the now, you're best to go with the decoding-to-a-dynamic-sound workaround mentioned by Juan, if you really need to be able to do this. And post a feature request at Adobe's bug tracker , or vote on an existing one!
