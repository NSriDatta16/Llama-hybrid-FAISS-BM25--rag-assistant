You could be describing a variation of named-entity recognition (NER). You have labels/ categories for tokens. Given a corpus (resumes), you want a NER tagger to classify tokens as belonging to one of the labels or not. You need to create a training set of ground-truth / "gold" labels of tokens and labels. Since you are only dealing with nouns, you can run a standard Part-Of-Speech (POS) Tagger then only custom tag the noun phrases. It best to take an active learning approach. Active learning makes tagging the training set part of the entire machine learning pipeline, thus greatly reducing the number of annotations. " Deep Active learning for named entity recognition " is the current state-of-the-art. Once you have a set of labels you can train NER classifier. The common options are Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (NER) and spaCy NER . A detailed example for Stanford Core NLP can be found here .
