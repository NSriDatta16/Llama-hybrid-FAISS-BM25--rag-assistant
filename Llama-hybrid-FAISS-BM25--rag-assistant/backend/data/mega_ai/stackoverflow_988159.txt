For our graphics we organize things into projects (like /graphics/marketing/NAILBA/2009/Banner represents our banner for the NAILBA {life insurance} conference this year). The folders /trunk and /branch are not mandatory, but they offer a clean way to explore ideas before selecting a single version. Since the HEAD is usually the only version that matters we don't use /tags. Now we don't create that much content (we program a suite of web apps, primarily) but this has worked well for our marketing projects (fliers, banners, websites etc).
