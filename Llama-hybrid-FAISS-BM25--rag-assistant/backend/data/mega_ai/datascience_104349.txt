Produce a forecast based upon multiple time series with variable lag

Firstly, I'm not a data scientist, but I am keen to understand the power of the subject and have invested some time in learning - most examples of time series analysis, however, consider only a single date series. I'm looking for advice on the most appropriate methods to learn/practice to allow me to develop a signature (prediction) of how one time-lagging variable affects another. The lag of cause/effect of one variable upon the other is variable depending on river flow, but likely to be between 2 and 8 hours. I would need to firstly demonstrate some evidence of correlation, accounting for the lag which I am able to calculate in any given circumstance, and then a mechanism of forecasting. The intention is to ultimately have a system automatically respond to a given situation by preparing in advance for an upstream change by reference to a signature, which would otherwise have reacted to the change as it arrived (and thus less effectively). Any prompts in the right direction appreciated.
