Measuring group homogeneity

I am trying to answer a hypothesis wherein companies with more heterogenous boards are more compliant and less likely to attempt fraud than companies with homogenous boards. So in effect I have a dataset containing hundreds of thousands of companies and details about the people behind each and everyone of them (such as age, sex, income level etc) Now I need to find a way to quantify similarity. The one approach I have tried is to calculate cosine distance from each board member to each board member within a single company and then take an average of these distances. I am, however, not particularly satisfied with this approach. I have tried to scour the internet for different measures to calculate for this kind of problem but haven't come up with any. Clustering indexes don't seem to apply here. Any idea on what to try? I would need the measurement to be standardized to certain range and preferably as robust as possible against differing board sizes.
