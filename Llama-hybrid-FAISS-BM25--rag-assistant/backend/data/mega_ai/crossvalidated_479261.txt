The kernel function is a function $K(x_1,x_2)$ which follows a few properties: in general it's the inner-product between $x_1,x_2$ in a higher-dimensional space. The kernel trick involves using such functions to treat inner-products between observations in the spaces described by the kernel function. For SVMs and other kernelizable algorithms (linear regression, PCA, K-means, etc) the interest is in defining a higher dimensional kernel space (even infinite dimensional) while keeping the complexity of the problem at circa $\mathcal O(n^3)$ (see Kernel Ridge Regression Efficiency ).
