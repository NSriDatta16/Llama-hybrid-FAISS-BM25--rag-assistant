If what you want to achieve is an "enforcement" of unit testing, I suggest checking in the post-commit (test do run slower than the usual commit operation) if the test coverage decreased for any class. even more, put that check in your Continuous Integration server. Of course, this may lead to "stupid" test of get and set just to get more coverage. This can be "prevented" by assigning a coverage threshold and alert only if the threshold is reached. This way you can sell the team the idea of a "mechanism to alert us if we make a mistake" instead of "a mechanism to punish you if you do wrong".
