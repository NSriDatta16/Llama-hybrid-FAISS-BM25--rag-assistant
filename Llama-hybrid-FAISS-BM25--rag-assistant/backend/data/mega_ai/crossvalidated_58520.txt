I found this paper : Au, et al. Automatic Forecasting of Double Seasonal Time Series with Applications on Mobility Network Traffic Prediction It is about predicting the mobile network traffic prediction using the automatic double seasonal ARIMA. As it is a research paper, it has clearly described the algorithm that one can adopt to adopt multi-seasonal ARIMA prediction. So far, it has given me enough background to proceed further with my research.
