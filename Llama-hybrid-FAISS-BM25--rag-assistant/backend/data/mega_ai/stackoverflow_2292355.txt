How can I programmatically access UI elements in a NIB without 'wiring' them?

I'm contemplating writing some helper functions to make it easier to do simple changes to the UI elements in my iPhone NIB. Mainly - I want to access a UILabel, or other element, via its Name in Interface Builder. Is this possible? Is there a smarter approach? Example Say I want to make a super simple iPhone app that displays 'Hello World'. I start a new project and then open the NIB and drag a UILabel into my view and give it a 'Name' of 'LblMain'. Now, presuming that I've included my handy helper function, I'd like to assign the label some new text something like this: [helper setText:@"Hello World" forLabel:@"LblMain"]; -or- UILabel *ObjTmp = [helper getUILabel:@"LblMain"]; ObjTemp.text = @"Hello World"; Now - the trick is that I didn't add a: IBoutlet UILabel *ObjLblMain; anywhere in .h file - I'm just accessing that label dynamically - wouldn't that be nice?! Now, for simple apps, to add some more labels or images, I could drag them into my NIB, assign them names in that element's inspector window, and then immediately access them inside code without the stuttering & hassle of adding them in the .h file. Motivation Basically, I'm frustrated that I have to wire every element in my NIB - it's a lot of stuttering and bookkeeping that I'd rather avoid. I could give a design some naming conventions, and they could generate a NIB without needing to be intimate with the implementation.
