How to access an NSNumberFormatter in a text field cell?

In XCode 3.2.x's Interface Builder this was simple enough, selecting the text cell displayed a small icon for the formatter that could be selected to configure the formatter in the attributes pane. Now in XCode 4, the formatter icon is gone! If I drag an instance of NSTextField with an NSTextFormatter from the library OR drop and NSTextFormatter into an existing cell there is no way I can figure out to select the formatter to configure it! Add to this the fact that Core Data entities UI prototype assistant was removed and I would say IB integration into XC4 is half baked at best! Any luck with this anyone?
