If you want to use your model for forecasting, having significant coefficients should not be that much concern. If you use it for inference (hypothesis testing), then it should be a concern. If your are confused how significant results could lead to low R-Squared, simply think in this way: I am 95% confident that my independent variable also could explain 5% of the variation of my dependent variable in the population. As it is mentioned in the comment, you should use accuracy measures for forecasting. If you have a time series, why don't you use time series models? auto.arima is a good function to work with. Water_vapor_quantity_kg.m2 could be an exogenous variable in your ARIMA model.
