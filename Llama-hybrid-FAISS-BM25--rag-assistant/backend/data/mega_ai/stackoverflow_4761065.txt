codeigniter sessions and cookies

I know that codeigniter stores it's sessions as a cookie, which, from reading around I understand to be somewhat insecure. So... I am planning to enable database storage for sessions, which I believe: a) Is safer? b) Allows you to store more data than the 4kb limit offered by cookies? However on the flipside I guess this will be slower for the system to retrieve, for example, in my application I regularly want to query the session data to determine if a user is logged in. Is is a good idea to store sessions in the database, or will this slow down my app considerably? Any other ideas or suggestions regarding sessions and cookies would be most appreciated.
