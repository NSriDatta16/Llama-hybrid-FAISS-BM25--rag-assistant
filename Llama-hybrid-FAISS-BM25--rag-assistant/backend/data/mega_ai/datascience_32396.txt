Classification using Orange 3

In Orange3 while only using its widgets, without writing Python code, Iâ€™ve implemented the following typical machine learning processes Train a training set, (1 file) Validating a validation set (e.g. using Naiive Bayes and kNN), and Testing the model with a test set.(another file) I keep getting: test and train datasets have different target variables error message. This is despite using exact same formats and names (with different values of course). What did I do wrong?
