Testing for statistical significance of the true positive detection rate between different machine learning models

Background Currently I am working on true positive detection for an image analysis problem. I have 4 methods and would like to test which methods differ from each other. Description of Data For each patient I have the number of false positives and true positives per method. What have I tried? I have looked through Andy Field's Discovering statistics using SPSS. According to this book I would have to run a one way repeated measures ANOVA. However, this would tell me that the group means differ significantly, but not what post hoc test to run. Questions What test would be best suited for this problem? Given the right test, what assumptions would I have to test for?
