In Psychology: Green (1991) indicates that $N > 50 + 8m$ (where m is the number of independent variables) is needed for testing multiple correlation and $N > 104 + m$ for testing individual predictors. Other rules that can be used are... Harris (1985) says that the number of participants should exceed the number of predictors by at least $50$. Van Voorhis & Morgan (2007) ( pdf ) using 6 or more predictors the absolute minimum of participants should be $10$. Though it is better to go for $30$ participants per variable.
