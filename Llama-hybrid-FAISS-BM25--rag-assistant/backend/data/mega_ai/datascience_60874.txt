Firstly for every expert you need to create a separate model because activity of one expert is totally different from other expert. Addressing your first problem : Appending fake accelerometer data will completely bias the results to one activity because at worst 50 points out of 250 i.e. 20% data is being augmented at your end. Rather you go with the number of points obtained for particular action performed by the expert, without appending fake/augmented data to the obtained accelerometer data. You can discard the points above 250, that will not affect the prediction much. Addressing your second problem: You can go for various statistical feature extraction such as (X,Y,Z)max, (X,Y,Z)min, (X,Y,Z)mean, (X,Y,Z)std. You can also use SMA(signal magnitude area) = |X|+|Y|+|Z| - The SMA variable is used to distinguish mobility (activity) and rest period in a time series. You can validate the correlation between the features and and the activity classes.
