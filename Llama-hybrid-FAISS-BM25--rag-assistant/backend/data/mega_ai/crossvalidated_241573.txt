The minimum and average distance between points are both vulnerable to outliers. Another possibility is the median distance between points. edit: Some more explanation: Take either the first or second image and add a red-point at (1000,1000). Do you want this single point to have a big effect on the overall distance between the red and blue clouds? If you don't, the mean-distance will give undesirable results in this case. Alternatively, consider a red-cloud contained in the unit-circle centered on (-1000,-1000) and a blue cloud in the unit circle centered on (1000, 1000). Suppose we add a single red-point at (1000,1000), do you want this to massively decrease the distances between the clouds? Because the minimum distance will do that. Using the median distance between points, neither situation will change the distance between clouds by much. Whether that is desirable depends on the specific application.
