The ormbattle.net webstite can be very miss leading, as different ORM are designed to be used in different ways, so simple benchmarks donâ€™t tell you match. You have two basic options. Choose the design of your system and database schema then find a data access system that works well for it. Or choose data access system and design your database schema to work well with it. E.g If you choose Nhibernate, you will find that Nhibernate experts will use a given style of database schema (and objects). Copy them and you will have the least pain. The problem is that no ORM copes well with all style of database schemas and you are unlikely to know until a long way into the development of a system what all you data storage needs are, unless you have written another similar system before. Remember you can always bypass the ORM and use hand written SQL if you find the your ORM is to slow for some updates.
