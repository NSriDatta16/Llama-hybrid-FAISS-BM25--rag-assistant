Use ACF and PACF for irregular time series?

Given an irregular daily time series where some days are missing, e.g. holidays and weekends. Suppose data is a zoo object in R, there are two ways to plot ACF of data (PACF in the same ways): acf(coredata(data)) acf(data, na.action = na.pass) The first approach will reindex the data so the data will be shift to eliminate the holidays and weekend. A regular ts is thus used in ACF. The second approach will interpolate NA in the ts. But I do not know how acf function deals with NA when na.action=na.pass is specified. The resulting plots were quite different so which approach is the correct one?
