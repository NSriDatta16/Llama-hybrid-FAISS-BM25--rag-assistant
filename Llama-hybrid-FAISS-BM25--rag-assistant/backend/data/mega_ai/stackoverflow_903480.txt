maven jetty does not shutdown properly in eclipse

I am currently running jetty from eclipse as an external java program. The problem is when I terminate jetty and I try to relaunch it again, it cannot due to the port still being in use. What I have to do is open up Windows Task Manager and kill the java process manually. How do you get jetty to shutdown/terminate/end nicely? The following are my maven jetty application settings Arguments: jetty:run-war MAVEN_OPTS: -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket, address=8080,server=y, suspend=y Setting suspend=n doesn't seem to solve the problem either.
