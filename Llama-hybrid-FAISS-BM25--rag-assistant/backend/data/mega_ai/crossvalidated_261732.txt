Time series with neural networks

I am new to neural networks (NN), so far I have been playing with the International Airline Passengers time-series dataset. To feed the NN, I transformed the data from: t i t i+1 t i+2 t i+3 ... to look like: t i t i+1 t i+1 t i+2 t i+2 t i+3 ... and then feed the NN with the latter. Now I would like to train neural networks on another dataset. I have three different features. The dataset looks like: t i s i r i t i+1 s i+1 r i+1 t i+2 s i+2 r i+2 t i+3 s i+3 r i+3 How can transform the dataset (as done previously) to feed it as input to the neural network? Would it be something like: t i s i r i t i+1 s i+1 r i+1 t i+1 s i+1 r i+1 t i+2 s i+2 r i+2 t i+2 s i+2 r i+2 t i+3 s i+3 r i+3 ... ?
