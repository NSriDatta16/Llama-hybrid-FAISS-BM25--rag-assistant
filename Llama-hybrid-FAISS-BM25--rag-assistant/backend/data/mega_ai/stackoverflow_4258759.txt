Crossbrowser method to cancel a drop event in a content edittable div

I want to be able to disallow images (and other stuff) from being dropped into a content editable div across browsers. I see how to do it for Chrome and IE. Firefox stubbornly refuses. The code snippet at http://jsbin.com/oqozo3 has an example which shows that the event is firing, I am cancelling it, and in Firefox the image still appears. Basically, The following fails to work in Firefox: ContentEditable fails in FF function init() { var target = document.getElementById("target"); if (target.addEventListener) { target.addEventListener ("dragenter", all, false); target.addEventListener ("dragover", all, false); target.addEventListener ("drop", all, false); target.addEventListener ("dragdrop", all, false); } else { target.attachEvent ("ondragenter", all, false); target.attachEvent ("ondragover", all, false); target.attachEvent ("ondrop", all, false); } } function all(event) { if (event.preventDefault) { event.preventDefault();} return false; } This is editable content I don't want the image to be draggable to the above div. Works in IE, Chrome, not firefox. I have already looked at: ContentEditable DIV - disabling drag and drop , but the suggestions there also don't work in Firefox.
