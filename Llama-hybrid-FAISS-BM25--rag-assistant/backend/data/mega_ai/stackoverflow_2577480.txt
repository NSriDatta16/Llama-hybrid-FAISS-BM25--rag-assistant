Javascript for conditional URL append or redirect based on window.location.href

I am trying to make a bookmarklet that when clicked will check the URL of the current tab/window to see if it contains 'char1' and/or 'char2' (a given character). If both chars are present it redirects to another URL, for the other two it will append the current URL respectively. I believe there must be a more elegant way of stating this than the following (which has so far worked perfectly for me) but I don't have great knowledge of Javascript. My (unwieldy & repetitive) working code (apologies): if (window.location.href.indexOf('char1') != -1 && window.location.href.indexOf('char2') != -1) { window.location="https://website.com/"; } else if (window.location.href.indexOf('char1') != -1) { window.location.assign(window.location.href += 'append1'); } else if (window.location.href.indexOf('char2') != -1) { window.location.assign(window.location.href += 'append2'); } Does exactly what I need it to but, well... not very graceful to say the least. Is there a simpler way to do this, perhaps with vars or a pseudo-object? Or better code?
