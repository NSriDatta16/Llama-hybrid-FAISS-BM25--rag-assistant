Reference for poor sampler mixing in large bayesian models

I keep seeing this in various presentations, but never saw a reference for it. Although it makes an intuitive sense why samplers potentially can face mixing issue when operating on large space of possibilities (i.e., in large Bayesian models), I wonder if there is a text book, or an article for this to cite?
