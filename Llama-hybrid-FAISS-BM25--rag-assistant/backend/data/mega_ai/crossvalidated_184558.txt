Bayesian inference on X's parameters by X's boundary sample data

Given $R = \{r_1,r_2,....\}$ and $T = \{t_1,t_2,....\}$ where $R If $X$'s distribution function $F(x,\alpha, \beta)$ is known. To estimate parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, I want to use following equation. $p(\alpha, \beta|r Is this correct application of bayesian inference?
