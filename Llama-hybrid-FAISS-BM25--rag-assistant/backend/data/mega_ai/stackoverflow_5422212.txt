search object within java collection

first, I don't know if I'm organizing my data efficiently, the idea is that I have pairs of key/value. public static class Freq implements Comparable { String term; double frequency; public Freq( String term, double frequency ) { this.term = term; this.frequency = frequency; } public int compareTo(Object o) { if(this.frequency == ((Freq) o).frequency) return 0; else if(this.frequency > ((Freq) o).frequency) return 1; else return -1; } Now, I'm storing such objects within a collection: List bla = new ArrayList () as well as sorting it. I'm interested to search for specific objects e.g. Freq.name = 'Bar' from the collection, which is sorted. How would I do that? Or I have to iterate the whole collection. or is there other more efficient ways to do this?
