What's the best measure of how much a value changes?

From a car, I get a value every second for accelerator pedal, from 0 to 100%. When you don't touch it, it reports 0%, and when you kick it to the max, that is 100%. I want to calculate how much change there is in this value. It will be one of many indicators of how you drive (how aggressively). The best I have so far, is to calculate the average absolute value of the change from one reading to the next. I am sure statistics offer something better, but I don't know what. My reasoning is that variance is not relevant. What I want is more like the total work you do on the pedal divided by how long the trip is. When posting this, I have to specify tags. When writing "change", autofill suggest "change scores". Is that something I should look into?
