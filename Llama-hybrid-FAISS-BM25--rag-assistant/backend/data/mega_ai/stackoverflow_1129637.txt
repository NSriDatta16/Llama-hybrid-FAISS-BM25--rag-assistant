Do you really intend to evaluate the architecture, ie. the internal structure of the aggregator? If I was doing that I'd be very interested in factors such as the decomposition into components, their degree of cohesiveness and their relative decoupling. These would be important for a number of reasons, not least the future felxibility of the product. Another place where the internal structure of the product becomes interesting is in the area of scalability and availability. If claims are made for such "ilities" I'd very much want to know "How does the architecture achieve that?" I think your approach of taking an external view, stacking up your non-functional requirements against the products "ilities", is probably the most pragmatic approach. I'd also be interested in the "ilities" of the vendor themselves - what's the installed base, do we believe in the ongoing support of the product, what leve of product support, is it local to your timemezone etc.
