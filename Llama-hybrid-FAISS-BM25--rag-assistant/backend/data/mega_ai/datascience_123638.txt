Seeking an RNA Sequence Tokenizer akin to OpenAI's tiktoken for Text

I want to train a language model tailored specifically for RNA sequences. Given the success of language models in the NLP domain, I believe there's significant potential to extract intricate patterns, motifs, and structures from RNA sequences using similar techniques. However, a major challenge I foresee is the tokenization of RNA sequences. While the immediate idea might be to tokenize based on the four nucleotides (A, C, G, U), I'm convinced that a simple mapping like ( $A \rightarrow 0$ ), ( $C \rightarrow 1$ ), and so forth, won't capture the complexities and nuances of RNA sequences, especially when feeding into a language model. To give an idea of the data, here's an example row from RNACEN: (8988364, 'URS00008926CC', datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 20, 18, 4, 7), 'RNACEN', 'AE0439B061E1640E', 1409, 'GTCGAACGGTAACAGGAAGCAGCTTGCTGCTTTGCTGACGAGTGGCGGACGGGTGAGTAATGTCTGGGAAACTGCCTGATGGAGGGGGATAACTACTGGAAACGGTGGCTAATACCGCATAACGTCGCAAGACCAAAGAGGGGGACCTT ... (1111 characters truncated) ... TCGACTCCATGAAGTCGGAATCGCTAGTAATCGTGGATCAGAATGCCACGGTGAATACGTTCCCGGGCCTTGTACACACCGCCCGTCACACCATGGGAGTGGGTTGCAAAAGAAGTAGGTAGCTTAACCTTCGGGAGGGCGCTTACCAC', None, '5ebae3845f9c331ae71786ed8c0fa100') Key Concerns: Depth of Tokenization: How can we tokenize RNA sequences in a manner that captures more than just individual nucleotides? Are there techniques that can encapsulate motifs, secondary structures, or other biological features inherent to RNA? Compatibility with Language Models: The tokenizer should be designed such that it's effective when used as input for deep learning models, especially language models like transformers. Efficiency and Scalability: Given the vast amounts of RNA sequence data available, the tokenization method should be efficient and scalable to handle large datasets. Questions: What advanced tokenization techniques are recommended for RNA sequences, especially when the end goal is to train a language model? Are there existing tools or libraries that offer sophisticated RNA tokenization, beyond the basic 0,1,2,3 mapping for the four nucleotides? EDIT: Currently, I have collected all RNA sequences from RAN Central and created a vocabulary using byte pair encoding (BPE) with 1000 tokens.
