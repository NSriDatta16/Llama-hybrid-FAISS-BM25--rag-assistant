There are three ways to do this that come to mind. You could store the state of the DIVs on the server side in the users session, if they have one. You'd need to use AJAX to send the DIV state back to the server, and then flag the DIV in some way when it is generated by the server (add a class to it or something) so that it will be left open. You could store the state of the DIVs in a cookie. The cookies project on Google Code provides a clean API and integration with jQuery: http://code.google.com/p/cookies/ You could store the state of the DIVs using HTML 5 local storage. Google search "html5 localstorage" for articles on the topic. Local storage is a new technology that is not available on older browsers (IE 6 and IE 7 for example).
