How to summarize data set in less than 100 bytes?

I'm in the beginning of a process learning to using accelerometer data to measure how good/bad a person drives a car (driver's behaviour). I want to decompose the acceleration into breaking, forward acceleration, sideways acceleration (cornering) and vertical acceleration. But I'm unaware of the sensor's physical orientation. What I do is to take the average reading from when the device is not moving and use this as the gravity. The I project the acceleration vectors on a plane orthogonal to the gravity. For a five minute driving trip, this can look like this: In the long term, I want to be able to determine the driving direction from this. Often it is easy, as the breaking acceleration usually is the largest. But not in this case. So for now I just want to describe this data set in a best possible way in 100 bytes or less. The accelerometer is on a separate device, and there are limitations on data traffic. What I have done is to update a table from 0 to 359 degrees with maximum values for each angle. But this is influenced too much by atypical values. The average may be a good alternative, or both. But I am not a statistician and I imagine that someone who is knows better ways to do this. So the question is how to describe/summarize this data set in 100 bytes or less. It won't be exact of course, but any improvements are welcome! edit: Here is the data set itself. This is the raw readings from the sensor: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19L3iw3kzeoyvHeOWLyhu7-T5dpxA63DIXZPQKRaG21o/edit?usp=sharing And see sheet 2 in the same document for another data set, driving a straight line accelerating normally and then breaking hard. (And repeating this pattern 3 or 4 times). In this data set it is very easy to see the breaking direction with max values. edit 2: I'm reading about skewness and kurtosis. Are those relevant here? Also I'm researching "circular regression", i.e. finding a best fit circle or ellipse for these points. Is that a good way to go?
