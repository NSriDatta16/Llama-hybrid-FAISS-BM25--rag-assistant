Why would an instrumental variable have its strength measured by an F-statistic?

A typical "rule of thumb" for instrumental variables is that an F-statistic of ten or higher indicates a strong instrument. This is mentioned in this Cross Validated post, which contains a reference to a Stock, Wright & Yogo (2002) article (that I cannot access), and I have seen such a value mentioned in primary literature that uses instrumental variable regression. Why consider an F-statistic at all? Unless the null hypothesis in the first stage of the two-stage least squares regression is absolutely true (which is probably is not), the F-statistic can be driven as high as is desired by increasing the sample size. The F-statistic is both a measure of the strength of the relationship and the sample size, rather than the measure of relationship strength that instrumental variable regression regards it. This seems tantamount to looking at the t-statistic (or p-value) of a t-test, seeing how large (or small) it is, and concluding that the effect must be gigantic. NO! That's what the effect-size quantifies. That practitioners often make the mistake of using p-values to measure effect size does not change the fact that it is a mistake. So what's with looking at the F-stat for instrumental variable regression? CITATION Stock, James H., Jonathan H. Wright, and Motohiro Yogo. "A survey of weak instruments and weak identification in generalized method of moments." Journal of Business & Economic Statistics 20.4 (2002): 518-529. EDIT I heard from some people today that the F-stat threshold for a “strong” instrument is becoming $100$ instead of $10$ . This makes me wonder if, with how easy it tends to be to get larger data sets than used to be available, it is way too easy to get $F=10$ despite a small effect size, prompting the bump up to $100$ .
