Secondary click toggle in OS X

I'm trying to write a program that serves to toggle a secondary click for a one button HID (in this case a touch screen). What I want to do is have the user touch a button on the screen that makes the next touch a right click. I simply don't know where to begin on this. I began by looking to Applescript, but found that this is impossible. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
