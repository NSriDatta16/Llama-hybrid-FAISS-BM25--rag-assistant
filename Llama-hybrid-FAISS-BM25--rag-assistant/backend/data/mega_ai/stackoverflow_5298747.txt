As written by David, applets can't access the local file system. They can send data to the host they came from (and receive answers from there), so you could store the highscores on the server, if you have some server-side program which accepts these highscores there. An alternative would be using a JNLP-deployed applet , then your applet could access an applet-specific local storage with a PersistenceService .
