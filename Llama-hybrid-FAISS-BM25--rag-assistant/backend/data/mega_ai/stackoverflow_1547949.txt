It all depends on what you're application is doing and what the specific code is doing. As thecoop says exceptions should be used for exceptional conditions. As an illustration take writing to a file. If checking for the existence of the file would slow your application down and/or the absence of the file is a serious problem then allow the exception to occur and trap that. If it's not so critical or recreating the file isn't a problem then do the file existence check first. I've seen it argued that all error handling should be done via exceptions (most recently in Clean Code by Robert Martin ) but I don't agree.
