Draggable With jQuery draggable plugin which is a part of the jQUery UI, you can set your selector yourself. For example a table row, that will work fine. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable There's also alot of options to make it behave the way you want, and you can also add callbacks with AJAX on what ever event you'd like. Selectable When it comes to selectable, I haven't tried it myself, but I read the Documentation, and it seems this is what you're looking for. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Selectable Good luck!
