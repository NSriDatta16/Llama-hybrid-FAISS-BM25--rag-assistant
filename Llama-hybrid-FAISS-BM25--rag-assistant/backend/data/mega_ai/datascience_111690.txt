Feature Selection - Comparing Performance of different size datasets

If I have training data X , with N features, and I do feature selection, and discover n of N (where n ) are basically relevant to target data Y (the other N - n are basically irrelevant), how do I assess the impact of feature selection of a feature selected dataset, n features, to full dataset, N features? Do I compare the performance on an identical neural network trained on "XN" vs. "Xn"? For example, if N = 20 , say, and n = 5 , and if I have a model with 3 layers, 18 nodes each, and an activation function F1 . Do I feed the same model with 20 and 5 inputs respectively? (Comparing well a model of 3 layers, 18 nodes, active_func = F1 , learns for 20 and 5 input features). "apples and apples" Or do I, for example, do a hyper parameter optimisation in both, so that I may be testing the impact of feature selection on my ML performance, with for "XN" a model of 3 layers, 18 nodes, active_func = F1 ("the optimal hyper parameters for this dataset"), and another with 2 layers, 12 nodes, active_func = F2 , ("the optimal hyperparameters for model with dataset n = 5 "). "apples and oranges" ? :) Thanks!
