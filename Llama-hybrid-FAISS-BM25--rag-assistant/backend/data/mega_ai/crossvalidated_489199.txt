In this kind of situation, you'll need to use unpaired tests. For example, the unpaired $t$ -test lets you compare the means of two different data sets. The two sets do not need to have the same number of data points, so this is particularly useful to you. Have a look at https://www.statstutor.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/unpaired-t-test.pdf for more information. You might want to ignore the cases where you have very few data points. Another option is using a Bayesian approach, although that will require you come up with a suitable prior and a distribution for each year's sample. For example, you might use a Gamma distribution for each individual sample taken, with a fixed shape and a scale that is some linear function of the year number; you can then find a distribution over possible slopes. This kind of approach requires several assumptions and takes a bit more work, but you might get more information out of it if you know how to use it properly.
