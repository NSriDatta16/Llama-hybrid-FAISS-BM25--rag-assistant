Callum's solution is powerful and flexible. A more limited solution that is slightly easier to implement is to leverage the spriteBatch color parameter. The variables Texture2D sprite; //Assuming you have loaded this somewhere Color color = Color.Red; //The color you want to use Vector2 position = new Vector2(0f, 0f); //the position to draw the sprite The drawing code //Start the spriteBatch segment, enable alpha blending for transparency spriteBatch.Begin(SpriteBlendMode.AlphaBlend); //Draw our sprite at the specified position using a specified color spriteBatch.Draw(sprite, position, color); //end the spritebatch spriteBatch.End(); If your sprite is all white, then using this method will turn your sprite red. Also, make sure you are using a file format with transparency in it, PNG is a favorite.
