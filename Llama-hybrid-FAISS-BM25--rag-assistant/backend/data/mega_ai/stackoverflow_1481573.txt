I haven't seen your error before. Note that you can't use the native Django database functions without using the "Django Helper" application: http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/appengine_helper_for_django.html You do not need to use Django Helper if you are only using parts of Django (but using native App Engine Models for storage): http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/overview.html
