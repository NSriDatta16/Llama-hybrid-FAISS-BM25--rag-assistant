The similarity used to train this model might be different from the similarity you expect. A better approach would be create your own large and good quality training set of similar and dissimilar sentences and fine-tune a pretrained model (the one from your question or some other ) using the same sentence transformers library ( https://www.sbert.net ). Another currently available alternative is to play with prompts for the huge commercial models (ChatGPT, GPT-4, Google Bard, etc) and hopefully they can understand what you want and do the task for you without any additional effort. For example ChatGPT said sentence B is more similar to A in 10/10 retries in my test.
