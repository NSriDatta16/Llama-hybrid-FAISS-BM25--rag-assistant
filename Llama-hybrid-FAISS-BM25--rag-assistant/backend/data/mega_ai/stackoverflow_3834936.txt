Can someone explain how to get an object position from the RIGHT?

I'm doing a drag and drop module now, and I need to get the position of the element on screen (don't really care if it is page, screen or offset or any thing else), but it has to be from the right as my project is in a RTL language....everything is RTL, so the data has to be saved like that to the DB because resolution and resizing matters... Does anyone know a jQuery/JavaScript/workaround for getting position from the right? I couldn't find anything about it.
