As mentioned in Using the Eclipse plugin page for js-test-driver, the correct update site is: http://js-test-driver.googlecode.com/svn/update/ But the following comment shows it may have been developed/tested mainly for Galileo (3.5) and not for Ganymede (3.4). do you support Eclipse 3.5? In eclipse's preference there is no Server Panel Yeah, we support Eclipse 3.5, I work extensively (almost exclusively) on it. Eclipse preferences should have a JS Test Driver, not a Server panel. The server panel is part of the JS Test Driver View.
