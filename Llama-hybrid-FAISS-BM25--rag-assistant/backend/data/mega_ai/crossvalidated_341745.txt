Let's take a quick step back. A logistic regression takes the following form: $$\text{log}\frac{\pi}{1-\pi} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2x_2... $$ where $\pi = P(Y=1 | X)$, where $Y=1$ is churn and $Y=0$ is not churn. Next, we know that the odds in favor of $Y=1$ can be written as: $$\text{odds}(Y=1|X) = \frac{P(Y=1|X)}{P(Y=0|X)} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2x_2+...}$$ In other words, a unit increase in $x_i$ increases the odds of churn - multiplicatively - by $e^{\beta_{i}}$, holding all other covariates equal. First, let's get the odds in favor of churning: $$\text{odds}(Y=1|X) = \frac{P(Y=1|X)}{P(Y=0|X)} = \frac{0.09}{1 - 0.09} = 0.0989$$ For your example, profileid_videos = -1.9924 . So you correctly conclude that the odds in favor of churning "increase" by a factor of $e^{-1.9924} =$ 0.136 for every 1 unit increase in $x_{video}$. That is, the odds in favor of churning get multiplied by 0.136 to yield 0.0134. This is your new odds of churn. You can say the odds of churn decrease by $\frac{0.0989 - 0.0134}{0.0989} = 0.86$. Which is equivalent to your conclusion, saying the odds of not churning increase by 86%. To convert this back to probability, we just apply the relationship above: $$\text{odds}(Y=1|X) = \frac{P(Y=1|X)}{1 - P(Y=1|X)} = 0.0134$$ And solve for $P(Y=1|X) = 0.0132$. This is the new probability of churn, given a 1 unit increase in $x_{video}$. There are a number of ways to interpret this new figure. One way, could be that the probability of churn decreased by $\frac{0.09 - 0.0132}{0.09}=0.853 = 85.3\%$
