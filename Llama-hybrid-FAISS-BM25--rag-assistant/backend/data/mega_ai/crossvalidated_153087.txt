Well the simple answer turned out to be: they should yield the same estimate. In the simple two period model, with no addtional controls, FD and DID yield the same estimate. That are at least two ways to see this. Either write up the DiD model and first difference it. Or write up the DiD estimator, and reorganize into the FD estimator. This is what the regressions showed, which was what tricked me in the first place.
