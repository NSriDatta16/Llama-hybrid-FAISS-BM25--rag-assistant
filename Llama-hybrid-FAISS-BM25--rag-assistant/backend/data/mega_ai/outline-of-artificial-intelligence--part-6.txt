The current flagship project is Project Aristo, the goal of which is computers that can pass school science examinations (4th grade, 8th grade, and 12th grade) after preparing for the examinations from the course texts and study guides. Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence European Neural Network Society Future of Humanity Institute Future of Life Institute – volunteer-run research and outreach organization that works to mitigate existential risks facing humanity, particularly existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence. ILabs International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Machine Intelligence Research Institute Partnership on AI – founded in September 2016 by Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. Apple joined in January 2017. It focuses on establishing best practices for artificial intelligence systems and to educate the public about AI.

Simon – 1960s (their students) Edward Feigenbaum – Raj Reddy – Seymour Papert – Ray Solomonoff – 1970s Douglas Hofstadter – 1980s Judea Pearl – Rodney Brooks – 1990s Yoshua Bengio – Hugo de Garis – known for his research on the use of genetic algorithms to evolve neural networks using three-dimensional cellular automata inside field programmable gate arrays. Geoffrey Hinton Yann LeCun – Chief AI Scientist at Facebook AI Research and founding director of the NYU Center for Data Science Ray Kurzweil – developed optical character recognition (OCR), text-to-speech synthesis, and speech recognition systems. He has also authored multiple books on artificial intelligence and its potential promise and peril. In December 2012 Kurzweil was hired by Google in a full-time director of engineering position to "work on new projects involving machine learning and language processing". Google co-founder Larry Page and Kurzweil agreed on a one-sentence job description: "to bring natural language understanding to Google". 2000s on Nick Bostrom – David Ferrucci – principal investigator who led the team that developed the Watson computer at IBM. Andrew Ng – Director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab. He founded the Google Brain project at Google, which developed very large scale artificial neural networks using Google's distributed compute infrastructure. He is also co-founder
