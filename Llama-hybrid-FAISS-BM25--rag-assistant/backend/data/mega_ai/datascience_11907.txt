In my experience, when people claim to have an automated approach to feature engineering, they really mean "feature generation", and what they're actually talking about is that they've built a deep neural network of some sort. To be fair, in a limited sense, this could be a true claim. Properly trained deep neural networks can handle any number of pairwise correlations between individual features or groups of features. That said, without a great deal of up-front data pre-processing tools that know how to intelligently handle different types of input data (e.g., free text, images, etc.), none of this would be possible. Bottom line, it takes a great deal of manual effort to do something automatically.
