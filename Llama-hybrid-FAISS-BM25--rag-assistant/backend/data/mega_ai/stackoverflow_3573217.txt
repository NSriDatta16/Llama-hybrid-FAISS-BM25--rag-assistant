How to disable specific JavaScript object

HI All, Is there a way to disable specific JavaScript object, while all other JS objects will be available for execution? Something like a script in the top line which controls the rest of JS code on the page. For example I want to prevent navigator.userAgent execution and leave navigator.appVersion available. Or even more advanced way, the execution result must be defined by me. Let's say my browser is FF 3.6.8 but navigator.userAgent would reture IE 8.0 Mostly I'm interested in disabling or superseding objects results that return information about user Browser, Cookie, Resolution and OS Thanks in Advance.
