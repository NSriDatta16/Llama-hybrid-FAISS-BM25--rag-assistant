You should read " Compressing Web Content with mod_gzip and mod_deflate " by Stephen Pierzchala. From a pragmatic point of view, I suggest mod_deflate because it is easy to configure, well documented , and actively maintained. Also, a precompiled version of mod_deflate is more than likely available for your server. Apache may even come with mod_deflate , as is the case with the Windows installer and apache2.2-bin Debian package.
