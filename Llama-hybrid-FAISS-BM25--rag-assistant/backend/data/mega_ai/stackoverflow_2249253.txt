setBackingStoreLocation

What is the base path of setBackingStoreLocation ? I've setNoStorage to false. I see datastore-indexes-auto.xml being created in \WEB-INF\appengine-generated(not \war\WEB-INF\appengine-generated). I've tried providing an empty string, null, not setting it at all, and an absolute path, all with both a file name specified as well as with just a path specified.
