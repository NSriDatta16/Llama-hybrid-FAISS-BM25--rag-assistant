Question on Xreg - potential double accounting

I am using the auto.arima() function with xreg feature to forecast total number of helpdesk calls. So, input to the time series is total number of calls and input to xreg is number of devices (also using time series to forecast the total number of devices in the future). Since the total number of calls increases when the number of devices increase, and the historical data for total number of calls already factors in the increase in devices, will there be double accounting if I still use total number of devices as additional predictor?
