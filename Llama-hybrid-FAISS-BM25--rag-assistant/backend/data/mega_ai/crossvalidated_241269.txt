This depends a bit on whether interpolating between points to infill missing data points makes sense, i.e. is there a high correlation between points or are they completely random at each minute reading. If they are correlated then filling them in with even time intervals is probably the way to go. If the values are random and independent of each other, then this would not work. The second method would (probably) not work, one issue would be that the time itself does not really impact the values directly, so you would have an input without predictive power in your RNN. This tends to produce poor results. The other large issue is to get your RNN to produce time points in the future; ANNs typically don't produce values outside of the observed range of input data. If the interpolation method doesn't work for your time series data, I might recommend resampling at a coarser frequency, for example every 5 or 10 seconds, and grab the closest point you can at each of those intervals (or average if needed). It would reduce some information but would avoid potentially interpolating where it doesn't make sense. In short this is a non-trivial question and as far as I know there is no standard or universal way of handling the issue of variable time increments, but hopefully these are some helpful thoughts.
