An easy method is to implement the pagecounter as image script: And mark that URL as inaccessible to spiders/crawlers via robots.txt , where you can either use * for all, or just Googlebot to exclude it: User-agent: * Disallow: /counter.php The alternative would be to just check for stristr($_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT", "Googlebot") in the script, and simply not up the counter then.
