I would remove the classes with very few samples, as they create discrepancies in the model and also help with skew. I would try to create new features by combining the features which are similar/ or have similar influence on the outcome. This is because as compared to the number of samples, you have too many features. Try using logistic regression and see the results. Logreg works great with such data.
