I would say that your functions will mostly work in R, but that is far from being universally true. I went through the same conversion before myself, and it was actually quite painful. Especially given all the functions that are actually writing in a foreign language (like C). As an example: it looks like you have some S-Plus timeSeries objects in there. It can be painful to convert functions that use or rely on the timeSeries object in S-Plus, and you will have a slightly rude awakening because the R time series libraries simply aren't as standardized or as user friendly. This is not to criticize the R libraries, but simply to point out that S-Plus was created by one company and there is only one timeSeries object and everything uses it consistently.
