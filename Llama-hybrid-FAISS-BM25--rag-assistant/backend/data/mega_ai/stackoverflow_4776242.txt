To quote you... This did seem to start happening when I started building with Proguard for release builds Since release builds and debug builds use different keys for signing, they can't coexist on the same device. Are you sure you aren't uninstalling your debug build when you install your release build? Uninstalls will nuke any preferences tied to the app. Since you say you have no code that would erase preferences, the only other way I know of for preferences to go away is if the physical preferences XML file gets cleared or deleted. So, you might check to make sure you don't have any code that clears out files in your application local storage area.
