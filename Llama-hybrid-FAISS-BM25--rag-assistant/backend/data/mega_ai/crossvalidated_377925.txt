ROC curve: models have different FPR ranges

I've created ROC curves by calculating the TPR and FPR at various thresholds. The FPR range differs between models, so I'm wondering if AUC is still a valid way to compare the curves. A curve will have a low AUC value if it has a small FPR range, but this doesn't make it a worse model, does it? Sidenote: These aren't machine learning models. I'm considering subsets of biological data as a model, and comparing results from each subset to those of the complete dataset to determine the accuracy of results.
