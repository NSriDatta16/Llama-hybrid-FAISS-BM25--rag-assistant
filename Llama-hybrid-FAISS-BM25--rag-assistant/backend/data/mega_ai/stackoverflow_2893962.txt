An alternative debug env is to use something like Asterisk with a voicexml browser plugin like the one from http://www.voiceglue.org/ or for a limited licence, i6net. You can keep all the pieces separate(dynamic html and vxml application in php/jsp/j2ee/, tts processing, and optional asr processing as separate virtual machines with something like virtualbox. If the logic can be kept the same, then it is just a matter of changing the UI based on the channel. A softphone is all you need to call a minimal asterisk machine, which has the voicexml browser with the url of the vxml in the call plan. I just used Zend Framework as php is used in this environment, and changed view suffixes(phtml vs vxml) based on the user-agent string. Flite for tts is fine for debugging, and when your app is ready you can either record phrases, and there was a page on the ubuntu forums with directions for how to increase flite quality with some additional sound files.
