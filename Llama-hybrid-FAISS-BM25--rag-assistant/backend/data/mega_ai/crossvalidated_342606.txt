Dynamic Time Warping may be the way to go ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping ). However, this method assumes that there may be a non-linear warp between different parts of the time series. If you are not expecting warping or delays in the signal, something as simple as Euclidean distance may be a better way to go. Of course, you should apply Euclidean distance only after you applied some preprocessing (for instance, amplitude scaling). If you can vectorize your time serie you could also measure the cosine similarity between the resulting vectors.
