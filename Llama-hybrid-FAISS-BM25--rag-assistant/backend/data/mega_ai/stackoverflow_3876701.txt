Embedding manifest error in visual studio build

When building C++ programs with VS2008 I occasionally get the following error message 1>Linking... 1>Embedding manifest... 1>Project : error PRJ0002 : Error result 31 returned from 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\bin\mt.exe'. Restarting the build is almost always successful, so it is a mere nuisance. I am curious as to what is going on.
