I think by accuracy you mean validation/test accuracy. Any Deep Learning Model is highly affected by the distribution of training data. If there is a mismatch between train set and test/val set then your model will perform poorly. Now, what do i mean by distribution of training data? For example, you yourself captured 5000 images of puppies and cats to build a image classifier. Now you downloaded some puppies and cat picture from internet and try to predict them. It is very likely that your model won't perform well on this test because your test data is from totally different distribution. Changing camera/resolution won't affect your performance if you make sure your train and test data comes from same distribution(like your camera and very very similar cameras like your ones).
