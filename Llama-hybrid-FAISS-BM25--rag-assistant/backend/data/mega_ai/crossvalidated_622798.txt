Here is a fairly general statement from Meyn & Tweedie (1994) that addresses the question: convergence to the invariant probability measure holds for all Harris recurrent aperiodic chains (without aperiodicity it fails!) with an additional result about the unicity of the stationary measure provided by recurrence only and another one about the convergence of the averages where $$S_n(f)=\sum_{i=1}^n f(\it\Phi_i)$$
