Is it problematic if one predictor in a set accounts for almost all the prediction?

I am running a logistic regression with customer event data with multiple predictors. However, one variable is extremely important, alone predicting 60% of the customers for the event. When this main predictor is included in the model, other predictors add very little to prediction over and above this main predictor. This main predictor is not a post event variable. The variable has full business support to be in the model. Given this, is it still okay to retain this main predictor variable in the model? Does this suggest that there is anything wrong with the model?
