How to create the magic .xcdatamodeld folder / package?

Recently, I managed (by accident, don't ask) to delete my Core Data datamodel files and classes. And I was completely and utterly unable to create the files again to be exactly the same as they would be in a freshly started project where those files are being prepared automatically by XCode. In a new project, the files would look like this: while all I was able to create was: Did I mention that the app didn't work anymore this way? It crashed saying the model must not be nil . The problem was solved by starting a new project with the same name and dragging the files over to the old one - not the most elegant solution, I suppose. I figured however that there are things about Core Data that I still don't quite understand, obviously. Please, enlighten me - what's the magic behind the .xcdatamodeld folder? Why would Foo.xcdatamodel feature that green checked-icon? Does the datamodel need to be compiled or processed in some way? Thanks alot guys!!!
