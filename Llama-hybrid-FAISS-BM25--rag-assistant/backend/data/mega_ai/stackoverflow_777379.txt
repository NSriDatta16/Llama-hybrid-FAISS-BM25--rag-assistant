Yes CSS is broken - though semantically you cannot call it a 'broken standard'. But the question is not really one of semantics. Experience of aiding in the definition of the UNICODE standard back in the late 80s and early 90s was good training for learning how to write a standard well. I have rolled my eyes so many times W3C write standards documentation that leaves immense holes in the definitions that lead to browsers interpreting things in different ways. There are many mutally exclusive parts to the CSS standard, even in v3, that have come about because we still have to keep compatibility with pre-CSS1. On the critical side, CSS has three mind-bendingly obvious issues that any computer scientist will tell you are both improperly designed and inconsitent. The Box Model - there are still huge holes in this even as CSS 3 approaches. The 'specificity' calculations. 'specificity' was implemented to patch a hole in CSS standard and then later to try and shore-up the ever conflicting rules. If stylesheets are be truely cascading then 'specificity' needs to be scrapped. Until it is CSS should be called SWISMCCS (sometimes-when-it-suits-me-CSS). Of course, in order to scrap this feature all the remaining issues with loose language in the standards need fixing - which in reality means it will never happen. Naming conventions for classes,selector etc allow the use of characters that are a problem for dynamic processing. The most obvious is allowing '-' symbol to be used in names. If you don't understand why I would encourage you to read up and bytecode compilers and compiler language parsing. So the answer is the CSS standard is not broken, the premise is sound, but the implementation of the standards documentation (not the browsers, the documentation) shows how conquest by committee will rarely get you something fully fit for purpose. I suppose this was because CSS was not created for trained programmers, it was created for web-designers - a strange breed who are not really programmers and not really designers. There are real web-developers who are different, but spend less time on pretty graphics. IMHO: CSS is broken. On the other hand, the alternatives are much worse. Better the devil-we-know. Role on the replacement for HTML.
