No to ANOVA, which assumes a normally distributed outcome variable (among other things). There are "old school" transformations to consider, but I would prefer logistic regression (equivalent to a chi square when there is only one independent variable, as in your case). The advantage of using logistic regression over a chi square test is that you can easily use a linear contrast to compare specific levels of the treatment if you find a significant result to the overall test (type 3). For example A versus B, B versus C etc. Update Added for clarity: Taking data at hand (the post doc data set from Allison ) and using the variable cits as follows, this was my point: postdocData $citsBin cits>2, 3, postdocData $cits) postdocData$ citsBin $citsBin) ordered(postdocData$ citsBin, levels=c("0", "1", "2", "3")) contrasts(postdocData $citsBin) citsBin) # 1 2 3 # 0 1 0 0 # 1 0 1 0 # 2 0 0 1 # 3 0 0 0 # fit the univariate logistic regression model model.1 Chisq) # citsBin 1.7977 3 0.6154 chisq.test(table(postdocData $citsBin, postdocData$ pdoc)) # X-squared = 1.7957, df = 3, p-value = 0.6159 # then can test differences in levels, such as: # contrast cits=0 minus cits=1 = 0 # Ho: Beta_1 - Beta_2 = 0 cVec
