You're going to need to use some kind of Temporary data storage. Something such as an Array or an ArrayList (http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html). List al = new ArrayList (); For your case Type would be Integer. Once you have everything stored in an ArrayList then you can just loop through the ArrayList to add up all the values. Also to find the "max" you will need to initially set an integer variable as -999. Then run through all of your values and if the value is > max then set that variable as max.
