EJB 3.1 application deployed as WAR-only: What about ejb-jar.xml?

I have a JavaEE6 application, consisting of Web stuff and EJBs and which is deployed as WAR-only (using EJB3.1). The build is based on Maven. I just read about a new possibility to order the module initialization in Java EE 6 here which i also need for my application. Also, i would like to have an option to define some EJB properties in XML. Since the example is deployed as an EAR-project the order is defined in the application.xml. But in a WAR-deployed project, there is no application.xml. Now i wonder where i can define such informations? Or is it possible to use an application.xml somehow in a WAR-deployed-app? EDIT: Oops i didn't read the module-order-example right, in the first moment i thought it was about in which order the EJBs in my app are loaded. Of course i have only one module in my WAR-app, so ordering makes no sense. Ok, but as i'm at it, one big question remains (also altered the question title to reflect the change): What about the ejb-jar.xml? Can i somehow define stuff about my EJBs in XML (as its useful for some settings, to avoid recompilation)?
