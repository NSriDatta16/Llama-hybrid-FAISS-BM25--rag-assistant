Your measurement processes is incompatible with linear regression. Given that your computer program rounds the measurement, and given the latent measurement is so low variance that it falls within 3 buckets, my recommendation is to reconsider the model likelihood and perform an ordinal logistic regression. Jeremy raises a good point that you have a problem with your parameter budget. 52 observations (assuming the 1 in 10 rule for binary logistic regression, which has been shown to be very liberal and in fact any such rule would require many more observations per parameter) would allow you to adjust for 4 additional parameters. You should strongly rethink rethink how to approach the model, starting with the likelihood.
