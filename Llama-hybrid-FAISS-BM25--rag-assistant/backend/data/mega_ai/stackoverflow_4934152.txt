I concur on the "Don't have a single CSS file" sentiment. Magento modules can each have their own stylesheet(s), and of course you already separate unrelated tasks into independent modules don't you? I would prefer it if Magento came with separate sheets for catalog, checkout, customer, etc. but sadly it does not, you'll have to do that yourself and maybe prepare a blank theme with them. It doesn't make sense to break it up according to developers. Devs come and go and are assigned different tasks. Magento also includes CSS & JS merging so you don't need to worry about having many sheets. There is Fooman Speedster and mod_pagespeed as well.
