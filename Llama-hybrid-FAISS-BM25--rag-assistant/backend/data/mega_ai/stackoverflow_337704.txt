Parameterize an SQL IN clause

How do I parameterize a query containing an IN clause with a variable number of arguments, like this one? SELECT * FROM Tags WHERE Name IN ('ruby','rails','scruffy','rubyonrails') ORDER BY Count DESC In this query, the number of arguments could be anywhere from 1 to 5. I would prefer not to use a dedicated stored procedure for this (or XML), but if there is some elegant way specific to SQL Server 2008 , I am open to that.
