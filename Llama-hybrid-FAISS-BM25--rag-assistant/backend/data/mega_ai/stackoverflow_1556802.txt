Programmatically extracting Adobe PDF package files

We have a bunch of documents in our organization that were inadvertently saved as Adobe PDF packages (also known as PDF 1.7 "collections"). We would like to convert these to normal PDFs (most of these "packages" contain one bog-standard pdf file), but given the number of files, it's not possible manually. Any Adobe expert know whether: There is an open-source or free library that handles PDF package format that I can write a script around? Does Adobe Pro 9 have a relevant scriptable interface that would allow me to extract the relevant file from each package? Alternatively, I'm looking at a macro-based approach, but I'd rather not go this route until investigating other options. Thanks!
