Although @cardinal has already given an answer that gives precisely the bound I was looking for, I have found a similar Chernoff-style argument that can give a stronger bound: Proposition : $$ Pr (T \leq n \log n - c n) \leq \exp(- \frac{3c^2}{\pi^2} ) \> . $$ (this is stronger for $c > \frac{\pi^2}{3}$ ) Proof : As in @cardinal's answer, we can use the fact that $T$ is a sum of independent geometric random variables $T_i$ with success probabilities $p_i = 1 - i/n$. It follows that $E[T_i] = 1/p_i$ and $E[T] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} E[T_i] = n \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i}\geq n \log n$. Define now new variables $S_i : = T_i - E[T_i]$, and $S : = \sum_i S_i$. We can then write $$ \Pr (T \leq n \log n - c n) \leq \Pr (T \leq E[T] - c n) = \Pr (S \leq - c n) $$ $$ = \Pr\left(\exp(-s S ) \geq \exp( s cn) \right) \leq e^{-s c n} E\left[ e^{-s S} \right] $$ Computing the averages, we have $$ E[e^{-s S}] = \prod_i E[e^{-s S_i}] = \prod_i \frac{e^{s / p_i} } {1 + \frac{1}{p_i} (e^s -1)} \leq e^{\frac{1}{2}s^2\sum_i p_i^{-2}} $$ where the inequality follows from the facts that $e^s - 1\geq s$ and also $\frac{e^z}{1+z}\leq e^{\frac{1}{2}z^2}$ for $z\geq 0$. Thus, since $\sum_i p_i ^{-2} = n^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{i^2} \leq n^2 \pi^2/6$, we can write \begin{align*} \Pr( T \leq n \log n - c n ) \leq e^{\frac{1}{12} (n \pi s)^2 - s c n}. \end{align*} Minimizing over $s>0$, we finally obtain $$ \Pr( T \leq n\log n -cn ) \leq e^{-\frac{3 c^2 }{\pi^2}} $$
