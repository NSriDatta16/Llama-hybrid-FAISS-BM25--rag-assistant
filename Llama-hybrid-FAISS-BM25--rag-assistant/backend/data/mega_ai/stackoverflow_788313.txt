Can I have two mail server for different emails

I have a registered domain name where the emails are handled by windows live admin center having a single mx record for my domain. I also have access to modify the dns records any time. We have around 20 email registered in windows live for my domain. for e.g. user1@example.com, user2@example.com etc. Some users want to go in for google app accounts as they say there are lots of features in it, and therefore I think I need more than one mail server in my organization. Is it possible that i can have some emails redirected to windows live and some to google apps, provided that I have access to change the dns and mx records?
