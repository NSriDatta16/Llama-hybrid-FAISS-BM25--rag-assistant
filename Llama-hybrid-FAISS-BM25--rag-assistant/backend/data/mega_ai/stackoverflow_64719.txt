I would suggest any time any user data is stored in a database and communicated, use https. Consider this requirement even if the user data is mundane, because even many of these mundane details are used by that user to identify themselves on other websites. Consider all the random security questions your bank asks you (like what street do you live on?). This can be taken from address fields really easily. In this case, the data is not what you consider a password, but it might as well be. Furthermore, you can never anticipate what user data will be used for a security question elsewhere. You can also expect that with the intelligence of the average web user (think your grandmother) that that tidbit of information might make up part of that user's password somewhere else. One pointer if you use https make it so that if the user types http://www.website-that-needs-https.com/etc/yadda.php they will automatically get redirected to https://www.website-that-needs-https.com/etc/yadda.php (personal pet peeve) However, if you're just doing a plain html webpage, that will be essentially a one-way transmission of information from the server to the user, don't worry about it.
