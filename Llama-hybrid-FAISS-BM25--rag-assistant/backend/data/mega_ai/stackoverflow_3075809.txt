Binding class method to event in google maps v3?

In V2 of the Google Maps API, you could bind map events to a class method using the GEvent.bind function: GEvent.bind(this.drag_marker, "dragstart", this, this.start_dragging_route); In the example above pretend that's a link from a prototype.init function, where start_dragging_route is a method inside the class. It appears that the bind method doesn't exist anymore, at least not in the documentation. If it's true I have one way to solve it, but it's a touch ugly so I'd love to hear some other solutions to this problem. How can I implement the GEvent.bind function in Google Maps API V3?
