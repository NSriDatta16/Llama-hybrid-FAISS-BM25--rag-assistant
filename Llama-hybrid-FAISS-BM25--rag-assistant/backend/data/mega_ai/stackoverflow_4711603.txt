NHibernate does not delete entity

In the TestFixtureTearDown-part of an NUnit test I try to delete some test-entities created in the TestFixtureSetUp-part. I use the following code sessionFactory = NHibernateHelper.CreateSessionFactory(cssc["DefaultTestConnectionString"].ConnectionString); uow = new NHibernateUnitOfWork(sessionFactory); var g = reposGebruiker.GetByName(gebruiker.GebruikerNaam); reposGebruiker.Delete(g); var k = reposKlant.GetByName(klant.Naam); reposKlant.Delete(k); // Commit changes to persistant storage uow.Commit(); However, after the commit, the two entities were still in the database. After searching on I came across this page on SO and so I added: uow.Session.Flush(); However, still the entities remain in the DB. Does anyone have an idea as to why this is?
