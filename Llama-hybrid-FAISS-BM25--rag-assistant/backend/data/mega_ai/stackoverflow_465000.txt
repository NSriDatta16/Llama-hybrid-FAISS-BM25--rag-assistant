We use S3 for storage very successfully and I've always kept an eye on EC2 for Windows and SQL Server support. So now these are available I dug further. I was pretty worried when I read this: http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2008/11/bad-storage-performance-on-amazon-ec2-windows-servers/ Perhaps, as we're developing what will hopefully become a very popular website, we should be considering the new data store models - Azure's or Amazon's SimpleDB. Hmmmmm - complete rewrite!
