Here's one valid reason I can think of: you want to figure out how to do it yourself. Which is fine, as long as you realize a production environment isn't for your own personal experiments. One might say "well look at how the CPAN module does it" but reading someone else's implementation is a poor substitute for doing it yourself. And honestly a lot of CPAN implementations are kind of terrifying. This might be disparaging on CPAN code quality, but its also a success story on just how well encapsulated and tested a CPAN module is that for the most part you don't notice. As to all the answers which are variations on "the CPAN shell is hard to set up", I agree. However, this is an O(1) problem. You solve it once and then you get easy access to CPAN for the rest of your life.
