Webapp that causes browser to issue an alert?

I am not sure exactly how to ask this question as I am not sure of the terminology I should use. I am writing a web application that is essentially a browser based IRC client. I wish to replicate some functionality I see in clients like x-chat where when you get a personal message it will alert the window manager. In my window manager (Aweosme wm) it turns the program tab red, in windows I imagine it would cause the programs button on the task bar to blink. Essentially it's a notification that tells the window manager that something has happened and the program wants your attention. What is the terminology for this functionality? Is it possible to make a webapp tell the browser to do this? If 'B' is yes then how?
