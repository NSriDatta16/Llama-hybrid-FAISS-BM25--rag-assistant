Uh. Seems like truncate and friends like to play with chars , but not their little cousins bytes . Here's a quick answer for your problem, but I don't know if there's a more straighforward and elegant question I mean answer def truncate_bytes(string, size) count = 0 string.chars.take_while{|c| (a += c.bytes.to_a.length) Give a look at the Chars class of ActiveSupport .
