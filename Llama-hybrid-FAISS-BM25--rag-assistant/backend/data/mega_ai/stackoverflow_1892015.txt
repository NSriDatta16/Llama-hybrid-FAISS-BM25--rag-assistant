Java Swing Fade Out Background

I have a Swing application and I'm trying to fade out the main application and show a window saying an operation is in progress (this is for long running operations that may need to block the UI). Is there an elegant way to do this in Swing (mainly the fading out the background) or maybe some swing library to help with this (maybe from swing labs)? Thanks, Jeff
