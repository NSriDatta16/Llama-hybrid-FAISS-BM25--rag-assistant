Approach 1 is the correct way to assess the coverage probability of an estimator. An estimator along with its variance estimate (which is also an estimator) are used to create a 95% CI independent of any knowledge of what future realizations of these data are . If you create N=5000 simulated realizations from the data and take the 2.5 and 97.5 quantiles, then you'll get 95% coverage each time... however, this has no connection to statistics. Each of those N=5000 realizations corresponds to one instance of the statistical experiment. The point of statistics is using the information from N=1 experiment to infer what the estimator will tend to be in the future N=4999 experiments. The estimator must be a function of a single dataset. The confusing bit may come from bootstrapping where for each N=1 experiment, you bootstrap simulated datasets N*=1000 based on the empirical distribution of the N=1 dataset . These empirical distributions are different for each of the N=5000 simulated realizations, however.
