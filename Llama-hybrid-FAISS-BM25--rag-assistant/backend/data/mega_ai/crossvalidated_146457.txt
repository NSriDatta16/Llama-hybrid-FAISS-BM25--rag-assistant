Considerations for forecasting

I am trying to make a generic forecaster for many short (~14 points) to long term (~365 points) time series data assuming the seasonal period to be weekly. The predictions are going to be made for a streaming input so I will have to automate most parts. The way I am approaching now is to loop through a bunch of time series models and pick the best one based on AIC. Probably, that is not the best idea but I am starting out with this. Could you please suggest what other considerations/approaches should I take? Some of the data is just too random without much seasonality or trends. Should I skip forecasting them? If so, how should I decide? What would be the best way to evaluate the predictions considering I have pretty large number(~100000) of datasets I am working with.
