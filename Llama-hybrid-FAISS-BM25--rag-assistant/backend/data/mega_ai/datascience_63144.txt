based on this information I would recommend to use Wilcoxon signed-rank test or paired Student's t test This depends on your sample size and distribution. To test if your data set is normally distributed you can use the Jarque-Bera test . I didn't work with Matlab yet, but I guess all the tests should be implemented in Matlab. From that point you could evaluate the impact of the condition on response time. Visualize your data (X on Y) - Scatter plot / Heatmap (if multivariate data). From here you could start building a model starting with linear regression going into more advanced models/approaches -- random forests, bootstrapping etc. Added If you only have binary variables (condition / no condition) - you need to set up dummy variables to perform a regression model (1 / 0) . Data then could look like: obs response-time any_condition condition_1 condition_2 condition_3 1 12.54 1 1 0 0 2 19.34 0 0 0 0 3 13.32 1 1 1 0 4 14.7 0 0 0 0 If you have multiple different "state" conditions, I would recommend to use a control variable ("any_condition") - to see if conditions (not specifying which, have an impact) on the response time. I hope that helps.
