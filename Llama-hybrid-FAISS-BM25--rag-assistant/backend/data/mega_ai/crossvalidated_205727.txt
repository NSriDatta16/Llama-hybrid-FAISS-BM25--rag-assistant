Hyperparameter optimization on large dataset

I have a huge dataset and want to carry out regression, such as gradient boosting. The problem is that the dataset is huge and hyperparameter optimization is computational expensive, especially I use cross validation for that. Is it OK to do the hyperparameter optimization on subsets of the dataset? Then can I average these hyperparameters from different subsets and use that to train my model on the whole dataset?
