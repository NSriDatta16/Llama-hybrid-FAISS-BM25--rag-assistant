Large inconsistency between ATE estimates from geralized random forest, propensity score matching etc

I have a RCT data set with about 10,000+ observations and 50+ covariates, and I am trying to estimate the ATE and compare the estimates from a couple of models. The models I use are: Geralized random forest (GRF): using the average_treatment_effect function Propensity score matching (PSM): I estimate the propensity score function of being treated and match each control unit with the closest treated unit (using the Matchit R package) Linear model in which the covariates are control variables However, the point estimates are very different: GRF gives 0.010 with a standard error of 0.021; propensity score matching gives 0.224 with a standard error of 0.051; the linear model gives 0.136 with a standard error of 0.036. From my past experience, this inconsistency seems unusual - different methods often yields quite consistent estimates, but it is not the case here. In general, why would there be huge differences between those estimates?
