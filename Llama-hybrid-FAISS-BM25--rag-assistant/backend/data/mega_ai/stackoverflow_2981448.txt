You should test your options from the command line first, and then translate the successes into your code. A PDF file usually does already include page margins. You "often cut" page content may result from a PDF which is meant for A4 page size printed on Letter format. PDF also uses some internal boxes which organize the page (and object) content: MediaBox , TrimBox , CropBox , Bleedbox . There are various options to control for which "media size" Ghostscript renders a given input: -dPDFFitPage -dUseTrimBox -dUseCropBox With PDFFitPage Ghostscript will render to the current page device size (usually the default page size). With UseTrimBox it will use the TrimBox (and it will at the same time set the PageSize to that value). With UseCropBox it will use the CropBox (and it will at the same time set the PageSize to that value). By default (give no parameter), Ghostscript will render using the MediaBox . Note, you can additionally control the overall size of your output by using -sPAPERSIZE (select amongst all pre-defined values Ghostscript knows) or (for more flexibility) use -dDEVICEWIDTHPOINTS=NNN -dDEVICEHEIGHTPOINTS=NNN to set up custom page sizes.
