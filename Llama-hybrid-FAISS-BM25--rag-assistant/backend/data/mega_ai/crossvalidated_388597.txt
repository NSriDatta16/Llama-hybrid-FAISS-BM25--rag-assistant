You seem to have an in-sample fit. In-sample accuracy is a very poor guide to out-of-sample accuracy, since you are invariably tempted to overfit. It's much better to use a holdout sample of (say) the last 10 observations, fit your model to the data without this holdout set, forecast into the holdout set and assess accuracy on these holdout observations. (Your in-sample fit looks reasonable, though.) We can't say whether a given MSE is "high" or "low". It is hard to say whether you have reached the limits of forecastability for a given time series. Ask yourself whether there are any drivers you could use to improve your forecast. And whether your accuracy is high enough for whatever you plan on doing with the forecast, i.e., the subsequent decisions. You may be interested in this online forecasting textbook , or a book I coauthored , which is less technical.
