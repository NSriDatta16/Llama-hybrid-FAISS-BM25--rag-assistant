Making a video player from scratch would have your first choosing a development path (Flash, Silverlight or HTML5) and then going from there. Unless you want to learn there are a lot of quality players that have already been developed and have active communities around them. JW Player is one of these: http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player/ Even with the player handled, you still need to encode your video, upload it, and do all sorts of not so fun management of your assets. There's a lot more work to self hosting video than people realize. It can be rewarding and good if there's a specific need for going this route, but often sticking with a service like Youtube or Vimeo is ideal. You get to do the fun part (IE share your video) without any of the development / management burden. In regards to playing youtube videos, you should just stick to embedding their player on their website. There are many customization options. This article discusses some of these options and how to do it.
