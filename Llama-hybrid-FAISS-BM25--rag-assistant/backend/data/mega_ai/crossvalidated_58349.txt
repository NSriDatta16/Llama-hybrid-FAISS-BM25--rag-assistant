Time series deseasonalization

How do you know when deseasonalization is not necessary? That is, from what I understand, if you want to just look at the trend and irregular components of a time series, then you just need to remove the seasonal component. However, let's say we're working with an irregular time series that is not affected by seasonality at all (for the sake of this example) and we want to see a trend of specific section of the remaining components. Would it be beneficial to remove the seasonal component anyways? Or would it skewer the remaining components? Any help is appreciated, thanks.
