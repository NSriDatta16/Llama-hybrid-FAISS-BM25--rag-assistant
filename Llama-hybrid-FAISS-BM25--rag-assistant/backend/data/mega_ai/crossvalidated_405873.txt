Population Monte Carlo Algorithm using L2 Distance Measure/ Likelihood Distribution

I am currently struggling with some concepts of the Population Monte Carlo Framework. Initially, I came across this set of algorithms as I am currently trying to infer parameters from a 7D mechanistic model. Unfortunately, the model contains correction factors of the form $g(x)= af(x)+b$ where $f(x)$ is the 7D model and $a,b$ are scaling and shift factors associated with the transformation of the measured current to the fundamental charge. The latter is what we want to describe based on fundamental parameters. The model has been tested against synthetic data and is valid. This is trying to move it to real measurement data. Using standard nonlinear techniques to infer the parameters results in a strong dependence on starting point. Excessive sampling with 10M samples using Parallel Tempering gives reasonable answers but is extremely slow and requires a certain degree of manual adjustments of the covariance matrix to achieve adequate sampling rates across various datasets. Being a lazy student, I looked for something automatic before resigning to manual tuning. Here I came across the Approximate Bayes set of algorithms. I used the previous described approach by Mark A. Beaumont(2009) . This worked great. It was able without much tuning to work out the parameters across various datasets, and only a little slower than the PT approach. Now though I discussed the results with one of the post docs supervising me. He wanted me to test out if it also worked with an L2 Distance Metric or a assumed Gaussian Likelihood instead of L1. This no longer is Approximate Bayesian computation and is more like the original Population Monte Carlo approach. In the ABC scheme, there is the acceptance of a move based on the distance which should be less than $\epsilon_t$ . I can not find a similar step in the original paper by Cappe 2004 . Is there an "acceptance criterion"? Thank you very much for your answers/ lit references in advance. A bit at a loss here.
