The discrepancy you see in the values for $\tau$ between the Kendall package and the zyp are due to reinflating the statistic by a factor of $(1-AR(1))$ used in the latter. You can disable this by setting the preserve.range.for.sig.test parameter to False in the zyp.trend.vector() function. This gives $\tau = 4.31$ which is much closer to the Kendall estimate. The the bootstrap function seems to produce nonsensical results when used in conjunction with the Kendall package. One way to solve this is to write your own block-bootstrap function. A similar problem was discussed in the reply for this question: Understanding the output of a bootstrap performed in R (tsboot, MannKendall) . The autocorrelation you are seeing (AR-1 and 2) disappears if you detrend the time series using a regular regression. Here is some crude code in R to do this: x Because of this I don't think that the violation of the assumption of no autocorrelation in the detrended series for the Mann-Kendall test is a problem.
