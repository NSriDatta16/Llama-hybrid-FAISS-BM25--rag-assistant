Here's the answer: the contents of the version control path is stored on the build agent in this folder: C:\Documents and Settings\ \Local Settings\Temp\BuildAgent\ \ where is the account that runs the build service, and is the number of your build agent. I have no clue why it was not there at first and what caused the build agent to finally fetch it from source control. Maybe just some patience is required if the version control path is changed or its contents gets updated?
