Manually scoring logistic regression model in SPSS?

First off, I'd like to apologize for my cluelessness, but I've come across a problem that I honestly have no clue how to circumvent. My programming skills are extremely limited, and my company uses SPSS 19 for most of their data analysis needs. I built a rather complex (as in, lots and lots of predictors) binary logistic regression model based on a sample from our primary dataset and would like to apply it to the rest of the dataset, which is featuring the exact same variables. Here is where SPSS makes life difficult for me - a xml-model export function and scoring wizard exist, but SPSS won't actually let me load the model I've exported (and informs me that my model is either not valid, which seems dubious, or is not supported by SPSS Statistics, with no explanation as to why). I suppose my question boils down to this: Is there any, really just about any foolproof way to score the rest of the dataset with the testing model? I'd be willing to delve into R, which I have no experience with, to make it work, at this point I'm just very desperate indeed. Thanks in advance.
