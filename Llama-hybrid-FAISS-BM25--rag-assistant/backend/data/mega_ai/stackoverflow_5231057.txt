Back Button brings HTML pages from browser cache. You do not have a control over it. But make sure that your authentication management does not let use the functionality that requires authenticated user. You may, however set "no-cache" is header. But, I strongly discourage it. see how: response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-cache");
