Is it possible to deploy Visual Studio Coded UI Tests to Azure or EC2 as Test Agents?

I'm not that entirely familiar with the testing suite that comes with Visual Studio 2010 (Ultimate) but I'm trying to find a means to produce something similar to Selenium Grid with the Coded UI Tests. I'd like to be able to deploy agents to Azure or EC2, execute all Coded UI tests, and then tear them down for a smoke test as part of a deployment process. From what I am seeing around the net, its possible to do something similiar to this via controllers and agents but I'm not certain how much of that can be easily migrated to the cloud. Ive found these posts: Load Testing with Agents running on Windows Azure : [ 1 2 3 ] but they surround load testing. It is my understanding that load tests can compiled and easily deployed but that is not necessarily the case for Coded UI tests.
