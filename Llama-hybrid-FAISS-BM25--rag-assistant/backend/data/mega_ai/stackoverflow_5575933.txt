Drag the Framework project into the App project's source list (on the left). I make a "Projects" folder in the source list for that exact purpose. Then, you can simply select your App Target, Get Info, and add the Framework as a Direct Dependency. Now, whenever you build your App, your Framework will be built as well. It's recommended to use a common Build Folder as well (Xcode->Preferences->Building) to help with linking.
