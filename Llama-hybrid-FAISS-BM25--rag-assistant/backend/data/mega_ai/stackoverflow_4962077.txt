Problem with spacing after anchor tag in IE6 and IE7

I'm having problems with my links in IE6 and IE7 (they're working fine in IE8). The HTML is correct and there are no unecessary spaces, but IE isn't removing the space between the end of the linked text - it's running straight on into the continuing paragraph text. I've searched endlessly, but can't find a solution for this. Any suggestions?
