Just run a contingency table, and then a logistic regression. contingency table: color x gender and color vs dialogue. Then, logistic regression color = a + b*gender + c*dialogue + d*dialogue *gender the interaction term will test your hipothesis that the main efect of gender isn't affected by dialogue. However, be awere that interpreting interactions terms in logistic regressions are tricky: Ai, Chunrong / Norton, Edward (2003): Interaction terms in logit and probit models, Economic Letters 80, p. 123â€“129 Last, but not least, I don't think you have a nested model, but a non-nested model. In any case, since the groups are small, It won't help you to model it as a multilevel model. So, just run a simple logistic regression.
