What's the interpretation of a Poisson regression model coefficient if there is no offset?

In a logistic regression model, e.g., $$logit(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2X_{2i}$$ where $Y_i \sim Bernoulli(\mu_i)$ , $expit(\beta_1)$ is the odds ratio. In a poisson regression model with an offset, e.g., \begin{align*} log(\mu_i) &= log(\lambda_i t_i)\\ &= log(\lambda_i) + log(t_i)\\ &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + log(t_i) \end{align*} where $Y_i \sim Poisson(\mu_i)$ , $\lambda_i$ is the mean rate per unit time, and $t_i$ is some unit of time, then $exp(\beta_1)$ is the incidence rate ratio. Now suppose that $t_i = 1$ for all $i = 1, \ldots, n$ . So we have $$log(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i}$$ My question is, what is $exp(\beta_1)$ called? Is it still the incidence rate ratio (but with a unit time of 1) or is there another word for it?
