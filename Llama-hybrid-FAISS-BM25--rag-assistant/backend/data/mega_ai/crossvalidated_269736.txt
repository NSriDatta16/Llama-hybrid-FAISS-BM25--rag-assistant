Two things to do when using kmeans: find optimal k number of clusters using both the elbow method and CH index; use a cluster bootstrap to check the stability of each cluster. The approach is well documented in the book Practical Data Science With R . You are lucky because the chapter on unsupervised learning is fully available free of charge as a sample. That said, I find it a little overshot to use clustering for a single dimension. Wouldn't a manual empirical analysis of the distribution accomplish the objective already?
