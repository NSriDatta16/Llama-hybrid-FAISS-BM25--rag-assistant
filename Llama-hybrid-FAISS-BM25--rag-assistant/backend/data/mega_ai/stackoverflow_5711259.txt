AtilaUy's answer is spot-on for the default way things work in Flying Saucer. The more general answer is that it asks the UserAgentContext. It will call setBaseURL() on the UserAgentContext when the document is set in. Then it will call resolveURL() to resolve relative URLs and ultimately resolveAndOpenStream() when it wants to read the actual resource data. Well, this answer is probably way too late for you to make use of it anyway, but I needed an answer like this when I set out, and setting a custom user agent context is the solution I ended up using.
