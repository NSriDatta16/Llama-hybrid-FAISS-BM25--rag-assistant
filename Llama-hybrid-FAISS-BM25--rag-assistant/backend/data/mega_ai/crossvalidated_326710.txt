Why is weight initialized as 1/sqrt(# of hidden nodes) in neural networks

I am currently reading Make your Own Neural Network by Tariq Rashid. He explains that instead of choosing weights randomly at a range of -1.0 to 1.0, initial weights should be in the range $ {1 \over \sqrt{n}}$ where n= # of hidden nodes in next hidden node layer. Why?
