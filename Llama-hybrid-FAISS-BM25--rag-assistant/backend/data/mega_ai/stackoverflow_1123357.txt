HTML parsing is hard! Even if you find a solution that works for one site, it will likely break in another. if you can find a library to help you your life will be a lot easier. If you can not find a html parser for actionscript 2, maybe you could set up a server script to it for you? Like: myXML.load("http://yourserver.com/cgi-bin/findrss?url=foo.com"); and then have it return the url as xml If you try this approach, I recommend the python library Beautiful Soup . I've used it before and, in my opinion, it's amazing. It will work on any website you give it, no matter how horrible the markup is. It would look something like this: #!/usr/bin/python import cgi import cgitb; cgitb.enable() # Optional; for debugging only import urllib2 from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup def getRssFromUrl(url): try: Response = urllib2.urlopen(url) except Exception: print " error getting url " return [] html = Response.read() soup = BeautifulSoup(html) rssFeeds = soup.findAll('link', attrs={"type" : "application/rss+xml"}) return rssFeeds print "Content-type: text/xml\n\n" form = cgi.FieldStorage() if form.has_key("url") is True: url = form["url"].value else: url = "" print " " rssFeeds = getRssFromUrl(url) for feed in rssFeeds: print (" %s " % feed["href"]) print " "
