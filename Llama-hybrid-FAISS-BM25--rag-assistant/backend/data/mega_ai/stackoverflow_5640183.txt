Gstreamer or VLC? For desktop and mobile platforms?

Is there any cross platform binaries available for Gstreamer to install it via Web start or Jnlp? Such as VLC seems almost have all platform compatibility but it does not provide Gst and commands are completely different. $gst-inspect filesrc missing $gst-inspect sdp missing $gst-inspect other codecs missing - lot of missing in other platforms or its bug in other platforms? note: I need to port Gstreamer from Linux working model to Iphone, Nokia, Blackberry, Symbian, Atom machine, Arm processors, Ipad, Meego, Windows/Mac/Bsd . Alternative of Gstreamer in such wide crossplatform is also a choice to ignore using Gstreamer, its good but very small future. Also the community seems dont have any action to make it happen, so as a developer it looks like loneliness in the big world
