What's Delphi Gantt/Scheduler component can I use?

I'm currently using DevExpress Scheduler's GanttView in my application, it does what I need except for one thing. My scheduler has multiple resources, and each resource has numerous events. The problem with the DevExpress scheduler is the height of each resource on the screen has to be the same, that means if a resource has 15 events, and another has 1 event, the resource with 1 event end up taking up lots of wasted space. Is there a scheduler available for Delphi that would adjust the height of each resource according to the number of events in it? The other requirements are quite simple: The time scale should be at 15mins of less Events can be drag to adjust start/end time Events can be drag to different resources Each event can be categories to different colours No event linking is necessary Events can start at anytime, no need to wait for previous event to finish Hope I've explained this ok, let me know if you need any clarifications
