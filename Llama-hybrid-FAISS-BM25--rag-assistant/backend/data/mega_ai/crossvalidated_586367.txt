Two ways I see. Marginal Effects You're basically asking about a contrast. The {marginaleffects} library handles this elegantly. library(tidyverse) library(rsample) library(marginaleffects) y % summary Term Contrast Effect Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) 2.5 % 97.5 % 1 sex M - F -0.6364 1.024 -0.6216 0.53419 -2.643 1.37 Model type: negbin Prediction type: response Here, the marginaleffects function call computes the Male/Female contrast. Bootstrapping # bootstrap compute_differences % mutate( difference = map(splits, compute_differences) ) %>% int_bca(difference, .fn = compute_differences) term .lower .estimate .upper .alpha .method 1 difference -2.85 -1.03 1.26 0.05 BCa Note that both of these methods only really work conditional on all the other variables being the same. If Sex is associated with a 14% change in the rate, then 14% of 100 is a lot more than 14% of 10.
