Update machine learning model while retaining the prediction results exact for old data

New to ML here. In our industry, we are looking for a type ML method/model that can be updated to accommodate new data points while keeping the prediction value of the historical data exactly the same. Of course a simple hash table would do, but are there other better alternatives. First question is what is this type of method/model called in the ML world. Where could I find some good examples/explanations of such techniques? Thanks
