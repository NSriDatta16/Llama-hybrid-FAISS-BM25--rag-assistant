Outlier detection with ARIMA models?

I have several different time series with monthly values for 8 years, where I fit an ARIMA model. And the purpose is to forecast the next year and indicate possible outliers in a fancy way. Is the simplest way of doing this just to check the graph and see which values are outside the confidence intervals of the suggested forecast by the ARIMA model? For e.g (random pic from google) Or can one, in say R , use some more fancy tools that would tell you the outliers aswell as the ARIMA forecasts?
