Suggestions on a solution for storing photos per client, which they can then have access to

I am trying to build an app for a photographer. These are his requirements: Photographer can upload photos or files (files up to 20-30mb). Photographer can categorize photos and files by client. Photographer can create client username and passwords. Photographer can send email from web interface to link to download. (which requires client login) Client can login and view and download photos and files assigned to his account. Photographer mentioned 1-2 terabytes of data needs to be stored. So, my questions: Is there an open source system out there that already does this. Is there an app already out there that does this. Photographer currently uses "yousendit" but the free solution is not sufficient since data is lost after 2 weeks. He mentioned he could host it on a box at his office, but his connection is limited.. thaughts? At that point storage space would not be an issue. I would have to code this app. GoDaddy hosting for example does unlimited storage with one of its plans that is reasonable. If I coded my own app, this would be perfect. I do hate GoDaddy though.. I will listen to any alternative suggestions. Thanks!!
