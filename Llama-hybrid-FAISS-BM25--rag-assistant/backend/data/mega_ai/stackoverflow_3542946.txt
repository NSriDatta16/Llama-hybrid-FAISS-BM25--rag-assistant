What are the things you have to do to make a panel work with a null layout manager?

I was having problems getting a null layout manager working, and I found this great page with things to remember when using a null layout manager. One of them was my issue, and I quickly moved on. I'm now having similar problems with another panel using a null layout manager. However, I cannot find this page anywhere! So what are the things? In the process of asking this question, I figured out my problem. I still want to add this knowledge to the site, since I couldn't find this question anywhere. It might be helpful to someone else. To clarify, I already have determined that I need to use a null layout manager for this panel, due to dragging and animation requirements. That is not the question.
