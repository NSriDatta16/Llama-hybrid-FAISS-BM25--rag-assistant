How to simulate the distribution of a diagnostic test

I have a parameter described as mean (95% CI low-hi) and would like to build a distribution that will have approximately that mean and lower/upper bounds. The constraints are that these are usually non-normal and all values have to be between 0 and 1. How would I go about that? One brute-force method I thought about is below, but I was wondering if there is a proper or, at least, more elegant way to do this. Note: A previous version of this question mentioned that these parameters are diagnostic test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity. bMoms
