The JavaEE spec does not dictate this, it is up to the individual implementations to decide. For example, the usual way to handle load balancing in Tomcat is to use replicated sessions , where the session data is multicast between the nodes. Storing session data in the database is a huge performance killer, and while Tomcat may support it, I really wouldn't recommend it.
