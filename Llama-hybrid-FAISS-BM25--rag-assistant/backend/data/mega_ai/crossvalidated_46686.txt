Here is a simple idea to help with understanding (it is linear rather than logistic regression, but the concept is the same). Imagine a dataset that is based on the coins in the pockets of several people (I will use US coins, but others would work), y is the total value of the coins, x1 is the total number of the coins, and x2 is the number of coins that are not quarters (or whatever the highest denomination common coin is). You can see that using one x at a time increasing x will increase y, but if we look at both x's at the same time then if we hold x1 (total number of coins) constant, but increase x2 (the interpretation of the slope) then y would decrease because that means replacing quarters with smaller valued coins. The same general concept will hold for other datasets, including yours.
