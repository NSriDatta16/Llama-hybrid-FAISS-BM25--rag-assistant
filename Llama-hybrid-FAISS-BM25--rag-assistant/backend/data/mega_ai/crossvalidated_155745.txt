Making forecasts in minitab only positive

I'm looking at 30 years of rainfall data, working with the daily average rainfall per month (That sounds weird... it's the total rainfall in the month, divided by number of days in the month). Anyway, after seasonal differencing it looks to fit to a SMA(1) process relatively well, but the forecast Minitab gives includes negative rainfalls. Is there a way to define that only values zero and up are appropriate for this forecast? Or perhaps something else I'm meant to have done with my data first?
