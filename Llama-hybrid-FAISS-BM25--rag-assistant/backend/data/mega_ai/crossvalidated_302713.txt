What is a collection of time series called?

I am involved in an engineering project. We concern ourselves with a manufacturing process in which mechanical parts are processed. Every time a part is processed we get a set of time series data. Let's say a part is produced in 5 seconds and we get temperature and torque with a rate of 1000 per second. So every Millisecond we write down the time (called timestamp) and the value and we do this for temperature and torque. Thus we get for each part two "lists" of time-value-pairs. Our system is not so exact so we cannot match up the time stamps exactly for both temperature and torque. Each of these lists is called a "time series" and for each time series we get about 5000 data entries (time-value-pairs). So for each processed part we have this data object which consists out of two time series. I am looking for a word for this data object. There is a mayor series of processed parts, where the parts are the elements of this series, but I am not concerned with that series. With () being a pair and [] a list, we got timeseries = [ (timestamp, value), ...(timestamp, value) ] word = [ ('temperature', timeseries), ('torque', timeseries) ] mayorsieries = [word, ..., word] So in total we have a series of "word" that consists out of multiple time series. Thus I am looking for a word for "multiple time series that belong together". It is not "multivariate time series" because the timestamps are not aligned. What does one call this data object in question?
