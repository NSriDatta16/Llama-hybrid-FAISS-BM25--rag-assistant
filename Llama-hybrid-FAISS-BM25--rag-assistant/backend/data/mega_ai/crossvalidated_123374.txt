It seems that cv.glm cannot handle any of the model averaging objects provided by either MuMIN or bbmle . I am looking for a similar answer, yet not for exactly the same question as yours. During my search, I found a blog post where a function is presented that allows cross-validation of MuMIN models. I thought it might be handy for you. Check out the link here Noam Ross` Blog in the bottom you should find the proposed Cross function. I only works with 2 models so you will have to adjust it. Did you find another solution already? If so, please post it here.
