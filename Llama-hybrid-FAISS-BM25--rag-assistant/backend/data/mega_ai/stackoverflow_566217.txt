There is this tool called JavaRebel which is a Java Agent that automatically reloads classes when they change. I forget if they support unexploded ear files, but in Jboss you can always deploy the ear as an exploded jar (directory) so to effect changes, you simply need to recompile the classes and update them and JavaRebel will update the running application on the fly. It works pretty decently too.
