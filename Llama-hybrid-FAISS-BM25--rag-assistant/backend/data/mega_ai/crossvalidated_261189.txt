(This answer does not really help with the Gibbs sampler much, but points at something else you could do. I do think the Gibbs sampler would converge). Recall that, $$p(X,Y) = p(Y | X) p(X)\, . $$ Now if you can sample from the marginal of $X$, then $X$ is the linchpin variable . You can use exact sampling methods if it is a known distribution, or you could use MCMC. This sampler should intuitively converge faster than the Gibbs sampler because the Markov chain is only present in $X$ here, whereas in the Gibbs sampler, the Markov chain samples both $(X, Y)$.
