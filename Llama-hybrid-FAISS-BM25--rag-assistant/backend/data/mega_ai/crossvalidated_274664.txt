To offer some alternative food for thought, here is a very simple real-world example where the MSE is not a suitable cost function, due to its symmetric nature (taken form Granger and Newbold's "Forecasting Economic Time Series" old but venerable book 2nd ed. 1986) (quote p. 125): "A bank intends to purchase a computer to handle its current accounts. To determine the size of computer to buy, a prediction of future business is made. If the prediction is too high, the result will be that the computer will be underutilized and a cheaper machine could have been bought. If the prediction is too low, the result will be that part of the accounts will have to be handled by other means. There is no reason to suppose that the cost of errors will be symmetric in these circumstances." When we "just" want to estimate some parameters, we have no argument to say that for example, deviating "to the right" is worse than deviating "to the left", and so symmetric cost functions are fine. But when we want to use these statistical estimates for decision making , real-world costs enter the picture, and they very well may not be symmetrical. See this post for a worked out example with general not-necessarily symmetric deviation costs. Obviously the above situation is a counter-example related to all symmetric cost functions, not just MSE.
