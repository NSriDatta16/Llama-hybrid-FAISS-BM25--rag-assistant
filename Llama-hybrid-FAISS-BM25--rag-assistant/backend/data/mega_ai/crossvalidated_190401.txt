Avoid Aliasing in sampled time series. If you are analyzing time series data that is sampled at regular intervals, then the sampling rate must be twice the frequency of the highest frequency component in the data you are sampling. This is the Nyquist sampling theory, and it applies to digital audio, but also to any time series sampled at regular intervals. The way to avoid aliasing is to filter out all frequencies above the nyquist rate, which is half the sampling rate. For example, for digital audio, a sample rate of 48 kHz will require a low-pass filter with a cutoff below 24 kHz. The effect of aliasing can be seen when wheels appear to spin backward, due to a strobiscopic effect where the strobe rate is close to the rate of revolution of the wheel. The slow rate observed is an alias of the actual rate of revolution.
