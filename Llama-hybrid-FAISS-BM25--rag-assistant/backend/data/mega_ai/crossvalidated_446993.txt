Indeed, this approximation is only valid over some region near the origin. I don't have time to do so right now, but it might be informative to simply plot the value of $K(0, x)$ in $\mathbb R$ for a moderate number of random features and a wide region. I'd dispute, though, that "no such discussion appears in the literature." Even in the original paper, the approximation theorem is for a compact region, and contains an error term based on the diameter of that region. This plot from my 2015 paper demonstrates the increase in empirical error; here $\breve z$ gives the embedding you used above and $\tilde z$ the (better) embedding which uses sin and cos of half as many frequencies, rather than cos with an offset. Sriperumbudur and Sz√°bo (2015) gave a bound with the (tighter) optimal-rate dependence on the radius of the approximation set.
