How to Split Time Series Data to train/test for RNN

Let's say I have a set of time series data with 32 time steps. My goal is to predict what the data value would be for the next time step, given data for 30 previous time steps. Would it be okay to split the dataset with overlapping parts as follows? train X set : index 1~30 // train Y set : index 31 test X set : index 2~31 // test Y set : index 32 P.S.: Set aside the dev set for now.
