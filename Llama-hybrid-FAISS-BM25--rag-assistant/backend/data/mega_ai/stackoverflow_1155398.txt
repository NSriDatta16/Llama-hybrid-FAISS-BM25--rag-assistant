I don't represent any kind of official answer but it makes sense that touchesBegan->touchesMoved has a longer duration than touchesMoved->touchesMoved. It would be frustrating to developers if every touchesBegan came along with a bunch of accidental touchesMoved events. Apple must have determined (experimentally) some distance at which a touch becomes a drag. Once the touchesMoved has begun, there is no need to perform this test any more because every point until the next touchesUp is guaranteed to be a touchesMoved. This seems to be what you are saying in your original post, Rythmic Fistman, and I just wanted to elaborate a bit more and say that I agree with your reasoning. This means if you're calculating a "drag velocity" of some sort, you are required to use distance traveled as a factor, rather than depending on the frequency of the update timer (which is better practice anyway).
