numpy join entries intersecting at a cell

In numpy, how can I join the entries that intersects at a cell? For example: Example http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/5162/matd.png In the example, I want to join rows/columns B and F into one row/column BF, where each element is the average of the ones with the same color.
