Both $t$ and $F$ distributions being outside exponential families, there is no conjugate distribution even in the central case (see Bayesian Choice , Chap. 3). You thus need to use non-conjugate priors and numerical methods like MCMC. For instance, using a flat prior on the non-centrality parameter. As for your question on "How are these used?", I can only advise reading at least an introduction to Bayesian inference...
