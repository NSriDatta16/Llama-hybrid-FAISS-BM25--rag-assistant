Here is a good explanation too: What is JSONP all about? EDIT: jsonpString Override the callback function name in a jsonp request. This value will be used instead of callback in the callback=? part of the query string in the url. So {jsonp:'onJsonPLoad'} would result in 'onJsonPLoad=?' passed to the server. jsonpCallbackString Specify the callback function name for a jsonp request. This value will be used instead of the random name automatically generated by jQuery. It is preferable to let jQuery generate a unique name as it'll make it easier to manage the requests and provide callbacks and error handling. You may want to specify the callback when you want to enable better browser caching of GET requests. taken from: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
