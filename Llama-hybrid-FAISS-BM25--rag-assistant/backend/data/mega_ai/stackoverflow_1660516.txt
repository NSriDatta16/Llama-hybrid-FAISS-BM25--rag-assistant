The fragment identifier (the # and everything that appears after it) is handled entirely client side, and is not sent to the server when the URI is requested. To make it available to PHP, you would have to: Allow the page to load Read the location with JavaScript Send it to the server using an Ajax technique (e.g. XMLHttpRequest) or in a subsequent request This won't make it available to the server at the time the original script runs, but nothing else can. An alternative approach would be to duplicate the information in the fragment identifier somewhere else in the URI (e.g. the query string). This is used by this site when submitting an answer.
