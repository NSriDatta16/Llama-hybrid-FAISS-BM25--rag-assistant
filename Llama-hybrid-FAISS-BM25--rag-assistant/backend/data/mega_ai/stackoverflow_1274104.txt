Drupal: Staying Organized with Module Changes

The deeper I get with Drupal the more I have to make changes to code within other people's modules. These are usually small changes, and so far it doesn't make sense to rewrite the module's functionality for my own needs. I'm trying not to make any modifications to Drupal core since that just seems like asking for trouble. But sooner than later, I'm going to need to update these modules with new releases and then repatch my changes back in. How do you stay organized when making these changes, upgrading modules, and re-applying your changes back? I'm taking as many notes as I can but the spiderweb is growing around me!
