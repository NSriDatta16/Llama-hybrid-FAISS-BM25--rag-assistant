The biggest problem with "my" is it gets redundant when you have a clear context for the current user. And gets redundant when listed on every item in any list. "Your" seems too rarely used to be familiar. For example, "My Documents" is obviously yours when it's shown on your desktop, in your home directory, or in "your home page" on a website (e.g. links across the top/side on twitter.com or facebook.com, when you're logged in). It seems natural to group these together, so when you can provide that context, dropping the "my" is shorter and simpler with no loss. For example, Stack Overflow uses the box at the top of the page to provide context for recent messages, profile, logout, and tools—all specific to the current user. You could even use "my" in some text to provide that context; similarly, "$user's" could be used to imply either the current user or another user: Home: [links to your home directory/page] - Documents - Downloads - Pictures - Profile - ... Simon: [links to either Simon's profile or Simon's home page] - Documents - Downloads - Pictures - ... Ultimately, you'll have to consider your target audience and what they will, on average, understand with the least effort. But shorter or simpler (from the user's POV) is almost always better: A designer knows he has reached perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. — Antoine de Saint Exupery
