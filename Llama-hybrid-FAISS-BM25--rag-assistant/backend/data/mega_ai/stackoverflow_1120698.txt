Flex: Testing UI components at the click level?

I've been working on a Flex component and I'd like to write some automated tests for it. The trouble is, the UI testing tools I've looked at ( FlexMonkey and Selenium Flex API ) don't simulate "enough": Most of the bugs which have come up so far relate to the way Flex deals with dragging and dropping, which these libraries can't simulate accurately enough. For example, I need to test a case where there is a "drop" event which occurs in the bottom half of a component – neither FlexMonkey nor Selenium Flex API can do that (they may simulate a mouse event, but they won't include coordinates). So, is there any "good" way to automate that sort of testing? Edit : After much research, it looks like the only piece of software that can do this is iMacros , which is Windows-only and the interface is... Lacking. So I'm going to be writing my own . Basically, it will put an HTTP interface on java.awt.Robot so code (in any language) can simulate mouse/keyboard events. If you're interested, PM me and I'll keep you updated. Edit 2 : I have published the first version of the framework I wrote, Blunderbuss, over at BitBucket: http://bitbucket.org/wolever/blunderbuss/ . You'll need Jython to run it ( http://www.jython.org/ ), but after that the flex-client example should work. Videos of Blunderbuss live over at Vimeo: Automating Flex testing with Blunderbuss Blunderbuss test suite running At the moment this remains a proof-of-concept, as I haven't had the cycles to clean it up and make it more useable… But maybe enough people bothering me would give me that time :)
