To do it the way the network does. Grab SharpPcap (Pcap wrapper for C#) and WinPcap (Windows) or libpcap (*nix). Write an application that creates SNMP packets to query the ARP table on the router. Note: The ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table is the table containing the mapping of IP address to MAC address. I've been thinking about implementing an example that does this lately but I don't have one to show yet. Once I do, I'll make sure it gets added to the SharpPcap examples found in the project's source tree.
