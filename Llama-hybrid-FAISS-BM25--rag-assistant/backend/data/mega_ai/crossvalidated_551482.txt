Interpretations of this residual value scatterplot of LinearRegression GridSearch CV model

I am very new to machine learning and did a first mini project predicting house price using GridSearchCV, elastic net model. Then I plotted out the residual value (Y_Predict - Y_Train) but I want to know whether the graph tells my model is good or bad? How do I translate it into valuable write-up? Or is there any other graph that I can use to tell more stories? I am sort of clueness about what else I can do based on this model, as this is my first model and I dont really know about the options so far. Thank you in advance! P.S. The MSE I got is 14195, RMSE is 20558, mean value of the dataset label "SalePrice" is 180815.
