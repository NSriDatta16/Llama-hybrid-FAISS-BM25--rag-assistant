http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/index.html Read chapters 2 and 3 and that will be enough to hit the ground running. The command you are likely looking for is svn update -rNNN however, without some background on SVN odds are excellent that you'll misuse it as SVN is very like (yet in some ways different) than the old school CVS, RCS, SCCS like systems. You might want to skim chapter 1 too, as the revisioning model SVN uses is a little different than tight locking models (if you've been using one of those).
