understanding random forest tree plot

I would like to understand the randomforest tree plot in this answer. The conditions and logic on each branch of the tree are very straightforward. But what does the content in the grey boxes at the end of the tree mean? Considering there are 3 species in the iris dataset, how do I know which of the species is actually being predicted according to the conditions in the branches?
