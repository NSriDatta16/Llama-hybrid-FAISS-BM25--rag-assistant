Change spacing of snaplines in Visual Studio

Is it possible to change the amount of space snaplines put between controls in a WinForms project in Visual Studio? For example, when I slide a textbox up to another textbox (one above the other), there's 6 pixels of space between the controls. I'd like there to be 5 pixels of space between them when they snap to each other. Thanks. EDIT: Thanks for all of the answers. I thought it might be helpful to summarize the approaches: Option 1 Set the Layout Mode to SnapLines (default) under Tools > Options > Windows Forms Designer > General and follow Igby Largeman's guidance in the accepted answer . Option 2 Set the Layout Mode to SnapToGrid and choose the spacing via Default Grid Cell Size. Thanks to Joe Caffeine and Marc Stober for this answer . Supplemental approach 1 Hold the ALT key when dragging controls to avoid using snapping altogether as Vigness.N suggested . Supplemental approach 2 Use arrow keys to move controls in pixel increments. Supplemental approach 3 Johannes Frank also suggests adding placeholder controls to assist with initial snaplines.
