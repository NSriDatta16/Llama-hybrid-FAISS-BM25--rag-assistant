From what I understand you are not just supposed to use EDM as a "pretty" database designer, in fact EDM does not depend on a specific storage layer. It tries to abstract that part for the developer. There are design schemas (CSDL) and storage schemas (SSDL). Anyway, don't mean to lecture you. ;) There is EDM Generator , which you use to create models and class, etc.. For a DDL kind of export, I've never done that but what I did was map my EDM to an existing database, which was easier for me to get started. There is a great tutorial on MSDN, which details step by step instructions on how to go about using an existing database, but also touches the how to start from scratch approach. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163286.aspx
