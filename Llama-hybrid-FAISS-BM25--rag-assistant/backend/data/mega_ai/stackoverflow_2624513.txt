You need a space between new and Array() : var Character = new Array(); The same applies to all the other lines making use of newArray() . Your code will run without errors after replacing all the occurrences of newArray() with new Array() , however as CMS previously suggested, you should consider using the array literal syntax instead: var Character = ["Larry Lightfoot", "Sam Wrightfield", "Gavin Hartfild", "Gail Quickfoot", "Robert Gragorian", "Peter Shain"]; Which as you can see, is much more readable than: var Character=new Array(); Character[0]="Larry Lightfoot"; Character[1]="Sam Wrightfield"; Character[2]="Gavin Hartfild"; Character[3]="Gail Quickfoot"; Character[4]="Robert Gragorian"; Character[5]="Peter Shain";
