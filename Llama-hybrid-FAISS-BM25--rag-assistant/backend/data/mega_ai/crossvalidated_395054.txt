What IrishStat has described is theory. Here's what you can try to do (I have not checked but just giving a theoretical possibility): You have an intuition that your series should have a higher correlation but excel is giving very low. As IrishStat has stated, for a non IID series/samples, the cross-correlation calculated will be biased. Now whether it will downward bias or upward, depends on the signs of the AR coefficients. For example, say X and Y in true sense are not correlated. However, both X and Y series have +ve (but less than one, i.e. stationary) sign of AR coefficient(s) then it is very likely that X(t+1), X(t) will tend to move together. Same will be with Y(t) and Y(t+1). This can result in a positive correlation when it actually doesn't exist. Similarly, if the signs are opposite, it will unnecessarily give a negative correlation. In your example, it could be that actually, correlation is high but the AR coefficients are opposite and dragging it down. So how to do? Fit ARIMA to both the series. Extract error terms and then check correlation between them.
