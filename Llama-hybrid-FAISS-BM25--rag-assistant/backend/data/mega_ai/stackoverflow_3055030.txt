Like others said, you can create two indexers. But to encourage the enum and to discourage to string, make the enum the indexer and name the string api something like "GetTheValueOfThisElementWhichCanBeUnsafe" or similar (you get the idea...). Lazy as I am, if both are indexers I could not care less but use the string version all the time. But if the API barks at me in a certain way, I at least see the implications in the code.
