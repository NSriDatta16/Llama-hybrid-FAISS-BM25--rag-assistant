Define the action you want performed, in this case ... a ScaleBy (as you want it relative to the current scale, not a definitive scale). When the touch is received, RepeatForever this action until the touch ends, then stop the action. If you wanted to implement an upper bounds so that the item does not grow beyond a certain point, then your ScaleBy would then be a ScaleTo with the upper bound set as the target scale. You will have to play around with the durations to get the feeling that your looking for, however. Too fast, too slow, etc ... those are up to you. - (void)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { UITouch* touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [[[Director sharedDirector] convertCoordinate: touch.location]; CGRect particularSpriteRect = CGMakeRect(particularSprite.position.x, particularSprite.position.y, particularSprite.contentSize.width, particularSprite.contentSize.height); if(CGRectContainsPoint(particularSpriteRect, location)) { // scale by 1.25 every 0.25 second while finger touching id a = [RepeatForever actionWithAction: [ScaleBy actionWithDuration: 0.25 scale: 1.25]; [a setTag: YOUR_TAG]; [particularSprite runAction: a]; return kEventHandled; } } - (void)ccTouchesEnded:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { // code to determine correct finger/touch releases omitted [particularSprite stopActionByTag: YOUR_TAG]; }
