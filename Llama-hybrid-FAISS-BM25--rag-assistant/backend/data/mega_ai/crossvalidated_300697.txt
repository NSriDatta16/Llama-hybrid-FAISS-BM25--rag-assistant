As you remarked, PCA doesn't know about the labels. In other words there is no guarantee that hyperplane that separates the classes is actually aligned with principal components. See this notebook for even more drastic example of this fact (hyperplane orthogonal to 1st principal component). Also, did you mean-center and standardize your data?
