I believe I answered a similar question you asked a while ago. IIUC, you want the more important terms to stand out, and you feel that "tom cruise" is more important than "cruise". This looks like a problem in your model of the data. TFIDF seems to be wrong for what you want. You can try building a language model, as described in Peter Norvig's "Beautiful Data" chapter . The gist is: Calculate a probability per each unigram, bigram and trigram (you will need smoothing or back-off as explained in the paper). Choose your terms by probability rather than TFIDF. A Language Model Approach to Keyphrase Extraction seems to do similar stuff. Some alternatives are Kea (which uses TFIDF as one feature among several) and Peter Turney's Keyphrase extraction work .
