It sounds like your header is defining objects ( _SA_GPIB_INTF , _fclose , etc.) when it should only be declaring them. Any objects that require storage must only be defined in a single source file. Also, the unresolved external symbol errors mean you're missing a library in the linking process (looks like the c standard library). Without seeing the header code itself, it's hard to get any more specific.
