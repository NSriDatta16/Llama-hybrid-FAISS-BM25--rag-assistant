for comparison you should check the same metrics for both models (F-metric, accuracy, ROC and etc). Cross validation is a technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data. It involves dividing the available data into multiple folds or subsets, using one of these folds as a validation set, and training the model on the remaining folds. This process is repeated multiple times, each time using a different fold as the validation set. When you train your machine using scikit-lear(example) you can tune cross-validation.
