Can I use NSFetchedResultsController for the display of data not meant for a UITableView?

In the FRC documentation, it says that it is intended to efficiently manage the results returned from a Core Data fetch request to provide data for a UITableView object. I am trying to setup my Core Data stack to handle the storage and retrieval of some VERY basic data. Can I not use FRC? I need to display a value set in the db to a UILabel, what is the best Core Data method to use for that? I have a core data book I am trying to get through, but the going is rough, so any help here would go a long way. Thanks!!
