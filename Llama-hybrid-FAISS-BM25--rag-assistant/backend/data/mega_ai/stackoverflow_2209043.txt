When you run ssh-agent -s, it launches a background process that you'll need to kill later. So, the minimum is to change your hack to something like: eval `ssh-agent -s` svn stuff kill $SSH_AGENT_PID However, I don't understand how this hack is working. Simply running an agent without also running ssh-add will not load any keys. Perhaps MacOS' ssh-agent is behaving differently than its manual page says it does.
