Intraclass distance is the distance between two points that are in the same class. In your example, an intra -class distance is the distance between measurements $X_i$ and $X_j$ where $(i,j \in 1 \cdots N)$ , and $X_i$ and $X_j$ are members of class C. One usually takes an average over the distances from all possible $(i,j)$ pairs within class C, and use it as the objective function. You can also use the distance between $X_i$ and $\bar{X}_C$ (the average coordinate of all measurements in class C), and take the average of this over all measurements in class C. In contrast, an inter -class distance is the distance between measurements $X_i$ and $X_j$ , where $X_i$ and $X_j$ are members of different classes.
