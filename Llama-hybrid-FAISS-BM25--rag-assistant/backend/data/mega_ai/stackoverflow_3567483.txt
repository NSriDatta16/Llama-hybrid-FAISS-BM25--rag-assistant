Javascript " " in Drupal

I'm trying to integrate a javascript library for drag&drop on tables into one page of my custom Drupal module. I've included the js file using drupal_add_js , but I don't know how to initialize it. The documentation for that library states that an init function should be called like How would I do that in Drupal? Or has Drupal some better way of initializing the script?
