I would leverage WebKit's support for MathML , or at least use a javascript library like jsMath . In general typesetting math notation in a non-webview is going to be annoying and take development time away from things that are actually relevant to the specifics of your app. (It may also be useful to look at MathJax , which looks more modern and shiny than jsMath)
