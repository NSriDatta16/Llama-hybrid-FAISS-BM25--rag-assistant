The first thing I'd check is that Magento is set to capture shipping information (I seem to remember some configuration option to turn it off), and that the items you've added to the cart are normal items (not downloadable/virtual items, which shouldn't capture shipping information). Based on your edit, it's looking for a form field which doesn't exist (seems to be the checkbox that lets a user choose whether to enter a separate billing address). Can you confirm that this form input exists and is sent w/ the form?
