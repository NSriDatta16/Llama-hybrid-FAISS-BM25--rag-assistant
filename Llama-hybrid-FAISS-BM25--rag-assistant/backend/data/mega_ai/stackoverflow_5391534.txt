If your data is arriving in discrete chunks, I would use Reactive Extensions . This allows the input to control what happens next (reacting to data) instead of using "pull" operations. You can then react to this data by passing it through filters, and then react to that data by displaying it or performing additional calculations. If you only need notch, high, and low filters, these are trivial to write. As each chunk of data arrives, you can decide whether or not to pass it to the next step (or whether or not to modify the data first). I would imagine you could write this whole section of code in less than 20 lines (maybe less than 10) using Rx. It would result in some pretty elegant code for this use case.
