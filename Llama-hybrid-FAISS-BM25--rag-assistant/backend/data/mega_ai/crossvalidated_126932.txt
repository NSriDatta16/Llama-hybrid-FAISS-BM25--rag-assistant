Logistic regression for paired comparisons

I am not a statistician; I'm an engineer, so much of this is a foreign language to me, though it seems like it wouldn't be that hard to understand if explained in a different way. I am trying to learn how to combine lots of paired comparisons of items into a unified ranking of the items. I can understand things like Elo and Glicko , but the Bradley-Terry model is supposed to be the more accurate, more general method that they are based on, so I am trying to learn that. I've been reading many different references and I just get lost trying to get an intuitive understanding of it. If it's possible to Explain Like I'm 5 the Bradley-Terry model in a single answer (preferably using more plots and graphs than equations), please do that. If that's too much for a single answer then I will ask a more specific question: This modeling is based around " logistic regression ". To me, that sounds like finding the best fit for a logistic function to some data points? Is that correct? If so, what are the data points in this context, and what do we do with the fit information after we have it?
