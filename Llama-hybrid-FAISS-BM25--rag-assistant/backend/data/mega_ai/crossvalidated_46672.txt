To completely define a first-order Markov chain you have to know the transition probability $p(x_j|x_i)$ for $1 \leq i, j \leq K$. Your calculation ignores the possibility of transitioning from state 1 to state 3, for example. Now, there are $K^2$ possible transitions from $x_i$ to $x_j$ with $1 \leq i, j \leq K$. But since $\sum_j p(x_j|x_i) = 1$ for each $i$, we only need to know $K-1$ of the transition probabilities for each $x_i$, and the last can be deduced from those. So there are in fact only $K(K-1)$ parameters.
