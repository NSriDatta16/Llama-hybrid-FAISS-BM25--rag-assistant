We just recently implemented #3, the client-side caching using Isolated Storage. In our app we have lot of drop downs and custom fields which the app used to get from the server every time it loads. Moving these data to IS really helped. The app now makes a call to check if there were any changes on the server, and if not - loads the data from the IS, otherwise ( which is pretty rare ) refreshes IS. That eliminated a lot of WCF calls and data transfers, the SL pages' loading time is shorter, and the app in general became more scalable because of the reduced network traffic and db access. Yes, there are some coding involved, but the benefits for the end users are essential. Andrew
