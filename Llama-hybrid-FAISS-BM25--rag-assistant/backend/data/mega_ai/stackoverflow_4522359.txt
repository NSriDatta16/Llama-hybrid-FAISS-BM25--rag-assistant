Check that the base SDK is set to Latest iOS (currently set to iOS 4.2) for your Xcode project and your target's product, then perform a rebuild and see if your iPod is recognized. Also try visiting the Xcode Organizer and see if it's asking for anything from your iPod. Typically Xcode will want to collect some data from devices whose OS receive updates, so it can update itself and install your apps on the updated OS properly.
