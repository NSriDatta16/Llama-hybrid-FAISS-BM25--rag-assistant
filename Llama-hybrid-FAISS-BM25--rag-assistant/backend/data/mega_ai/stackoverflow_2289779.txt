strictly speaking, this solution does not loet you define an array starting at an index different from 0, but you may declare your memory this way: typedef union { unsigned char all[15000]; struct { unsigned char sram[10000]; unsigned char bram[5000]; }; } memory; this does convey the intent that the memory is contiguous, and that it is split in 2 parts. note that you should beware of the alignment of bram and sram , a #pragma pack(1) may be necessary.
