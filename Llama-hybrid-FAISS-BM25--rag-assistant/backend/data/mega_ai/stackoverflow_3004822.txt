elastic / snaking line algorithm

I am making a graphics application in which I can edit a polyline by dragging the control point of it. However, I'd like to make it a bit easier to use by making it elastic; When dragging a control point, instead of moving a single point, I'd like the points within a certain distance of that point to be moved as well, depending on how hard the control point is 'pulled'. Does anyone know a simple algorithm for this? It may be quite rudimentary, as the primary requirement is speed. Actually, knowing how to call such behaviour would also be nice, so I can look it up on google. I tried 'snaking' line, but that seems to refer to active contours, which isn't what I'm looking for. Thanks
