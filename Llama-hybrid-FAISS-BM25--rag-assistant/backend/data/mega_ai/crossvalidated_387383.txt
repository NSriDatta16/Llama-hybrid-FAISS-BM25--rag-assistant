There are a lot of terminology differences between different areas of statistics. Sometimes the used terminology might also depend on context. When it comes to machine learning some good examples are given in the introduction section of the book All of Statistics by Larry A. Wasserman: Statistics | Machine Learning --------------------------------- estimation | learning covariates | features classification | supervised learning clustering | unsupervised learning classifier | hypothesis ... So what various subfields of statistics refer to as independant variables / regressors / covariates / predictors , etc - the $X$ , machine learning calls features . And what is referred to by dependant variable / regressant / response / predicted variable / etc. - the $Y$ , in machine learning is often named labels
