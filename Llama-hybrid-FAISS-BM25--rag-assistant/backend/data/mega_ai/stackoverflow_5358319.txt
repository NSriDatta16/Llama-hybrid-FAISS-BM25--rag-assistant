Possible to invoke system's USB mode activity from within an application?

Normally a user would have to go to the notification bar -> click "Select to copy files to/from your computer" and then be presented with the activity offering mount/unmount/etc. options. Can anyone share their experience trying to open this from an application? It appears one guy found a way to open this from within an application here , but only for an HTC phone. Any idea how I could find out what that activity might be for other devices as well? EDIT: See Comments below; it appears it may be device independent, and the full name of the class is com.android.server.status.UsbStorageActivity
