Comparing two independent proportions

Led Zeppelin's first album consisted of nine songs. The length of these songs averaged 299 seconds, with a standard deviation of 132 seconds. Their last album consisted of eight songs; they averaged 247 seconds in length, with a standard deviation of 59 seconds. Does this prove that the average lengths of songs written by the band were different at the end of their career than they had been at the beginning? State and test appropriate hypotheses.
