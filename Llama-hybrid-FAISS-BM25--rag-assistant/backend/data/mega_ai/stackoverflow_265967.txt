How to get a DIB implemented in a C++/COM library into a .NET client using that COM object

We have a COM object implemented with C++/ATL that includes a method which will return a DIB. We are also writing a .NET application that will use this COM object. Since we are writing both, we have the liberty of deciding how best to return this DIB from the COM object. To clarify, would it be best to return a native windows handle to a DIB or a byte array or is there some other way to easily transition a windows DIB into a .NET Image object? And, related to that question: once I have this returned DIB how can I get it into a .NET Image object?
