There are several ways you could approach this. Ultimately it would depend on what your data represents as to which method is best suited. Some options include: sequence mining: n-gram frequency. You could apply a tf-idf tokeniser to your data to generate matrices for different size $n1,n2,...nx$ grams. This would yield the prevalence of set combinations in your data including [1,6] and [1,6,4]. set similarity. The above ngram approach assumes that the patterns are sets. Where [1,6,4] and [1,6,5,4] are distinct. You could then apply some similarity score to find similar sets such as jaccard within and across each animal. Then compare each animal based on some measure of the number and similarity of sets identified. correlation and time series: This wouldnâ€™t find the unique patterns and sequences per se, but would yield information for sequence similarity. sliding window. You could pass different size sliding windows over the series to compute rolling means and sums. Then apply correlation, covariance, and time series analysis to determine the similarity of each animal as a series. Again it depends what your numeric data values represent as to wether this is applicable.
