To piggy-back on Jeremy Miles's answer (his description is good, you should choose it as the correct answer--mine is just supplemental)... If you aren't familiar with longitudinal SEM (of which this test-retest reliability model is a very simple case), I'd encourage you to check out Little's (2013) book on the topic--very helpful for understanding the important basics of SEM, and how things change when moving to modelling longitudinal processes--as Jeremy's answer attests to, keeping track of how to model "unique" ("error", or "residual") variances becomes very important. Anyways, if you don't have much experience with SEM (longitudinal or otherwise), here is some example code of how you would fit the model that Jeremy has described, using the lavaan package for R . In this example, we're pretending that you are looking at test-retest reliability of one latent variable over two time-points, with 3 indicators of the latent variable: #Simulate data of latent variable with 3 indicators (X1-X3) that are measured at two time points (.1 and .2) set.seed(1234) X1.1 = rnorm(100) X2.1 = 0.7*X + rnorm(100) X3.1 = 0.7*X + rnorm(100) X1.2 = 0.7*X + rnorm(100) X2.2 = 0.7*X4 + rnorm(100) X3.2 = 0.7*X4 + rnorm(100) Data Which would give you the following output... lavaan (0.5-18) converged normally after 30 iterations Number of observations 100 Estimator ML Minimum Function Test Statistic 6.226 Degrees of freedom 5 P-value (Chi-square) 0.285 Parameter estimates: Information Expected Standard Errors Standard Estimate Std.err Z-value P(>|z|) Latent variables: LV1 =~ X1.1 0.111 0.138 0.803 0.422 X2.1 0.753 0.170 4.425 0.000 X3.1 0.553 0.141 3.933 0.000 LV2 =~ X1.2 1.522 0.260 5.860 0.000 X2.2 0.451 0.137 3.292 0.001 X3.2 0.532 0.143 3.725 0.000 Covariances: LV1 ~~ LV2 0.468 0.139 3.376 0.001 X1.1 ~~ X1.2 0.001 0.087 0.009 0.993 X2.1 ~~ X2.2 -0.007 0.135 -0.050 0.960 X3.1 ~~ X3.2 -0.151 0.115 -1.313 0.189 Variances: X1.1 0.986 0.141 X2.1 0.863 0.233 X3.1 0.926 0.169 X1.2 -0.895 0.786 X2.2 1.405 0.206 X3.2 1.206 0.192 LV1 1.000 LV2 1.000 Within all of that output, your test-retest reliability in this example would be captured by the covariance between LV1 ~~ LV2 ( r = .47, p = .01). The covariances between each indicator at both time points (e.g., X1.1 ~~ X1.2), alternatively, ensure that the dependency between related observed variables is adequately captured.
