Not the whole list technically, but you could use a bit mask to decide if a number has already been selected. This has a lot less storage than the number list itself. Set all N bits to 0, then for each desired number: use one of the normal linear congruent methods to select a number from 1 to N. if that number has already been used, find the next highest unused (0 bit), with wrap. set that numbers bit to 1 and return it. That way you're guaranteed only one use per number and relatively random results.
