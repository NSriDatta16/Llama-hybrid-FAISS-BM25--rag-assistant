Is there a name for this form of sampling?

I had an idea to combine oversampling and undersampling in the following way: Compute the average number of individuals in each class. For classes with a number of individuals greater than this average, undersample the class so that the number of individuals in this class equals the average. For classes with a number of individuals lower than this average, oversample the class so that the number of individuals in this class equals the average. Overall, all classes then have a number of individuals equal to the original average. However, I cannot see any literature on this idea. Does this idea exist and does it have a name so that I may read about it?
