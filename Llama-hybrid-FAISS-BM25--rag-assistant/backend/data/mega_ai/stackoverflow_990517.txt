At the end: Calculate the "average" value for the array. Initialize a counter with zero, and for each of the array's entries: add the entry's difference to "average" to the counter. With some modifications you can get Shannon's entropy: rename "average" to "entropy" (float) entropy = 0 for i in the array[256]:Counts do (float)p = Counts[i] / filesize if (p > 0) entropy = entropy - p*lg(p) // lgN is the logarithm with base 2 Edit: As Wesley mentioned, we must divide entropy by 8 in order to adjust it in the range 0 . . 1 (or alternatively, we can use the logarithmic base 256).
