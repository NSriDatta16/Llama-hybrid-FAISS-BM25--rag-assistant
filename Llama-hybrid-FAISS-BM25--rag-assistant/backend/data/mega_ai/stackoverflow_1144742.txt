When it comes to C++ and elegance, I tend to follow two rules: Say what you mean. Profile first, optimize later. You're talking about concatenating strings here, so this is the code that comes to mind: std::string s = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4; foo(s.c_str()); To "say what you mean," I reach for operator + . Using std::stringstream (a stream of strings) is pretty good too, but I don't immediately go for another #include just to concatenate strings. It's a matter of personal preference I guess. I definitely don't think of building up a raw char array by hand. In terms of performance, my guess is that operator + is probably the slowest method of putting the strings together. But even a slow method might be fast enough for your purposes.
