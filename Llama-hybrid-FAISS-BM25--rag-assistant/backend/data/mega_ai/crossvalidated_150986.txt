This is standard imputation in Natural Language Processing (see for instance http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/courses/nlp2011/notes/pcfgs.pdf ). Though, I don't think you should expect to get what you expect every time. What you expect will depend on what you train the system with. I am sure you are aware that the order of likelihood is highly subject to the training data you use
