As there already seems to be an adequate array of explanations of Regression Analysis vs Curve Fitting, I’ll leave that alone. However, there is an additional question buried in the OP’s original question. There’s very little ‘given data’, but he asked if someone could suggest a correlation formula, so I’ll add my 2 cents. I don’t have any experience with ROC Curves etc..., however, plotting the data gives a strong indication that it’s a First-Order System $\frac{1}{\tau\centerdot s+1}$ (in Laplace terminology) responding to a Step-Input $\frac{1}{s}$ (in Laplace terminology). Obviously, the time constant is very small, yielding an extremely fast steady-state. I’ll assume that the dependent variable is ‘y’, and the independent variable is ‘t’. A general equation for a 1st order process is $y=A[1 – B \centerdot e^ {-\frac {t}{\tau}}]$ , where $\tau$ is the process time constant (where 1 $\centerdot\tau$ generates approx 63.2% of the response). Using your data, $@t=\infty, y=1$ , therefore, $A=1$ . The general model now becomes $y=1 – B \centerdot e^ {-\frac {t}{\tau}}$ . In addition, $@t=0, y=0$ , therefore $B=1$ . The model is now $y=1 – e^ {-\frac {t}{\tau}}$ . Regressing (or curve fitting) your data to this equation yields $y=1 – e^ {-\frac {t}{0.0023}}$ . Explicitly, this says that in $\approx 0.0023\space sec$ , 63.2% of the response has completed. I have the benefit of not knowing your specific noise or data variance, so I took the liberty to curve fit a 2-parameter model to see if it tightens the error. That yielded the model $y=1 – 0.99972 \centerdot e^ {-\frac {t}{0.0023}}$ . I’d recommend taking more data on the early portion of the response, and ignore sampling after the response lines out, as there’s nothing interesting to model at steady-state. In addition, the $exp()$ argument is getting extremely high the further you go out into steady-state.
