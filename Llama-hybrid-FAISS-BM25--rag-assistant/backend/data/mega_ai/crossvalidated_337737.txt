What you are looking for is a way to characterize dose-response surfaces formed by a series of single-time dose-responses. Sun et al ( Risk Analysis 15 : 247, 1995) illustrate an approach using maximum-likelihood estimation based on assumptions about "shape factors" for dose-responses and time-responses. In that approach you could compare the parameter values found to characterize the responses of each of the cell lines, but you might be limited by restrictions and assumptions on the forms of the shape factors. A more recent and more general approach that even allows for evaluation of multiple outcomes is given by Patel et al (Ann Appl Stat. 6 : 1707, 2012). They use splines to model the dose- and time-responses and a Bayesian approach with appropriate choices of priors and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to ultimately evaluate dose- and duration-response slopes, maximal safe doses/times, and maximum responses. The approach was apparently developed for high-throughput biologic testing of nanomaterials on a single cell type, but I see no reason why it can't also (a) be used for standard drug testing and (b) be used to compare responses of different cell types to the same drug rather than compare different drugs on the same cell type. Visualization of responses by color over 2-dimensional plots of time by dose seem to more than make up for not having easily interpretable functional forms of the response surfaces. I'm not sure that I can legally copy the image here, but the paper is freely available from the link above; look at Figure 6 for an example of what can be done. Strictly, this site doesn't deal with implementations in software. Patel et al did use R for at least some of their work, but I'm not aware of a particular package that implements their entire approach. The rsm package in R might give you something close to what you need. It fits response surfaces (not just dose-time response surfaces) but is limited to combinations of first-order, two-way, pure quadratic, and second-order functions to fit the responses in a generalization of linear modeling, so it might not be sufficiently flexible for your purpose.
