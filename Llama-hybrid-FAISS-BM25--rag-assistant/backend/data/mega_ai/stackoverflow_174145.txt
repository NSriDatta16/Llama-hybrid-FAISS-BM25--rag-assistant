While at the end of the day, you may not care, the more abstraction the harder the maintenance (especially for other people). If in six months you have to start digging through this code to find or fix a bug, or even add a new feature, it will take you that much longer to remember what you did and why. If someone else is doing it, multiply that time. Elegant code is always nice when you're writing new code, but I always like to weigh that with the needs of maintainers down the road.
