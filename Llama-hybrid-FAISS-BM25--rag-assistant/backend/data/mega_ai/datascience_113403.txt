How much percentage of outliers are allowed in a data

I am buliding a machine learning model with logistic regression. I am dealing with blood transfusion data set. In which there is a feature,Total_volume, I found that there is more than 5% of outliers present.Should I handle this? Or I keep this data as it is? Bacauase more than 5% data may contain some patterns.
