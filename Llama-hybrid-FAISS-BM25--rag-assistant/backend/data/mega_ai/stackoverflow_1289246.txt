Your clients will always be asking for your feed data so you cannot necessarily control when they ask. I dont think most feed readers obey HTTP Cache Control / Expires headers so you cannot rely on using the HTTP spec and leverage HTTP caching. I think your best bet is to just cache your last response and send all subsequent requests from the cache - updating the cache appropriately when changes are made. Effectively this means that your cost to respond to each client and its stale data is pretty much close to 0, if you just pull it from memcache or the filesystem.
