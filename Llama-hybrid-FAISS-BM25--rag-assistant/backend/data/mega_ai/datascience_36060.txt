Is there a general guideline for experience replay size, and how to store?

I am trying to use deep Q-learning on color images of size (224 x 224 x 3). I have read that implementations of DQN use experience replay sizes around 50,000. If my calculation is correct, this is over 56 Gigabytes for my data (two images per tuple, one image for state and next_state, totaling 100,000 images). Is this correct? If yes, how can I go about this without that much RAM?
