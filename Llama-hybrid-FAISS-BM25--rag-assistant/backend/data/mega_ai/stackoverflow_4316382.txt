Gratuitous verbosity considered harmful. I would never write unsigned int or long int or signed anything (except char or bitfields) because it increases clutter and decreases the amount of meaningful code you can fit in 80 columns. (Or more likely, encourages people to write code that does not fit in 80 columns...)
