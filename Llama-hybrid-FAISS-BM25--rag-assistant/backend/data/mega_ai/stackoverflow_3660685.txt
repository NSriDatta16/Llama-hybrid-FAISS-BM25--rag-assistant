Application Client Agent Design

I need to create a small app which will run on my client machines as "agent" which will periodically check in with a server for certain tasks. Do I Create the app as a windows service with an interface for configurations? Create an app which will run in system tray, with an interface for configuration? Many moons ago I read that windows service app should not have any configuration interface. I would assume that even if I do create a windows service, there will have to be a second app which interacts with the service as the interface for configuration, correct?
