You may want to check out the book Leveraging Drupal: Getting Your Site Done Right , which doesn't mention scrum specifically, but does include an entire chapter on agile approaches to building Drupal sites. There's a DrupalCamp Stockholm presentation video on Using Scrum to Manage Drupal Projects . Or there's the Intro to Agile and Scrum session from DrupalCamp Dallas. Not specifically scrum, but other agile presentations include the video from the recent DrupalCon Chicago session on Lessons Learned from the Agile Process Applied . Or check out the Agile is Not 'Cowboy' Spelled Backwards presentation from Drupalcamp Colorado.
