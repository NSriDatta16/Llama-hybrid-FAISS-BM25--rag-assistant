Assuming that you're attempting to execute the package with a dtexec command, the issue is that the package is executed on the calling server, not the server where it is stored. Since the 2005 SSIS service can't execute 2008 packages, the step fails. You need to trigger the dtexec on the server where you want the job to run. The easiest way to do this is probably to set up a SQL Agent job on the 2008 server which starts the package, and trigger that from the 2005 server (using sp_startjob or some more complex trigger mechanism).
