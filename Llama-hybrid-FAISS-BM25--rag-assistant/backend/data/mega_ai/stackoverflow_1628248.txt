Get font name from FontFamily in WPF

I'm currently working on a little font organization/preview application for myself, however, I'm having a hard time getting the exact information I need. I've found that I can load an external font by just creating a new FontFamily object with the font's file location as its source. However, I can't find a way to get a font's specific font name back. I know I can use FontFamily.FamilyNames to get the font's family name back, but that's useless to me when I have multiple fonts with the same family being displayed. I'd like to actually display the specific name for the specific font. Is there any way to do this? I currently display the file name instead, but it's incredibly sloppy because I have to iterate through every file in a directory and call Fonts.GetFontFamilies() on each just so I can get the actual file name(FontFamily's Source property only gives WPF's makeshift family-name source instead of something useful).
