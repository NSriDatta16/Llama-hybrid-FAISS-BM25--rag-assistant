Eucalyptus http://eucalyptus.cs.ucsb.edu/ EUCALYPTUS - Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs To Useful Systems - is an open-source software infrastructure for implementing "cloud computing" on clusters. The current interface to EUCALYPTUS is compatible with Amazon's EC2 interface, but the infrastructure is designed to support multiple client-side interfaces. Note that, according to the documentation, Eucalypus includes a reimplementation not only of the EC2 interface but also the S3 storage system. That storage component is called Walrus.
