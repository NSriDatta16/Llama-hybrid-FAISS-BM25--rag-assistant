Since you know what the answer is and you are are calculating highest posterior density (HPD) intervals I would say that choosing the method that returns the narrowest interval would be a starting point in selecting the better method, especially since HPD intervals do not have to be symmetric. Of of course you could look at a criteria like BIC, since you are doing this from a Bayesian perspective, but since you are talking about $\theta_i|m_i$ when not try using Bayes factors to compare models? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor The way you problem is set up I think it would lend itself greatly to Bayes factors. Lastly, I think seeing how well calibrated your model is (i.e., finding the proportion of times the $Î¸^i$ falls in the intervals) is also a very good idea. So, bottom line if you have the time I think all of those aforementioned criteria are worth looking into. Also, have you considered trying some sensitivity analysis for your prior choice?
