Case 1: When clicked on the log off button clear the Session. Clicking the back button in the browser might result in fetching the page from the cache. So by cheking Session in the page might not be effective. You can disable caching for the page so that when back button is clicked a new request to the page will be generated. For pages not to be cached set this Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Case 2: You can set the default timeout for Session as 10 minutes. See HttpSessionState.Timeout Property Case 3: Check Session for null and if found to be null then redirect to a login page.
