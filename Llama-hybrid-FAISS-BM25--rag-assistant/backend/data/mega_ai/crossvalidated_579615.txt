One experimental design problem is that you don't have much overlap in the observation times between the two groups. Another problem (maybe less important if you have a lot of specimens), is that each specimen either did or did not have the "extender liquid" added. It seems that it should have been possible to treat half of each specimen with the "extender liquid" for a more direct test of the treatment. I recommend comparing the two groups at some shared evaluation time between 6 and 8 hours. One could consider a joint model of survival over time that incorporates the treatment as a predictor variable, but the treated group provides no information before 6 hours and the untreated group provides no information after 8 hours. Of course, if the untreated group has exactly 0 survival beyond 8 hours you pretty much have shown the superiority of the "extender liquid" anyway. An alive/dead outcome ideally should be evaluated by a binomial model based on the observed counts. You have much more confidence in a value of 90% survival, for example, if you have 100 observations instead of 10 observations; the analysis should take that into account. For a single time point (e.g., 7 hours) that would just be a standard binomial test. If you want to model over time, a logistic regression would be appropriate. For modeling over time, if you made multiple motility measurements on the same specimen you would need to take that within-specimen correlation of outcomes into account, e.g. with a mixed model treating specimens as random effects.
