Structuring longitudinal clinical input for LSTM RNN

Totally new to LSTMs and would like some guidance on how to structure input data for classification using multivariate longitudinal data. Most, if not all, tutorials online are non-healthcare related and I could not find a good analogy as an example to work from. The problem: predicting that a hospitalization event will occur in the next 30-90 days (where days 0-29 is a lag period for intervention). The data: Each observation is one patient, and each patient has several lab outcomes with many sequential values. Each patient also has non-sequential data, like gender and race. Questions: 1. How do I specify the individual values of one lab outcome's sequence from another's? 2. How do I input non-sequential variables along with sequential? 3. How should LSTM parameters/architecture be adjusted to accommodate? My thinking so far is that the data should be structured using an array, where each row is the sequence of a lab outcome, and non-sequential attributes exist as sequences with the same value in each column. I assume that the LSTM inherently knows that each row is another variable. Here are two papers that are helpful for context: 1. Learning to diagnose with LSTM RNNs https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03677v7 2. Multi task prediction of disease onset from longitudinal lab tests https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00647v3 I am using python: keras with tensorflow.
