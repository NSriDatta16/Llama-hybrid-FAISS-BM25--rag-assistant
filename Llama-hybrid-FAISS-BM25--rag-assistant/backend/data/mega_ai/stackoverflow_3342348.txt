I agree with what's been said so far. Though I guess getting started with MySQL (databases) in general is not a bad idea for the long if you are going to deal with data. I mean I checked your profile which says finance PhD student. I don't know if that means quant. finance, but it is likely that you will come across really large datasets in your career. I you can afford some time, I would recommend to learn something about databases. It just helps. The documentation of MySQL itself is pretty solid and you can a lot of additional (specific) help here at SO. I run MySQL with MySQL workbench on Mac OS X Snow Leopard too. So here´s what helped me to get it done comparatively easy. I installed MAMP , which gives my an local Apache webserver with PHP, MySQL and the MySQL tool PHPmyadmin, which can be used as a nice webbased alternative for MySQL workbench (which is not always super stable on a Mac :) . You will have a little widget to start and stop servers and can access some basic configuration settings (such as ports through your browser) . It´s really one-click install here. Install the Rpackage RMySQL . I will put my connection string here, maybe that helps: Create your databases with MySQL workbench. INT and VARCHAR (for categorical variables that contain characters) should be the field types you basically need at the beginning. Try to find the import routine that works best for you. I don't know if you are a shell / terminal guy – if so you'll like what was suggested by neilfws. You could also use LOAD DATA INFILE which is I prefer since it's only one query as opposed to INSERT INTO (line by line) If you specify the problems that you have more accurately, you'll get some more specific help – so feel free to ask ;) I assume you have to work a lot with time series data – there is a project (TSMySQL) around that use R and relational databases (such as MySQL, but also available for other DBMS) to store time series data. Besides you can even connect R to FAME (which is popular among financers, but expensive). The last paragraph is certainly nothing basic, but I thought it might help you to consider if it´s worth the hustle to dive into it a little deeper.
