HTML Editor not working in publishing pages - SharePoint

I am developing a SharePoint publishing portal wherein I make use of HTML Editor(third party control) in my page layout for editing the contents. When I try to edit the page using the publishing console, the HTML Editor which I have added in my page doesn't appear at all. I monitored the design at run time using firebug and it showed no content. Where could I be wrong? Regards, Raghuraman.V
