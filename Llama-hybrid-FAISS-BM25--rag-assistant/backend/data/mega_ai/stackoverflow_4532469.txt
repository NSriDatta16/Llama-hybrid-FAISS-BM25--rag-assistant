I don't know if it's documented anywhere, but I've found empirically that any gesture states other than UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan , UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged , and UIGestureRecognizerStateRecognized will have garbage touch and location information. In many cases, the code would even crash trying to access a non-existent touch. So, changing the condition as follows should fix the issue you're having: - (void)pan:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)gesture { if (gesture.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged) { CGPoint location = [gesture locationInView:[self superview]]; [self setCenter:location]; } }
