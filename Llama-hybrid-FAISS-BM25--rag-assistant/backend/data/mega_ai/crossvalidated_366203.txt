Understanding Q-learning for continuous actions

I am reading the paper on Normalized Advantage Functions for continuous Q-learning and I am having trouble understanding why the advantage function takes this particular form: Why is the Advantage function, ($A$) quadratic in actions ($u$)? What are the purposes of $P$ and $\mu $? I am completely lost at why the advantage function takes this form and how it is justified. Edit: so I can see that when $u=\mu$ , $A$ is maximized which is handy but why do we need $P$ - after all $\mu$ would still maximise $A$ without the $P$ right?
