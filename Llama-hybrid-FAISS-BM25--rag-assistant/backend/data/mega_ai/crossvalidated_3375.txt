[Caveat: I have not read the paper so the below may be nonsense for all I know ...] Based on the summary of the R package I would venture to guess that you could use the proposed methodology for the survey data provided the following conditions are met: You have survey data from control groups during pre-intervention periods. These control groups need not be identical to the treatment groups. The data you have is time series data. Provided points 1 and 2 are met my best intuition as to how the method works is as follows: First, construct a 'hypothetical' (synthetic in their words) control group that behaves as identical as possible as the treatment group. The hypothetical group is constructed by taking a convex combination of the control group data you have. As an example, suppose that you want to measure student performance on math. Your control groups could be different sections whereas the treatment group is one specific section. You construct the hypothetical control group such that the weighted (with the weights summing to 1 and hence convex) average of the scores of the control group sections is as close as possible to the scores of the treatment group before the intervention (i.e., use MSPE which is Mean Squared Prediction Error). Second, extrapolate the hypothetical group's scores into the post-intervention period using the parameter estimates from step 1. Since, the hypothetical group has been constructed to be identical to the treatment group pre-intervention, the post-intervention scores of the hypothetical group provides an appropriate counter-factual evidence to the treatment group's post-intervention scores to assess the effectiveness of the intervention.
