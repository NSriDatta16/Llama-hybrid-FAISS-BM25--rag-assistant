Aggregating standard deviation to a summary point

I have a range of data (server performance statistics) is formatted as follows, for each server: Time | Average | Min | Max | StdDev | SampleCount | ------------------------------------------------------------------- Monday 1st | 125 | 15 | 220 | 12.56 | 5 | Tuesday 2nd | 118 | 11 | 221 | 13.21 | 4 | Wednesday 3rd | 118 | 11 | 221 | 13.21 | 3 | .... | ... | .. | ... | ..... | . | and so on... These data points are calculated from data that has a finer resolution (e.g. hourly data). I need to aggregate this data into a single summary point so the end result is a list of servers and an aggregate average, min, max, standard deviation. For average, I take the average of all the averages. For min, we take the minimum min. For max, we take the maximum max. However, I'm not sure what method I should be using to aggregate standard deviation? I've seen various answers including square roots and variance but I really need a concrete answer on this - can anyone help?
