Organising Imports in NetBeans

Netbeans is able to organise imports in a similar fashion to eclipse, but: it seems unable to remove unused imports for classes that can't be resolved (and are no longer used) I can only organise one class at a time - eclipse allows import organisation on packages and projects etc. Is there some way that I can fix these problems?
