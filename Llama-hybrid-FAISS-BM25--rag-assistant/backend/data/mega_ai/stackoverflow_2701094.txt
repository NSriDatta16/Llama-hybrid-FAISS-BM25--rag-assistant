Java EE 6: JSF vs Servlet + JSP. Should I bother learning JSF?

I am trying to get familiar with Java EE 6 by reading http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/tutorial/doc/gexaf.html . I am a bit confused about the use of JSF. Usually, the way I develop my Web App would be, Servlet would act like a controller and JSP would act like a View in an MVC model. So Does JSF try to replace this structure? Below are the quote from the above tutorial: Servlet are best suited for service-oriented App and control function of presentation-oriented App like dispatching request JSF and Facelet are more appropriated for generating mark-up like XHTML, and generally used for presentation-oriented App Not sure if I understand the above quote too well, they did not explain too well what is service-oriented vs presentation-oriented. A JavaServer Faces application can map HTTP requests to component-specific event handling and manage components as stateful objects on the server. Any knowledgeable Java developer out there can give me a quick overview about JSF, JSP and Servlet? Do I integrate them all, or do I use them separated base on the App? if so then what kind of app use JSF in contrast with Servlet and JSP A JavaServer Faces application can map HTTP requests to component-specific event handling and manage components as stateful objects on the server. Sound like what servlet can do, but not sure about manage components as stateful objects on the server . Not even sure what that mean? Thanks in advance.
