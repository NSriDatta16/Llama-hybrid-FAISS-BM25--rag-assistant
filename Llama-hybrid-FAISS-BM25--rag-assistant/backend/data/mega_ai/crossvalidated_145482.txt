I would suggest you the following high-level data analysis strategy/workflow : Start with performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) . This will provide you with a sense of your data set as well as reveal the data set's features, which might be helpful in further steps (assumptions, etc.). Perform regression analysis . Your statement about inability of using logistic regression is incorrect, but this due to confusion that the term logistic regression often is used to refer to a model with a binary DV . Indeed, logistic regression is applicable in your case and is referred to as multinomial logistic regression , since your DV is of unordered categorical type . Should your DV be ordered, then that would be a case of an ordered logistic regression . The analysis IMHO should include evaluating the model's goodness-of-fit (GoF) and other relevant metrics (see above-referenced articles as a starting point, including for information on tests, etc.). Interpret the results of your analysis , based on your research goals and questions.
