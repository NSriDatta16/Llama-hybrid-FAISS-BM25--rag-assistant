Since all those factors are not measured, you have no idea about: 1) The magnitude of their effect on the yield; 2) The direction of that effect. For instance, for a given plot you can say that the yield is expected to be higher than average because the level of fertilizer is higher than average, but you have no idea whether the amount of rainfall has been higher or lower than the average precipitation. It can go either way. Therefore, your best guess is to say that, on average (across all the plots with varying level of rainfall), rainfall factor has zero effect. In technical terms, that statement corresponds to $E[u] = 0$.
