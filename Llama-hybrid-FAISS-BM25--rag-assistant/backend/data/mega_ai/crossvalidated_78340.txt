Modeling prior probability as a delta function

I'm using approximate Bayesian computation to find the true value of a parameter. My prior distribution is uniform over $(0, 1)$. I was watching this video on Bayesian learning and the lecturer states (around 36:00) that this is making a huge assumption. That is, we are assuming the value of the unknown variable has the same mean as the random variable (in my case $0.5$) and also has a variance that we can compute (I assume based off the number of observations?). He goes on to say that if you want to really model a prior like this, you should use a delta function centered around a value, $a$, which is unknown. My questions are these: What is wrong with assuming that the mean and variance are the same as the random variable? How can I use a delta function to generate probabilities for my prior?
