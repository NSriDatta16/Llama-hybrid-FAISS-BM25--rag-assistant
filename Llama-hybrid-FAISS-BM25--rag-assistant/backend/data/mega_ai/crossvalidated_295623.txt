Logistic Regression for 2x2xK data

I am very familiar with logistic regression. I have used logistic regression with data sets in which each set up independent variables has a binary (1 or 0) dependent variable. However, I have found much discussion of logistic regression as an alternative to a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test. The CMH test takes 2x2xK contingency tables and test whether or not the odds ratio between the K-levels is different from 1. Can logistic regression be run on 3-dimensional contingency tables, without attempting to split the counts within the contingency table into a normal data frame? Is there logic to do this in R? Below is an example of a 2x2xK subsection where K = 1. You can see why I would not want to have 15,511 rows that all have the same information (K = 1, Female, No Damages) and would rather keep in this clean format. Response for K = 1 Family Damages No Damages Male 10 245 Female 533 15511
