I had to solve the same problem when integrating language translation with an XMPP chat server. I partitioned my payload (the text I needed to translate) into smaller subsets of complete sentences. I canâ€™t recall the exact number, but with Google's REST -based translation URL, I translated a set of completed sentences that collectively had a total of less than (or equal to) 1024 characters, so a large paragraph would result in multiple translation service calls.
