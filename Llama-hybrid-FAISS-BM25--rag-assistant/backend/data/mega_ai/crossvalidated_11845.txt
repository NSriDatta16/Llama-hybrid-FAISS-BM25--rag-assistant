Probably there is a little chance for any code which would take advantage of that -- you would rather need to write something on your own. However, the other option is to transform your data to reduce the size of your data removing redundant information. It is hard to tell how without the information about your data, but maybe you can merge some features which you know does not overlap, PCA parts of it or change representation of some descriptors? Also, if you say your response is sparse as well, maybe it is reasonable to downsample objects with 0 in response?
