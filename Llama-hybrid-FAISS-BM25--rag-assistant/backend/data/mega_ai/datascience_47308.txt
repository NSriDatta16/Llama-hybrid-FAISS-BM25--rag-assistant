Weighted linkage probably does not mean you get to specify weights of features (build the distance matrix yourself!) Instead this most likely refers to the well-known weighted group average strategy you will find in most textbooks often called WPGMA. There are two different definitions of "average", so this is likely simply the "other" average linkage.
