Does it make sense to do PCA after robust PCA?

I was wondering whether it makes sense to do PCA after robust PCA. Suppose I have a matrix $X$ and if I do robust PCA I would get: $$X=A+E$$ And if I do PCA over $A$ would this make sense as a preprocessing step? The matrix $X$ is highly sparse (less than 10% is populated, with a size of 15K by 20K). An introduction to robust PCA , if more specific details are needed: I would like to use the inexact ALM method to do this. My objective is to reduce the dimensionality of $X$, but it contains some extreme outliers.
