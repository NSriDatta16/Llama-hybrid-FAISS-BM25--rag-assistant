Safari developer iphone mode is not working?

I started to learn how to design a website to work and look nice on iOs's Safari browser. I don't own iPhone/iPod, so I have to test is in PC Safari's developer mode I set to iPhone. The problem is it isn't work and I don't know if my HTML is bad, or the browser isn't that good developer tool as I thought it is. My html (its just a simple test): iPhone css test lorem ipsum And my two css's: iphone.css #test{ width: 480px; border: 1px solid #000000; } desktop.css #test{ width: 700px; margin: 0 auto; border: 1px solid #ff0000; } And no meter how I set Safari developer, it shows the 700px wide, centered, red bordered version of the div, not the 480px wide black. Did I miss something? A meta tag? Or other? SOLVED: If browser width 480px or less than 480px the iphone.css applies automatically. It doesn't even need to be set to iPhone user agent. Thanks Jack Lawrence!
