Am not really sure what this code means... $(this).find('p') $(".array").append(ui.draggable.children("span").text()) Try changing to this: $(this).find('p.array').append(ui.draggable.children("span").text()) EDIT: I think I see what you need now. Did not read so carefully earlier. What you need is to append the text from s in the draggable to to the paragraphs in the first code block after they are dropped in their corresponding divs in the second block, right? If so, you could add your own attribute to the draggables, say 'myattr'. If this is is your draggable: text to append and this is the code for your droppable drop: function(event, ui) { var myattrVal = ui.draggable.attr('myattr'); //Finds the p with the class goals from if the div above was the draggable $('p.' + myattrVal).append(ui.draggable.find('span').text() + ','); }
