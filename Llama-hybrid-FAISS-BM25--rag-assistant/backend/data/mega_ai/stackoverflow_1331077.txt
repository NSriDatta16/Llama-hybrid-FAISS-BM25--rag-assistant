Some thoughts: Set a durable cookie. (Since FF is in kiosk mode, you should be safe from the users clearing it.) Have that kiosk use a different URL (perhaps with a query string parameter). What I wouldn't do is work according to the machine's MAC address (which Gibson tells us is possible) or similar; too fragile when hardware gets fixed, etc.
