If you're anything like me, you will only learn so much from reading; it's important to have a project. Find something you want to actually build . Even if it's the ubiquitous blog application, it's something with a definitive set of requirements that are reasonably well known--at least to you. If you're an experienced enough as a developer, you should have a pretty decent idea of what you want to do and from there it's just a matter of determining the (Cake|Rails|Django|etc.) way of doing that particular thing. Take it one thing at a time and eventually everything will click. Pick a framework with an active (and helpful community). Leverage the documentation and that community extensively to help you get over the learning curve. There will be a learning curve and you will get discouraged from time to time. If you can power through, you'll be better for it. It's rather generic advice, I know, but it's a rather high level question. Hopefully it helps some.
