This seems to be the documented behavior. The default Maven wagon for HTTP (i.e., the "lightweight" client) does not seem to allow disabling these headers. Actually, you can configure the Lightweight HTTP Wagon client using the available setters, for example (Maven 2.0+): central true Or even override or provide additional HTTP headers (Maven 2.1+): central User-Agent Internal-Build-System/1.0 This is nicely covered by Brett Porter in Configuring Maven HTTP Connections . Why is Maven configured in this way by default? Wild guess: it's a safe default to avoid problems with badly configured proxies (not really sure this is true). What can I put in my settings.xml or pom.xml to disable these headers and allow our proxy to cache responses and return them? The above settings go in the settings.xml (of course, adapt the id if required, central is for the default repository used by Maven). If it doesn't work (it should), the alternative would be to switch back to HTTPClient Wagon and to configure it as documented in the Advanced Configuration of the HttpClient HTTP Wagon .
