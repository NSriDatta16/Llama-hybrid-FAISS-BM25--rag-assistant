i was also looking into using iTextSharp in a web application. However the following paragraph from http://itextpdf.com/terms-of-use/ clarified the licensing implications: Buying such a license is mandatory as soon as you develop commercial activities involving the iText software without disclosing the source code of your own applications. These activities include: offering paid services to customers as an ASP, serving PDFs on the fly in a web application, shipping iText with a closed source product. Regards.
