For msvc compiler you can add #pragma comment(lib, "MYLIBNAME.lib") in your header. This will automatically make the linker look for "MYLIBNAME.lib" in the "Additional Library Directories". If no longer an error occures Can't find header ... Can't find MYLIBNAME.lib the problem is probably related to some other stuff like wrong C runtime, debug release mismatch, ... P.S.: If the lib is in the solution tree just setting the dependency on the lib, will cause VS to add the targetpath to the libfolder and the libname to the libraries.
