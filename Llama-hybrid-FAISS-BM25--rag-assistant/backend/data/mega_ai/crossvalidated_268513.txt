Aggregation of data for forecasting

I have a univariate time series of quarterly data. I am interested in making both quarterly and yearly predictions using ARIMA/SARIMA. The quarterly prediction is just one step ahead while the yearly prediction is 1, 2 and 3 years ahead. My question is if I should aggregated the data to annual for the annual prediction? Or should I use the quarterly data and predict 4, 8 and 12 steps ahead and then aggregate?
