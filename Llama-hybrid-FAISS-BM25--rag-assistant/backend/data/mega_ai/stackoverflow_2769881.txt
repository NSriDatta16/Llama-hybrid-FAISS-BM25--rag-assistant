I assume that by "closing databases" you mean that they would free their cache memory? Because there really is no benefit to "closing" actual files on disk, their resource usage is negligible. Some database engines use the operating system's disk cache. MySQL's MyISAM storage engine is an example, but doesn't offer integrity guarantees, so that excludes many of its uses. MySQL's other engines like InnoDB do not offer this, however. PostgreSQL natively uses the operating system's cache as a second-level cache; while the first-level cache (shared_buffers) still consumes memory all the time, it's common to set it to only 10-25% of your memory even on performance-critical servers. The rest is free for OS-level caching, and will be allocated to the database when needed, and is available to other applications when they need it.
