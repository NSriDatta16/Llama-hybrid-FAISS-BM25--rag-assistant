An extensive discussion is already provided here in the answer by cbeleites, and under similar questions ( PCA and Correspondence analysis in their relation to Biplot ), so I'll just comment briefly on the specific video. As the narrator never mentions "scores" or "loadings" explicitly throughout the video, and the term "dimensions" in PCA is already ambiguous, technically there were no mistakes. However, I agree with you that his presentation is confusing: the first part states that the dimensionality along cells is to be reduced (200 cells -> 2 PCs), and the second part actually focuses on reducing dimensionality along genes (10,000 genes -> 2 PCs). I'd say there's many better and still accessible introductions to PCA, with consistent presentation and actual terminology E.g.: http://webspace.ship.edu/pgmarr/Geo441/Lectures/Lec%2017%20-%20Principal%20Component%20Analysis.pdf .
