One way to think of the proportional odds form of ordinal logistic regression is that you are studying a continuous latent variable which we might call Attitude to government policy on poverty. What you have observed though is not the latent variable itself but a coarsened form of it with three categories. The threshold coefficients account for where the cut-offs between the categories are and the coefficient for your covariate (age) tells you (when exponentiated) the odds ratio of being in the higher category versus the lower at every cut-off point. The model assumes this is the same for each cut-off hence the name proportional odds.
