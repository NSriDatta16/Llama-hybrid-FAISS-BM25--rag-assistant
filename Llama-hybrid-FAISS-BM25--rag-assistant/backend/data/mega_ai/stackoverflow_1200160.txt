DevExpress vs infragistics Suites - looking to possibly switch

We are currently an Infragistics NetAdvantage Select customer and have been for a few years. Their controls are ok but not what I would call great but the time invested in learning them to date is the main reason we stick with them. We use both ASP.NET and Winnform controls. As we are due to renew, we are considering DevExpress as an option as they seem to offer much of the same functionality. For anyone that has made this move fro mInfragistics to DevExpress, how have you found it? A step forward or back? Pros and Cons to doing so?
