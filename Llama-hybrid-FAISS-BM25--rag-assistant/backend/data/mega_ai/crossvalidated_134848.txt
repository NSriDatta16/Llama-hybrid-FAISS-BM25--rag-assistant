If your data is static and you know your meta-function $F$, you can try different value of $k$ and make use of model selection technique to find out the most likely value of $k$. On the other hand (or in general), I think you can transform your problem as bayesian influence and try a MCMC-approach to solve your problem. Peter Green (1995) invented a technique to sample from the posterior distribution even if the dimension is unknown. Have a look on it, and I think textbook on computational statistics or Monte Carlo will discuss this too.
