How to interpret the significance code?

I'm studying for some time and I´m trying to do a logistic regression (using GLM in R) and now it´s extremely difficult to know what to do. I have a binary dependant variable and 15 independent variables. As result of running GLM I've got: glm(formula = y ~ ., family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = crs$dataset[crs$train, c(crs$input, crs$target)]) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.9601 -0.5093 0.3074 0.4809 2.9348 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.52793176 0.19178032 -2.753 0.00591 ** x1 -0.03566232 0.01605379 -2.221 0.02632 * x2 0.00497392 0.00110514 4.501 6.77e-06 *** x3 -0.00002352 0.00000944 -2.491 0.01272 * x4 0.01004249 0.01174335 0.855 0.39246 x5 0.10133956 0.01674787 6.051 1.44e-09 *** x6 0.11445741 0.01819984 6.289 3.20e-10 *** x7 0.06258882 0.01386824 4.513 6.39e-06 *** x8 0.02266609 0.00103133 21.978 I´d like to ask for help to see at this result to know if its a acceptable model. I evaluated this model using ROC, and it gave me the result of 0,8843. Does it means that the prediction is 88,43% right? Can I use as reference these significance codes (***,**,*,., ) ? Which one should I choose to keep in my model?
