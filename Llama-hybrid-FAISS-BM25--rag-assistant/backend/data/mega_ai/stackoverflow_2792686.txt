UTF-8 is a Unicode encoding. You probably meant that you want to choose between UTF-8 and UTF-16. Microsoft recommends that Developers should use UTF-8 for all Unicode data that they send to and receive from the browser. For database storage, use the encoding your RDBMS has better support for. Or, all else being equal, choose based on space efficiency. UTF-8 is smaller for English and most European languages, while UTF-16 tends to be smaller for Asian languages.
