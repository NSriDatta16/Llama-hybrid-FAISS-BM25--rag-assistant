Workflow for using TextMate/Coda with Transmit and Versions

I use TextMate to do my HTMl,PHP,JS/Other languages and CSSEdit to do my CSS. I want to integrate TextMate with Transmit better because at the moment I work like this: TextMate: Edit code Transmit: Look for folder and drag to online server Firefox: Refresh page Rinse, Repeat. It feels very clunky to me and I do the same with CSSEdit (although CSSEdit's live preview means that I only have to upload once) but I would like to be able to, on save, have Transmit upload the edited document to the relevant place on the server (given that linked browsing is enabled). Does anyone have a certain workflow that they follow or macros enabled in TextMate to do such tasks as they would certainly make my life a lot easier, Coda is also an option instead of TextMate if needed. Being able to have Versions/Git-Tower auto commit on save would be great too.
