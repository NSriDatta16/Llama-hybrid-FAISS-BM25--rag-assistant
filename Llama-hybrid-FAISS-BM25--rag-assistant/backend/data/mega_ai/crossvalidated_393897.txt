NOTE: I am not sure this answer is right, but I think it is. It's an idea. I know others here have more math background than I do and will point out if I have messed up. First, I'd not use t-tests. The data are likely to be extremely skew and are also counts. Second, I like @StatsStudent 's idea, but I don't think a linear model is right (as he notes in his final paragraph). I think it should be some form of count model, such as Poisson or negative binomial, perhaps with zero inflation. Third, the problem that arises is that you have a non-zero comparison. In the linear model, you might just subtract 5 from every value, but that is going to mess up the count nature of the data. So .... How about an offset of 5 and then a NB regression with "diagnosis" as the independent variable? I know that's not the usual use of an offset, but, intuitively, it seems right to me.
