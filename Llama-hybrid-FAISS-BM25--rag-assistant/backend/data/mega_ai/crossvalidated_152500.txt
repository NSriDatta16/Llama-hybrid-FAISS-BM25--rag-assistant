To the references of the above comment, I would like to add " Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis " by Alan Agresti. The book is precisely intended for non-statisticians and I believe it is commonly used as a first couse in the theory of GLM. Its main focus is logistic regression but you also see the Poisson, Negative Binomial and Gamma models in worked out examples. The book uses SAS but not to worry. There is an R-manual that also accompanies it] 2 , one important difference between SAS and R being of course that the latter is freely available. I believe there is a free pdf version available somewhere on the internet, so take a look. If you are finding it too easy, you might also want to try its twin , which is intended for more advanced students.
