jquery UI sortable: how can I change the appearance of the "placeholder" object?

In the example given at http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#placeholder the placeholder is the orange box that appears when you drag any of the items. This element can be tweaked using the placeholder option -- but it only lets you modify the class of the element as described here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#options I would like to customize this element more, e.g. by supplying a function to the placeholder option in the same manner that one can supply a function to the helper option. What would I need to change (e.g. in sortable.js) to do this?
