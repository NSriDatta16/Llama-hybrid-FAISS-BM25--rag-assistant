A couple of things to consider. 1) Reporting Services are part of Sql Server, so you may have an extra license issue if you go that route. 2) Reporting Services can serve up web pages, or be used in WinForms with full paging, sorting, sub reports, totals etc etc - that's really hard in XSL. It will also play nicely with printers. 3) Reporting services comes with a WYSIWYG editor to build reports. It's not perfect by any means, but a lot easier than hand crafting. 4) Using XSL to create XHTML can be real performance hit. XSL works on an entire XML Dom, and that maybe a big document if you're dealing with a multipage report. I'd expect Reporting Services to work a lot faster. 5) Reporting Services can leverage the whole of .Net, so you can get a lot of other functionality for free. Taking all that on board, using Reporting Services will save you time, unless your reporting requirements are very simple. It is less fun though.
