XML is the way to go. From there, you mosey on to parsing out and acting upon the Agent tags in the request. From there you can choose (assuming the device supports it), having the device render it via XSLT, or you can apply the XSLT on your end and stream down the appropriate markup language for the device. In the end, you end up with a specific "rendering" per device. Ideally, the more compatible the devices are with normal browsers, the close the final XSLT is to each other. But you'll still likely have a version for each device that you support. The beauty of this is that you can add devices incrementally, as time and demand permits. And as devices converge, you gain value by being able to converge your renderings. Also, your back end stays the same no matter what. Finally, it also works great for non-mobile as well. Yea, it's a burden to support the different devices, but that's just a truth of the marketplace.
