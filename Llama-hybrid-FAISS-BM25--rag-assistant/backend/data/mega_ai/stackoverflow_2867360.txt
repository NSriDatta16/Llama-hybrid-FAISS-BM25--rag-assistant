Magento - showing review links & add-to-compare links on custom pages

I have a custom page as my magento homepage. It's content is hardcoded on the default CMS page (which shows if a CMS homepage isn't enabled in the CMS pages section of the admin). I have a list of products showing there (pulled from best-selling/highest rated etc). However, the review links and the add-to-compare links don't show on this page. The list of products is displayed using the same code as the default template/catalog/product/list.phtml , and everything else works except for these 2 things. It seems that both the following code snippets have no effect on pages other than the default category listing page: getAddToCompareUrl($_product); ?> & getReviewsUrl() ?> I'm guessing that there's something else that needs to be called in order for these to work, but can't figure out what it is. Everything else from the product collection is available. I load my product collection using the following code: $_productCollection = Mage::getResourceModel('reports/product_collection') ->addAttributeToSelect('*') ->addAttributeToFilter('visibility', $visibility) $_productCollection->load(); Any ideas?
