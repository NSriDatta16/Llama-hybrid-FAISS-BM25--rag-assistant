We are unfortunately maintaining a Lasso app here and it's an absolute nightmare. Lasso crashes once a day on average. The people at LassoSoft are very quick at taking our money but do not provide any useful support. Also like you probably noticed, nobody uses Lasso and you'll struggle to hire qualified staff. You'd be better off with Ruby, Python, Perl, Java or even PHP.
