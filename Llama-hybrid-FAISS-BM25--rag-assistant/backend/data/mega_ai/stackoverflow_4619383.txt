VB.NET: PictureBox view range?

I two pictureboxes in my application: One that is mostly just a background image, and another which you can move around changing some settings. However, depending on my settings (X,Y,Width,Height), a fragment or all of the second picturebox might be "out" of the first picturebox. I don't want that. Basically, if there is anything in the second picturebox's that is not over the first picturebox, I don't want to show that fragment. I want to cut it. If I move the second picturebox back inside the first picturebox, then I can see all of it again. Think of the first picturebox as a "view range"
