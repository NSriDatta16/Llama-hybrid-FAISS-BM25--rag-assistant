SharePoint 2010 - List view threshold: What does not trigger the threshold?

In SharePoint 2010, we have the List View Threshold, which defaults to 5,000, and: Specifies the maximum number of list or library items that a database operation, such as a query, can process at the same time outside the daily time window set by the administrator during which queries are unrestricted. So, I'm looking to determine the options for querying a document library that will have more items than the threshold limit. Ignoring the 'unrestricted' dailty time window, will the threshold be triggered under the following scenarios on a document library with more than 5,000 items? Using CAML Queries in Content Query WebParts on indexed columns, non-paged results (Answer: Yes) Using CAML Queries in Content Query WebParts on indexed columns, paged results, 100 per page (Answer: If using ContentIterator, No. Otherwise, Yes/Maybe (depending on retrieval method)) Using the Search API on indexed or non-index columns (Answer: No)
