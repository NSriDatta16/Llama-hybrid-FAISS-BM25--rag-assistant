Are these NotePad++ features available in TextMate?

I'm a NotePad++ user, new to TextMate. There are some features that I really like in NP++ but couldn't figure out if TextMate support them. Double click on a variable and have all instances highlighted View 2 text windows side by side Drag a file onto another opened Window For this one, I don't know how to generate a screenshot ;-p. Basically, you can drag a file from Windows Explorer and drop it into NP++ to have it opened.
