Merge two arrays as key value pairs in PHP

I've got two arrays of the same size. I'd like to merge the two so the values of one are the key indexes of the new array, and the values of the new array are the values of the other. Right now I'm just looping through the arrays and creating the new array manually, but I have a feeling there is a much more elegant way to go about this. I don't see any array functions for this purpose, but maybe I missed something? Is there a simple way to this along these lines? $mapped_array = mapkeys($array_with_keys, $array_with_values);
