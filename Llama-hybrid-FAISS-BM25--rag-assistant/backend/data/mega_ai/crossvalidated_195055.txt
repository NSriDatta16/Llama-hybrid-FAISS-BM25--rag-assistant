Bespoke MCMC priors & likelihoods, & feeding a posterior joint pdf back in as the prior next time

We're looking at PyStan, PyMC3 and emcee. (switching to R could also be an option, if need be). We have a lot of bespoke priors and bespoke likelihood functions: they are bespoke in the sense that they are not one of the standard distributions: they are unique to our work. These are used to estimate the joint distribution of several real parameters; and ideally we'd like the estimator to spit out a posterior in a format that it could later read in as a prior for further estimation: e.g. as an empirical distribution function (that would be then interpolated when used as a prior), perhaps with something to ensure the tails go out appropriately far. So, I need an expert compare-and-contrast: is it easier to do that with one of those libraries (PyStan, PyMC3, emcee) rather than the others, and what additional programming languages are needed / would be helpful to do so? (e.g. AIUI it's possible to extend STAN with additional C++ programming)
