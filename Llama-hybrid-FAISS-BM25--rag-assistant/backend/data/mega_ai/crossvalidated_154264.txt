Directed acyclic graphs in regression model

I am using DAGs to select best set of variables for my logistic regression analysis. Assessment of DAG includes one exposure, number of covariates and an outcome variable. I have not found any solid statement how should I treat these terms with regard to logistic regression. I have several exposures of interest and several other covariates. Aren't all variables in regression analysis "equal"? Lets say I have exposures X1 and X2 and covariates C1 and C2. When I perform logistic regression I get regressions coefficients for all these variables. Any covariate can shown significant effect in the model. Thats why I think them "equal". If I want to assess the suitability of my model,should I use DAGs having both exposures as exposure of interest in two separate DAGs treating other exposure as covariate? DAG 1: exposure of interest X1, covarites C1 and C2,other exposure X2 as covariate C3 DAG 2: exposure of interest X2, covarites C1 and C2,other exposure X1 as covariate C3
