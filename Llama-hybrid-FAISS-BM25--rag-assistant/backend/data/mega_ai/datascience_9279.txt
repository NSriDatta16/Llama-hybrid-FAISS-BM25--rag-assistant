I've tried the following algorithms: Factorization Machines by Steffen Rendle - Really good algorithm for sparse feature sets, in construct to polynomial-regression. Measures the interaction between features. Model that in addition to learning linear weights on features, learn a vector space for each feature to learn pairing interactions between features in this new space. Field-Aware Factorization Machines - an improvement of the FM model. Recently, have been used to win two Kaggle's click-through rate prediction competitions. FTRL - "Follow The (Proximally) Regularized Leader" algorithm - regularized online logistic regression. Equivalent to Online (Stochastic) Gradient Descent when no regularization is used. Very easy to implement. AdPredictor algorithm by Microsoft The algorithm is based on a probit regression model that maps discrete or real-valued input features to probabilities. It maintains Gaussian beliefs over weights of the model and performs Gaussian online updates derived from approximate message passing.
