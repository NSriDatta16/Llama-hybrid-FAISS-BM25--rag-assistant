From the git-gc man page: Users are encouraged to run this task on a regular basis within each repository to maintain good disk space utilization and good operating performance. Emphasis mine. Bare repositories are repositories too! Further explanation: one of the housekeeping tasks that git-gc performs is packing and repacking of loose objects. Even if you never have any dangling objects in your bare repository, you will -- over time -- accumulate lots of loose objects. These loose objects should periodically get packed, for efficiency. Similarly, if a large number of packs accumulate, they should periodically get repacked into larger (fewer) packs.
