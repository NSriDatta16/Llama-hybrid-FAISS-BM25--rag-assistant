Reduce a transition matrix when using Markov chain to describe a web site activity

I have log from a website describing page by page visits. So lots of data. I would like to make a transition matrix with states each page of the site. So markov chains with continuous-time and discrete states. It will be a huge transition matrix with a lots of states. The idea behind is to be able to represent how visitors navigate through the website. It will make a lot of states. I would like then to reduce the number of states by aggregating them on a relevant way. aka, two pages visited the same way should go altogether. I saw this concept: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpability Now, my questions are the following: Is there better way to look at the way people navigate on the website that I missed? I use r and I saw the markovchain package allows to do nice stuff, like giving the probability to go from one page to another. I didn't found a simple function to determine if two states are "lumpable". So is there some package that I am missing? In the case of non-lumpability, how to determine which states should go altogether? Is a segmentation like k-mean on the transition matrix would make sense? (I think about replacing the diagonal coefficient by 0 and create a new variable for the segmentation)
