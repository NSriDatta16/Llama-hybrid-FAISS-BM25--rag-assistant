Survival analyses for complicated models

I've just began looking into survival analyses, and I'm having some difficulty interpreting the results. I have a model linear regression model where time ~ x1 * x2 * x3... x9, this model seems to fit well (adjusted R${^2}$ of ~0.9) however it was suggested that survival analyses may be a better direction. I have tried using the R tool for this, but I can't interpret the data. I do have some trails where they timed out (after 1 hour) so I set up my censor column for that. I then tried plotting the full data set (~200 trials), and got a nice downward stepped curve. , however this doesnt seem to tell me anything, the model used was just survfit(my.surv ~ 1). If I replace the ~ 1 with one of the variables, for example survfit(mysurv ~ x1), I get a total mess. Lines all over the place (mostly vertical). So, my questions are these: 1) Is it possible to gain useful information, other than saying that 80% of the trials finished before 2000 seconds, which is what I think this plot shows 2) Is it possible to include factors in the model, for example time ~ x1 + x2, etc. If not how does one ascertain which variables are important by this method. 3) How can I use this to make predictions about new data, not included in this model?
