Distribution of estimator of multiple (spatially related) proportions

Consider a spatial random process $Z(s)$ , where $s$ denotes the spatial location. Our objective is to delineate the zone $\mathcal{Z}$ where the probability that $Z$ exceed a given threshold $\zeta$ is above a specified probability $r$ : $$ \mathcal{Z} = \{s | \mathrm{Pr} (Z(s) > \zeta) > r\} .$$ We know a sample $\{z_1, \dots, z_N\}$ of $N$ realisations of $Z(s)$ . /I dropped the dependence in $s$ for notational brevity, but the $z_i$ are functions of the location $s$ ./ A straightforward estimate of the exceedance probability is the average of the $N$ images $\{1_\zeta(z_1), \dots, 1_\zeta(z_N)\}$ by the indicator function $1_\zeta : z \mapsto$ (1 if $z> \zeta$ and 0 otherwise). Now, we would like to account for the uncertainty of this estimate when drawing the estimated zone of probable exceedance $\tilde{\mathcal{Z}}$ . The probability $r$ is small, say $5\%$ or possibly $1\%.$ The sample size is expected to range from a few decades to a few hundreds. This problem similar to the question of “Confidence interval for a proportion” ( Confidence interval for a proportion ) except that we consider several dependent variables, namely the $Z(s_1), \dots, Z(s_n)$ for a set of locations $s_1, \dots, s_n$ . How to display (visualise) this added uncertainty is the subject of another question ( Display uncertainty on spatialy distributed proportions (visualisation) ).
