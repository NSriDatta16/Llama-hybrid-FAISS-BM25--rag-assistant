Sample Inclusion Criteria for an Intent-To-Treat Analysis in an Encouragement Design With One-Sided Non-Compliance

This question is about how to define the sample in an Intent-To-Treat analysis of an experiment with balanced pre-assignment and an encouragement design. This is a bit different than the usual setting with perfect compliance in exposure, so bear with me. Here's my setup. Suppose there is a group of size $N$ that is the population of interest (based on some criteria) that is split into treatment and control. Each member is pre-assigned to a experimental arm. A balancing test using baseline data is performed to confirm that groups are comparable at randomization time, perhaps with some re-randomization needed to achieve that balance. The treatment is an encouragement design with imperfect one-sided compliance (say being told about the benefits of wearing masks on top of a general explanation of COVID, the control group received only the latter). I care about the causal effect of being told about the benefits of masks, rather than the effect of actually wearing them. Unfortunately, only $N' folks are exposed to the encouragement and/or lecture since people need to go to a place where that happens, and not everyone does. We can assume that the treatment does not influence the attendance margin, the outcome is perfectly observable for all $N$ users, and SUTVA is maintained (no interference between units). I have two questions: In calculating $E[Y \vert T] - E[Y \vert C]$ , do we use $N$ observations or $N that were exposed to the experiment? Which is the policy relevant group here for the cost-benefit analysis? My intuition is that while using $N$ dilutes the effect and worsens efficiency of the test, that seems like the appropriate group for the ATE calculation and weighing the costs and benefits of the program. Moreover, the balance check applies to the original $N$ -randomization, so that favors using $N$ as well.
