Why is convolution operation an integral?

I was reading the wonderful book on Deep Learning ( http://www.deeplearningbook.org ) trying to understand convolution. It uses an example in the convolution chapter ( http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/convnets.html ) which is pictured of a function x(t) of the position of a spaceship and w(a) as a weighted avg. Of reading of age a. The convolution is shown in the image as an integral of x(a)w(t-a) hence the convolution. I don't understand the intuition of this example and of convolution. Have tried researching and not helped. In particular why this is an integral not just a straight function of s(t) = x(a)w(t-a) MANY THANKS!
