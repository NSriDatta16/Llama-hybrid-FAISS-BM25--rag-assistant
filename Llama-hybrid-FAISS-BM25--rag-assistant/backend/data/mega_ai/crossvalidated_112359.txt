Choosing between loss functions for binary classification

I work in a problem domain where people often report ROC-AUC or AveP (average precision). However, I recently found papers that optimize Log Loss instead, while yet others report Hinge Loss . While I understand how these metrics are calculated, I am having a hard time understanding the trade-offs between them and which is good for what exactly. When it comes to ROC-AUC vs Precision-Recall, this thread discusses how ROC-AUC-maximization can be seen as using a loss optimization criteria that penalizes "ranking a true negative at least as large as a true positive" (assuming that higher scores correspond to positives). Also, this other thread also provides a helpful discussion of ROC-AUC in contrast to Precision-Recall metrics. However, for what type of problems would log loss be preferred over, say, ROC-AUC , AveP or the Hinge loss ? Most importantly, what types of questions should one ask about the problem when choosing between these loss functions for binary classification?
