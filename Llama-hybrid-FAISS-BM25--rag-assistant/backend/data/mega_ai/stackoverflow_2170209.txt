Emacs has mapcar* in the cl package which does exactly that. Here is the documentation: Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQ, and make a list of the results. If there are several SEQs, FUNCTION is called with that many arguments, and mapping stops as soon as the shortest list runs out. With just one SEQ, this is like mapcar . With several, it is like the Common Lisp mapcar function extended to arbitrary sequence types.
