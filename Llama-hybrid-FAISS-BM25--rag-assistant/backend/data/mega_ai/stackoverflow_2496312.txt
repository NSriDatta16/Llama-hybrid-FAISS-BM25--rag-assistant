To me this seems like a good candidate for a classification problem. You have two classes (correct password input / incorrect), your data could be the time (from time 0) that buttons were pressed. You could teach a learning algorithm but having several examples of correct password data and incorrect password data. Once your classifier is trained and working satisfactorily, you could try it out to predict new password input attempts for correctness. You could try out several classifiers from Weka, a GUI based machine learning tool http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ What you need is your data to be in a simple table format for experimenting in weka, something like the following: Attempt No | 1st button time | 2nd button time | 3rd button time | is_correct -----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------ 1 | 1.2 | 1.5 | 2.4 | YES 2 | 1.3 | 1.8 | 2.2 | YES 3 | 1.1 | 1.9 | 2.0 | YES 4 | 0.8 | 2.1 | 2.9 | NO 5 | 1.2 | 1.9 | 2.2 | YES 6 | 1.1 | 1.8 | 2.1 | NO This would be a training set. The outcome (which is known) is the class is_correct. You would run this data through weka selecting a classifier (Naive Bayes' for example). This would produce a claffier ( for example a set of rules) which could be used to predict future entries.
