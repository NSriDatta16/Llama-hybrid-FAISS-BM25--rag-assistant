Regression with count data as an independent variable

I want to understand the appropriate way to regress a duration variable on a count variable. For instance: I have data on turn around time of a process in a hospital ward. The ward admits patients with diverse clinical specialties. I have the daily average turnaround time of the process as the dependent variable. The independent variable is the count of medical specialties on a given day. The count variable has non-zero values ranging from 1 to 12.
