I think that what that error message is trying to tell you is that the certificate you have generated for your key does not contain the correct certificate extensions. Code-signing requires a certificate that has been generated for code-signing. Other types of certificate -- e.g. those that are generated for signing data -- are subject to less scrutiny by the CA, and so offer a lower level of security that is required for code-signing. Your own self-signed root certificate should be set up for key-signing, and the child certificate should be set up for code signing. Then your ActiveX signature should be OK, so long as your root certificate is in the browser's trusted key store. Generally a key-signing certificate should be set up only for key-signing and a code-signing certificate should be set op only for code-signing, so you can't use these keys for any other purpose. That solution is OK within an organization, where you can install your root key on every user's PC in advance. If you want to use your ActiveX control on a webpage on the public internet you will either have to persuade users to trust your certificate (even though they may have no good reason to do so) or you will have to buy a code-signing certificate from one of the commercial CAs whose root certificates are already known to the common browsers. Finally, I'd really advise against using ActiveX controls for anything as they'll only be able to run on Windows, and then only if they're trusted. Most people who have any sense will have their browser's security set up to reject them. You'll have much more success producing your active content with a different technology ( e.g. Javascript)
