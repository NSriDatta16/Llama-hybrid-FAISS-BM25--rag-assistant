To quote the w3.org spec: The section element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. And another quote from the w3.org people: The section element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead. A general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline. Given the definition for section by w3 we can conclude that your example would be a good use of section because: The elements have a header It is a thematic grouping of content It is a part of the document outline. EDIT: To expand upon your comment below, the new HTML5 elements are NOT supposed to replace the old HTML4 elements. For example, going through a page and replacing all the div elements with section elements would be flat out wrong. The section element was, in my opinion, intended to make it easier for machines to parse certain pages (think: feedburners) by giving a more semantic structure to a page. After all, what's easier to parse, a page with 30 div elements, or a page with 10 div 5 header 5 section 5 article and 5 footer elements?
