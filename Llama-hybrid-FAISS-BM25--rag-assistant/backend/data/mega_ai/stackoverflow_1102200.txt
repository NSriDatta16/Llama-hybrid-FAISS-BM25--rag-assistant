This is a typical Many-To-Many relationship. And the Organization_Users tables is the bridge table. Infact NHibernate and all the other ORM tools have built-in feature to support bridge table. This thing should be resolved at data modelling level rather than at application level. You should analyze your data model and it is recommended to avoid many-to-many relationships (in the sense if it is not the necesity of domain model, you should try to avoid many-to-many relationship). First thing first you need to be sure that many-to-many relationship in data model is necessary for mapping domain entities. Once you have done this then the model represented in your diagram is ok for mapping those relationships at application level
