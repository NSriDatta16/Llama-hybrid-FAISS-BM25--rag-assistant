Help to implement a ZipWithRatio extention method

I'm trying to find a elegant way to write a extention method that might be called MergeWithRatio or ZipWithRatio. I expect it to have this signature.. public static IEnumerable MergeWithRatio (this IEnumerable source, IEnumerable mergeSequence, int ratio) { .. } Example first. var source = new[]{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; var mergeSeq = new[]{100,200}; var result = source.MergeWithRatio(mergeSeq, 3).ToArray(); result now contains [1, 2, 100, 3, 4, 200, 5, 6, 100, 7, 8, 200, 9] Summing up: The mergeSeq is looped when/if finished and the yielding stops when 'source' is empty. If possible I would prefere if the solution was lazy but it is not a requirement. Any ideas or pointers?
