I would start with ordinal logistic regression, with the Likert score as the dependent variable and the conditions as independent variables and also number of conditions. You might want to do this as two separate analyses. One issue with the first is that it might be combinations of conditions that are most important, but with each person having up to 4 out of 6, there will be too many combinations to look at them all.
