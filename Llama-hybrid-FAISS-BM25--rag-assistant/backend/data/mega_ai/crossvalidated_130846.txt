Getting less number of features in weight vectors as were provided for SVM

I have trained a SVM with 18881 features and wanted to know the ranking of features. I tried the method given at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7390173/svm-equations-from-e1071-r-package for it and found the weight vector by w = t(model$coefs) %*% model$SV On checking w by str(w) , I get the following: > str(w) Formal class 'matrix.csr' [package "SparseM"] with 4 slots ..@ ra : num [1:16725] 1198.1 229 107.5 -22.4 408.3 ... ..@ ja : int [1:16725] 381 396 434 447 3262 4802 9187 10398 11856 13896 ... ..@ ia : int [1:2] 1 16726 ..@ dimension: int [1:2] 1 18881 Please explain me the meaning of these @ra etc. I guessed that @ja is giving the column id of feature and @ra is giving the corresponding weight. In that case why number of features is not equal to 18881. Am I correct when I say that @ja is column id of features? As was explained in the mentioned stackoverflow answer, I used linear kernal. Can I apply the same method for Radial Kernel?
