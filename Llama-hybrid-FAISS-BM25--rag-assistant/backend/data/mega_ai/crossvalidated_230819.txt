The question you were asked is quite poorly worded; that doesn't help (in fact if a student wrote that way I'd be inclined to deduct marks for it). It seeks a test for a difference in means ("average chemistry test score"). The "simple random sample of all students" implies that the scores should be independent or close to it. Do you know of any tests for a difference in means with two independent samples?
