If you don't mind a 2 pixel discrepancy you could add... div.content dt.top { position: relative; top: -2px; } But I think your solution is good, it can be improved by using the shorthand version of border radius: http://jsfiddle.net/DAjWS/ border-radius: [topleft] [topright] [bottomright] [bottomleft] The article you are mentioning probably has to do with the combination of border with border-radius (it produces a halo similar to yours), but in your case it's expected. The same thing would happen in a vector editing app if you overlapped two boxes with rounded corners. you just have to find an elegant way of covering the anti-aliasing of the bottom box.
