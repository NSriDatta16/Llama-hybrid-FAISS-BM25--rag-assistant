How can I train the model from the time series to make a regression for each customer? There is no need to do regression for every customer. You just need one model to do everything. You can construct the training data as following: First, select the same time period for every customer (you can choose those customers who purchased at least 120 days) Second, do some features engineering, like last month purchased moving average, days of week, weekend, holiday, and so on Finally, you will arrange the training data like this: Customer-Id Purchased timestamp days-of-week moving-average-terms ... Then, you can do some regression on it, but i will suggest you do something feature selection using tree based models.
