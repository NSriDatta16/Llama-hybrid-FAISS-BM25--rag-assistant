How to fire event from button inside datagrid in silverlight and MVVM

I have button at first column in datagrid. I am using MVVM and try to bind Command to Command in ViewModel but when I click button in each row, it don't work (It don't call Command in ViewModel) but if I move that button out of datagrid it's working properly. How can I fire event from button inside datagrid in MVVM? Update 1: XAML's code is: ViewModel's code is: public ViewModelCommand ViewOrganizationCommand { get; set; }
