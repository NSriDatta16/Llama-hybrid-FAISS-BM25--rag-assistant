git clone heroku ssh permission denied

I just bought a new computer and I am trying to clone my heroku project on it. Here's what I've done so far. I didn't include the trace, but everything was saved in the right place, and the functions ran without errors. >> sudo ssh-keygen >> heroku keys:add >> sudo git clone -o heroku git@heroku.com:myapp.git Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/macuser/Sites/shwagr/shwagr/.git/ Permission denied (publickey). Then I heard about doing it through ssh bash.. >ssh-agent bash >ssh-add ~/.ssh Permissions 0777 for '/Users/macuser/.ssh' are too open. It is recommended that your private key files are NOT accessible by others. This private key will be ignored. What? Ok Dad.. >>sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh >>ssh-agent bash >>ssh-add ~/.ssh Enter passphrase for /Users/macuser/.ssh: Bad passphrase, try again for /Users/macuser/.ssh: Bad passphrase, try again for /Users/macuser/.ssh: Bad passphrase, try again for /Users/macuser/.ssh: Bad passphrase, try again for /Users/macuser/.ssh: Bad passphrase, try again for /Users/macuser/.ssh: Bad passphrase, try again for /Users/macuser/.ssh: Not sure what the password here is, but it sure wasn't me who set this one. If I simply press return/enter, it exits out, but that doesn't give me the impression it worked. And consequentially, it still doesn't allow me to clone the repository. Any ideas? UPDATE I went into my ~/.ssh file and performed ssh-keygen -t rsa and i made a new key called love . Then I heroku keys:add love.pub successfully. Then I went to git clone.. sudo git clone -o heroku git@heroku.com:mysite.git Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/macuser/Sites/shwagr/shwagr/.git/ Permission denied (publickey). UPDATE 2 I deleted ~/.ssh, and recreated it without sudo . Then I removed all my keys I had created today off of heroku , and restarted the process. Same error. Update 3 >>heroku keys No Keys for this computer. >>sudo heroku keys No Keys for this computer >>heroku keys:add >>heroku keys ssh-rsa AAAA...J67lw== macuser@Mac-Users-MacBook-Pro.local Compared these keys to my keys : They are identical. :D Permission Denied. Attempt 4 heroku keys:clear rm -rf ~/.ssh mkdir ~/.ssh cd ~/.ssh ssh-keygen -t rsa heroku keys:add cd /Users/macuser/Sites/ sudo git clone -o heroku git@heroku.com:shwagr.git Failed. fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly Huge Update Just found out that git repo is actually empty. And it's just a symbolic link ( when you attach a real domain to it it still uses the old one as the real repo ). So when I pulled one of Heroku's default names like smooth-buttery-back-52.git , it pulled and worked, and was actually my repository.
