Short answer : It exists and here is the reference and also there is a similar post regarding difference between R RMSE & RMS R E I would like to draw your attention to. It depends where you apply division to make the error relative! Mathematically, when you divide the difference between the predicted output and actual(expected) output $T_i-X_i$ by $T_i$ then the error will be considered Relatively which means that each residual is scaled against the actual value or normalized by that. \begin{equation} \Delta X_{\text{rel},i}=\frac{X_i-T_i}{T_i} \end{equation} \begin{equation} \text{RMSRE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}\Delta X^2_{\text{rel},i}} \end{equation} \begin{equation} \text{RRMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i-T_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}T_i^2}} \end{equation} \begin{equation} \text{PRMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i-T_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}T_i^2}}\cdot 100 \% \end{equation} Another reference for using RRMSE could be found here and the last form is known as r RMSE as well as shown here Basically the same approach is used in MAPE to express error either relatively or in form of percentage as the last form. Obviously expression in form of percentage itself includes relative error.
