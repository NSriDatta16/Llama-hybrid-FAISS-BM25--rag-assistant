Missing UDP fragments when monitoring traffic with tcpdump

I'm on a local LAN with only 8 connected computers using a netgear 24 port gigabit switch, network load is really low and send/receive buffers on all involved nodes(running slackware 11) have been set to 16mb. I'm also running tcpdump on each node to monitor the traffic. A sending node sends a 10044byte large UDP packet which more often than not (3/4 times) does not end up in the receiving side application, in these cases I notice(using tcpdump) that the first x fragments are missing and only the last 3 (all with offsets > 0 and in order) are caught by tcpdump. The fragmented UDP package can therefore not be reassembled and is most likely thrown away. I find the missing fragments strange since I have also tried a simple load test bursting out 10000 UDP messages of the same size, the receiving application sends a response and all tests so far gives 100% responses back. Any clues or hints?
