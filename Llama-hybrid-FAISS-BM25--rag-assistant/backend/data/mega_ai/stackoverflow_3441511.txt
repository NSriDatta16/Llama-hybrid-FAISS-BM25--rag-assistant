It's very simple: create a transparent UIView object that receives touches in the area you want, and when the touch is in the bounds of that view, call resignFirstResponder. // somewhere in a view controller UIView *backgroundView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 480)]; [self.view addSubview:backgroundView]; // in the touchesBegan:withEvent: method, for example UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; if ([field isFirstResponder] && [touch view] == backgroundView) { [field resignFirstResponder]; } Alternatively, you could skip the backgroundView stuff and just add a conditional statement like the following in your touchesBegan:withEvent: method: UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; if ([field isFirstResponder] && [touch view] != field) { [field resignFirstResponder]; } If the touch is ! (not) in the bounds of field , then you want to remove the keyboard.
