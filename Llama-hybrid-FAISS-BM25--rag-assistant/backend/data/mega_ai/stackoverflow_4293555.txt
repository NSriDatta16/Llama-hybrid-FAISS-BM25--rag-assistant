How to default all routes to a specific folder in Rails?

I have a folder called home that I'm using to organize my top level view files. How do I set the route so that when they appear the url doesn't contain the /home/ section. Example: Currently the file about_us displays http://somesite.com/home/about_us where I want it to display http://somesite.com/about_us Thanks
