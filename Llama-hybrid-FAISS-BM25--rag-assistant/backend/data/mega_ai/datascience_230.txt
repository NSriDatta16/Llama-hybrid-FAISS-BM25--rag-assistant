In general, you don't want to use XML tags to tag documents in this way because tags may overlap. UIMA , GATE and similar NLP frameworks denote the tags separate from the text. Each tag, such as Person , ACME , John etc. is stored as the position that the tag begins and the position that it ends. So, for the tag ACME , it would be stored as starting a position 11 and ending at position 17.
