How to make 'p4 annotate' list the modifier name instead of revision number

In previous organization, 'cvs annotate' used to give annotation w.r.t modifier login id. This was very useful and time saving in finding out who modified what in the file. Could i do same thing in perforce with simple tweeks? Thanks
