What is the difference between bagging and random forest if only one explanatory variable is used?

" The fundamental difference between bagging and random forest is that in Random forests, only a subset of features are selected at random out of the total and the best split feature from the subset is used to split each node in a tree, unlike in bagging where all features are considered for splitting a node." Does that means that bagging is the same as random forest, if only one explanatory variable (predictor) is used as input?
