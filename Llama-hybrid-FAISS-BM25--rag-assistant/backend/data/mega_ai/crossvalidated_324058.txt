Finding significant independent variables for categorical dependent variable

I have factor dependent variable and many independent variables(continuous & discrete). This is about financial risk modelling. Whether a customer is likely to default the loan or not is the dependent variable and the principle, interest, high/low/medium income, etc are few out of many independent variables. I would like to see which hypothesis testing is best for this scenario. My objective is to identify significant independent variables impacting the y. I think multinomial logistic regression is good for such scenario but regression is modelling. I only want to understand which x's significantly impact the y. Suggesions will be appreciated.
