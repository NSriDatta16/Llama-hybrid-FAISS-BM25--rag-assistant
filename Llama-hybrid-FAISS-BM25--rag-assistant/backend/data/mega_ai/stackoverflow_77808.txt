Compatibility mode does not affect storage. It's just a flag. Nothing will change in the data or queries. Only query execution will get affected. Nothing - or lots of things. Did you use syntax marked as obsolete and subject to deletion in 2000? Did you use parethesis when providing hints in queries? Did you use query execution hints? If yes, it's better to revise your database first, remove obsolete syntax, put the parenthesis back and dig the BOL to find which hints are going to slow down your fine-tuned query on new engine. No. But the data will survive. In fact, if you are able to run your database on server2005, even in mode 8, you're using new data format already. Yes, you can roll back. It's not transforming, it's just setting a flag which says "My queries are that compatible."
