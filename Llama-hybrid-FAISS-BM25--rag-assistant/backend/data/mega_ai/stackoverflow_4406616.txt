Some info from initial review: https://github.com/tnc/php-amqplib forked http://code.google.com/p/php-amqplib/ at an unknown point in the past and does not have a clear history or show what was changed, which results in an unfortunate fragmentation of efforts. It also appears to NOT be keeping up with bugfixes being applied to the original, a number of which have come in the last few months. Also http://code.google.com/p/php-amqplib/ itself now appears to be no longer under active development, and a bad patch was applied over a month ago leaving the trunk in a broken state. (I submitted a patch to fix that, but this is a bad sign).
