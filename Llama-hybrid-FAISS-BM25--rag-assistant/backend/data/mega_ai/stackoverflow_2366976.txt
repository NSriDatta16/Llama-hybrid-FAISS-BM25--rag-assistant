Facebooker Built In Data Retrieval Methods Return "No info set for this user" error

I've gone through the Facebooker msg archive, google, etc and found a couple messages dealing with this and they basically say "Go look at the Facebook docs and see what is happening". I did that, but I'm still not clear what is going on and why I'm not able to retrieve my profile or status arrays using Facebooker. I'm starting to think that the Facebooker direct API calls are "broken" and am going to try the equivalent FQL queries next. Am I missing some sort of Facebooker User initialization or something? I've looked at the source, and the calls I'm making seem to be exactly what I'm looking for. The error I'm getting is API_EC_INFO_NO_INFORMATION, "No information has been set for this user". When I check my profile using the FB Tool Console, I see my info just fine. What I'm trying to do is set up a beanstalk job to pull FB profile/status info, like so: sess = Facebooker::Session.create(" ", " ") # session_key passed to beanstalk as body payload sess.secure_with! job.body fbkr_user = Facebooker::User.new(sess.user.id, sess) puts fbkr_user.get_profile_info.to_s # info not set error # same result if I go through the session, or try to get user.statuses puts sess.user.get_profile_info puts sess.user.statuses ERROR: [..]/gems/facebooker-1.0.62/lib/facebooker/parser.rb:646:in `process': No information has been set for this user (StandardError) from /Users/notbrain/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/facebooker-1.0.62/lib/ facebooker/parser.rb:36:in `parse' from /Users/notbrain/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/facebooker-1.0.62/lib/ facebooker/service.rb:66:in `post' from /Users/notbrain/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/facebooker-1.0.62/lib/ facebooker/session.rb:638:in `post_without_logging' from /Users/notbrain/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/facebooker-1.0.62/lib/ facebooker/session.rb:649:in `post' from /Users/notbrain/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/facebooker-1.0.62/lib/ facebooker/logging.rb:20:in `log_fb_api' from /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ ruby/1.8/benchmark.rb:308:in `realtime' from /Users/notbrain/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/facebooker-1.0.62/lib/ facebooker/logging.rb:20:in `log_fb_api' from /Users/notbrain/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/facebooker-1.0.62/lib/ facebooker/session.rb:648:in `post' from /Users/notbrain/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/facebooker-1.0.62/lib/ facebooker/models/user.rb:390:in `get_profile_info' from app/workers/index_fb_user.rb:23 from app/workers/index_fb_user.rb:6:in `loop' from app/workers/index_fb_user.rb:6 from /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `eval' from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/rails-2.3.5/lib/commands/runner.rb: 46 from /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `gem_original_require' from /Library/Ruby/Site/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `require' from script/runner:3
