Building and Using a DYLIB in Xcode

I'm trying to build a .dylib in Xcode. Currently the .dylib builds, but when I drag the .dylib into another project and try to #import one of the headers (Seeker.h) in the .dylib, I get this error: *: No such file or directory Seeker.h: No such file or directory The project is available as an Xcode project here . I can confirm the header is indeed in a path alongside the .dylib once built, but as for what to do with it I have no idea. My only experience with .dylib files is frameworks built into Mac OS X, like libsqlite3.dylib, which works perfectly. All the tutorials I can find on .dylib files does not cover how to use them with Xcode in a sensible manner; all of them rely either on complex scripts or machine-dependent configuration which will not work for us. So basically I need a start-to-finish step-by-step process that successfully builds the .dylib and successfully includes it in another Xcode project in a way that's not dependent on changing build settings for different users. In other words, a way that just works and that will work when we distribute both projects to members of our team.
