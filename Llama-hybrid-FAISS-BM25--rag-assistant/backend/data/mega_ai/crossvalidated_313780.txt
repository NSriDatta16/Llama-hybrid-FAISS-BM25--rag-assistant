Random Forest: Estimate False Discovery Rate in new data?

I have a random forest classification model built on balanced positive and negative classes. I am trying to estimate the number of false positives and false negatives in the new data, in order to select an appropriate threshold. However, I don't have a good estimate for the number of positives in the new data. I know that N_negatives >> N_positives , so I can estimate false_positives = N * FPR . Is it possible to estimate the number of true positives?
