Firstly, it would probably be more elegant if you were to use the DateTime.ToString method with a format string specifying the form that you want the date string to appear in (information on this can be found here ). As for why the other formats that you specified are not being parsed into a DateTime object correctly, you probably need to use the DateTime.Parse(string, IFormatProvider) variant and define your own IFormatProvider for this. You might find this MSDN article might be useful for this.
