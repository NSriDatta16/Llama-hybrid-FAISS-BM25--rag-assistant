How does Support Vector Machine compare to Logistic Regression?

Support Vector Machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) have been discussed widely in machine learning community, I know that both of them achieve pretty good performance. But, I am not sure how in general SVM compared to logistic regression? Why sometime SVM can perform better than LR? And sometime not? What factors determine these.
