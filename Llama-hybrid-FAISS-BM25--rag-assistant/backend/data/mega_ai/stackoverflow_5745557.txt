Getting "new-line character seen in unquoted field" when parsing csv document using django-storages

I am trying to parse csv files that have been uploaded to Amazon S3 using django-storages. I keep getting a "Error: new-line character seen in unquoted field - do you need to open the file in universal-newline mode?". The normal work around for this is to open the file with "rU", but that does not seem to work with django storages. If I drop the file directly on the server and open from there it works, I just want to avoid storing the files directly on the server if possible. Here is the code I am using: import csv from django.core.files.storage import default_storage as s3_storage n = 'csvdumps/130331548894.csv' csvf = s3_storage.open(n, "rU") csvReader = csv.reader(csvf) for item in csvReader: print item
