I've never used this server before and I can't find any good documentation. Perhaps these less elegant solutions have occurred to you already, but I just thought I would mention them. Seems like com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer has an implementation class called HttpServerImpl. It has a method called stop(). Or perhaps you can find the Thread listening on the server socket and call interrupt(). Sean
