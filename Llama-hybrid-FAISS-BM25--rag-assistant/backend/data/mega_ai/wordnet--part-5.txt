ayalam WordNet, developed by Cochin University Of Science and Technology. Multilingual Central Repository (MCR) integrates in the same EuroWordNet framework wordnets from Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Galician and Portuguese liked to English. The MultiWordNet project, a multilingual WordNet aimed at producing an Italian WordNet strongly aligned with the Princeton WordNet. OpenDutchWordNet, is a Dutch lexical semantic database. OpenWN-PT is a Brazilian Portuguese version of the original WordNet freely available for download under CC-BY-SA license. plWordNet is a Polish-language version of WordNet developed by Wrocław University of Technology. PolNet is a Polish-language version of WordNet developed by Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań (distributed under CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 license). Projects such as BalkaNet and EuroWordNet made it feasible to create standalone wordnets linked to the original one. Two such projects were the Russian WordNet, patronized by Petersburg State University of Means of Communication and led by S.A. Yablonsky, and Russnet, by Saint Petersburg State University. UWN is an automatically constructed multilingual lexical knowledge base extending WordNet to cover over a million words in many different languages. WOLF (WordNet Libre du Français), a French version of WordNet. Linked data BabelNet, a very large multilingual semantic network with millions of concepts obtained by integrating WordNet and Wikipedia using an automatic mapping algorithm. The SUMO ontology has a complete manual mapping [1] between all of the WordNet synsets and all of SUMO (including its domain ontologies, when WordNet contains a word sense for a given SUMO term) which is browsable at, for example [2]. OpenCyc, an open ontology and knowledge base of everyday common sense knowledge, has 12,000 terms linked to WordNet synonym sets. DOLCE, is the first module of the WonderWeb Foundational Ontologies Library (WFOL). This upper-ontology has been developed in light of rigorous ontological principles inspired by the philosophical tradition, with a clear orientation toward language and cognition. OntoWordNet is the result of an experimental alignment of WordNet's upper level with DOLCE. It is suggested that such alignment could lead to an "ontologically sweetened" WordNet, meant to be conceptually more rigorous, cognitively transparent, and efficiently exploitable in several applications. DBpedia, a database of structured information, is linked to WordNet. The eXtended WordNet is a project at the University of Texas at Dallas which aims to improve WordNet by semantically parsing the glosses, thus making the information contained in these definitions available for automatic knowledge processing systems. It is freely available under a license similar to WordNet's. The GCIDE project produced a dictionary by combining a public domain Webster's Dictionary from 1913 with some WordNet definitions and material provided by volunteers. It was released under the copyleft license GPL. ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by millions of images. Currently, it has over 500 images per node on average. BioWordnet, a biomedical extension of wordnet was abandoned due to issues about stability over versions. WikiTax2WordNet, a mapping between WordNet synsets and Wikipedia categories. WordNet++, a resource including over millions of semantic edges harvested from Wikipedia and connecting pairs of WordNet synsets. SentiWordNet, a resource for supporting opinion mining applications obtained by tagging all the WordNet 3.0 synsets according to their estimated degrees of positivity, negativity, and neutrality. ColorDict, is an Android application to mobiles phones that use Wordnet database and others, like Wikipedia. UBY-LMF a database of 10 resources including WordNet.
