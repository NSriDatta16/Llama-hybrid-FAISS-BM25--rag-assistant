How can I programmatically determine if an "touchUpInside" event occured?

It seems like if this method will be called any time the user touches my view: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if ([touch view] == self && [touch tapCount] >= 1) { // do something... } } I've implemented this in an UIScrollView. The documentation for UIEvent doesn't mention those touchUpInside, touchUpOutside, etc. events that are available in Interface Builder when making connections to action methods. Actually I want a method to be called only upon one of those "touchUpInside" events, rather than on any kind of touch.
