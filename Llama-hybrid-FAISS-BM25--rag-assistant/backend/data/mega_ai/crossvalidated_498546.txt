Interpreting Omega coefficients (reliability) from EFA and CFA

I have a dataset with 5 variables and I would like to estimate the reliability of the scale score computed as the linear combination of all items (n = number of items), that is $O = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i)$ . I expect a unidimensional structure, but also correlated errors between variables v3 and v5. > head(dx) v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 1 3 3 -3 3 -5 2 5 4 -2 4 -3 3 3 3 -4 3 -2 4 4 3 -3 3 -3 5 3 2 -4 4 -4 6 5 3 -2 5 -1 > correlation::correlation(dx) %>% summary() Parameter | v5 | v4 | v3 | v2 ------------------------------------------------- v1 | 0.28*** | 0.48*** | 0.32*** | 0.42*** v2 | 0.32*** | 0.42*** | 0.31*** | v3 | 0.40*** | 0.30*** | | v4 | 0.31*** | | | I have tried using packages psych , lavaan and semTools to estimate $\omega$ . I need help to understand the output of these analyses. Psych package - EFA > x1 x1 Omega Call: omegah(m = m, nfactors = nfactors, fm = fm, key = key, flip = flip, digits = digits, title = title, sl = sl, labels = labels, plot = plot, n.obs = n.obs, rotate = rotate, Phi = Phi, option = option, covar = covar) Alpha: 0.73 G.6: 0.7 Omega Hierarchical: 0.59 Omega H asymptotic: 0.76 Omega Total 0.77 Schmid Leiman Factor loadings greater than 0.2 g F1* F2* F3* h2 u2 p2 v1 0.46 0.53 0.51 0.49 0.41 v2 0.48 0.39 0.38 0.62 0.60 v3 0.65 0.43 0.57 0.97 v4 0.45 0.53 0.49 0.51 0.42 v5 0.64 0.43 0.57 0.95 With eigenvalues of: g F1* F2* F3* 1.47 0.72 0.00 0.06 general/max 2.05 max/min = 368.22 mean percent general = 0.67 with sd = 0.28 and cv of 0.41 Explained Common Variance of the general factor = 0.65 The degrees of freedom are -2 and the fit is 0 The number of observations was 91220 with Chi Square = 0 with prob As I understand, this function does EFA with Schmid-Leiman transformation that extracts the G factor from the previously 3 extracted factors. Did I understand well that: A. $\omega_h = 0.59$ tells me that 59% of variance in composite score &O& is attributable to the general factor? B. $\omega_t = 0.77$ tells me that 77% of variance in composite score &O& is attributable to common factor variance (general + other common factors)? In which cases do I report $\omega_h$ and in which $\omega_t$ ? For me, it would make sense to report only $\omega_h$ because the readers would probably want to know how much of the composite score variance is actually attributed by the G. Or am I mistaken? Which $\omega$ is reported more commonly? When do I use $\omega_hasymptotic$ ? How do I interpret it and when should I use it? Psych package - CFA I also tried estimating omega with CFA. When I run omegaSem , I get an error > x2 :2:0: unexpected end of input 1: ~ ^ Do you know why that happens? Lavaan + semTools - CFA I also try to manually postulate the model in CFA. Here it makes sense to model the correlated error directly, instead of modeling another factor besides the general one. > m fit summary(fit, fit.measures = T, standardized = T) lavaan 0.6-7 ended normally after 23 iterations Estimator ML Optimization method NLMINB Number of free parameters 11 Used Total Number of observations 89798 91220 Model Test User Model: Test statistic 613.122 Degrees of freedom 4 P-value (Chi-square) 0.000 Model Test Baseline Model: Test statistic 85412.700 Degrees of freedom 10 P-value 0.000 User Model versus Baseline Model: Comparative Fit Index (CFI) 0.993 Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) 0.982 Loglikelihood and Information Criteria: Loglikelihood user model (H0) -608146.875 Loglikelihood unrestricted model (H1) -607840.314 Akaike (AIC) 1216315.750 Bayesian (BIC) 1216419.209 Sample-size adjusted Bayesian (BIC) 1216384.251 Root Mean Square Error of Approximation: RMSEA 0.041 90 Percent confidence interval - lower 0.038 90 Percent confidence interval - upper 0.044 P-value RMSEA |z|) Std.lv Std.all g =~ v1 1.000 0.680 0.677 v2 0.882 0.006 137.570 0.000 0.600 0.630 v3 0.770 0.007 109.383 0.000 0.524 0.466 v4 0.969 0.007 142.474 0.000 0.659 0.687 v5 0.741 0.007 105.834 0.000 0.504 0.449 Covariances: Estimate Std.Err z-value P(>|z|) Std.lv Std.all .v3 ~~ .v5 0.240 0.004 61.537 0.000 0.240 0.240 Variances: Estimate Std.Err z-value P(>|z|) Std.lv Std.all .v1 0.548 0.004 144.520 0.000 0.548 0.542 .v2 0.549 0.003 160.026 0.000 0.549 0.604 .v3 0.988 0.005 189.371 0.000 0.988 0.783 .v4 0.485 0.003 140.556 0.000 0.485 0.528 .v5 1.009 0.005 191.263 0.000 1.009 0.799 g 0.463 0.005 94.964 0.000 1.000 1.000 Then, when calculating $\omega$ I get this: omegaFromSem(fit) The following analyses were done using the lavaan package With only 1 factor specified in the sem model, we can only calculate omega Total.

How can I interpret $\omega_t$ from omegaFromSem function? Why doesn't the function produce $omega_h$ also? Why are omegas from semTools::reliability and psych::omegaFromSem so different from each other when the model is the same? Why are omegas from semTools::reliability and psych::omegaFromSem different from the EFA estimations of $\omega$ ? You can see where my confusion comes from. Thanks!
