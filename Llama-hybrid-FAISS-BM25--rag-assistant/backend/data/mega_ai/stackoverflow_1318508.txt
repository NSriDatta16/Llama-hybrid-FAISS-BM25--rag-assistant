Currently the application is using a Java 6 applet that allows me to extract both the hostname and the MAC address from the remote system. I don't like having this dependency on Java 6, but Snow Leopard and Windows both support it, so I can probably live with it. On a related-front our networking folks approached me for some help with converting some existing code to ASP.NET. During the conversation I asked if they had live MAC address information (since they do port shutoffs based on suspicious network activity -- viruses/worms). Turns out they do and we may be able to leverage this project to get access to the information from the network database.
