You could use the discouraged myThread.stop() method. But then it is very likely the Thread is still referenced there, so you should use some reflection magic to remove all references to this thread from the components holding it. How to find the Thread? Use Thread.getThreadGroup() and ThreadGroup.getThreadGroup() to go up to the root ThreadGroup(), and then use the iterate() functions to go through all threads.
