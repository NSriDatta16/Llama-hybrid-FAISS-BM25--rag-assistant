what's the best practice in PHP?

I would like the experts to give me some suggestions in organizing my code in PHP. Usually what i do is that i break the code into multiple files, and then include(); them all into a master file. this makes it easier for me to debug the code but the program gets slow. So, masters of programming, please suggest me something.
