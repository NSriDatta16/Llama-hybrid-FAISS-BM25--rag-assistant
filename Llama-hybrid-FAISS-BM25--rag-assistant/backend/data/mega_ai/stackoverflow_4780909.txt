Effective image switching on drag motion

I have 200 images on sdcard which represent a 360 view of an object frame-by-frame. I want to let the user 'rotate' the object by dragging the finger over the image. I have no problem with implementing the drag event, the problem is with loading and switching between images. Caching all of the images before displaying the Activity is impossible due to limited VM memory (the images are quite big, resolution is over SVGA) for the process. Loading images on drag event is ineffective - far from even acceptable. Has anyone faced such a problem or similar? Any help will be much appreciated.
