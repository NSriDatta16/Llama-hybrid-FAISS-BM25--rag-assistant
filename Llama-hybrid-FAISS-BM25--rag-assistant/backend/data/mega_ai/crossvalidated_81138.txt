What is the best technique for panel regressions (ols, fixed, between, random effects)?

I have panel data which includes American states (1-48) and years (1900-1917). All the variables are time-varying with one exception. This exception is time invariant and a three level categorical variable measuring regional designations for the states tested using two dummy variables. I also want look at interactions between one of the dummies and several of the time-varying variables. OLS estimates of this model indicate heteroscedasticity. So given the organization of the data my question is which of the panel techniques is best and why? I am using Stata. Thanks, RB
