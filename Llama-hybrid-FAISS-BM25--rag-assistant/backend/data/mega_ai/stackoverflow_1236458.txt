I could be wrong, but I think there may be inherent problems with using a mouseover or mouseenter event to control a vertical accordion -- unless you really know what the submenus are going to be like. The problem lies in the what-if: you have a long list of items in a submenu, and some short submenus or single menu items that follow below. like this: menu 1 2 a b c d e f 3 4 5 a b c So when you move from #2 to #3, #2 collapses, putting your pointer way down the list. You fire all the mouseover/out or mouseenter/leave events for #3, #4, #5... and maybe move past the whole menu... things can start bouncing around like crazy. Maybe the hoverIntent plugin can be made to work, but I think just using the mouse click is a more elegant solution. At least for an abstracted list, that is.
