Current RDBMS implementations are not very good at handling temporal data. That's one reason why maintaining separate journalling tables through triggers is the usual approach. (The other is that audit trails frequently have different use cases to regular data, and having them in separate tables makes it easier to manage access to them). Oracle does a pretty slick job of hiding the plumbing in its Total Recall product , but being Oracle it charges $$$ for this. Scott Bailey has published a presentation on temporal data in PostgreSQL. Alas it won't help you right now but it seems like some features planned for 8.5 and 8.6 will enable the transparent storage of time-related data. Find out more .
