A quick way to accomplish this is to run SQL Profiler, and then "group" your trace by TextData. Go into your Trace Properties Under the Events Selection tab, click on Organize Columns... Click on TextData, and move it up to the "Groups" area. You may also only want to watch specific events, like SQL Batch Completed. If I remember, that will give you durations and other handy stats to group/filter by.
