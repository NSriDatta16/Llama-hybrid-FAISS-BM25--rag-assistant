I don't know the SVM lingo but it sounds like you want to do kernel discrimnation. D. J. Hand has a good book on it. Basically you use the kernel method to estimate the class conditional densities. Then you apply the Bayes rule as if the estimated densities were the actual ones. What is best with respect to a kernel function is not usually important although there are assumptions that lead to a theoretical best kernel. But what really matters is the bandwidth. However it is sometimes hard to tell what is too small leading to a density that is too rough versus too large which leads to a density that is too smooth. The book that I think provides the clearest explanation of probability density estimation is Bernie Silverman's book. Check it out if you don't follow what I ahve told you.
