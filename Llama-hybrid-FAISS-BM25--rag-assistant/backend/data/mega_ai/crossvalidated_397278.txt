Beta estimates of logistic regression

I am trying to predict the likelihood of violent incidents as a function of time in hour in r. Its a binomial classification problem. glm(formula = "violent ~ Timehr", family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = incidents). Here are beta estimates along with significance level. Time0 is taken as reference level. So the rate of violent incidents goes up significantly at Time1 relative to Time0 by 0.4388 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.5167 0.1414 -10.728 But on plot it is at time0 when violent crimes are at its peak and based on model summary interpretation is at Time1 it goes up as compared to Time0. Am I interpreting the two output model summary and plot correctly?
