hmm. your code little buggy. first i see that you have div OUTSIDE of body tag. try to validate your code. anyway you can change the space weebven lines in the same paragraph with : p {line-height:0.7em} this creates a 7/10 line height of the font size. if you want to decrease space between paragrapsh you shold change the margin|padding of the paragraphs. p{margin:0 91px 0 37px;padding:0 43px 0 19px}
