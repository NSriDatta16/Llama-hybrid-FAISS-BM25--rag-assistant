Sql = how to calculate the return vector with a time series of prices?

I have a table which has columns of price and date , ordered by the ascending dates. I need to calculate from this a return vector where return = price ( i) / price ( i- 1) . The time is not time based, which means that one record can be at 9h34, the next at 9h35, then 9h40 etc... I have found the following topic: SQL Syntax for calculating results of returned data but in Oracle I can't use order by in a subquery, could you please help me?
