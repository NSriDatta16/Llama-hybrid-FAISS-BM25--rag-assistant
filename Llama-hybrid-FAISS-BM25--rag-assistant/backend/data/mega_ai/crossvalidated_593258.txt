In order to apply Bayesian analysis (or indeed, any other method of inference) you have to have something unknown in the problem that you want to infer from your observed data. Your question is not very clear about this part, but I'm going to consider the case where it is unknown whether or not the shape-information $X$ was given and you observed the outcome of $Y$ . (If this is not unknown then your problem does not appear to have any unknown parameter, in which case statistical inference is not needed at all.) This would encapsulate the situation of a third-party who does not know if you had the shape-information or not, but observes whether or not you select a red ball. In this case $X$ is your unknown parameter and the probability of selecting a red ball is: $$p(Y=1 | X=x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{100} & & \text{if } x = 0, \\[12pt] \frac{1}{80} & & \text{if } x = 1. \\ \end{cases}$$ Under a Bayesian analysis we would set some prior probability that the shape-information was present, which we can denote as $\pi \equiv \mathbb{P}(X=1)$ . Applying Bayes' rule then gives the posterior probabilities: $$\begin{align} \mathbb{P}(X=1|Y=0) &= \frac{\mathbb{P}(Y=0|X=1) \cdot \pi}{\mathbb{P}(Y=0|X=1) \cdot \pi + \mathbb{P}(Y=0|X=0) \cdot (1-\pi)} \\[6pt] &= \frac{\tfrac{79}{80} \cdot \pi}{\tfrac{79}{80} \cdot \pi + \tfrac{99}{100} \cdot (1-\pi)} \\[6pt] &= \frac{395 \cdot \pi}{395 \cdot \pi + 396 \cdot (1-\pi)} \\[10pt] &= \frac{395 \cdot \pi}{396 -\pi}, \\[12pt] \mathbb{P}(X=1|Y=1) &= \frac{\mathbb{P}(Y=1|X=1) \cdot \pi}{\mathbb{P}(Y=1|X=1) \cdot \pi + \mathbb{P}(Y=1|X=0) \cdot (1-\pi)} \\[6pt] &= \frac{\tfrac{1}{80} \cdot \pi}{\tfrac{1}{80} \cdot \pi + \tfrac{1}{100} \cdot (1-\pi)} \\[6pt] &= \frac{5 \cdot \pi}{5 \cdot \pi + 4 \cdot (1-\pi)} \\[10pt] &= \frac{5 \cdot \pi}{4 + \pi}. \\[6pt] \end{align}$$
