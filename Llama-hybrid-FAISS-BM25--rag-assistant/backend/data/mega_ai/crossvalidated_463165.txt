Please help - completely stuck on what model to use in analysing changes over time between groups

I am running an experiment in which I have three groups , and three treatments . The treatments are three different temperatures, and I am testing how they impact DNA degradation in water. I.e. Group 1: 4 degrees; group 2: 16 degrees; group 3: 27 degrees. Each run lasts for 5 days, and I sample the water once each day, at the same time. I end up with 5 data points/time series, and a trend of overall change. My question is: what model could I use to compare these three groups over time? I can't figure out how to fit the 5 time-series in, with any model. Would it be ANOVA-RM? Or could I even use a linear regression? Thanks so much!
