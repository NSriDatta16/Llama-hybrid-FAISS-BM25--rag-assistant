Some (not all) system classes are already loaded before the pre-main method is invoked and your ClassFileTransformer is added. If you want to transform these classes as well, you can invoke something like Instrumentation#retransformClasses(Instrumentation#getAllLoadedClasses()) after adding your ClassFileTransformer. Note, you have to use Instrumentation#addTransformer(ClassFileTransformer, true) to indicate that your transformer supports retransformation of classes.
