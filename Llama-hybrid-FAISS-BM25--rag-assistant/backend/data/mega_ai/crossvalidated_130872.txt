Does the method of computing feature weights for linear kernel SVM also works for radial Kernel SVM?

I searched for how to find feature weights and found this stackoverflow answer . It gives the following equation to get the weights: w = t(model$coefs) %*% model$SV The answer mentions that the method is for SVM with linear kernel. Can I use the same equation for radial ? Why or Why not?
