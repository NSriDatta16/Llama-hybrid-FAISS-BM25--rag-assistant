wget -r --directory-prefix=/path/to/save/to -A jpg www.example.com/path/to/image/directory All from the wget manual The -A argument allows you to specify the file name suffixes that you care about (there's also a similar -R to exclude files): -r is recursive retrieval, so it will go into subdirectories. --directory-prefix=/path specifies where to save to. And the -A flag, I'll cut a snippet from the manual: -A acclist --accept acclist -R rejlist --reject rejlist Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to accept or reject (see Types of Files). Note that if any of the wildcard characters, ‘*’, ‘?’, ‘[’ or ‘]’, appear in an element of acclist or rejlist, it will be treated as a pattern, rather than a suffix.
