you can take a weighted average of the ranges given by the doctors to give an overall range. If half the doctor say 40-60% and the other half say 60-80%, you can be sure that 50-70% of the patients overall have the condition. I hope the math is obvious enough with this simple example. you can use middle values of the range if you declare so, but this may just as well be reason for more confusion.
