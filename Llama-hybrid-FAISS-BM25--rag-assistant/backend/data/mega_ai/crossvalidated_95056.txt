Well, I don't know about SVM. But with Random Forest you got at least two options. Random Forest is composed from trees and in every tree at terminal node (leaf) you can calculate so called leaf statistics,that is - number of covered instances / number of misclassified instances. Or better number of correctly classified instances / number of covered instances. That could be your confidence for one tree in Random Forest. For the final confidence for whole forest you can calculate average of this score from all trees that classified particular instance correctly. I think this way it is calculated in Weka and Rapidminer. The second option is easier, simply take ratio of number of trees that classified instance correctly / total number of trees as confidence. I think there are other ways, original (Breiman's) algorithm has so called "out of bag error" - OOB and I think little more error estimates of individual trees that you probably can use in confidence calculation. Sorry, I would post this as a comment, since I did't say a word about SVM, but I don't have enough credits to post comments and I thought that it may be helpful to you.
