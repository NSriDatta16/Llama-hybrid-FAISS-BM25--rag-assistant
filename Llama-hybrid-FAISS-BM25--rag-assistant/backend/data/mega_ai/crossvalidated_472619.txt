Calculating F-Score using LOOCV

I am a machine learning novice and currently evaluating my decision tree model using the LOOCV. From my research I know that the accuracy can be calculated using LOOVC however I was wondering if it is ok to calculate the f_score as well. The code I wrote for this is below: for train_index, test_index in loo.split(loo_X): X_train, X_test = loo_X.iloc[train_index], loo_X.iloc[test_index] y_train, y_test = loo_y.iloc[train_index], loo_y.iloc[test_index] clf.fit(X_train, y_train) y_predict = clf.predict(X_test) f_score.append(f1_score(y_test, y_predict, zero_division=1)) score.append(accuracy_score(y_test, y_predict) * 100) print(np.array(f_score).mean()) print(np.array(score).mean()) Update y_test_all = [] y_predict = [] for train_index, test_index in loo.split(loo_X): X_train, X_test = loo_X.iloc[train_index], loo_X.iloc[test_index] y_train, y_test = loo_y.iloc[train_index], loo_y.iloc[test_index] y_test_all.append(y_test) clf.fit(X_train, y_train) y_predict.append(clf.predict(X_test)) print(f1_score(y_test_all, y_predict, zero_division=1))
