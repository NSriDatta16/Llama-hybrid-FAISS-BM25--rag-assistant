When estimating the variance of normal distribution with known mean $\mu$ using conjugate inverse gamma prior , the model is $$ X \sim \mathrm{Normal}(\mu, \sigma^2) \\ \sigma^2 \sim \mathrm{IG}(\alpha, \beta) $$ So we assume an inverse gamma prior parametrized by $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for $\sigma^2$. When we observe some data $x_1,\dots,x_n$ we can update our prior , to get posterior distribution of $\sigma^2$ and since inverse gamma is a conjugate prior , the update has a simple closed-form solution. The updated parameters become $$ \alpha' = \alpha + \frac{n}{2}, \qquad \beta' = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2}{2} $$ and the posterior distribution of $\sigma^2$ is inverse gamma parametrized by $\alpha'$ and $\beta'$. So by updating the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters you already estimated the distribution of $\sigma^2$. If you want to obtain a point estimate of $\sigma^2$, then you can calculate mean $\tfrac{\beta'}{\alpha'-1}$ or mode $\tfrac{\beta'}{\alpha'+1}$ of it's posterior distribution. What you were trying to do, is you were trying to calculate the variance of $\sigma^2$, that is certainly not it's point estimate. Check also Bayesian updating with conjugate priors using the closed form expressions and Bayesian updating with new data for similar questions.
