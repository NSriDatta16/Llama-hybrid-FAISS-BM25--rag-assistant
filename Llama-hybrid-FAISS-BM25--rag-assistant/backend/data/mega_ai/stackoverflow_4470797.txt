You can cast the PreviousPage object to the type of the previous page if it exposes public properties and methods that are going to be of use to you. However this isn't the same instance of the page that you created during the previous request. Any properties of then page that you set during the previous request will no longer be set. One of the downsides to the webforms model is it encourages you to think that web programming preserves state from one request to the next, when in fact it doesn't.
