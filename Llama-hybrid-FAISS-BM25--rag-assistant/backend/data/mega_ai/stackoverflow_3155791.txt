User agent or daemon?

I am writing driver to a HID device. The driver opens HID device in exclusive access mode. This driver should run for all user. So it should be either User agent or daemon. In driver I use some CoreGraphics API's which is under ApplicationService framework but Technote say's daemon won't get access to ApplicationService framework. So I can go For User Agent , but i don't know what is the behavior of User Agent when Fast User Switching is done. Could you please suggest in which direction I should go? Regards Devara Gudda Edit: The CoreGraphics framework is used to post Events.
