Regarding the convergence assessment on Markov chain monte carlo (MCMC)

During studying the convergence assessment on Markov Chain Monte Carlo, I once read the following statement: A slowly converging sampler may be indistinguishable from one that will never converge(e.g., due to nonidentifiability)! How to understand this statement? Thanks!
