Orange Biolab custom widget learner input

I was able to install the demo widget in Orange 3.9.1 and made it work with these learners Naive bayes Logistic regression In other words I was able to connect the nodes to the newly installed "Learning curve A" widget. This is the catch: Those two were the only I was able to connect. For example, I can't connect the tree learner or the random forest learnear. You can see what I mean from the picture below. Find here the source of the demo widget In the tutorial you can see other learners are connected successfully. Any idea why I can't connect the other learners?
