I was wondering why people would code in VB6 instead of C++ or how they rank in different areas. VB6 is a dead language. It was a Microsoft proprietary language.The VB6 IDE is no longer supported but VB6 applications are supported for at least the lifetime of Windows 8. Most (with many changes) of the syntax lives on in VB.NET (another proprietary language). In addition to the syntax, VB.NET and VB6 share the idea of "canned programming", where the developer just combines existing building blocks to create small applications very easily. VB6 introduced a large number of innovative techniques for this. It became known as RAD, Rapid Application Development or Rabid Application Development , depending on who you ask. The problem with RAD, that it doesn't scaleâ€¦ Probably you looked at a very old web site. C++ is a general programming language standardized by ISO. There are also a great many other general programming languages, and many of them are also standardized. In addition there are general programming languages like Java that are not standardized by some international standards organization, but have sufficient heavy backing that it's almost as if they are open languages, in spite of being technically proprietary. Going into more details comparing the languages serves no useful purpose. You might read up on the old C versus Pascal debates to see why (these debates got pretty heated, so called language wars , but resulted in some classic papers such as Brian Kernighan's "Why Pascal is not my favorite language" ).
