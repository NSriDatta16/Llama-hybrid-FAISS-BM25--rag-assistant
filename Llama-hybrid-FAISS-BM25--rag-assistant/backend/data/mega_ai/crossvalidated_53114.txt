The null hypothesis is generally done so that you make an assumption that there's "no-difference." When you make the assumption that H0:mean Here is a blog-like article on the null hypothesis: http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/stathyptesting.html These kinds of problems though are naturally suited in a bayesian environment. There's a great light bulb example in Bayesian Reliability ( http://books.google.com/books/about/Bayesian_Reliability.html?id=GIhbskry6NYC ), where a manufacturer makes a claim about light bulb lifetimes. The skeptic students grab some light bulbs test them, and combine the manufacturers claim with their new test data to measure the chances the manufacturer was right. In the same suite, you could measure how likely it is the mean By doing that you've gotten rid of the H0,HA approach. However it's much more complex to do. Good luck.
