funny thing: I stumbled in your question while looking for a tool chain to do it the other way round (developing in MRI Ruby, deploying with JRuby). Of course you can not use any Java classes and internals, but this for sure is obvious to you. According to my results thus far you shouldn't encounter any process structural issues, because MRI Ruby adheres to the shared nothing principle whereas your requests in the development app share the VM at least. Maybe to be shure you should hae a look at http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/DifferencesBetweenMriAndJruby and read it in a reverse sense, especially the "Native Endian is Big Endian" paragraph when un-/packing Strings or Arrays.
