In .NET large objects go on the large object heap which is not compacted. Large is everything above 85,000 bytes. When you grow your lists they will probably become larger than that and have to be reallocated once you cross the current capacity. Rellocation means that they are very likely put at the end of the heap. So you end up with a very fragmented LOH and lots of memory usage. Update : If you initialize your lists with the required capacity (which you can determine from the DB I guess) then your memory consumption should go down a bit.
