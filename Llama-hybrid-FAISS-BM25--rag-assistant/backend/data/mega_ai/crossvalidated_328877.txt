Trying a short non-technical answer. Univariate time series models like AR (or ARMA) for stationary time series try to autoproject the future of the series from its past. Thas is, your projections only comes from the history of the series. That may be fine, maybe you do not have any other information on other variables. But maybe you have some other time series (measured at the same points in time), as an example inflation, wages and unemployment. Now, certainly, say wages probably do depend some on unemployment, with low unemployment the employers are competing for workers and need to pay more. So, maybe, the time dynamics of these series do involve all three at once, and if that is true we might make better forecasts of, say, unemployment if we take into account also wages and inflation. That lead to VAR models. To see if it is worth it, build first some univariate time series models and calculate some measure of prediction quality. Then you can use that as a baseline for your VAR model. I am sure other reasons can be given, econometricians use such models to test hypothesis about the economy, but I have no experience with such use.
