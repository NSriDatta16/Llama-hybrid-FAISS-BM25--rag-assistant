How to fit the correct multilevel (logistic) regression?

I want to study the link between hospital competition and mortality. The competition a hospital faces is measured by the Herfindalh-Hirschman index (HHI). So I want to know if a hospital's HHI is lower (that is, if it faces more competitors) if its mortality decreases. I have three types of variables. Patient-level variables (age, gender, diagnosis...), hospital-level variables such as the HHI (The Predictor), the public or private status of the hospital, etc., and variables related to the patient's area of residence (Social Disadvantage Index of the patient's municipality of residence). I therefore decided to do a 2-level logistic regression. The outcome (mortality=yes/no) as well as all other variables at the patient level are level 1 variables. The variables at the hospital level are level 2 variables. I now ask myself the question: what level should the variables at the area-level be? Should they also be level 2 variables like the hospital-level variables, knowing that the hospitals where patients are treated and the municipalities where patients live are not the same kind of clusters and that a given patient belongs to both kinds of clusters at the same time. Or should there be a hierarchy between hospitals and the patient's area of residence? Finally, I don't know if I should do a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model (with only a random intercept or with a random intercept and slope). Note that I have hundreds of municipalities (areas) and hundreds of hospitals. Hundreds or even thousands of patients in each municipality and each hospital.
