Filter and sort music info on Google App Engine

I've enjoyed building out a couple simple applications on the GAE, but now I'm stumped about how to architect a music collection organizer on the app engine. In brief, I can't figure out how to filter on multiple properties while sorting on another. Let's assume the core model is an Album that contains several properties, including: Title Artist Label Publication Year Genre Length List of track names List of moods Datetime of insertion into database Let's also assume that I would like to filter the entire collection using those properties, and then sorting the results by one of: Publication year Length of album Artist name When the info was added into the database I don't know how to do this without running into the exploding index conundrum. Specifically, I'd love to do something like: Albums.all().filter('publication_year I know that's not possible, but what's the workaround? This seems like a fairly general type of application. The music albums could be restaurants, bottles of wine, or hotels. I have a collection of items with descriptive properties that I'd like to filter and sort. Is there a best practice data model design that I'm overlooking? Any advice?
