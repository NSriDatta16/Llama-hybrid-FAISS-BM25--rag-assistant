Perhaps an RNN can solve this "order doesn't matter" problem. Consider the task of image captioning which has been successfully implemented by Stanford and Google. Now consider that an image might have multiple equally correct solutions, "dog playing with cat" or "cat playing with dog". I believe using an RNN (recurrent neural network) to spit out the text is the key to getting around this, because the RNN knows that if it already said "dog playing with" the next word should be "cat", and vice versa for "cat playing with" -> dog. http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/cvpr2015.pdf
