How to handle features which are not always available?

I have a feature in my feature vector that is not always available respectively sometimes (for some samples) it makes no sense to use it. I feed a sklearn MLPClassifier with this feature vector. Does the neural network learn by itself when the feature make sense to use for its decision or do I have to add a flag in the feature vector which says for example “1” if it makes sense or “0” if it does not make sense.
