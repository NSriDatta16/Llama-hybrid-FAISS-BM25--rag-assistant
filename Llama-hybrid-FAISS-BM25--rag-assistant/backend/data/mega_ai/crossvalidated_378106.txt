Each member of the bootstrap sample is selected randomly with replacement from the data set. If we were to sample without replacement, then every sample would simply be a re-ordering of the same data. But, as a consequence of replacement, the bootstrap samples differ in how many times they include each data point (which may be once, multiple times, or not at all). On average, ~63% of data points appear at least once in a given bootstrap sample.
