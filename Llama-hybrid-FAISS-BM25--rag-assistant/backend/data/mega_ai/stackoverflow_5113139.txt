Javascript, what does the 1 in slice(1) refer to in this program?

In this program, I understand (I think) that paragraph.charAT(0) = "%" checks whether the first character in paragraph is equal to %, i.e. the counting starts at 0, so charAT(0) is the first character However, in the line, paragraph.slice(1), what does the 1 refer to? Is it slicing off the first character?, which in this case will be at 0 position? function processParagraph(paragraph) { var header = 0; while (paragraph.charAt(0) == "%") { paragraph = paragraph.slice(1); header++; } return {type: (header == 0 ? "p" : "h" + header), content: paragraph}; } show(processParagraph(paragraphs[0]));
