erickson's answer is probably the one expected by whoever set this question. You could use each of the N machines as a bucket in a hashtable: for each string, (say string number i in sequence) compute a hash function on it, h. send the the values of i and h to machine number n for storage, where n = h % N. from each machine, retrieve a list of all hash values h for which more than one index was received, together with the list of indexes. check the sets of strings with equal hash values, to see whether they're actually equal. To be honest, though, for 10 billion strings you could plausibly do this on 1 PC. The hashtable might occupy something like 80-120 GB with a 32 bit hash, depending on exact hashtable implementation. If you're looking for an efficient solution, you have to be a bit more specific what you mean by "machine", because it depends how much storage each one has, and the relative cost of network communication.
