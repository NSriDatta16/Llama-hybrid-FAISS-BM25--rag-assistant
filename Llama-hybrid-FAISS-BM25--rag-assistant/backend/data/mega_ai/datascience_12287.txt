How to dive into data science quickly?

I'm new here - I hope this kind of question is legit. I have a background in mathematics - my field is probability theory, where I am quite strong (top 2% of University). I have little experience in programming but I guess I get things done once I know what is out there (i.e. what program languages can do for me). I want to learn more about data science and dive into the field particular when it comes to programming. I'd also like to get going on manageable yet interesting data science related tasks (building some "usefull" statistics skill might be desirable, too). I know kaggle.com are there other places I could look into? Any projects I might take on? Thanks a lot. :)
