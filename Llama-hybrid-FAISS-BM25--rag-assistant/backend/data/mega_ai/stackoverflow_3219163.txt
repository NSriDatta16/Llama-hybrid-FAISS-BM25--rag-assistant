How to increase DatePicker height in ipad?

How do I increase DatePicker height in iPad? Is this possible? And also one more doubt is, is it possible to increase the UITableView vertical scrollbar is more visible? (i.e I want to increase the vertical scrollbar width). Every time I load the tableview data, the first time the scrollbar is not visible. When I drag the tableview only it shows the vertical scroll bar. I want to set vertical scrollbar as default when I load my tableview data. Can any one help me? Thanks in advance
