Statement-modifiers make ruby behave more like English, which is nice: if it rains, stay home stay home if it rains I'd advise you to use the form that seems the most natural and elegant to you. If in doubt, read the statement out loud in both forms. Personally, I tend to only use statement-modifiers for short statements such as return :nope if input.nil? -- for longer or more complicated statements, it can take the reader longer to grasp, because the eyes only cover a certain amount of space and so someone would only read the modifier on second glance.
