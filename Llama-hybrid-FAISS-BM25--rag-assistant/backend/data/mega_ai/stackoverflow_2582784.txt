I'd consider using the at program to run the programs (instead of using cron directly, because cron really only works on a fixed schedule). I'd also create a program (I'd use Perl; you'll use Ruby) to schedule a random delay until the next time the job is executed. You'll need to consider whether it is crucial that the job is executed 'x' times in 24 hours, and how the randomness should work. What is the range of variation in times. For example, you might have a cron job run at midnight plus 7 minutes, say, which then schedules 'x' at jobs spaced evenly through the day, with a random deviation in the schedule of Â±30 minutes. Or you might prefer an alternative that schedules a the jobs with an average gap of 24/x hours and a random deviation of some amount. The difference is that the first mechanism guarantees that you get x events in the day (unless you make things too extreme); the second might sometimes only get x-1 events, or x+1 events, in 24 hours.
