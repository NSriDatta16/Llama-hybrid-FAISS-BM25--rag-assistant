Does normal linear regression in R overcome confounding?

When I run a linear regression model or logistic regression model in R like this lm(outcome ~ treatment + covariate) does the + covariate part help control for the effect of that covariate on both treatment and outcome or just on outcome? If it doesn't what exactly is this doing because people are telling me this controls for confounding, but I don't see how? if it doesn't control for likelihood of treatment then we need to do things like propensity score matching or IPTW, inverse probability treatment weights, at least to my understanding
