Validating logistic regression - formulas needed for simulation

This is related to a data classification problem having a Boolean output variable. Summary: Once I perform the ML task using Logistic regression, I get the required coefficients. I use the multivariate model $\theta_0 + \theta_1X_1 + .. = Y$. Having obtained the $\theta$'s, am looking for some straightforward formulas that I can use to get the following: For the coefficients: Standard Error: I think it is $(X^TX)^{-1} * (X^TY)$. Please correct me if wrong Wald Stats: Is it square of $\text{Coefficient} / \text{StdError}$? 95 %CI: Is it $(\text{lower, upper}) = (\text{coefficient}_i - 1.96 SE_i,~ \text{coefficient}_i + 1.96 SE_i)$? p-value and significance For the whole model Null model -2 Log likelihood Full model -2 Log Likelihood Chi-squared DF Significance level ROC Curve Area under the curve (AUC) I am new to ML and trying out C# based simulation, so any vector-based formulas would be highly appreciated.
