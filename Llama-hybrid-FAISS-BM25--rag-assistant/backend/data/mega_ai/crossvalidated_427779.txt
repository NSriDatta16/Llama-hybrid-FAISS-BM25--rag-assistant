When testing for differences between two groups or samples, what is the best approach in concluding statistical significance? This is completely contextual. If you want guaranteed frequency properties (assuming the assumptions of each procedure are not grossly violated), then I would say a Frequentist approach is best. If you have small data and good prior information about the effects or baseline values, then I would say Bayesian methods are best. Depends on what you want. The orthodox approach is to take a t-test or an Anova when there is more than 1 factor to consider. Assuming the outcome is normally distributed. This isn't the case for binary outcomes (though I'm sure you could make a good argument for ANOVA). But what can you do after obtaining these estimates to say the two groups are or are not statistically significant? Ah, now this is a different question all together. If you want to evaluate if two groups are not different, you might be interested in a "non-inferiority" test.
