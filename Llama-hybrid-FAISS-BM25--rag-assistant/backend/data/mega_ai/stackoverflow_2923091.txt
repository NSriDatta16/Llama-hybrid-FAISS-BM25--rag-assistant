You can disable the ETAG middleware using the condition decorator . That will get your response to stream back over HTTP. You can confirm this with a command-line tool like curl . But it probably won't be enough to get your browser to show the response as it streams. To encourage the browser to show the response as it streams, you can push a bunch of whitespace down the pipe to force its buffers to fill. Example follows: from django.views.decorators.http import condition @condition(etag_func=None) def stream_response(request): resp = HttpResponse( stream_response_generator(), content_type='text/html') return resp def stream_response_generator(): yield " \n" for x in range(1,11): yield " %s \n" % x yield " " * 1024 # Encourage browser to render incrementally time.sleep(1) yield " \n"
