Looking for a tool that will let me store and insert text fragments (code snippets) into Visual Studio

I have a demo coming up and would rather not type in front of the audience. I figured I could put the code snippets some place and put them in as I go. Now I know I can use Notepad (or pretty much any other text editor) for the purpose but I have a feeling there's something nicer out there. Anybody have any ideas for me? Ideally I'm looking for something like the Visual Studio toolbox where I can drag text in to set it up and then drag it back into the IDE when I need it. I tried just dragging the text to the toolbox. It seemed to work but then I closed Visual Studio, put my laptop into standby and powered it back up and everything was gone! Maybe its a VS bug (or a Win 7 bug) or maybe this is how its supposed to work. Either way, I'm looking for something a bit more robust.
