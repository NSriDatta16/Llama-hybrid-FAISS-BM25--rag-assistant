ARIMA flattens out on one order and works perfect on another

I am implementing an ARIMA model on a time series data. I have confirmed that the data is stationary with the adfuller test. I plotted my ACF and PACF graph as below with a lag of 40. Here, I see the PACF plot for AR order and the p value looks like 8. I see the ACF graph for the order of the MA model and the q value looks like 5. Since there is no differencing, the d value is 0. so with p=8, d=0 and q=5, I fit and predict the model but the prediction flattens out after a while. I use the grid search method to find the minimal AIC score and find that the orders should be 3, 0, 5 for p, d and q respectively. I fit this model and predicted the results as below and it seems to be a really good fit. Orange line is for the previous model and the green line is for the newer order. My question is, have I interpreted the PACF and ACF plots incorrectly? Because, number of lollipops out of the confidence boundary are as mentioned above but still the data does not fit correctly. If not, why does the prediction flatten out after fitting well for a small subset of the data?
