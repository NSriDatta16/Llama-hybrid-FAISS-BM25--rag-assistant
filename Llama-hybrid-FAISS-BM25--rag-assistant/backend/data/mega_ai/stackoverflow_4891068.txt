Using Custom Shaders in WorldWind Java / JOGL

or Creating an IR effect in WorldWind Java I need to emulate an infrared (IR) view in WorldWind, and I'm not sure about the best way to go about this. I should point out that I do not need to simulate IR (i.e. no heat maps) -- I just need to produce a reasonable facsimile of a black-and-white IR display. I have very limited graphics knowledge and no prior experience with OpenGL, JOGL, or WorldWind. Based on my research so far, it seems that the best approach is to use a custom shader. However, as far as I can tell, WorldWind provides no high-level shader support. I found the following relevant threads on a WorldWind forum, but I'm still not sure how to proceed: GLSL Shader support that renders tiles correctly Updating GLSL support with new JOGL Normal mapping (GLSL shader) GLSL fragment shader problem To clarify my question(s): How do I integrate a GLSL shader into a WorldWind application, if that is in fact the best approach? If not, how should I implement this effect?
