I am a bit confused with the description of your data: you said that you only have one factor? PCA is usually used when one has many variables and wants to reduce the data down to just a few (principal) components. You may want to consider looking at different perspectives of this plot. Notice you have PC1 plotted against PC2. Maybe if you looked at PC2 plotted against PC3 you might see some clustering. That said, there are lots of clustering techniques available in R, maybe you should consider those?
