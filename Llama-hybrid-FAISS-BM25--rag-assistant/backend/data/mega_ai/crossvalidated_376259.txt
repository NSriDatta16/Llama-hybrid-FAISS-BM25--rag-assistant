Penalize the intercept in lasso (L1) penalized logistic regression or not?

In logistic regression: $log(\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$ , let $x' = \frac{x-\bar{x}}{\sigma_x}$ , then in terms of the centered and scaled varaible $x'$ , $$ log(\frac{p(x')}{1-p(x')}) = \beta_0' + \beta_1'x' = \beta_0' - \frac{\beta_1'}{\sigma_x}\bar{x} + \frac{\beta_1'}{\sigma_x}x $$ Since $log(\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}) = log(\frac{p(x')}{1-p(x')})$ , then $$ \beta_1 = \frac{\beta_1'}{\sigma_x} \\ \beta_0 = \beta_0' - \frac{\beta_1'}{\sigma_x}\bar{x} = \beta_0' - \beta_1\bar{x} $$ (In logistic regression, intercept is the log odds only when other predictors are 0. ) Note the intercept $\beta_0'$ is not zero. But in the linear regression case, after centering and standardization, the intercept is 0, so there is no need to penalize the intercept. Questions: in the logistic regression case, do we need to penalize the intercept ( $\beta_0'$ ) after centering and scaling the data x?
