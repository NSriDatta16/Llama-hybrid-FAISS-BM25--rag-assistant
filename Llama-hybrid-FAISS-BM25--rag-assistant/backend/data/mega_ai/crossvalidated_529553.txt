Problems with plotting extremely wide confidence interval for odds ratio

I am having problems with preparing the forest plot for the logistic regression. I am comparing the effect of 3 treatments of complications. Here is the code that reproduces this: library(finalfit) library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) mydata $Method Method) explanatory = c("Method") dependent = c("Complications") mydata %>% or_plot(dependent, explanatory) Because Method2 does not lead to any complications, the OR confidence interval is extremely wide. I just want to shrink it for the plot to look reasonable. I have tried to use breaks like mydata %>% or_plot(dependent, explanatory, breaks=c(8e-135,0.1,1,100,5e+5)) but for some reason this does not work as well. If anybody knows how to make this plot look nice, please kindly let me know.
