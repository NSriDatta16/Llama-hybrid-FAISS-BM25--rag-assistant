From Technet , might be of use: If the name of an organizational unit contains a forward slash character (/), the system requires an escape character in the form of a backslash () to distinguish between forward slashes that separate elements of the canonical name and the forward slash that is part of the organizational unit name. The canonical name that appears in Active Directory Users and Computers properties pages displays the escape character immediately preceding the forward slash in the name of the organizational unit. For example, if the name of an organizational unit is Promotions/Northeast and the name of the domain is Reskit.com, the canonical name is displayed as Reskit.com/Promotions/Northeast
