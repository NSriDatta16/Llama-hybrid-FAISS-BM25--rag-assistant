I presume you are using the old command line IMP utility, rather than Datapump? IMP does not drop the existing table, nor does it clear out the existing data. If we set the flag IGNORE=Y then it will insert what data it can into the an extant table and report errors (duplicate keys) in the logfile. Here is the current table ... SQL> select * from t0; COL1 ---- rowA rowC SQL> ... and here is what I exported ... SQL> select * from t0; COL1 ---- rowA rowB SQL> An import with the default setting of IGNORE fails because the table exists but changing the flag succeeds: SQL> host Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600] (C) Copyright 1985-2001 Microsoft Corp.

In fact you should use Datapump anyway, because it is by-and-large much better utility. Find out more .
