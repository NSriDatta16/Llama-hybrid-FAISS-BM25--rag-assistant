Given your past experience with SQL and VBA I recommend building your first version in Excel using VBA so that you get something work as fast possible. Later you can migrate to C#. Creating GANT charts in Excel is easy, plus you can use your VBA/SQL skills to load/save data from your database. A google search for: excel gant charts Turned up lots of easy to follow samples. With VBA you can use ADO to access your database. To get user input you can create Forms in VBA or simply drop UI controls right on your Excel worksheet. The usability of Excel and VBA is perhaps not the best, but you will get a version 1.0 out the door, and sort out all your business requirements.
