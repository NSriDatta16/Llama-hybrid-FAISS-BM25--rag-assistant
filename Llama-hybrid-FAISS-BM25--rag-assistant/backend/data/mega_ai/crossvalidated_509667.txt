Standardisation in PCA: 'scaling' and 'sphering' and the covariance matrices of $\mathbf{X}_{\text{scale}}$ and $\mathbf{X}_{\Sigma}$

I'm currently studying standardisation in PCA. This primarily involves the generalised standardisation concepts of scaling and sphering : The scaled random vector and random sample are $$\mathbf{X}_{\text{scale}} = \Sigma_{\text{diag}}^{-1/2} (\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{\mu}) \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \mathbb{X}_{\text{scale}} = S_{\text{diag}}^{-1/2} (\mathbb{X} - \overline{\mathbf{X}})$$ The * sphered random vector and random sample are $$\mathbf{X}_\Sigma = \Sigma^{-1/2} (\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{\mu}) \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \mathbb{X}_\Sigma = S^{-1/2} (\mathbb{X} - \overline{\mathbf{X}})$$ This is further illustrated in this image: I am then told the following: Let $\mathbf{X} \sim (\mathbf{\mu}, \Sigma)$ , and assume that $\Sigma$ has rank $d$ . Write $\mathbf{X}_{\text{scale}}$ and $\mathbf{X}_{\Sigma}$ for the scaled and sphered random vectors. These vectors have the following properties: The expected values of $\mathbf{X}_{\text{scale}}$ and $\mathbf{X}_\Sigma$ are $\mathbf{0}$ ; the covariance matrix of $\mathbf{X}_{\text{scale}}$ is the matrix of correlation coefficient $R$ ; and the covariance matrix of $\mathbf{X}_{\Sigma}$ is the identity matrix $\mathbf{I}$ . I am fine with claim 1., but I'm struggling to see how claims 2. and 3. are true. So how are claims 2. and 3. are true?
