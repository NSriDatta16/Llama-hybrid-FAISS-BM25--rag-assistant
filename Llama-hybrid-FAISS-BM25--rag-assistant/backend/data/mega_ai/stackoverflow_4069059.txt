Some hints: the case where the Tree is a Leaf is trivial the difference between BottomUp and TopDown seems to be whether you reverse the list of Layer s when the Tree is a Node you will have to recurse on the subtrees and combine the results somehow Edit: OK, let's concentrate on the first of these. The equation you have for this case is writeLayer Leaf x = [x] First, the Leaf x needs to be in parentheses, because it's a single Tree value. writeLayer (Leaf x) = [x] Second, the equation needs to reflect that writeLayer takes two parameters (as written above, it takes only one). With a Leaf value, we don't care which order the results are to be returned in --- we give the same answer either way --- but we still have to take the parameter. We use _ to signal that we don't care above the parameter and aren't going to use it. writeLayer (Leaf x) _ = [x] Thirdly, [x] is a (single element) list of Integer s --- but we are supposed to be returning a list of Layer s. I'm sure you can figure out how to fix this. Finally, pay attention to the error messages the computer gives you. Understand them.
