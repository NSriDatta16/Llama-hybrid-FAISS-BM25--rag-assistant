What is "Verbose" in scikit-learn package of Python?

What is "Verbose" in scikit-learn package of Python? In some models like neural network and svm we can set it's value to true. This is the documentation: verbose : bool, default: False Enable verbose output. Note that this setting takes advantage of a per-process runtime setting in libsvm that, if enabled, may not work properly in a multithreaded context. What is this option?
