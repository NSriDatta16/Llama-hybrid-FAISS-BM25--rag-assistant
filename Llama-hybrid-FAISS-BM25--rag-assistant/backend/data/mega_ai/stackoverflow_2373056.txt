Problem with Ruby mechanize and inheritance

I'm working with mechanize and having problems with inheritance when testing in a rails environment, using script/console. When I write like this: require 'rubygems' require 'mechanize' agent = WWW::Mechanize.new agent.get 'http://www.google.com' Everything works fine. But when I try to create a subclass of WWW::Mechanize like this: require 'rubygems' require 'mechanize' class Alfa I get the following error: NoMethodError: You have a nil object when you didn't expect it! The error occurred while evaluating nil.parse from /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/mechanize-0.9.3/lib/www/mechanize/page.rb:77:in `parser' Am I missing something? Thanks in advance
