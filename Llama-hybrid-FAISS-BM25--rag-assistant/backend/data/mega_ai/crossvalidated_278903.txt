Define $Y_i = \frac{X_i - \mu}{\sigma}$ which are i.i.d $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, and let $y = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$. Then, noting that $dy = \frac{dx}{\sigma}$ gives us that the above integral is equivalent to $$ \int_{\min Y}^{\max Y} \frac{e^{-\frac{y^2}{2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}dy $$ Hence, there is no dependency on $\sigma$ nor $\mu$. Intuitively speaking, the $\min{X}$ and $\max{X}$ encapsulate the same probability, regardless of moving the average or spreading the function out more (as they move along and spread out the same way).
