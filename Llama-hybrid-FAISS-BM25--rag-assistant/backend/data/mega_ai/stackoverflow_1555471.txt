What tools are available to test SQL statement performance?

In the never-ending search for performance (and my own bludgeoning experience), I've learnt a few things that could drag down the performance of a SQL statement. Obsessive Compulsive Subqueries Disorder Doing crazy type conversions (and nest those into oblivion) Group By on aggregate functions of said crazy type conversions Where fldID in (select EVERYTHING from my 5mil record table) I typically work with MSSQL. What tools are available to test the performance of a SQL statement? Are these tools built in and specific to each type of DB server? Or are there general tools available?
