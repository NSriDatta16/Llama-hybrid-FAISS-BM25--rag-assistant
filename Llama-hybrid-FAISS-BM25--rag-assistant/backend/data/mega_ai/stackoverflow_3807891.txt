You can use the method described here in the Django docs. You grab your user based on the one-time-use key you supplied them and call login(request, user). The catch here is that you'll need to manually specify the authentication backend because you're not calling authenticate() first. from django.contrib.auth import login def my_view(request): // your user retrieval code ... user.backend='django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend' login(request, user)
