Cross-validation split for modelling data with timeseries behavior

Background: I have a dataset that is generated every month (it is similar with card data that contains card demography and transactions every month and new accounts can be added in the middle of data series). From those historical data, I need to build a classification model to predict a binary label for the next month. Question: Which better cross-validation split type that can be used to get a fair model score assessment (not bias and low variance)? To make it clear, lets take 15 months training data and needs to hypertune the model with 5-folds cross-validation split. I have two options below, but it is ok if you have other. 1. Time series with leave one out type fold 1 : training [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10], test [11] fold 2 : training [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11], test [12] fold 3 : training [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12], test [13] fold 4 : training [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13], test [14] fold 5 : training [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14], test [15] 2. Time Series with leave rest out type fold 1 : training [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10], test [11 12 13 14 15] fold 2 : training [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11], test [12 13 14 15] fold 3 : training [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12], test [13 14 15] fold 4 : training [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13], test [14 15] fold 5 : training [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14], test [15] Thanks for your answer, will appreciate so much any respond.
