Is train/test-Split in unsupervised learning of neural network necessary?

I am using autoencoder for anomaly detection in warranty data. It is unsupervised. I calculate the reconstruction error by the model and the records with high reconstruction error value is considered as an anomaly. I would like to know, if it is necessary to train/test-split the data. Any help is much appreciated!
