I also incurred the same problem randomForest function giving different values for different passes. As Zach mentioned: random forest algorithm randomly creates multiple subsets of the data, the end results might vary slightly for different passes. To overcome this, I simple ran set.seed(500) every time before a new pass, so as to reset the seed to 500 and it is giving me exact mirror results. I hope it helped.
