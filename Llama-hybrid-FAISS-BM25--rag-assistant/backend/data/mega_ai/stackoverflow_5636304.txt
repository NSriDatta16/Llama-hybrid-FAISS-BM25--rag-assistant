I tend to agree with @Lior Kogan, in that upgrading for the sake of it is not something that you should be arguing with management about. In fact, there are good arguments for not upgrading: if you've got a stable platform, why introduce potential instability? if we upgrade this, will it force us to spend more money upgrading other things? will it mean we have to force our customers to upgrade as well? All these things are big negatives to a business, and make a good case for maintaining the status-quo. However, upgrades are necessary at some point. There are a lot of very frustrated web developers out there who are cursing businesses worldwide for taking the above aproach to Internet Explorer v6: While those businesses were arguably doing the right thing for some time, they've now passed the point where it is difficult to defend staying still. It may not be the case for you now, but eventually the same will hold true for a .NET upgrade. The argument here would be that the old version of the technology is obsolete: it is no longer supported by the vendor, particularly with security fixes. it is no longer sold by the vendor, making it hard to increase your number of users. other technologies that we use rely on the newer version. our customers are asking us for features that can only be delivered using the new version. If any one of those points holds true than you may have a good argument for an upgrade that will win over the management. If not, you may have to stick it out.
