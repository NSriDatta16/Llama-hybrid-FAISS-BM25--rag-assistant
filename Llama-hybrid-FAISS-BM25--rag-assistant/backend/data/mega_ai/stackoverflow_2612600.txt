Is there support for Git within most 3rd party applications (other than Eclipse..) yet? Not for many of the ones I've seen. Git is probably not going to be replacing SVN completely--they are different enough that each may have their role for some time. Anyway to answer the overall question: no, it's not ready for prime time in the business world. Perhaps it will be some day, in some cases (probably not all cases), but of course it's still too new--many people have not even heard of it yet! Just the fact that you've been advised to do a presentation on it to get buy-in should be a red flag. If you go to devs nowadays and say you want to move to SVN, the only ones who won't immediately understand are the ones living under a rock, and who cares about them? Besides, newer is not always better. It takes time for this type of paradigm shift to be confirmed as an improvement--look at the backlash on Maven over time. Don't be so fast to jump ship from a proven solution, not when your job and reputation is at stake--if Git doesn't work out, you wouldn't look good recommending it. At least with a product like SVN you have the fact that it's NOT new, it's definitely proven over time, and even if there are problems the recommendation can't be questioned too harshly because it's still the default answer from most devs. It's harder attacking advice to switch to an industry standard than a switch to something new and non-standard. Not the answer you wanted to hear (it appears you've already made your decision), but ask yourself if the benefits (and branches are something to be avoided, not encouraged) really outweigh the risks.
