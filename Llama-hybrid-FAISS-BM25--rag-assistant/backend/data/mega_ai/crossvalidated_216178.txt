Real world datasets are rarely deterministic. In the example you've provided above your neural network will learn that when it sees 01101 there will be a 50% probability of 0 and a 50% probability of 1. Deleting the records will make your neural network overconfident, assuming the records were not accidentally mislabeled by whomever gathered the dataset.
