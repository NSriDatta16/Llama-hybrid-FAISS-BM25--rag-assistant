Recover Magento checkout details where customer goes to Paypal and never returns

When using Paypal Standard or Paypal Express, customers are directed to the Paypal website to either complete the sale, or sign in to their Paypal accounts to verify payment, respectively. There is a significant percentage of customers who do not complete the sale from that point. Magento reserves an Order Increment ID for these abandoned carts, and the sales_flat_quote_address table contains all the address details, however these don't appear in the Abandoned Carts report or anywhere else that I can see in the Admin. It would be helpful to be able to display the order details as the customer has already entered contact information in the Shipping/Billing steps of the checkout, and hence should be open to being contacted to reactivate the checkout. I'm looking for architectural suggestions on how to display these details and reduce the order leakage? Would a new Report be best, or a module that adds a node under the Sales menu. I don't have any experience in writing new Reports, and the Sales Grid/Views are quite complex... Thanks, Jonathan
