How do I add a remote Git repository to an Ubuntu Server?

I have created a Git repository on my Desktop machine (Windows 7) with: git init git add git commit -m "added my files" Now I have installed a new Ubuntu Server 10.10 on a machine on my LAN and installed OpenSSH. My home directory is /home/jonas and I created a directory ~/code/ to contain my projects. I can log in to the Ubuntu Server from Windows 7 with Putty. I installed Git on the server with sudo apt-get install git Adding a remote repository Now I want to add my Git repository on my Desktop to the Server. I tried to follow the instructions from Pragmatic Version Control Using Git . From my Desktop I run these commands: git remote add origin jonas@192.168.1.10/home/jonas/code/myproject.git git push origin master But I got this error message: fatal: 'jonas@192.168.1.180/home/jonas/code/myproject.git' does not appear to be a git repository fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly What is the problem? How do I create the remote repository? As PerfectlyNormal suggested, I added a : in the address. Now it worked better, and I had to type my password to the server, but then I got a similar error message: fatal: '/home/jonas/code/myproject.git' does not appear to be a git repository fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly Do I have to initialize a Git repository on the server before I can git push to it?
