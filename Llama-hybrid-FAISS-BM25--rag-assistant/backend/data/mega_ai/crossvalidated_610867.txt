There are also countless other methods to estimate survival functions in special scenarios. For example, there are multiple methods to adjust survival functions for confounders ( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.9681 ). You may also use a bayesian approach ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34548947/ ) and there are also extensions for time-varying variables ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12459796/ ) etc. Which method to use depends almost entirely on your situation.
