You might want to consider how REST-ful this is? i.e. see "Communicate statelessly" paragraph in " A Brief Introduction to REST "... "REST mandates that state be either turned into resource state, or kept on the client. In other words, a server should not have to retain some sort of communication state for any of the clients it communicates with beyond a single request." (or any of the other links on wikipedia for REST ) So in your case, the 'wave_id' is a sensible Resource to GET, but do you really want to store it in the SESSION? Surely memcached is your solution to cacheing the object Resource?
