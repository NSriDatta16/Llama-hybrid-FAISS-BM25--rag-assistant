Is it necessary to go through all the possibilities of the partitioning? No it's not necessary to go through every possibility of the partitioning. You may do repeated k-fold cross validation (it takes longer), but it's perfectly acceptable to do one iteration of k-fold CV. which one should we take to determine the optimal parameters? You can take the average of all k CV error rates to get your estimate of out-of-sample error. See this interesting analysis to answer most of your questions in more detail and with empirical evidence.
