Confidence interval for proportion assuming binomial distribution when observed proportion is exactly 1 (or 0)

I have a simulation (a set of 200 iterations) which I used to compute a confidence interval for average statistical power. In binomial approximation, I know that the standard error is computed as $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$ where $p$ is the success probability and $n$ is the sample size. As I mentioned before, my $n=200$ as 200 iterations. Assume that in some instance I got statistical power exactly equal to 1 (when averaged from 200 iterations) and it is clear that the standard error is equal to 0 (computed as $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{1(1-1)}{200}} = 0$ ), and hence the confidence interval is no longer an interval, but a point (which is 1). If I need to get a confidence interval where there is no overlap in lower limit and upper limit, can I use continuity correction (if this is not called so, what is it)? if yes, what will be the computational formula? reference(s)? I could not find a proper reference which is applicable for my case (when sample size is 200 range â€“ in case if there's any such constraint of sample size). ETA: As a community suggestion, I was given reference to a similar question posted earlier Confidence interval around binomial estimate of 0 or 1 , but I do not see it is helpful since the sample size is too small (typically less than 100 cannot be approximated normal). My case n=200, so I am not sure how to relate that response to my question. Plus I would appreciate references of a valid well-established method, and therefore, the quoted link will not provide answers to my question, though it looks similar.
