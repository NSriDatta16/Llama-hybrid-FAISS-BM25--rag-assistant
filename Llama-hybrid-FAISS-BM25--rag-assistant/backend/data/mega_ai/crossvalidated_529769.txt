Can vanilla NN model a moving Average (MA) process?

Let say I simulate an AR(1) process. We can easily model the data with a vanilla NN with a single neuron as it is about finding the linear relationship between $y$ and $y_{t-1}$ . Now, how about a MA(1)? Can a vanilla NN model that MA process? And if not why (w.r.t universal approximation theorem) and what kind of structure would you need?
