svn: module organization early in the development process

OK, I understand the trunk/tags/branches thingy for a repository with a single project. Now let's say I have a main project and a number of smaller auxiliary modules/ plugins / tools / scripts etc. During the early stages there's a lot of renaming, reorganization, etc., and some of them die an early death because they go nowhere. It doesn't make sense to me to stick a particular module into the trunk until the organization is pretty stable. (at which point copying to the trunk is "cheap" per the svn design) Where would be the best place to put small a module (say "FooModule") early in its development process? /branches/development/FooModule ? /development/FooModule ? /sandbox/modules/FooModule ? does anyone have experience organizing subversion repositories in a similar way? what has worked for you?
