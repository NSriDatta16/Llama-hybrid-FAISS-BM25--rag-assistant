Generally speaking, no, because all of the tabs within the browser window share the same cookies. One way to do it would be use multiple domain names all pointing at the same app. Each domain name would have its own set of cookies. You would need to have some way of switching to a new domain name after you open a new tab. How about, have a set of bookmark toolbar bookmarks, each corresponding to a different domain name. Control-click on the bookmark and it opens in a new tab. You could provide the users links in your navigation to the different domains that they can drag onto their toolbar. Depending on what browsers your users are using you could get even slicker - in some browsers Javascript window.open() opens a new tab. You could have the JS compute the new domain name before the window.open().
