What's the point in studying moderation effects if effect sizes are so small?

.002 is the median and 0.009 is the average moderation effect size in psychology, based on Aguinis et al. 2005 , Effect Size and Power in Assessing Moderating Effects of Categorical Variables: A 30 Year Review, J. Applied Psychology, 90 94-107. I mean, the effect is so small i can't not figure out how it could be of any interest...and the social world is also full of noise... I'm looking for ideas and suggestions. Thanks all in advance Edit: Thanks for the editing. I'm adding some context: Journals : All articles published from 1969 to 1998 in Journal of Applied Psychology (JAP), Personnel Psychology (PP), and Academy of Management Journal (AMJ). These journals were chosen for their methodological rigor and emphasis on theory; Inclusion criteria: (a) at least one MMR analysis was included as part of the study, (b) the MMR analysis included a continuous criterion, (c) the MMR analysis included a continuous predictor, and (d) the MMR analysis included a categorical moderator. (NB MMR= Moderated Multiple Regression) Final sample: "Computed effect sizes for the 261 MMR analyses for which sample size and predictor– criterion correlations across moderator based subgroups were available. We used X and Y variance information when available and assumed homogeneity of error variance for the MMR analyses for which this information was not available. In computing the construct-level effect sizes (i.e., based on error-free measures), we used reliability information when available and a value of .80 when this information was not available. In computing power, we used targeted f 2 values ranging from .001 to .35 to include a broad range of what can be considered critical effect sizes in applied psychology and management research and the sample sizes reported in each published study." 2° EDIT: Thank @ all the ppl who have answered and commented. I'm closing the question. 3° Edit: Answered Thank you all
