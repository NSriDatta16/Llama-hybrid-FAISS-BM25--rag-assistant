i find it a good practice. i don't know if many users pay any attention into it, but as a developer, the more i see it on sites, the more i feel compelled to use the standards. i find it as a means of showing each other that we find this important. don't see any negatives, and coding standard-wise has made my work much easier over the years. as for how- i use the standard w3c logo, but i've seen many sites who styled their own version.
