Logit - probit regression

I was running regression of - determinants of acceptance into a social science college. I found this unrelated paper (Screenshot of relevant page attached herewith). Here, they have computed logit and probit regression at probabilities =0.5 and 0.8 and compared it with linear probability regression. I was wondering can we do the same in stata? (Can we run logistic regression in stata at a particular probability say 0.5) I tried to look this problem over the internet but couldn't find any useful resource on this.
