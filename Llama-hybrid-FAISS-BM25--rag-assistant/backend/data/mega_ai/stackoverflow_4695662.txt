1) Store the average values for each player in an arraylist. So that when you calculate the average you just throw it in the list and have it already. ArrayList arrayList = new ArrayList(); arrayList.add(new Integer(average)); then access the list in your main method for the player's score you want 2) For cumulative average just iterate over the arrayList adding the scores together and then divide by the arrayList length. For highest score make an if statement to check if the average score for each player is higher then your previous players highest average score, if it is set that equal to the new highest average score.
