Ruby core documentation quality

I'm relatively new to Ruby and have limited time therefore I try out simple things. Recently I needed to create a file and because I'm lazy as hell, I run to Google. The result: File.open(local_filename, 'w') {|f| f.write(doc) } Shame on me, it is very straightforward, should have done it myself. Then I wanted to check what ruby magic the File class' methods offer or if there's any 'simplification' when invoking those methods, so I headed for the documentation here , and checked for the File class. 1.8.6 documentation presents me with "ftools.rb: Extra tools for the File class" under 'File' class, which is not what I'm looking for. 1.8.7 documentation seems OK for 'File' class, there are a plethora of methods. Except 'open'. 1.9 documentation finally shows me the 'open' method. And I had an almost same tour with Net::HTTP. Do I exaggerate when I think good old Turbo Pascal's 7.0 documentation was better organized than Ruby documentation is right now? Is there any other source for the uninitiated to collect knowledge? Or is it possible that I just tumbled into a documentation hole and the rest are super-brilliant-five-star organized? Thanks
