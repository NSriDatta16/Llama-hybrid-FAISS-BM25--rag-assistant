I just gave a talk about programming reactive Silverlight applications in F# at London F# user-group meeting. The recording of the talk (and samples) are available here , so you can take a look at that. Here are a few points you could consider: I think F# has some very nice features that make programming this kind of applications more elegant than in C# (for example, you can nicely model program as a state machine and encode this direcly in code). F# is still relatively new, but I believe that there is a decent chance that finding someone familiar with F# after three years will be much easier than today (and finding younger students who are interested to learn something new should be easier :-)). I was surprised that there is already quite a demand for good F# programmers in the London area. This will be probably different in different places, but I think that F# is becoming a "nice-to-have" feature on CV for some jobs.
