How does Bayesian Sufficiency relate to Frequentist Sufficiency?

The simplest definition of a sufficient statistics in the frequentist perspective is given here in Wikipedia . However, I recently came across in a Bayesian book, with the definition $P(\theta|x,t)=P(\theta|t)$. It's stated in the link that both are equivalent, but I don't see how. Also, in that same page, in the section «Other Types of sufficiency» it's stated that both definitions are not equivalent in infinite-dimensional spaces... Also, how does the predictive sufficiency relates to the classical sufficiency?
