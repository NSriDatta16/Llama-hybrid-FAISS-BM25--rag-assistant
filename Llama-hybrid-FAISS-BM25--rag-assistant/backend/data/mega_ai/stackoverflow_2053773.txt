Looks good to me as far as Java is concerned. If you are going to do it this way, it is more conventional to make the thread-local storage a reference. No point in reading the static as well. But in Java class loading is lazy and thread-safe, so you might as well just write: private static final MySingleton instance = new MySingleton(); Or not use singletons at all.
