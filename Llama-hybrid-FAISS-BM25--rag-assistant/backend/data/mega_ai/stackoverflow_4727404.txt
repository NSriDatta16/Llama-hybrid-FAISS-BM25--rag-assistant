How do I store image sequence changes to a mysql database with php

I am trying to build a photo organization table and am looking for advice and/or examples of how to save the display sequence of photos to a database. I'm using php and mysql Example: If I have 10 photos in an album and decide to change the sequence of images, so I move a photo from seq 2 to seq 7, then the sequence changes to the following. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Original Sequence 1, 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 New Sequence How do I tell the database that the sequence column for all the affected rows has changed? ...in one operation. Do I change multiple rows in the db at once? Can I limit to just the affected rows the photos table currently has "rowID, sequence, URL...."
