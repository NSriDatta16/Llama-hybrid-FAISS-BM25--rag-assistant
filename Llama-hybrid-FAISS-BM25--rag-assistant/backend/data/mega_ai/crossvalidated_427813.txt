First of all, you need to adjust your usage of some terms. For instance, your problem does not look like an anomaly detection problem because anomaly stands for rare events and abandon a form is not a rare event most of the time. Second is that just because your data is time-based your problem not necessarily turns into a time series modeling problem i.e you're not trying to predict when a user will do something. Your have a classification/discrimination problem. It could be the case that is somehow imbalanced (80% abandon vs 20% completion) but again not anomaly detection. Before modeling, you need to do some EDA on your data. So first question: what is the completion rate? if you aggregate positive examples and negative examples what is the distribution of your categorical features or the average (and std) of the time spent (max timestamp - min timestamp)?. Some univariate analysis could help you to understand better how descriptive your features are to detect completion (or abandonment). After this initial stage then you can easily sketch a classifier with scikit-learn or similar but that would require some feature engineering especially because you have continuous and categorical features as well as coordinates which you need to handle somehow if they help you to identify your label. Overall you need to structure more your approach but don't worry we're all been there.
