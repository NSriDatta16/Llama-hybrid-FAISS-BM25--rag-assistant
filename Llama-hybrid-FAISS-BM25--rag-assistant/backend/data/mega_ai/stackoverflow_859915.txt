Stepping back a bit... Could you go with a fixed-size Java heap? At that point concerns about reallocation and fragmentation go away. On a stand-alone Java invocation, that involve specifying something like -Xmx500m and -Xms500m for a 500Mb heap. You'd have to translate that into what matlab wants.
