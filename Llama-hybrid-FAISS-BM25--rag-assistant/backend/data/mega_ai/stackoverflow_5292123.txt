The easiest would be to make this in interface builder, then you could just drag the view-controllers into the tab bar, then it becomes buttons. It's really easy! If you would like to make it programaticaly as the app starts up, you could make UITabBarItems, and implement the UITabBarDelegate and watch for "tabBar:didSelectItem:" But, as i said. Interface builder is the simplest!
