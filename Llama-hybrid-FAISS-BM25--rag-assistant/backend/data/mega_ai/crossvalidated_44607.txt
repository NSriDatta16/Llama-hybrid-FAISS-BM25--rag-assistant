If you want to use logistic regression to find the cutpoint the following R-code should work: df If you don't use R, just calculate -Intercept / RegressionCoefficient. Edit: The code above gives you the cutpoint ($x$) that results in the corresponding logistic function being 0.5, that is, halfway between the two extremes 0 and 1. Say you got an intercept, $\beta_0$, and an regression coefficient, $\beta_1$. The logistic function is 0.5 when $\beta_0 + \beta_1x=0$ which gives $x=-\beta_0 / \beta_1$
