Changing logistic regression's loss function

We're using logistic regression to predict events probability. Logistic regression tries to minimize the residual variance (sum of squared residuals). However, in our specific problem we would like to use a different loss function (for the errors in the logistic regression). Does anyone knows any implementation (or how to implement) such change? (preferably in R or Python) Thanks!
