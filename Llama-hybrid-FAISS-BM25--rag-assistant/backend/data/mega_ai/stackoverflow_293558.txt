using BeautifulSoup: from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup html = " Foo" soup = BeautifulSoup(html) print soup.prettify() gets you Foo As far as I know, you can't control putting the tags on separate lines from Foo. using Tidy: import tidy html = " Foo" print tidy.parseString(html, show_body_only=True) gets you Foo Unfortunately, I know of no way to keep the tag in the example. Tidy interprets it as an empty paragraph rather than an unclosed one, so doing print tidy.parseString(html, show_body_only=True, drop_empty_paras=False) comes out as Foo Ultimately, of course, the tag in your example is redundant, so you might be fine with losing it. Finally, Tidy can also do indenting: print tidy.parseString(html, show_body_only=True, indent=True) becomes Foo All of these have their ups and downs, but hopefully one of them is close enough.
