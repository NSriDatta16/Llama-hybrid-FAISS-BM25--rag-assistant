How to use NHibernate's Session.Criteria with multiple foreign keys?

I'm trying to create a query using NHibernate and searching along multiple foreign keys: The following code works when I'm only searching on one of the foreign keys: ICriteria query = Session.CreateCriteria () .Add (x => x.FldUrlSafeName == teamName) .CreateCriteria (x => x.TblSportsType) .Add (x => x.FldUrlSafeName == sportsType); return query.UniqueResult (); I need to search on two of the foreign keys so I created the following: ICriteria query = Session.CreateCriteria () .Add (x => x.FldUrlSafeName == teamName) .CreateCriteria (x => x.TblSportsType) .Add (x => x.FldUrlSafeName == sportsType) .CreateCriteria (x => x.TblSportsOrganization) .Add (x => x.FldUrlSafeName == sportsOrganization); return query.UniqueResult (); Unfortunately, this gives me the following error: "could not resolve property: TblSportsOrganization of: site.Core.TblSportsType" How would I have it take a "step back" as it were so I can add criteria to TblTeam and not TblSportsType?
