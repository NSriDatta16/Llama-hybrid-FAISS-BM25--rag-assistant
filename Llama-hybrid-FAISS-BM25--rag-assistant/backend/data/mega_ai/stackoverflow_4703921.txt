Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition

Hey guys, Am wondering if anybody can help me with a starting point for the design of a Neural Network system that can recognize visual patterns, e.g. checked, and strippes. I have knowledge of the theory, but little practical knowledge. And net searches are give me an information overload. Can anybody recommend a good book or tutorial that is more focus on the practical side. Thank you!
