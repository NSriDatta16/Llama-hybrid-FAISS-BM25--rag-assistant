A term you could google - multi-pass encoding & rate prediction. What it does (beyond providing the best quality encodes) is that the codec effectively encodes the video twice, first time recording the quality loss resulting from a fixed bitrate, second time, incorporating that information in order to maintain the same level of quality regardless on the amount of changes in the video. Rate prediction/Rate control, is a very fascinating topic, especially for real time, one-pass encoding. The codec has to make a good estimate of the future scene complexity, in order to keep the overall bitrate on target. Restrictions on maximum bitrate permitted by channel (for instance, you might want a 1MBit/s average bitrate, but the content cannot exceed 2MBit/s for longer than 5s, because of buffering in the players) make this task even more challenging.
