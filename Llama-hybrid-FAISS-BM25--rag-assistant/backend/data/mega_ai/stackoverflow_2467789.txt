Vertical scrolling in silverlight

I have a silverlight application that is set to use 100% browser height. As I dynamically add controls to a canvas (which can be dragged around), I would like the expand the canvas vertically. Ideally show the browser scrollbar so the user can move up or down, if that can't be done, use the scrollbar control. I would also need to handle the user changing the size of the browser. Any suggestions on how to do this ? Cheers,
