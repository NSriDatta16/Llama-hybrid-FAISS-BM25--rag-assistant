The answer by mttk is quite nice. I will just add that you could also extract the probabilities and use them as input to a meta-classifier such as a simple logistic regression. This will automatically adjust for differences in the way classifiers produce probability estimates (i.e. classifier A almost exclusively produces probabilities on the range [0.4, 0.6], whereas classifier B almost exclusively produces probabilities near 0 or 1).
