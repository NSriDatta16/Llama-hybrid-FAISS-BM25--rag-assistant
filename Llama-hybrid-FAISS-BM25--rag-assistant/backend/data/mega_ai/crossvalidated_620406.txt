Is it OK calculating and compare the differences between standardized (z-log) means of different subsets of a dataset?

I have a large dataset of different species-level traits like leaf length, lifespan, height, etc that I am combining with a time-series occurrence dataset to see changes in mean trait values over time. Some basic example of the dataset structure: Traits Species Leaf length Height A 1 10 B 5 15 C 3 35 D 2 50 E 6 60 F 8 90 Time series Period 1 Period 2 Period 3 A NA A B B B C C NA D D D NA NA NA F NA F I would like to be able to compare the relative size of changes between different traits over time to see which traits were emphasized most during different periods. For this purpose I log- and z-transformed my dataset to standardize it and then calculated the difference in standardized means between two different time periods.This produced sensible results, until I noticed that sometimes the mean z-log score will slightly decrease even though in reality, the untransformed value slightly increased over the same period. Overall, though, I'm fairly happy with the results though I'm not sure if this is meaningful or not. Is comparing differences in standardized means a valid strategy? But it seems like calculating Cohen's d to estimate the effect size between different periods would also be an option. Would Cohen's d or another method be more appropriate? Any advice appreciated.
