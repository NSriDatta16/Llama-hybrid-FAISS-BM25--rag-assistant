If you want a method in one class to know about an instance of another class (an instance is created when you call "new", and assigned to a variable, like subject), the variable either needs to a) be global, as glenn mcdonald indicated by suggesting you use $subject. The $ indicates a global variable b) be a member of the class from which your calling, so it would not be created outside the class. So subject would be a member variable of NumberTwo, and initialized in NumberTwo's constructor perhaps c) be passed in as a parameter. It seems to me that the easiest way given what you're showing us, would be to pass in subject as a parameter. class NumberTwo def doSomethingElse(subject) subject.doSomething end end subject = Test.new otherObject = numberTwo.new otherObject.doSomethingElse(subject)
