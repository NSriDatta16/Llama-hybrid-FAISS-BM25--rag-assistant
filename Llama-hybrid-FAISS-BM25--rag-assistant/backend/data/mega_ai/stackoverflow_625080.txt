Some sites look at the incoming IP address, lookup where it's coming from and then take various actions they think relevant to you - usually, redirecting you to a more-local site. Of course, lots of sites react if they think they've "seen you before." For example, there may be cookies that tell them something about you. Or, they may be reacting to your browser. Sometimes, organizations look at the source IP address and if it's coming from a business they may respond differently than if it's from a non-business ("home") IP. And, sometimes companies intercept IP traffic and edit it in various ways. This is not normally done to web pages, but if your employer isn't happy with your watching porn at work ( -smile- ), they may do something about it! ...China is well known for doing this type of interception...
