Clustering credit card accounts based on their balance trajectories

I am trying to cluster credit accounts based on the shape of their balance trajectories over the next 36 months, to identify the different types of shapes possible in the portfolio. Here is how I am doing it: Standardize balance trajectories by converting them into proportion of balances (balance at each point in time divided by the initial balance at the starting point) Do PCA and reduce from 36 to 3 dimensions. The top 3 components explain almost ~85% of the variations in the initial 36 values. Do K-means clustering (using fastclus in SAS). The issue is that the CCC (cubic clustering criterion) value I end up with is very high (~-500) even after I identify almost 15-20% of my data as outliers (using the strict= options in fastclus). I understand the CCC value should be around 2-3 for a statistically sound clustering. Is there any way I can improve this? Should i normalize the 3 principal components before doing k-means? Update: It seems PCA can lead to order loss because it is not mindful of the sequence in which balances occur. Can anyone suggest better parameters to capture 36 months of balance information that I can use in K-means? I want to do K-means with lowest dimensionality possible because distance doesn't work with high dimensional data (36 in my case). I think using slope, curvature and level. I can define level with average values, slope with regression slope coefficient of balance versus time equation but how do I define curvature? My basic goal is to cluster those accounts together which have a similar balance trajectory.
