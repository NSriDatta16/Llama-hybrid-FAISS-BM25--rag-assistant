Good thinking, but here's the problem in your explanation: " $H_0$ is true" is not a random variable. In the frequentist approach, parameters are (un)known fixed numbers. So the hypothesis is either right or wrong. Therefore the idea of $P(H_0$ is true $|$ observation $)$ is itself incorrect. Edit : Based on another answer below, one more thing comes to mind. Even if you consider parameters as random (i.e., Bayesian approach), you can relate $P(H_0$ is true $|$ observation $)$ to MLE. In MLE you maximize something subject to parameters. Basically rather than assuming some value of the parameter in $H_0$ , you just assume that distribution comes from a particular family (for example, you may assume distribution is Normal). And then you maximize likelihood function subject to parameters. So an MLE can be though of as finding the $H_0$ for which $P(H_0$ is true $|$ observation $)$ is maximum among various possible hypotheses.
