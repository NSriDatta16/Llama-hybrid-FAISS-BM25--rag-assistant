How to use ARIMA to predict time series?

Time Volume 9/30/2019 2000 10/1/2019 1800 10/2/2019 1600 10/3/2019 1400 10/4/2019 1200 10/5/2019 1000 10/6/2019 800 10/7/2019 600 10/8/2019 400 10/9/2019 2000 10/10/2019 1800 10/11/2019 1600 10/12/2019 1400 10/13/2019 1200 10/14/2019 1000 10/15/2019 800 10/16/2019 600 I have this dataset with Volume consumption of a tank over period of time. The volume decreases with time and on 10/9/2019 the tank has a load-up and is full tank. I have data for over a year and would like to use ARIMA to predict when would the next load-up happen based on previous consumptions.
