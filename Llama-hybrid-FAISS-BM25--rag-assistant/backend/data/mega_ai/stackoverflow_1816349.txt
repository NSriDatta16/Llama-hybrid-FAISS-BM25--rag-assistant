Are you aware that with Windows Forms there is an existing settings infrastructure you can use to save settings of controls and your forms? From the designer, select a control and in the properties under Application Settings, then Property Binding, you can bind any property on the control to a property that will be generated to access and save that property value. The settings can be application or user scoped. These settings will also use isolated storage, allow you to upgrade to different versions of settings to maintain user settings between versions, and many other features. So this may not directly answer your question, but may be a better solution for your particular problem. Once you bind a property you can save changes whenever you want, on a per user or per application basis like so: Settings.Default.TextBox1 = textBox2.Text; Settings.Default.BackColor = Color.Blue; Settings.Default.Save();
