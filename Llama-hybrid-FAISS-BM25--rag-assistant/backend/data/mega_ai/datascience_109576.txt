too much data to label

I'm working on a Data Science project to flag bots on Instagram. I collected a lot of data (+80k users) and now I have to label them as bot/legit users. I already flagged 20k users with different techniques but now I feel like I'm gonna have to flag them one by one with will likely take months. Can I just stop and be like "I'm fine with what I have" or is this bad practice? Stopping now would also mean that the distribution of the data is NOT the same as my labeling techniques were used to find bots and not legit users. What are my options?
