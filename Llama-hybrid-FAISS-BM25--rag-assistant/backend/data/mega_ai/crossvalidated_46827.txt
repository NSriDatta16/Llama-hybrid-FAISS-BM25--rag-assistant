Hypothesis tests on 2-dimensional panel data w/ 1 characteristic?

I have a 2-dimensional panel data set with one characteristic looking along these lines: individual | year | BMI 1 2005 25.3 1 2006 25.4 1 2007 24.1 2 2005 22.9 2 2006 22.1 2 2007 21.1 ... I also have annual values for another external variable V for the years 2005 - 2007, and I'd like to investigate whether there's a correlation between people's BMI and V. In particular, I have a hypothesis that the true correlation is > 0 that I want to test. My question is, can I test this by constructing a "time series" that pairs each BMI value with the value of V for the given year and use Pearson's r for the hypothesis test and correlation coefficients? Why or why not? If I do that, are the results at all useful? If not, what are the alternatives that are rather simple to perform? I'll clarify what I mean by constructing the time series. Assume V is 1.1, 2.2 and 3.3 for 2005 - 2007, respectively. The constructed "time series" would then be as follows (BMI values from above): BMI | V 25.3 1.1 25.4 2.2 24.1 3.3 22.9 1.1 22.1 2.2 21.1 3.3 A related question that I found (unfortunately it didn't give me all answers I was looking for): Are short time series worth modelling? Thanks in advance!
