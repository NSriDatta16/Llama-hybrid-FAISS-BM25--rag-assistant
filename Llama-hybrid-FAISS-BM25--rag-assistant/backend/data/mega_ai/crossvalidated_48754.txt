Easy way to test usefulness of data for stock market analysis?

I have a lot of data (gigs) that may be useful in predicting equity prices. I can import these as a series of features (columns) in a table where the companies are rows. I have time series information too. I have some machine learning experience but no experience as a trader. Is there some software or platform where I could easily import my data and it could backtest/forward test my data to see if it's useful? I understand that any machine learning system that's out there in public won't outperform the market enough to cover brokerage fees, but given my data, there's a chance it would. So I probably don't need state of the art in machine learning but I'd like to find a solution where I don't spend the next 6 months learning the stock market. I'd rather spend that time getting feedback on, and iterating on the input data, because as a data-oriented developer, that's where I can add value. Any help, much appreciated.
