Can we use bootstrap in time series case?

I use random forest for time series forecasting.I have some features: lags. day of year,day of week,hours,minutes. rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=1000,n_jobs=-1,bootstrap=False).fit(X_train, y_train) rf-function use for learning random forest.X_train-features,y_train-values of time series,n_estimators-number of trees,(bootstrap=True)=use bootstrap,(bootstrap=False)=not use bootstrap example of X_train: Should i write bootstrap=False in this case? If not, why?
