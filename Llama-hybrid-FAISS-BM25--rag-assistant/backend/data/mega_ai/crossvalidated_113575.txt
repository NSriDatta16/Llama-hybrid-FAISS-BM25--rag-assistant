First, you have to decide what units of time are you going to use. Is each step the same amount of time? So an 8-step project takes twice as long as a 4-step project? Or the pathways take the same amount of time regardless of the number of steps. For now, let's assume that you are counting steps as time. I assume a student cannot earn a badge in step 4 before earning a badge in step 2. So the average time (in terms of the number of steps) to earn the first badge is just the time of the first badge. Now if you want to take into account multiple badges, than you could consider the average time (steps) between badges. So you would average the time to the first badge, the time to the second badge after the first badge, etc. PathwayID TotalSteps BadgeEarned@Step TimeSinceLastBadge 1 4 2 2 4 2 2 7 3 3 5 2 7 2 3 5 2 2 4 2 4 9 4 4 6 2 8 2 The averages would be: PathwayID AvgWaitTime AvgTimeBetween 1 0.75 2 2 0.71 2.33 3 0.60 2 4 0.67 2.67 If you count completion as a "badge" (success), then you could add another row at the end of each pathway to incorporate any long badgeless periods at the end of the pathway.
