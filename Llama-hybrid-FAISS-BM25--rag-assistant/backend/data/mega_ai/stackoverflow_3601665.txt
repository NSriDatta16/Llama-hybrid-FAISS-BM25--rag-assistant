AppleScript GUI elements besides dialog

I was wondering if there is a way in AppleScript to create a small Applet of sorts, without having to use a bunch of dialogs, and I think it would be nicer in the end. Here is the script I have currently, courtesy of AppleScript Wikia set x1 to text returned of (display dialog "What is X1?" default answer "") set y1 to text returned of (display dialog "What is Y1?" default answer "") set x2 to text returned of (display dialog "What is X2?" default answer "") set y2 to text returned of (display dialog "What is Y2?" default answer "") display dialog "Distance = " & ((x2 - x1) ^ 2 + (y2 - y1) ^ 2) ^ (1 / 2) Now, obviously, I understand this script, as it is quite simple! But I was wondering, if a small Applet such as this were to be a little more useful and practical, it would be better to have some sort of window, without barraging the user with a bunch of dialogs. Is there a way I can construct a window of sorts, with input fields and a "Calculate" button or something like that. Or, at this point, would it just be better to construct a super simple Objective-C application?
