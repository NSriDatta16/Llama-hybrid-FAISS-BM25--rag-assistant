I'm going to totally ignore what you asked and answer something completely different instead! I'm just that crazy! Well, not really, I'm leveraging a core perl module, File::Find , instead of writing my own directory parser. On request, here's the question I'm actually answering: "How do I find the path to a file that is somewhere in a sub-directory of a specific set of paths?" use File::Find; # Other parts of the class here sub find_template_file { my ($this, $filename) = @_; my $file_path; my $path = $this->{path}; # Note that this inner sub uses variables we defined above find(sub { if ($_ eq $filename) $file_path = $File::Find::name; }, @$path); if ($file_path) return $file_path; my $s = $path ? ("['" . join("','", @$path) . "']") : '[]'; die "Tenjin::Engine: $filename not found (path=$s)."; }
