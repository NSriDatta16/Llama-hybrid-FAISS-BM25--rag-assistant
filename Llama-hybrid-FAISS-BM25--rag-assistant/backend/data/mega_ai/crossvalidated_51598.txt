This number of features is often seen with MLP architectures. some function optimization algorithms I'm afraid you're not using the right learning algorithms for training the weights of your network. Less than 1 million features should not create memory problem with iterative layer-wise methods, like the Backpropagation algorithm (but it usually takes time on a simple computer). For more efficient methods, take a look at the recent literature on deep learning algorithm (Bengio, LeCun & others).
