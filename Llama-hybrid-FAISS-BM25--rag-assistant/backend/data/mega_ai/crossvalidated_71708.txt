How to find the distance from data point to the hyperplane with MATLAB SVM?

I am using the SVMStruct function in MATLAB (with RBF kernel) to classify my data, and it works great. But now I need to compare the distance from the data points to the hyperplane, or to find the data point that is closest to the hyperplane. I don't find a function in MATLAB to do that, or even how this can be done. Could someone please suggest?
