Is Logistic Regression the right analyses when a study has 1 categorical DV and 2 categorical IV's?

I am working on a project for a faculty member who wants to know if placement in Developmental Reading (IV1: Dev RDG & NonDev RDG) and/or placement in Developmental English (IV2: Dev ENG & NonDev ENG) affects the success rate (DV: Successful & Unsuccessful) in a course (HIS101 for example). I used a Logistic Regression to try and analyze this result. When I look at my results, however, something seems wrong. Would a different analysis be more appropriate? My main hang up is that I see significant differences throughout my results but my crosstabs do not seem to agree.
