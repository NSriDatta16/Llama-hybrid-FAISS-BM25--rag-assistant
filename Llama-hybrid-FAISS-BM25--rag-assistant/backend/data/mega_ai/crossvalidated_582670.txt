How can make sure our deep neural network is differentiable

When we have a deep neural network, according to how much complicated that neural network is, how we can make sure that in each layer we can calculate the derivatives?( Is that differentiable or not). We may have a combination of multiplications, summation, activation functions and ... but how do we know that is differentiable?
