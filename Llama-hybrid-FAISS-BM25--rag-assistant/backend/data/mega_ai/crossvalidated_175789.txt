Relationship between logit and odds ratios

Alright so I am trying to sort out exactly what a logit is in terms of a ratio... I understand that : $logit(p) = log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = \beta$ and that $exp(\beta) =$ odds ratio =$ \frac{\frac{p_1}{1-p_1}}{\frac{p_2}{1-p_2}}$ I guess what's not coming across is how $\beta$, not being a ratio of odds, converts to the odds ratio metric, when taken out of logarithmic space. To provide a bit more, if this is the logistic regression equation for the constant $log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = \beta + \beta_1*0 + \beta_2*0 + \beta_3*0 + \beta_4*0 + \beta_5*0$. then $exp(\beta)$ = odds ratio so likewise for $log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = \beta + \beta_1*1$ then $exp(\beta+\beta_1*1)$ = odds ratio for a one unit increase in $\beta_1$ BUT, how does $$exp(\beta+\beta_1*1) = \frac{\frac{p_1}{1-p_1}}{\frac{p_2}{1-p_2}}\tag{1}$$ because doesn't the $+$ in log terms (e.g. $\beta+\beta_1*1$) equal a multiplication and not a division?
