Let's say you have 800 samples. For each fold, you are leaving out about 160 samples and doing this 30 times. For each combination of weight decay and number of hidden units, train will use the average of the 30 resamples to figure out which is empirically best. Once that is finished, it takes those optimal settings and fits a final model with all 800 samples and that is used for future prediction. I'm not sure if that qualifies as 'retraining' or not. You can also use model averaging with neural networks by using method = "avNNet" if you think that helps. Max
