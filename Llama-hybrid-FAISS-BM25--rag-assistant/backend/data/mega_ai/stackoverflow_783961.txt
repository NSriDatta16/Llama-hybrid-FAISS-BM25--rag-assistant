std::string will always manage it's internal storage with new/delete. Not sure why your question contains glibcâ€™s string implementation . The string implementation of the c++ standard library has nothing to do with glibc . The only way to store a string on the stack is to use a C char array on the stack (like what Shhnap outlined). But that's probably not what you want anyway :-)
