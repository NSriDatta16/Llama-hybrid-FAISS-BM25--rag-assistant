MVVM and commands that show more GUI

I like the MVVM idea of a RelayCommand that's exposed by the ViewModel. That's nice and elegant, for operations that can be done with no further user input. Simple. Testable. However, not all operations are UI-less. Some require confirmation ("Are you sure you want to delete?"). Others require more information yet. Opening a file might entail anything from a File Open dialog up through a full-blown Import wizard. What's the best way, within an MVVM app, to write commands that require user input? Is there an established pattern for solving this with dependency injection somehow? Should I write a KeyDown handler in the code-behind, and have it explicitly execute the event? Should I fall back on RoutedUICommand, and put all the "display the next GUI" code in my View? Or is there something obvious that I'm totally missing?
