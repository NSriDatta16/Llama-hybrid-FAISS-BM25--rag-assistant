According to Standardizing features when using LDA as a pre-processing step , there is no reason for you to standardize data when computing LDA. To answer your question, however, the mean is meant as the average column-wise of X s.t. the vector $\mu_x$ has size 5 (there are 5 columns) regardless of how many rows you have. In other words, the mean is "the average value of your input samples".
