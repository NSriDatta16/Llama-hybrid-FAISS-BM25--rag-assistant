Your data retrieval action in beforeSend is asynchronous, meaning $.get() returns immediately and then beforeSend returns immediately. Then the $.ajax() continues execution. At this point, the $.ajax() call is already well underway and has a headstart over the $.get() call. I'm not sure exactly how the two requests are handled concurrently under the covers, but that is the gist of it. What you want to do is have $.get() execute synchronously , not asynchonously. That way beforeSend won't return until the data retrieval completes. To do this, merely add async: false to your $.get() parameter object.
