If you look in the MatchIt documentation, it pretty clearly tells you how to calculate the standardised mean differences. The standardized mean differences are computed both before and after matching or subclassification as the difference in treatment group means divided by a standardization factor computed in the unmatched (original) sample. The standardization factor depends on the argument supplied to estimand in matchit() : for "ATT", it is the standard deviation in the treated group; for "ATC", it is the standard deviation in the control group; for "ATE", it is the square root of the average of the variances within each treatment group. The post-matching mean difference is computed with weighted means in the treatment groups using the matching or subclassification weights. You're ATT, because you're keeping all your treated and matching the controls to them. So, find the standard deviation of the variable in the treated group pre match (but in this case it's the same people anyway, because you're keeping all your treated). Don't worry about the weights comments, you haven't specified any weights, so the weights are simply all 1 for all observations kept in your matching sample. lalonde%>%group_by(treat)%>%summarise(sd(age))%>%as.data.frame() treat sd(age) 0 10.786653 1 7.155019 lalonde%>%group_by(treat)%>%summarise(mean(age))%>%as.data.frame() treat mean(age) 0 28.03030 1 25.81622 (25.81622-28.03030)/7.155019 [1] -0.3094443 check it against summary(m.out) Now try it for the matched group. Get the matched data set. Find the means and apply the same process, still use 7.155019 as the standardising factor. m.out.2 %group_by(treat)%>%summarise(mean(age))%>%as.data.frame() treat mean(age) 0 25.18378 1 25.81622 (25.81622-25.18378)/7.155019 [1] 0.0883911 You can apply the same process to your unmatched variables.
