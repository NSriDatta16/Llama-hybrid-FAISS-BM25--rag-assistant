Multilevel model for questionnaire-like data

I am trying to create a multilevel model to investigate this question, but I can't come up with a solution (it's the first time I do multi-level modeling, and my statistics skills are rather elementary). 135 teachers were given 35 sentences and they rated them for perceived difficulty on a continuous 1-100 scale. Each sentence had some characteristics, such as length in words, number of commas, number of subjects, number of verbs and a few more, 7 predictive factors altogether. Each participant was scored for two characteristics, school level where they teach (4 values, nominal) + years of experience. I would like to model how these factors predict their responses about item difficulty. My data are organized in two spreadsheets: one contains the 35 sentences and, for each of them, the values for their characteristics (e.g. sentence 1 has 35 words, 2 commas, 6 verbs, 5 subjects etc); the other contains the participants' responses (e.g. participant 1 rated sentence 1 35.3, sentence 2 28.9, sentence 3 67.1 etc.) + participants' characteristics. Now I don't know if and how I should merge all this information into a single data matrix or whether I can conduct the analysis with two different matrices, and how to practically run the analysis. I would say it's a multivariate, repeated measures, multilevel model with a single, continuous response variable. I've tried to look for information on the web about how to practically conduct this type of analysis with R, but I could not find anything specifically addressing this research design. I would really appreciate if anyone could direct me to some introductory tutorial, or give me some hints on how I should proceed. Thank you very much
