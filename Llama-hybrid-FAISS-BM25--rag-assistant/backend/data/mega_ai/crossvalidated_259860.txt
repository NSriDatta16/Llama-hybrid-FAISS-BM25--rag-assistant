Aside from Feature Extraction, can t-SNE do feature selection?

I am working on a genomics project, that contains a dataset of ~100 cells (that contains 8 classes of cells) and ~20,000 genes. I am interested in trying to find out what genes are influential in classifying the 8 cell types, but am challenged by the curse of dimensionality. After doing some research, it seems that researchers have used PCA and t-SNE to tackle similar challenges. I understand that for PCA, one can examine the loadings of the PCs to determine which genes are influential. However, I haven't read anything of a similar procedure for t-SNE. Is there a way to examine which genes are influential by using t-SNE (feature selection), or is t-SNE only capable of doing feature extraction?
