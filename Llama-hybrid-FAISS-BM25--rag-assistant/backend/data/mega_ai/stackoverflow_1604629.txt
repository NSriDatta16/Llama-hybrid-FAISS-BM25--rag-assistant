Exclude weekends and custom days (i.e. Holidays) from date calculations

Currently, I am calculating a finish date based on the start date (DateTime) and duration (# of days), but my calculations do not take into account weekends or holidays. So, my solution is not correct. This was just a starting point. I read some articles out there and one approach is to create a gigantic calendar table that has all the weekends and holidays for the next 50 years. I guess the idea is to query a date range against the calendar table and subtract the # of weekends and/or holidays. The problem is the software I am working on allows users to set their own project calendar. Wouldn't the table become to large to maintain given that the software allows users to manage multiple projects? So, I guess my question how do I get started and what are some possible approaches to this problem? Basically, for each project task I need to calculate the task finish date given the START date and DURATION, but taking weekends and custom days(aka holidays) into consideration. Any ideas? BTW: I'm using SQL Server 2005.
