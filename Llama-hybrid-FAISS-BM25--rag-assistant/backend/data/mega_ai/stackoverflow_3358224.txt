I can't tell whether the gurus would call it bad practive. I just know I'd never do it - it is slower, more error-prone, possibly makes it very hard to change a title's name (admittedly, only if you hardcode it everywhere) and (arguably) very inelegant. At least you should associate te options with the widget's identity, which still smells imho, but at least has a few problems less. Maybe that whole part of the application should be refactored to be less centralized so the issue disappears completely. Edit on how to refactor: Honestly, I can't tell - I know little about the application. The obvious approach would be subclassing all widgets and making them responsible for somehow getting the options and changing accordingly. But I can't tell whether that's really feasible.
