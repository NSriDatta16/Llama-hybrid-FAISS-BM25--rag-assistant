From http://www.jslint.com/lint.html : The analysis is done by a script running on your machine. Your script is not sent over the network. It is also available as a Konfabulator widget . You can check a file by dragging it and dropping it on the widget. You can recheck the file by double-clicking the widget. It is also available in a WSH Command Line version. It is also available in a Rhino Command Line version. Or since JSLint is a JavaScript program running in your browser - you could grab the script and run it locally.
