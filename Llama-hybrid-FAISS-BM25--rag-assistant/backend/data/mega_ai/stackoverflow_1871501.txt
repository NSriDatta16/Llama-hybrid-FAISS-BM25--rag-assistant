Embedding an applet doesn't work on my website

I'm trying to code an applet and put it in my website. I remember doing this a long time ago using Borland back when 1.4 was the latest version. It of course used the applet tag (which I'm using currently) and it had no issues. But anyways, I put the class files in httpdocs/ under its own directory, and then used this code in the web page: Your browser does not support the applet tag. And when I try to load the page, this happens: Java Plug-in 1.6.0_17 Using JRE version 1.6.0_17-b04 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM java.lang.ClassFormatError: Incompatible magic value 1008813135 in class file wsavatar/WSAvatar at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method) at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown Source) at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown Source) at sun.plugin2.applet.Applet2ClassLoader.findClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source) at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2ClassLoader.loadCode(Unknown Source) at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2Manager.createApplet(Unknown Source) at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2Manager$AppletExecutionRunnable.run(Unknown Source) at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) Exception: java.lang.ClassFormatError: Incompatible magic value 1008813135 in class file wsavatar/WSAvatar I have tried making a quick local html file to load the applet using the same applet code and it worked. I have looked around online and have heard various things pertaining to this error, but nothing seems to alleviate it, that I've found. Any ideas? Ben
