Java Swing - JPanel and GridLayout Margins/Padding

I'm working on building a chess game in Java, and I'm currently having a bit of trouble getting the GUI exactly the way I want it with Swing. I'm using a GridLayout to organize a grid of 8x8 ChessButton s (which override the JButton so that I can store extra information inside of them such as coordinates). Originally, the ChessButton s wouldn't appear unless I moused over them, but I solved that problem by placing each ChessButton inside a separate JPanel and setting each button's setPreferredSize() to a set height and width. Now, my problem is that there seems to be a small margin or padding above (and/or below?) each button. I've made sure to set setHgap(0) and setVgap(0) for the GridLayout , so I'm pretty sure the mysterious margin is coming from either the buttons or the JPanel s. But, I can't seem to get rid of them, and they seem to be causing each ChessButton to shift a little bit up/down whenever I mouse of them. I realize this description of the problem might be a little hard to visualize, so I've taken a screenshot (using JButton s rather than ChessButton s so the gaps are slightly easier to recognize): http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/6656/jbuttonmargins.png Here is the code I used to initialize each ChessButton : chessBoard = new JPanel(new GridLayout(8, 8, 0, 0)); chessBoard.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder()); for (int i = 0; i So, how can I get rid of these vertical spaces between buttons? I'm relatively new to Swing, so I'm sorry if the answer is extremely obvious, but I'd appreciate any help anyone might have to offer! Thanks in advance!
