If two datasets have the same principal components does it mean they are related by an orthogonal transformation?

This is the reverse of my previous question Is PCA invariant to orthogonal transformations? Let $A$ and $B$ be two $n$ x $p$ data matrices where $n$ is the number of samples and $p$ is the number of features. Both $A$ and $B$ are centred (zero mean for each feature). The following are the eigenvalue decompositions of their covariance matrices: $$ \frac{1}{n-1} A^T A = V_A L_A V^T_A $$ $$ \frac{1}{n-1} B^T B = V_B L_B V^T_B $$ Now suppose that $A$ and $B$ have the same principal components, that is: $$ A V_A = B V_B $$ Does it follow that $B$ is a rotation of $A$ (or vice-versa), that is: $$ B = AQ \ ? $$
