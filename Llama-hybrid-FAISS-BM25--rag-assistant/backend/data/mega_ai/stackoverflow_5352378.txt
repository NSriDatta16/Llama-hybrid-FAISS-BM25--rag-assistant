If you want to develop web application using a 'component' approach - like GWT - having knowledge of Swing can help you. GWT or Vaadin framework are using widgets (window, panel, menu, text area) and layout them to organize the client view. The application is not going from pages to pages but instead have a single entry point that will show and hide windows and panels. In this way they are very close to Swing (even if they are simpler to handle). You'll find easier to switch from Swing to GWT (and vis-versa) than to switch from a page based framework (like struts) to GWT.
