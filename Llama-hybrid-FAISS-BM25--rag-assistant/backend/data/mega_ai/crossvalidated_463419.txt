Why accuracy and prediction changes when random state is changed in machine learning?

When random state is changed between 0,1,2 manually I observed accuracy is changing and at the same time when the model was checked with random state '0' and with internally split X_test data it predicts 82% and external data it wasn't predicting correct but still accuracy is high of 82%. With random state '2' the external data is predicting good but accuracy is 71%. Should I consider random state based on accuracy of the model or should I consider random state based on external data prediction which was correct but accuracy is 71%. I'm using random_state=2
