You can load the data in a cache sure, precisely how/where the data is cached is entirely up to you. You can use anything from per-request caching (which will be pretty useless for this particular problem) to things like APC , memcached , a local database or even just saving the raw results to files. These will not make the actual retrieval of the data from Google any quicker of course. On that note, it is likely (not having seen the code) that the requests over to Google are probably being executed sequentially. It is likely possible to extend the PHP class to allow requesting multiple sets of data from Google in parallel (e.g. with cURL Multi ).
