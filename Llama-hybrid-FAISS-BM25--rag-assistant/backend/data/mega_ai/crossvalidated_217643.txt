Anova on logistic regressions linearity

I'm trying to find out if my numeric predictors have a linear relation to the logit of my logistic regression. I tried to use the lrm fit in the rms package where I have used 3 knot cubic spline on all numeric predictors like this: > fit There after I used anova on lrm fit. The main question is how do I use the result in anova(fit)? My understanding is that the wald statistics are just the associated coefficients squared and dived by it's se. But what about the statistics for nonlinear terms here? are they the wald statistics for the coefficients for the squared predictors? If none of the statistics are significant, can I conclude that there are no quadratic effect from my predictors?
