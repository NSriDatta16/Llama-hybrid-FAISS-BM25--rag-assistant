How to identify a set of n-highest intercepts after running a series of mixed models

I have a data frame that contains multiple dependent variables and multiple entries per subject. I don't have any regressors in my model, I am just interested in the global intercept. For each of my variables, I fit a random-intercepts model which allows me to account for within-subject and between-subject variance, After running all mixed models, I would like to use a method that allows me to identify a set of dependent variables associated with significantly higher intercepts than the rest. Consider this example with different days, different subjects and how much of a particular food each subjects eats: value subject food variable 1 Jane Apple Monday 2 Jane Steak Monday 3 Jane Fruity Loops Monday 2 John Apple Monday 3 John Steak Monday 1 John Fruity Loops Monday 2 Jane Apple Tuesday 3 Jane Steak Tuesday 4 Jane Fruity Loops Tuesday 3 John Apple Tuesday 4 John Steak Tuesday 2 John Fruity Loops Tuesday 3 Jane Apple Wednesday 4 Jane Steak Wednesday 5 Jane Fruity Loops Wednesday 4 John Apple Wednesday 5 John Steak Wednesday 3 John Fruity Loops Wednesday For each of the variables (days) we could fit a model like such: value ~ 1 + (1 | subject) Which in plain english translates to "I am not interested in how much of a particular food has been eaten and I also don't care how much and what each subject eats. I want to know how much the average person eats on this day ". Finally, after setting up a mixed model for each day, I would like to identify the day(s) on which people eat the most. Does anyone have an idea how to do this?
