An index speeds up searching, at the expense of storage space. Think of the index as an additional copy of an attribute's (or column's) data, but in order. If you have an ordered collection you can perform something like a binary search, which is much faster than a sequential search (which you'd need if the data wasn't ordered). Once you find the data you need using the index, you can refer to the corresponding record. The tradeoff is that you need the additional space to store the "ordered" copy of that column's data, and there's a slight speed tradeoff because new records have to be inserted in the correct order, a requisite for the quick search algorithms to work.
