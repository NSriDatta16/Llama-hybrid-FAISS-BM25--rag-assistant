This is definitely NOT safe in a shared hosting environment like most web hosting deals that do not include a dedicated (virtual o physical) server. Since session data is stored in the filesystem and is by default NOT ENCRYPTED in any way it is possible (depending on your web hosters configuration) that scripts from other hosting accounts may gain access to your session data. There are much more secure places for sensitive data. Depending on the nature of the data, you might even want to consider encryption of your data storage. Even if your application lives on a dedicated server where session data is in theory secure, sessions are not a very reliable storage medium. Use your database for any persistent and/or sensitive data.
