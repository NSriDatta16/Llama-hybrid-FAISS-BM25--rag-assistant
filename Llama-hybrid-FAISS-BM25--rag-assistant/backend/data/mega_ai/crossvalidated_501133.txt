The LOGISTIC REGRESSION procedure provides leverages for binary response models, but none of the SPSS procedures that will fit multinomial logistic models provide leverage statistics for them. Nothing fancy is provided in the way of residuals statistics either. It is possible to save actual category probabilities in the NOMREG (Multinomial Logistic Regression) procedure. Small predicted probabilities for the actually occurring group would be indicative of badly mis-predicting cases.
