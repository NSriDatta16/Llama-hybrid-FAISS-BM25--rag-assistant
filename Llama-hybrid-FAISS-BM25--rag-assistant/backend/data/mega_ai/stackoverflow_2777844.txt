Pan point on Google Map to specific pixel position on screen (API v3)

When overlay is a Google maps overlay and offsetx, offsety is the pixel distance from the maps center that I want to pan latlong to, the following works. var projection = overlay.getProjection(); var pxlocation = projection.fromLatLngToContainerPixel(latlong); map.panTo(projection.fromContainerPixelToLatLng(new google.maps.Point(pxlocation.x+offsetx,pxlocation.y+offsety))); However, I don't always have an overlay on the map and map.getProjection() returns a projection , not a MapCanvasProjection which does not have the methods I need. Is there a way to do this without making an overlay specificaly for it?
