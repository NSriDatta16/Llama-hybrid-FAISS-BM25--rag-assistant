From a non-Bayesian view point, there is no definition of quantities like $$p(x|\theta = -\sqrt \eta \lor \theta = \sqrt \eta)$$ because $\theta$ is then a fixed parameter and the conditioning notation does not make sense. The alternative you propose relies on a prior distribution, which is precisely what an approach such as the one proposed by Casella and Berger wants to avoid. You can check the keyword profile likelihood for more entries. (And there is no meaning of right or wrong there.)
