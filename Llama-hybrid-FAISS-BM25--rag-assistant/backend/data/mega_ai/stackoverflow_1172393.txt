Did you try using the paragraph format specifier for one or more of the columns? That is p{ } as in: \begin{tabular}{|rrp{4.5cm}l|} ... Multirow seems like overkill for most of the use cases I am envisioning. NB: The "length" can be computed from other values as is 0.4\textwidth , but is always a constant. Don't know off hand how rubber reacts in this case.
