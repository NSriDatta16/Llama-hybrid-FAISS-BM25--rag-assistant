In the "Run" dialog, select your JUnit configuration and go the "Arguments" tab. Add jTracert parameters to "VM arguments" section (something like -javaagent:/home/dmitrybedrin/work/jtracert/deploy/jTracert.jar) Click on "Run" button. You will see the following in the "Console" tab: jTracert agent started Waiting for a connection from jTracert GUI on port 7007 Now execute jTracert gui and connect to the jTracert agent. That's it - you will see the sequence diagrams now!
