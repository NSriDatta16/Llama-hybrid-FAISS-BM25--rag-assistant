Partially answered in comments: In a nutshell, you appear to be asking "is it ok if I just make up all my data?" I suppose that depends on what the simulation is for. If it's an educational exercise, then go and have fun. But if you hope to derive any information from it about activity patterns, then this looks like the archetype of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out . – whuber Agree w/ whuber. Just want to add that, if you're going to make up the the transition probabilities, then you at least have to respect the constraints of the physical system. For example, it shouldn't be possible to teleport between rooms, meaning that transition probabilities can only be nonzero between adjacent rooms. You also can't get 'stuck' in a room (hopefully!) so the Markov chain shouldn't contain any absorbing states. – user20160
