A possible solution would be to setup the expire headers to the past and make sure that the browser does not cache nay json via cache-control haders for json files and You can try to add this to your apache config file : Header set Cache-Control "max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" Header set Pragma "no-cache" Header set Expires "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT" The mod_headers module will need to be installed in Apache to use this method. If you are interested you can have a read at the roots http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9
