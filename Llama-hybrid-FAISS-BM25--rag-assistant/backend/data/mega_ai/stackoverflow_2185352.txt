How do I design the file storage issue?

I am working on an application that creates video files and stores them in a folder in the C:\ drive. I speculate that there will be a large number of these files in the future and we would run out of disk space at some point of time (on our VPS). When the time comes that we have to upgrade, we either plan to use one of the Cloud providers to store files or our existing provider can add another disk (say D:\ drive). Either way, I would want to design the app now in a way that in future, moving to different locations would not be an issue and would be transparent to the end user. The code that creates these files supports 2 ways: myObj.SetOutputToDisk( ); or myObj.SetOutputToMemoryStream(ms); If we go with the Cloud architecture, I assume we might have the following combination: Cloud Files + Existing VPS or Cloud Files + Cloud Windows Server Given the unknowns at this time, how would I go about designing this?
