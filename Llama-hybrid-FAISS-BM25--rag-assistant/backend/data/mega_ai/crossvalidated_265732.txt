How to address underdispersion in a GLMM

I've read a few entries about underdispersion in count or binomial data, relating to poisson and binomial probability distributions. However, I haven't been able to find any information about gaussian distributions with underdispersed data. I am currently analysing the average annual change in population size (位). I have used other metrics of change in population size, but there are reasons I have decided to move forward using average-位. Below is the distribution of average-位 values. When I start building a GLMM, I typically start with a GLM and slowly increase the complexity until I get to the GLMM, just so I can see where the problems arise. Thus, using the formula: glm(formula = avg_lamda ~ Total_Threats, family = "gaussian", data = x5yr_data) Output below: Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.200553 -0.019402 0.001415 0.021470 0.205119 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.003944 0.002927 1.348 0.178310 Total_Threats1 -0.021170 0.005910 -3.582 0.000372 *** Total_Threats2 -0.021339 0.005861 -3.641 0.000299 *** Total_Threats3 -0.012737 0.006340 -2.009 0.045053 * --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 (Dispersion parameter for gaussian family taken to be 0.002372469) Null deviance: 1.3082 on 533 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 1.2574 on 530 degrees of freedom AIC: -1706 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 2 My question is how would I transform the data average-位 values so that my dispersion becomes more acceptable? I will also be using this data in much more complex models testing threat interaction so I will need to fix this before I get to what I am suspecting will be much more complex models. Thank you for your time.
