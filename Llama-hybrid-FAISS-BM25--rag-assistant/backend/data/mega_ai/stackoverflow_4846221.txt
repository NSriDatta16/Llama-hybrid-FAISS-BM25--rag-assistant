Detect and remove comments from beginning of a file

Discount 's configure.sh script generates some dynamic comments at the start of the config.h file: /* * configuration for markdown, generated Fri 28 Jan 2011 16:13:46 EST * by tim@Orion.local */ #ifndef __AC_MARKDOWN_D #define __AC_MARKDOWN_D 1 [...] Which makes for some useless patches when embedding discount inside a git project, so I remove them before committing. I want to automate the output from configure.sh so I can upgrade discount inside the project quicker, but I'm not that well versed with awk/sed. I've got this line in my script: tail -n +5 config.h > ../discount-config/config.h But I'd like to replace this with something more future-proof, so it won't mangle the file if later versions of discount have more/less than 4 lines of comments.
