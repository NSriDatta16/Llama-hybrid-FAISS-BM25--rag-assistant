Yes, you can do this with winpcap. It should work on Windows 7 (though you may have to get a beta version of it). This is all I could find for doing it in delphi: http://www.magsys.co.uk/delphi/magmonsock.asp I don't know how well that works with the latest version of winpcap though. I'd seriously consider just doing it in C or C++.
