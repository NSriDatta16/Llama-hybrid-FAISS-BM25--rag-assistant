Instead of confidence intervals, Bayesian analysis uses credible intervals. So you could take a particular bound that you think is significant and calculate the percentage that the parameter falls in that region. I find credible intervals far more intuitive than frequentist confidence intervals. Also, since you're doing a MCMC, you can also plot histograms of the parameter values to get a sense of how different the posterior is from any quantity of interest, such as zero.
