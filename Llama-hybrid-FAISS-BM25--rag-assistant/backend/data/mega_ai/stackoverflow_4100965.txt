Hold down CTRL and drag a control to duplicate it. NOTE: Be careful, if your control has an event handler that was created by the designer, it will associate your newly created control with the event handler as well as the old control. Use the keyboard shortcut F7 to go from the designer view to the code view, and Shift-F7 to go from the code view to the designer view.

It's especially useful when you're working with docking controls. You can also move a child control to a different parent, or take it out of a container control, or move a parent into a container, etc... View -> Other Windows -> Document Outline The "Layout" toolbar is great for lining things up to make a clean looking user interface. View -> Toolbars -> Layout
