C++: can an int be assigned a char*?

I am reading chapter 2 of Advanced Linux Programming: http://www.advancedlinuxprogramming.com/alp-folder/alp-ch02-writing-good-gnu-linux-software.pdf In the section 2.1.3 Using getopt_long , there is an example program that goes a bit like this: int main (int argc, char* argv[]) { int next_option; // ... do { next_option = getopt_long (argc, argv, short_options, long_options, NULL); switch (next_option) { case ‘h’: /* -h or --help */ // ... } // ... The bit that caught my attention is that next_option is declared as an int. The function getopt_long() apparently returns an int representing the short command line argument which is used in the following switch statement. How come that integer can be compared to a character in the switch statement? Is there an implicit conversion from a char (a single character?) to an int? How is the code above valid? (see full code in linked pdf)
