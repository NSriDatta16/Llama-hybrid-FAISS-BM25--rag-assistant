A few more books worth reading (in no particular order): Aha! Insight (Martin Gardner) Any of the Programming Pearls books (Jon Bentley) Concrete Mathematics (Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik) A Mathematical Theory of Communication (Claude Shannon) Of course, most of those are just samples -- other books and papers by the same authors are usually quite good as well (e.g. Shannon wrote a lot that's well worth reading, and far too few people give it the attention it deserves).
