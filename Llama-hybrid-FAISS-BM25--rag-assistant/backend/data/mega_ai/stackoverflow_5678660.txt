How to correct the spelling of app name in App Store?

I know this may be impossible but... I just got an app approved, and everywhere (that I can see) it is capitalized correctly - it's called "Daybreak", but when you download it, the name under the icon is "daybreak". I let Xcode take care of all that naming stuff this time, so I'm not sure where it got changed, or where the app store is taking the app name from. Like I said, every where else it is correct - just not under the icon in my phone! [EDIT] One other place it shows up lower case is in the organizer for its archive. On the left it's lower case; when selected, it's lower case in the large font at the top of the details, and upper case just below that... [EDIT] I should mention that I'm using Xcode 4... [EDIT] The following are from my target's info tab: Bundle display name ${PRODUCT_NAME} Bundle identifier com.lollygaggersoft.${PRODUCT_NAME:rfc1034identifier} [EDIT] I was able to fix the issue by manually changing my Bundle display name to the correct capitalization and leaving the Bundle identifier alone. This worked when I submitted my update.
