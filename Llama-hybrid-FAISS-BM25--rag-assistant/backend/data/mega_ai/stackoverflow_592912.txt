I assume if you use a List, hibernate assumes that the order is important, and it will deduce the order of elements from the rows returned, but if you join with a nother table hibernate will get each campaign multiple times which confuses hibernate. Again, I am just assuming this This is expected behavior Use a RootEntityResultTransformer to get a single root entity: http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/v3/api/org/hibernate/transform/RootEntityResultTransformer.html
