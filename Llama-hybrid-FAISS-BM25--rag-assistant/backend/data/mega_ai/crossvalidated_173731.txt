Compare one level vs the others in regression

We have a set of exclusive mutations on a set of genes. We would like to estimate the influence of such mutations on a certain syndrome. Our main problem is how to model the comparison between mutations. I would like to have your opinion on different ways to model this problem: Perform a regression for each mutation in which the predictor is dichotomized as having or not having the mutation. The pro is that I can assess the effect of each single mutation, the cons is the multiplication of analysis. Perform a multiple regression in which each yes/no mutation variable is used as covariate. Pro: one analysis. Cons: How do you interpret the adjustment? What is the intercept, considering that the mutations are mutually exclusive? Perform a regression with a "mutation" predictor whose contrast allows to compare each level against the average of the others. Pro: very clean and easy to interpret. Cons: I don't know how to implement such contrast in R.
