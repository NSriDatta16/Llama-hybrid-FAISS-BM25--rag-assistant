You could, but keep in mind that the errors would propagate , so each new model you stack adds to the uncertainty of the end result. But why would you do that? Your description lacks details, but it sounds as if you could achieve the same thing by either directly using the results you have or modifying the model to give you the result that you want. If you want to compare growth rates estimated by the model between groups, you can simply look at the overlap between posterior distributions of the estimates to get your answer directly. The simplest approach possible would be to plot the distributions of the predicted growth rates between the groups (e.g. kernel densities plotted with different colors per group), but you may also take a more formal approach and calculate some kind of Bayesian $p$ -values .
