Deep learning models for unsupervised semantic segmentation

I am working on semantic segmentation for satellite images using keras and python. It is my understanding that popular models like U-Net require mask images (labels). Are there any unsupervised deep learning models for semantic segmentation that work without mask images? Can we implement unsupervised learning by deep learning models?
