Multiple testng.xmls in the same IntelliJ run configuration?

I have a project that has two different modules each with its own set of testng tests. I have separate run config's with code coverage enabled for each. I need to run both to gather coverage statistics and was wondering if there was a way to consolidate the coverage data in to a single session. Is it possible to create a run configuration in IntelliJ that executes the two different testng.xml's?
