There are a number of problems in there and nobody will be able to tackle everything in a short answer or spare you the trouble of learning and reading about whatever techniques you end up using. Your description also raises many questions and is not entirely clear. Generally speaking, it would seem common to directly analyze the original items (without “parcelling”), aiming at recovering the hypothesized dimensions (e.g. “be altruistic” or “start a business”) and use and interpret the resulting scales scores. Also, since you seem to be trying to extract measures of some latent constructs like “altruistic motivation”, factor analysis would seem more appropriate than PCA. You can find a lot of relevant material on this site but Factor analysis of questionnaires composed of Likert items seems particularly relevant. In any case the following paper should directly address the specific question you formulated at the end: DiStefano, C., Zhu, M., & Mîndrilă, D. (2009). Understanding and Using Factor Scores: Considerations for the Applied Researcher. Practical Assessment, Research & Evaluation, 14 (20).
