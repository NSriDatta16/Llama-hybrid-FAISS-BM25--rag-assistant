Is it true that a (simple) exponential smoothing model with alpha (smoothing constant) = 1 is the same as MA(1), which is in turn the same as a random walk model? (i.e. using only the most recent observation as the forecast for all future periods)? No, it is not. Here are the forecasts by the three models: Simple exponential smoothing (SES; see section 7.1 of Hyndman & Athanasopoulos "Forecasting: Principles and Practice"): $$ \hat x_{t+1|t} = \alpha x_t + \alpha(1-\alpha)x_{t-1} + \alpha(1-\alpha)^2 x_{t-2} + \alpha(1-\alpha)^3 x_{t-3} + \dots $$ Moving average of order 1 (MA(1); see section 8.4 of the same textbook): $$ \hat x_{t+1|t} = \mu + \alpha\hat\varepsilon_t $$ where $\varepsilon_t = x_t - \hat x_{t-1}$ . By iterated substitution, $$ \hat x_{t+1|t} = \mu(1-\alpha+\alpha^2-\alpha^3+\dots) + \alpha x_{t-1} - \alpha^2 x_{t-2} + \alpha^3 x_{t-3} - \dots $$ Random walk (RW): $$ \hat x_{t+1|t} = x_t. $$ As you can see, they are all quite different. It is only RW that uses the most recent observation as the forecast for all future periods. Meanwhile, both SES and MA(1) (implicitly) use a linear combination of all past observations to forecast the future. When $\alpha=1$ for SES (but not for MA(1)), you get SES: $\hat x_{t+1|t} = x_t$ . Hence, there SES coincides with RW but MA(1) is different. Also, even if we take $\alpha=1$ for MA(1), it still does not coincide with SES or RW. However, if you replaced MA(1) with AR(1), then your conjecture would be correct. Edit: If by MA(1) you mean moving average of one element rather than the moving average model of order 1 (which it is the standard notation for), then indeed that forecast will coincide with the RW and SES forecasts under $\alpha=1$ .
