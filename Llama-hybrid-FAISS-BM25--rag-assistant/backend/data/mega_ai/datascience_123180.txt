How to train multiple inputs for my model?

I'm a high school student and a newbie in Machine Learning. I just learned Machine Learning Crash Course by Google so my knowledge's still limited. I'm trying to build an Object Detection by myself and get into trouble. That is, I have a dataset as below: xmin ymin xmax ymax name 0 31 155 56 179 pendulum 1 157 150 178 172 pendulum 2 151 65 173 88 pendulum 3 67 32 88 54 pendulum 4 178 214 212 246 pendulum .. ... ... ... ... ... 42 93 225 108 244 pendulum 43 133 246 151 262 pendulum 44 59 175 71 188 pendulum 45 176 113 190 126 pendulum 46 114 87 124 99 pendulum [47 rows x 5 columns] And my question is How do I train all of these features xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax to my model? In Machine Learning Crash Course I just learned how to train a model with a single feature, so in this case, I'm so confused. Hope everyone helps me
