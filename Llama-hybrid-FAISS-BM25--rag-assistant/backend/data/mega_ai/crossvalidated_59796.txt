Clustering mixed variables in SAS

I have following variables in my dataset: Working hours (numerical:ordinal) Effectiveness (categorical:ordinal ; 4 values-> (poor,average,good,best)) Satisfaction (categorical:ordinal ; 4 values-> (poor,average,good,best)) I want to cluster the data on the basis of how good is my worker. I am expecting 4-5 clusters effectively. I ran fastclus in sas after normalising my data (mean=0 std=1) But i doubt the k means will work on categorical variables. I have getting an Rsqaure value of 62% when i have 5 clusters. Any help on how to go about this problem?
