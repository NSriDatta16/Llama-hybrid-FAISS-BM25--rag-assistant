The query you say you are submitting bears little resemblance to the table structure you have given us! What is Table D.national_regionID ? Or modx.coverage_state ? Generally though don't mix left and right joins. Also every table used in the query must either follow the FROM or follow a JOIN . You seem to be using Table B and Table C in join conditions without ever adding them to the query.
