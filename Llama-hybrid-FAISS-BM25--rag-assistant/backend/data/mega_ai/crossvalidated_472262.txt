Should independent variables measured only once per set of replcations be duplicated in the data?

I have a dataset from an experiment on soil erosion, where soil samples a , b and c where collected, and measurement of an independent soil property x was taken for each soil sample, such as in the following small example: type x 1 a 1.7 2 b 1.9 3 c 1.9 Next, four sub-samples from the each soil sample were subject to an experiment on soil erosion, where soil erosion metric y was measured. Technically, the "bucket" with each soil sample was divided to four sub-samples 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , then y was measured in each sub-sample: type repl y 1 a 1 1.3 2 a 2 1.6 3 a 3 1.4 4 a 4 1.2 5 b 1 2.3 6 b 2 2.2 7 b 3 2.1 8 b 4 2.0 9 c 1 1.7 10 c 2 2.1 11 c 3 1.5 12 c 4 1.2 My question is: when analyzing the effects of x on y , such as using lm in R, which approach is more correct, (A) or (B)? (A) Analyzing all 12 observations, while duplicating the measurement of x for each set of four sub-samples: type repl x y 1 a 1 1.7 1.3 2 a 2 1.7 1.6 3 a 3 1.7 1.4 4 a 4 1.7 1.2 5 b 1 1.9 2.3 6 b 2 1.9 2.2 7 b 3 1.9 2.1 8 b 4 1.9 2.0 9 c 1 1.9 1.7 10 c 2 1.9 2.1 11 c 3 1.9 1.5 12 c 4 1.9 1.2 (B) Analyzing the three observations, where outcome y is averaged : type x y 1 a 1.7 1.375 2 b 1.9 2.150 3 c 1.9 1.625 P.S. If the answer is (A), is it necessary to treat type as a random effect? Thank you very much for any help or guidance.
