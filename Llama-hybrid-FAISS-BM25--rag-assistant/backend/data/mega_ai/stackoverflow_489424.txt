An array would probably do the job, but it is not exactly elegant. Do you have a class with some collections with the different type of items in? Another solution that's a little more precise is using a Dictionary Dictionary numberOfEach = new Dictionary (); numberOfEach.Add("balloons", 2); numberOfEach.Add("cupcakes", 4); Then you'll have a method in your class (the one with the collections) public bool correctAmmounts(Dictionary numberOfEach) { return collection1.Count == numberOfEach["balloons"] && collection2.Count == numberOfEach["cupcakes"]; } Where collection1 has some balloons and collection2 has some cupcakes. You'll have to edit your method if the number of different types change, though.
