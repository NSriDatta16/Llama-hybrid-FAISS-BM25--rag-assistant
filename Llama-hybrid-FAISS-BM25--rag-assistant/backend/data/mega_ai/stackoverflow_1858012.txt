Techniques to speed up Magento on a shared host

I have an established Magento site that is only just starting to get complaints about its performance. It's on a shared server. The internal server-side cache is also enabled. Some of the problems I have noticed are Many HTTP Requests No minification of CSS or JavaScript. No CSS sprites Shared server isn't recommended for Magento, or so I've read Unfortunately, I can not get a dedicated host and I don't want to hack the codebase to minify all JS/CSS. Is there any plugins that will minify CSS / JS? Do you have any experience with speeding up Magento's performance?
