Using cache systems for session storage?

Say I have a caching system that i can use for storing sessions: // example i have a cache class $memcached->add('key','value'); // then i can get the session from $memcached->get('key'); What are the advantages and disadvantages of using caching (e.g. memcached, maybe Redis can fit in, or other things) for sessions rather than using PHP's built-in sessions?
