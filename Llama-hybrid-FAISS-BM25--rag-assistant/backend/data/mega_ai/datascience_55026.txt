Is it possible to predict using fewer number of features than the number of features that was used in training the model?

I'm making a model using sklearn.svm.SVC that would predict machine performance ( ErrorID ). For the training of the model, I'm using 6 features, namely, EmployeeID , JobID , MachineID , Speed , RunningDateandTime , Meters and passing in ErrorID as labels. Now for the prediction, I only have RunningDateandTime because I want to predict the performance in the future. But the model won't accept it because the number of features at the time of training and the number of features at the time of prediction is not same. Is there any way to force the model to predict using only 1 feature while being trained on 5 features?
