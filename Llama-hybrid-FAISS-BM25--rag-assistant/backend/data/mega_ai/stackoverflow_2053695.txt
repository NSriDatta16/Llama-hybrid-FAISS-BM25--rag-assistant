disabling a javascript script when loaded on a smart phone

I am using the following HTML fragment to load a different stylesheet for smartphones: media="only screen and (min-device-width: 4801x)" media="only screen and (max-device-width: 480px)" I would like to disable a certain javascript script for smartphone users as well. Is that possible? I don't think i can do: Thanks
