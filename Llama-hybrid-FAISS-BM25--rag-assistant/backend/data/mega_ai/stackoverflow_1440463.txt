Here are some simple pointers for usability in your typography . These things mainly address readability and accessibility concerns. DOs: Use relative font sizing (em) Identify language changes within a document using the LANG attribute Black text on a white background For headings, use H1, H2, etc. and nest them appropriately Chunk up content and organize with headings that fit what your users are looking for Write clear and simple copy Align left, ragged right Text-to-background color must be high contrast DONTs: Use "click here" or "more" as link text Use underline for emphasis More than 2 font-type families Italics Blocks of text using all caps Use true red or true blue text on white background (chromatic aberration)
