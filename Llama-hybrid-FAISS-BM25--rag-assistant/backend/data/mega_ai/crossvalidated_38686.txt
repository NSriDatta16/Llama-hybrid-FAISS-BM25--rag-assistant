In addition to Peter's great answer, here are some answers to your specific questions: Who to trust will depend also on who is doing the poll and what effort they put into getting a good quality poll. A bigger sample size is not better if the sample is not representative, taking a huge poll, but only in one, non-swing state would not give very good results. There is a relationship between sample size and the width of the confidence interval, but other things also influence the width, such as how close the percentage is to 0, 1, or 0.5; what bias adjustments were used, how the sample was taken (clustering, stratification, etc.). The general rule is that the width of the confidence interval will be proportional to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ , so to halve the interval you need 4 times the sample size. If you know enough about how the sample was collected and what formula was used to compute the interval then you could solve for the standard deviation (you also need to know the confidence level being used, usually 0.05). But the formula is different for stratified vs. cluster samples. Also most polls look at percentages, so would use the binomial distribution. There are ways to combine the information, but you would generally need to know something about how the samples were collected, or be willing to make some form of assumptions about how the intervals were constructed. A Bayesian approach is one way.
