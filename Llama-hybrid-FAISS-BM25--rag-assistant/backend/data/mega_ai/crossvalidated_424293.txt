Your objective can be achieved using an R package "glmnet". It is a machine learning package in R that fits generalized linear models via penalized maximum likelihood. But, it also allows coefficients to be constrained. This can be used to solve your problem. For more details please follow the link below: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html Coming back to your problem, glmnet works only on matrices so please be sure to get all your data in the matrix form. Create two separate matrices one for the predictors (X) and another for the response (Y). Run the following code: library(glmnet) loReg The above line will create a logistic model with penalizing coefficient equal to zero (which is what you want). Since the lower limit of all of your variables is the same (i.e. zero), setting lower.limits=0 will do the job. To predict new observation : Suppose you want to predict m new observations. Get these observations in an mxp matrix, where p is the number of predictors. Let this matrix of new observations be newX. predict(loReg, newx = newX, type="response") Hope this would help.
