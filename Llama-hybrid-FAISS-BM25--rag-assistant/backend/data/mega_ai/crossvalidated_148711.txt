multi-class logistic regression for ordered labels

I have a set of labells: A - no lesion B - mild C - severe If an instance from a class predicted as its nearest class not a big problem compare to an instance predicted as a compeletely different class. For e.g. if A predicted as B is not a big problem compared to A predicted as C. Are there any methods to do this? could you please suggest some readings and any public code to do this?
