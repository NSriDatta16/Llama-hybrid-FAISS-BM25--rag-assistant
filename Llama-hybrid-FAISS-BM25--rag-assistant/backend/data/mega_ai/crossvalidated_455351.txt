Named entity recognition with only one pure entity(no context)?

We know that we can extract entities from a sentence using named entity recognition, but what if the sentence contains only an entity and no other context? For example, we can use CRF for the following sentence : Conditional random fields (CRFs) are a class of statistical modeling method often applied in pattern recognition and machine learning and used for structured prediction. to extract Conditional random fields , statistical modeling , pattern recognition and etc from the sentence if we train our model with labeled data to do that. But what if the sentences look like the following three? Sentence 1: Conditional random fields Sentence 2: statistical modeling Sentence 3: Donald J. Trump Can we use CRF again to recognize them respectively as "algorithm", "algorithm", "politician"? If not, how can we tackle that?
