No. Neurons are not data, the brain is not data. It's all spatial/quantum/?? stuff, possibly infinitely complex depending on how deep you want to go. This cannot be represented as data, and can only be processed in its own context. From Wikipedia: In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. If you represent a neural network in a computer, then yes. It's a very poor abstraction. Can you even call it a proper neural network? If you have a queue of people, you wouldn't call it a queue of data items, or even a data structure.
