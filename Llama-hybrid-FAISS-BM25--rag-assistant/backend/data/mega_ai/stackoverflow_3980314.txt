I would use Bayesian filtering featurizing misspellings that are combinations of alphas and other characters (e.g. all of the examples you've provided). This has the decided benefit that it "learns" over time, but needs to be fed an initial training set before it can produce useful results. To fit your needs you would set the threshold for matching low so you'd get false positives that you'd have to allow (and hopefully the algorithm would not allow through too many false negatives). Toby Segaran's Programming Collective Intelligence provides a good explanation and Python code for making this work.
