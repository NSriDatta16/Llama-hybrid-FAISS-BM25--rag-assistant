SQL Server table structure for storing a large number of images

What's the best practice for storing a large amount of image data in SQL Server 2008? I'm expecting to store around 50,000 images using approx 5 gigs of storage space. Currently I'm doing this using a single table with the columns: ID: int/PK/identity Picture: Image Thumbnail: Image UploadDate: DateTime I'm concerned because at around 10% of my expected total capacity it seems like inserts are taking a long time. A typical image is around 20k - 30k. Is there a better logical structure to store this data? Or do I need to look into clustering or some other IT solution to accommodate the data load?
