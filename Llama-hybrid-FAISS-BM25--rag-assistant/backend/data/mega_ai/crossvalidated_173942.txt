I suppose you are interested in obtaining a confidence interval for the true mean of a distribution with bounded support (although your post does not mention the mean at any point...) If your sample size is not tiny, then Student intervals will provide usually an excellent approximation (Central Limit Theorem, no heavy tails). To illustrate this, we can simulate from a beta distribution with known mean, compute the t-confidence interval and check in each run if the interval contains the mean $\mu$ (which is 1/3 in the example below). n So the real coverage probability is almost exactly identical to the nominal coverage of 0.95 even if the underlying is not normal but asymmetric beta. Histogram and boxplot in the last run of the simulation are looking as follows: If we run above simulation with tiny sample sizes, we get the following coverage probabilities: 0.9399 ($n = 5$) 0.9365 ($n = 4$) 0.9403 ($n = 3$) 0.943 ($n = 2$)
