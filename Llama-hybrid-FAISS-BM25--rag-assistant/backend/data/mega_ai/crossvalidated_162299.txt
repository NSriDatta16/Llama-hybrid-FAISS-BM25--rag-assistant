How to build the structure of a Bayesian Network

I have some traffic-related data which has been used originally for regression with bicycle as the dependent variable. The data-set consists of the following variables: Does the person go to work by bicycle (bicycle)? Age of the person Gender of the person Is the person corpulent (obese)? Temperature Wind Rain Number of cars in household How can I manually build a Bayesian network structure from these variables? To my understanding, all of these variables except the bicycle are mostly unrelated and hence the network structure would be close to trivial. Is such a data set not amenable to Bayesian networks?
