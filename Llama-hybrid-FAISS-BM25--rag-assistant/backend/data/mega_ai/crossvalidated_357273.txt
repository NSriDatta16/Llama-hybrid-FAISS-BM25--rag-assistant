As I read it, this question is asking two somewhat orthogonal questions. One is should one use MAP-estimators over posterior means, and the other is whether one should MCMC if the posterior has an analytical form. In regards to MAP estimators over posterior means, from a theoretical perspective, posterior means are generally preferred, as @Xian notes in his answer. The real advantage to MAP estimators is that, especially in the more typical case where the posterior is not in closed form, they can be calculated much faster (i.e. several orders of magnitude) than an estimate of the posterior mean. If the posterior is approximately symmetric (which often the case in many problems with large sample sizes), then MAP estimate should be very close to the posterior mean. So the attractiveness of the MAP is actually that it can be a very cheap approximation of the posterior mean. Note that knowing the normalizing constant doesn't help us find the posterior mode, so having a closed form solution for the posterior technically doesn't help us find the MAP estimate, outside the case where we recognize the posterior as a specific distribution for which we know it's mode. In regards to the second question, if one has a closed form the posterior distribution, generally speaking there's no reason to use MCMC algorithms. Theoretically, if you had a closed form solution for the posterior distribution, but didn't have a closed form for the mean of some function and couldn't take draws directly from this closed form distribution, then one might turn to MCMC algorithms. But I'm not aware of any cases of this situation.
