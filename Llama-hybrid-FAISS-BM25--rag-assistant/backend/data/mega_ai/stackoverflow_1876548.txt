I tend to work my hardest to not write any type of caching code. I leverage caching capabilities of other libraries such as StructureMap to handle both my dependency injection and caching needs. It provides a caching scope called Hybrid which will use ThreadLocal or HttpContext depending on where it's called from. It makes testing so much more effective.
