Averaging Correlations

I am working with patient experience data where patients answer questions regarding their stay at the hospital. Each question is then given a correlation value as it relates to the final "overall experience" question. The data is in 6 month intervals with each question having different correlation values for each 6 month interval. How can I get one correlation value for 2 years worth of data from four 6 month intervals, i.e., four correlation values?
