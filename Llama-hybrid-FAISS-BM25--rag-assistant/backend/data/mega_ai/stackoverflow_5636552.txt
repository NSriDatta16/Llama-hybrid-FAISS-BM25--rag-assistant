Drupal 6 - Content profile fields within page-user.tpl.php

Going a bit mad here... :) I'm just trying to add CCK fields from a Content Profile content type into page-user.tpl.php (I'm creating a highly-themed user profile page). There seem to be two methods, both of which have a unique disadvantage that I can't seem to overcome: '$content profile' method. $var = $content_profile->get_variables('profile'); print $var['field_last_name'][0]['safe']; This is great, except I can't seem to pass the currently viewed user into $content_profile, and it therefore always shows the logged in user. '$content profile load' method. $account_id = arg(1); $account = user_load($account_id); $user_id = $account->uid; $var = content_profile_load('profile', $user_id); print $var->field_first_name[0]['value']; Fine, but now I can't access the full rendered fields, only the plain values (i.e. if the field has paragraphs they won't show up). How can I have both things at once? In other words how can I show fields relating to the currently viewed user that are also rendered (the 'safe' format in 1)? I've Googled and Googled and I just end up going round in circles. :( Cheers, James
