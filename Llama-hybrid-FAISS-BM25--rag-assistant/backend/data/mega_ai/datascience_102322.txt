If you are planning to use it in a Neural Network, it might also be a good idea to get rid of outliers. Distance column has a max of 50, but a %75 of 2.23. You probably should get rid of the rows where distance is too high. And most of your data is categorical, only "Distance" has continuous values so it might be a good idea turn it into a categorical variable as well, and do one-hot-encoding or label encoding on all data instead.
