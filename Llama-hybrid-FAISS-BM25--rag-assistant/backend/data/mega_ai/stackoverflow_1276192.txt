Evidently, batch files can have multiple objects dropped onto them. See this question . You should be able to adapt the answer to your needs. I do wonder if there is a maximum number of characters that can be passed in, though, so you might not be able to drag thousands of files onto it. Possibly not even hundreds. But definitely multiple. EDIT: In your comment to dmercredi's answer, you mention wildcards. If you don't need the drag/drop capability and just want to specify *.drag in your batch file, check out this question instead. There are a variety of answers there that may suit your needs.
