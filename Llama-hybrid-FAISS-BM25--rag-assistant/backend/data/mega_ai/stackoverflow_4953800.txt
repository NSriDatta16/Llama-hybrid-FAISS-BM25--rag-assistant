In local machine, you can be well sure of yourself that you need to organize each project of yours in a folder in the " htdocs " directory. This is of utmost importance to keep all the projects nicely so that you can later on reference all your projects easily. When " tutorials are saying that you need to place all the files (in the WordPress folder) into the htdocs folder (without a sub-directory) ", they mostly mean about the live server & not about the development server. Also please check the ".htaccess" file of the root directory of each project, for the " Site URL " or the " Rewrite Base ", when you are configuring multiple projects in the " htdocs " folder, so that each of the projects run smoothly. And you should also check that each project is running smoothly, which have been kept in the " htdocs " folder. Hope it helps.
