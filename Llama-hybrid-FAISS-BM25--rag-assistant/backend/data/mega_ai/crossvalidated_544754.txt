The test performed in grangertest is to compare a model with (lagged versions of) X3 and X1 against a model with just X1. This model comparison is performed using a Wald test, which may aid you in finding details about the comparison. The null hypothesis is that the "full model" including X3 or X2 as well as X1 is not any more predictive than a model predicting X1 using just (lagged) X1. Differing levels of significance represent levels of confidence in your rejection of the null, just as they would with any other statistical test. Non-significant results mean, as it would with any other statistical test, that you cannot reject the null. That is, there is not sufficient evidence in the data to say that the full model is more predictive than the simpler model, nor to be able to suggest that X forecasts Y. I imagine with a larger dataset it might be useful to plot (lagged) time series beside each other. Something like this: my_example
