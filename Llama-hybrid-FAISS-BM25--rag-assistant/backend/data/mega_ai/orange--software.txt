Orange is an open-source data visualization, machine learning and data mining toolkit. It features a visual programming front-end for exploratory qualitative data analysis and interactive data visualization. Description Orange is a component-based visual programming software package for data visualization, machine learning, data mining, and data analysis. Orange components are called widgets. They range from simple data visualization, subset selection, and preprocessing to empirical evaluation of learning algorithms and predictive modeling. Visual programming is implemented through an interface in which workflows are created by linking predefined or user-designed widgets, while advanced users can use Orange as a Python library for data manipulation and widget alteration. Software Orange is an open-source software package released under GPL and hosted on GitHub. Versions up to 3.0 include core components in C++ with wrappers in Python. From version 3.0 onwards, Orange uses common Python open-source libraries for scientific computing, such as numpy, scipy and scikit-learn, while its graphical user interface operates within the cross-platform Qt framework. The default installation includes a number of machine learning, preprocessing and data visualization algorithms in 6 widget sets (data, transform, visualize, model, evaluate and unsupervised). Additional functionalities are available as add-ons (text-mining, image analytics, bioinformatics, etc.). Orange is supported on macOS, Windows and Linux and can also be installed from the Python Package Index repository (pip install Orange3). Features Orange consists of a canvas interface onto which the user places widgets and creates a data analysis workflow. Widgets offer basic functionalities such as reading the data, showing a data table, selecting features, training predictors, comparing learning algorithms, visualizing data elements, etc. The user can interactively explore visualizations or feed the selected subset into other widgets. Canvas: graphical front-end for data analysis Widgets: Data: widgets for data input, data filtering, sampling, imputation, feature manipulation and feature selection Visualize: widgets for common visualization (box plot, histograms, scatter plot) and multivariate visualization (mosaic display, sieve diagram). Classify: a set of supervised machine learning algorithms for classification Regression: a set of supervised machine learning algorithms for regression Evaluate: cross-validation, sampling-based procedures, reliability estimation and scoring of prediction methods Unsupervised: unsupervised learning algorithms for clustering (k-means, hierarchical clustering) and data projection techniques (multidimensional scaling, principal component analysis, correspondence analysis). Add-ons Orange users can extend their core set of components with components in the add-ons. Supported add-ons include: Associate: components for mining frequent itemsets and association rule learning. Bioinformatics: components for gene expression analysis, enrichment, and access to expression databases (e.g., Gene Expression Omnibus) and pathway libraries. Data fusion: components for fusing different data sets, collective matrix factorization, and exploration of latent factors. Educational: components for teaching machine learning concepts, such as k-means clustering, polynomial regression, stochastic gradient descent, ... Explain: provides an extension with components for the model explanation, including Shapley value analysis Geo: components for working with geospatial data. Image analytics: components for working with images and ImageNet embeddings Network: components for graph and network analysis. Text mining: components for natural language processing and text mining. Time series: widget components for time series analysis and modeling. Single-cell: support for single-cell gene expression analysis, including components for loading single-cell data, filtering and batch effe
