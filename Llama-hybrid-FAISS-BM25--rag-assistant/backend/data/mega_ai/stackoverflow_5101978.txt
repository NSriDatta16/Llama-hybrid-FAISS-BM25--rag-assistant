I'm also think that just setup local Jenkins is a best idea. What tool you use for build? Maybe you can improve you situation with switching to Maven as build tool? In more smart and don't recompile full project if you don't ask it directly. But switch to in can be HUGE paint in the neck - it hardly depends on how you project organized now... And about VCS- exist Mercurial/SVN bridge - so you can use local Mercurial for you development .... check this link: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/WorkingWithSubversion
