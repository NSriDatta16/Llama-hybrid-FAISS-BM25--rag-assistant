Is there a rule of thumb when designing neural network in deep reinforcement learning?

In deep learning, we can assess model's performance with loss function value and improve model's performance with K-fold cross-validation and so on. But how can we design and tune neural network used in deep reinforcement learning? We can assess reinforcement learning algorithm's performance itself with rewards and so on, but how can we be sure that neural network used in reinforcement learning algorithm is good or bad ?
