Is it possible to reference a file stored in Isolated Storage by its URI?

Using this previous question as motivation, I would like to temporarily store images and videos in Isolated Storage. My application (written in WPF/C#) will allow a user to review these temporarily stored items by viewing their contents in a MediaElement . I was hoping to set the MediaElement's Source Property to a video or image's URI stored in IsolatedStorage but I cannot figure out how to dynamically create a URI since it doesn't appear to be naively supported by IsolatedStorage. Any help would be greatly appreciated - thank you in advance! Update - 1/21/09 After battling the issue for a day, I concluded that the Isolated Storage approach is not practical for storing large video files that need to be referenced by a Uri.
