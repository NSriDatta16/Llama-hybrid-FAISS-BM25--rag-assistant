Let's have a look at two vectors, the first being 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 and the second vector being 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 6 2 Calculating the Pearson correlation you'll get cor(a,b) [1] -1 However if you take the average of successive pairs for values both vectors are identical. Identical vectors have correlation 1. 4 4 4 4 4 4 This simple example illustrates a downside of your method. Edit : To explain it more generally: The correlation coefficient is computed in the following way. $\frac{E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]}{\sigma_X\ \sigma_Y}$ Averaging some $X$s and some $Y$s changes the differences between $X$ and $\mu_X$ as well as the difference between $Y$ and $\mu_Y$.
