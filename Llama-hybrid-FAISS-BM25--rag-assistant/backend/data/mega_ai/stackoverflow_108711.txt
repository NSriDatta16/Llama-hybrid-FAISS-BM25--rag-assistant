I'm not aware of any readily available library or class that does this. This may mainly be because I don't care as I am on the side of strongly opposing such tests. So even though you asked there must be a bit of justification for this view: I doubt that autotesting getters and setters benefit your code quality or your coverage: Either these methods are used from other code (and tested there, e.g. 100% covered) or not used at all (and could be removed). In the end you'll leave getters and setters in because they are used from the test but nowhere else in the application. It should be easy to write such a test, e.g. with Apache Commons BeanUtils, but I doubt you really need it if you have good tests otherwise.
