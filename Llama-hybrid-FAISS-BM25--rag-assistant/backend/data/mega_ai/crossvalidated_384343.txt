Algorithms for Graphs Clustering

Which methods is available for graph clustering? The most information by query "Graph clustering" concentrated on the finding set of nodes in the one large graph (or graph partition), but it isn't my case. But I interested in classical clustering task: I have a set of graphs, and I'd like to group this graphs in groups. Which methods are available for this task? I already read about graph embeddings, but this is comparatively new approach, and I think, that exists another approaches. In particular, I have a set of trees with different structure, and I'd like to separate them into groups.
