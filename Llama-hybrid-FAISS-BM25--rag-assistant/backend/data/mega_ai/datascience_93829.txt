Testing trained model on the image from the test set

I trained my EfficientNet (CNN) and got accuracy=0.73. The question is how to check it on one concrete image from the testing set? How to write a code in python for it? I described the testing set this way: testing_data = np.load("testing_data.npy", allow_pickle = True) test_X = torch.Tensor([i[0] for i in testing_data]).view(-1, 3, 224, 224) test_y = torch.Tensor([i[1] for i in testing_data]) This one ( https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html ch5) doesn't work for me because I didn't use torch.utils.data.DataLoader in the previous code. My model is called net. I only tried something like this: net(test_X[0]) but got an error: RuntimeError: Expected 4-dimensional input for 4-dimensional weight [32, 3, 3, 3], but got 3-dimensional input of size [3, 224, 224] instead
