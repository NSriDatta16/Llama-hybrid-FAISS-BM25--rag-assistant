How should I save scores and settings on android?

I'm creating the specification for a game I'm about to start creating on android, my main concern is how should I keep scores and settings on android? I assume they would be two different things. The game has players that will have their settings and scores stored and then a settings menu (for the person setting up the game, not necessarily the player). How would I go about storing these things? What type of data storage means should I be looking into?
