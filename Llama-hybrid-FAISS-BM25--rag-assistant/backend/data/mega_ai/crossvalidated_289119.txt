You could use a linear mixed model to analyse this. You can include whatever covariates you are interested in (age, gender etc). I specify a mixed model because you have both eyes for some patients; you can account for this by including 'patient id' as a random intercept. This will implicitly estimate a mean effect per patient (as suggested by @Łukasz Deryło) without any manual averaging step. I do not know how to use STATA, but this is a reasonably simple model and should be easy to execute.
