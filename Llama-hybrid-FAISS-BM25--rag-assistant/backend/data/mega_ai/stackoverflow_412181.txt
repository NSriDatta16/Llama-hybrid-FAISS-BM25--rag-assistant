We know so much about the right OO techniques. Decoupling, programming by contract, avoiding improper inheritance, appropriate use of exceptions, open/closed principal, Liskov substitutability, and so on. Any yet, the .Net frameworks do not employ best practices. To me the single biggest flaw in the design of .Net is not standing on the shoulders of giants; promoting less than ideal programming paradigms to the masses of programmers that use their frameworks . If MS paid attention to this, the software engineering world could have made great leaps in terms of quality, stability and scalability in this decade, but alas, it seems to be regressing.
