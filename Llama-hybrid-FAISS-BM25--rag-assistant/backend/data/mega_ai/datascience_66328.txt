I was looking your hyper-parameters, seems ok, maybe the min epsilon is to high but don't think this is the problem. Your reward scheme is not the best. Going towards the food twice is the same as eating the food on time, so the return of a policy will vary a lot depending on how far is the food. In other words and only as an example, is better to go towards the food 2 times not eat the food and die than eat the food and then die. Probably the agent will need forever to play well. Try to reduce your reward for moving to 0, will take more time time understand the objective of the game (eating) but will understand what to maximize.
