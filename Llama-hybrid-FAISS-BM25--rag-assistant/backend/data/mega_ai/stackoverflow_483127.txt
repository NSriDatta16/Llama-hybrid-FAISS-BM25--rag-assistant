In general, it's the storage part of the lisp process (that is, all "lisp" functions and data), but no parts of the underlying lisp binary. On the plus side, this gives a fast start-up, since there's (essentially) no book-keeping to be done on loading the image, everything is just there. On the other hand, it means any open files, sockets and what-have-you are missing, so saving images as some sort of check-pointing will require a bit of implementation to make it work.
