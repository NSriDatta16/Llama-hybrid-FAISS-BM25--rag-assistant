It depends on what you want to use the average for. A CPI of $x$ means it takes $x$ times as much money now to buy a basket of goods as it did during a reference period. (Sometimes values are multiplied by an arbitrary constant, such as $100$, so that a CPI of $x$ means it takes $x/100$ times as much money as before. The value of that constant does not matter: it merely establishes a unit of measurement of money. It will therefore be set to $1$ in the ensuing calculations.) Suppose you want to measure how much people typically needed to spend during the year in toto . You would likely assume they would buy this same basket at regular intervals (rather than varying it or varying the rates at which they purchased it), so without loss of generality let's suppose they bought it once a month, spending $x_i$ during month $i$. Then they spent a total of $$S(x)=\sum_{i\in \{\text{January, February,}\ldots\text{, December}\}} x_i,$$ whence their mean monthly price $S(x)/12$ was the arithmetic mean of the monthly prices. If you have data about rates of purchase you could instead compute a rate-weighted arithmetic mean. Suppose you want to measure how much people with a fixed monthly income were able to purchase on average. This time assume they purchased as much as they could at regular intervals. During month $i$ they could purchase only $1/x_i$ as much as they could during the reference period. Now the total amount of goods purchased is $$H(x) = \sum_{i\in \{\text{January, February,}\ldots\text{, December}\}} \frac{1}{x_i}.$$ In this case the reciprocal of its mean--that is, the harmonic mean $12/H(x)$ of the monthly CPIs--is the right average to use. Once again it would be possible to weight this harmonic mean by rates of purchase, if such information were available. In any event, the harmonic mean cannot exceed the arithmetic mean (weighted or not, only provided both use the same weights). The two will be close when the ratio of the largest $x_i$ to the smallest $x_i$ is small--say, well under $2:1$. They will be identical when all the $x_i$ are equal. The Wikipedia quotation does not apply because it refers to "normalized" values, or ratios, whose denominators could be varying or chosen arbitrarily. That is not the case with an index: the denominator is fixed during the (past) reference period. Its effect is only to establish the units in which money is expressed.
