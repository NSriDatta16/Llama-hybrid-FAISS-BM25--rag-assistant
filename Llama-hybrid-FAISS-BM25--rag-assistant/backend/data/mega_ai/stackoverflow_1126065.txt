No, it's a programmer bug. s are attached to their or , not to its container. And appending a close tag is nonsensical. You're basically working as if what you were appending were raw HTML, and it's not; you're actually working with the DOM. Try this: var list = $("#details").append(' ').find('ul'); for (var i = 0; i something '); Note: please see (and upvote) Blixt's answer, which expands on a couple different options that are superior for various purposes. It deserves attention and hasn't been getting it.
