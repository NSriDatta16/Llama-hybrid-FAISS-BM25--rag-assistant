You can use a query to select the result you want into a new file: SELECT column_pk, SUM(counter) FROM ( SELECT column_pk, counter FROM Server1.Table1 UNION ALL column_pk, counter FROM Server2.Table2 ) data GROUP BY column_pk INTO OUTFILE "dump.txt" You can then load this file into the destination server using LOAD DATA INFILE EDIT: Here "Server1.Table1" is a pseudonym - you can't really write that. To read from tables on other servers as if they were local, use the federated storage engine .
