Bayesian p-values are normally used when one would like to check how a model fits the data . That is, given a model $M$ we wish to examine how well it fits the observed data $x_{obs}$ based on a statistic $T$ , which measures the goodness of fit of data and model. For this, suppose we have a model $M$ with probability density function $f(x|\theta)$ and with prior $g(\theta)$ . Then, one can define the prior predictive p-value or tail area under the predictive distribution through the expression $$ p = P(T(x)\geq T(x_{obs})|M) = \int_{T(x)\geq T(x_{obs})}h(x)dx, $$ where $$h(x)dx = \int f(x|\theta)g(\theta)d\theta$$ is the prior predictive density. Notice that this approach may be influenced by the choice of the prior (for an example, see pg.180 of [1]). For this reason, the posterior predictive p-value was introduced. Now, consider that the prior depends on the observed data $g(\theta|x_{obs})$ , thus, $$ h(x|x_{obs}) = \int f(x|\theta)g(\theta|x_{obs})d\theta. $$ However, this approach presents two disadvantages . First, we're considering a double use of the data (for the definiton of $h(x)$ and $p$ ). Second, for larger sample sizes , the posterior distribution of $\theta$ concentrates at the Maximum Likelihood Estimate of $\theta$ (the frequentist or classical approach). To overcome this, the conditional predictive distribution was introduced. Consider a statistic $U$ that does not involve the statistic $T$ . Then, the conditional predictive p-value is $$ p_{c} = P^{h(\cdot|u_{obs})}(T(x)\geq T(x_{obs})|M) = \int_{T(x)\geq T(x_{obs})} h(t|u_{obs}) dt, $$ where $h(t|u_{obs})$ is the conditional predictive density of $T$ given $U$ and $u_{obs}$ is $U(x_{obs})$ . Additionally, one could consider the partial posterior predictive p-value with the advantage of not requiring a choice for the statistic $U$ , see pg.184 of [1] for more details.
