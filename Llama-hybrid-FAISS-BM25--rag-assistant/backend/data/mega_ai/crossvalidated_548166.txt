How to determine which text classification algorithm is most appropriate for a given problem?

As someone very new to NLP, I'm curious to know what types of things people consider before building text classification models to help determine an appropriate starting point. For example, I see people may use a GRU or an LSTM, but are there any questions to consider before training any models that might inform whether I should expect either the GRU or LSTM to be the more appropriate model? When attempting to look online for guidance, I see lots of articles like this , where the approach is to just train dozens of models and pick which performs best. And not that this is invalid, but I'd like to be a bit more intentional if possible.
