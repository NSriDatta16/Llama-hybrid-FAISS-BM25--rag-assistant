If the zero-inflation is extreme, it will cause problems, not because it violates assumptions but because of the sense of the regression. I think it will cause problems here. Many studies use two smoking variables: Yes/No and then number (just among smokers). Logistic regression in its usual form assumes that the relationship is linear in the logit; that is, the difference in the logit between 0 and 1 cigarettes is the same as between 1 and 2: $f(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$ where $z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + ... \beta_p$ Such a linear relationship seems unlikely here (although you don't say what your DV is) One could use a spline of B instead (see, e.g. this article . If I recall, Frank Harrell's book discusses these models as well. However, a yes/no + number analysis might be easier to interpret.
