You can't do this. They have exported C++ classes from their dll, rather than C-functions. The difference is, c++ functions are always exported with names in a mangled form that is specific to a particular version of the compiler. Their dll is usable by msvc only in that form, and will probably not even work between different versions of msvc, as Microsoft have changed their mangling scheme before. If you have any leverage, you need to get them to change their evil ways. Otherwise you will need to use MSVC to write a shim dll, that will import all the classes, and re-export them via c functions that return interfaces.
