Questions regarding Binary Logistic Regression

I am very new to statistics and is currently performing binary logistic regression analysis to test null hypothesis for my dissertation. First, both my independent variables and dependent variable are dichotomous (0, 1). The dependent variable for the analysis is whether or not the respondents got attacked by cyberstalkers. As you can see from the figure below, I have selected all variables as the covariates, and the significance levels show are .66 and .016 respectively for AcceptStrangerFR and PublicPrivacySetting. However, when I insert them individually, the significance level changes to MORE SIGNIFICANT , example as follows: My question is why does the significance level differ when I insert the independent variables individually and as a group ? Also, which is the correct way to analyse these data? Should I compare the independent variables against the dependent variable individually or should I include them all at once and test them against the dependent variable? This is important because the significance level is >0.05 when tested in group and is Hope you guys understand what I mean, thank you all very much in advance!
