I can see that there two parts to this question What fields do we use to detect the device type User Agent Header UAProf How do we use these fields to find out the device type and the device characteristics. For this you should have a device database that stores a mapping between the above mentioned fields and the corresponding device characteristics and also have an efficient algorithm to query this database. Following could be your solutions. build in house database and data access library ( cons re-inventing the wheel, problems with updating the database as and when new device come to the market, which practically is everyday ) WURFL ( pros contains both database and access library, open source, free, used to be the defacto standard till a few years ago and is very mature, cons is not always upto date) Device Atlas from .Mobi ( pros uptodate, has efficient data access library, provides a wide range of device characterestics, IMHO best option | cons paid ) BTW, Which language are you using to build you website ?
