You can always use correlation in a problem like this. I guess there could be some problems if the dispersion of the marker (a continuous variable) is very high and the dispersion organ count is very low (i.e. a lot of observations having a low count like 1 or 2). Anyway, in such a case you can still use correlation but it would yield a low number. If you want to get more fancy you can try a regression with a categorical dependent variable (the organ count). Poisson regression might be best.
