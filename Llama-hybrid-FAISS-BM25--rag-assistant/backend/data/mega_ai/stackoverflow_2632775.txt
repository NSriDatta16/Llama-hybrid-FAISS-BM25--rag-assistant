Your second link works. First one doesn't. As was said earlier, onclick doesn't require 'javascript:' as it's implied. Also - your first link has an incorrect url: http://http://stac... - notice two http:// And finally, as you may realize, you can technically spoof a link simply by mismatching the href and text properties without javascript: www.google.com Obviously hovering over the link would reveal the url to saavy users or those not paying attention, but thought I'd include it for example's sake... The most likely to fool people is: www.google.com Hovering shows google in status bar. Only way to detect this is to inspect html. It's things like this that make Firefox + NoScript so valuable :)
