It's just a coding convention. You're free to choose, but use it consitently . Also, an average IDE can autogenerate all getters/setters in a few keystrokes/clicks. In Eclipse for example, do Alt + Shift + R and then S and then select the properties you'd like to generate getters/setters for and click OK. Also, an average IDE will display a warning when you do x = x instead of this.x = x . I myself prefer the this.x = x . Eclipse and many reverse-engineer tools (like Dali and Hibernate Tools) also generates it that way by default. The x = newX convention (the Hungarian notation ) is just inherited from the (old-fashioned) procedural programming world and simply doesn't fit nicely in the OO ideology.
