I can't think of anything. It looks to me like what you're doing exactly fulfils the purpose, and SQL certainly doesn't seem to go out of its way to make it easy for you to do this more succinctly. Consider this: What you're trying to do doesn't make sense in a strict context of set arithmetic. Mathematically, the answer is to count everything and then take the MIN() with 100, which is what you're (pragmatically and with good reason) trying to avoid.
