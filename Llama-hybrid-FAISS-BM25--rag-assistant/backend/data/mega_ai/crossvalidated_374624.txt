Backpropagation NN - is it trained?

I am working on a simple Back propagation Neural Network that is predicting next value of a sensor reading. It took me a while to train it based on the last year data and now i have the results. There are several inputs into my NN like temperature, humidity, day, month, hour. The answer i want from the NN is: What is the next hour value for the sensor reading? Let's say that at 13:00 reading is 50 What will be the sensor reading at 14:00 ? Here are the outputs per hour: YELLOW : Predicted GREEN : Sensor reading I think i could use it as an eventual trend for the next hour, still i see some errors there. Looking at the results above, how do you tell if this network is performing well / overfitted / under-fitted ? it suits at all Here are the stats of the training: 1000000 epochs 3700 training set 3700 validation set Validation Error: 0.000376 Training Error: 0.000214
