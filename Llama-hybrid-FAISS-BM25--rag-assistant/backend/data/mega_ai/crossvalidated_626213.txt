This paper presents an interesting solution: “Dividing the observed by the expected mean gives the nearest neighbor statistic, R = r0 ⁄ rE, which provides a quantitative summary of the spacing between stimulus elements. The average nearest neighbor distance decreases as points become more tightly clustered; hence, the closer to 0 the value for R becomes. The most tightly clustered situation is that in which all points are superposed, when the value of R equals 0. The closer the points are to being randomly dispersed, the more similar are the values of r0 and rE and the closer to 1 the value for R becomes."
