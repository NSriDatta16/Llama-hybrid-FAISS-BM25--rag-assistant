how do I handle messages asynchronously, throwing away any new messages while processing?

I have a C# app that subscribes to a topic on our messaging system for value updates. When a new value comes in, I do some processing and then carry on. The problem is, the updates can come faster than the app can process them. What I want to do is to just hold on to the latest value, so I don't want a queue. For example, the source publishes value "1" and my app receives it; while processing, the source publishes the sequence (2, 3, 4, 5) before my app is done processing; my app then processes value "5", with the prior values thrown away. It's kind of hard to post a working code sample since it's based on proprietary messaging libraries, but I would think this is a common pattern, I just can't figure out what it's called...It seems like the processing function has to run on a separate thread than the messaging callback, but I'm not sure how to organize this, e.g. how that thread is notified of a value change. Any general tips on what I need to do?
