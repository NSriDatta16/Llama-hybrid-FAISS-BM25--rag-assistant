In your query you need to JOIN your tables on matching fields (drag field Apptmt.Qno to Visit.QueueNo, Apptmt.TrackNo to Visit.trackNo). In the case that gives you duplicates in the output, you might as well use GROUP BY: click the Sigma symbol in the toolbar and specify which fields are GROUP BY, which are SUM, etc...
