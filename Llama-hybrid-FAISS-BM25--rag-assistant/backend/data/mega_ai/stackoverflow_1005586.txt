How to swap product image that is already in cart depending on selected product option?

recently I was needed to enhance Magento (1.3.1) user interface. Particularly add a product image switcher (following http://inchoo.net/ecommerce/magento/create-a-color-switcher-in-magento/ ). The results: - image switcher works as expected, which is fine. The problem: - The product itself could hold as much as 15 or 20 colors-images to choose from. The goal: - when the user choose the product color using "select" element, the selected product color must swap default product color to show it in cart. I was thinking to use a session to hold the selected data and then swap it, but it looks way to complicated, because image directories holds as cache directories and I don't know the exact path when viewing the image. Second idea was to swap from checkout/cart controller using /checkout/cart/item/default.phtml, but I don't know how to do it.
