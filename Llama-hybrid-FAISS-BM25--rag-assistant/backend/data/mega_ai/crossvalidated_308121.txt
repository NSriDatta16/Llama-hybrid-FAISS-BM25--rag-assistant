As T.E.G.'s comment suggests, you can't extract more than one factor because beyond one factor, these model are not identified. With four observed indicators (D), you have D(D+1)/2 pieces of information in your variance/covariance matrix (so 10, total). Your one-factor model is identified as it has 2 degrees of freedom, because from those 10 pieces of information, you are estimating 8 things: 4 factor loadings and 4 residual variances (10-8 = 2 df). Move to a two-factor solution, and your estimation needs double, and exceed the amount of information you have. I wouldn't live and die by the chi-square test because it tests a pretty unreasonable null hypothesis--that in the long run, your model-implied variance-covariance matrix will perfectly reproduce the observed variance-covariance matrix. With any meaningful amount of modelling parsimony and a half-decent sample size, this null will be regularly rejected for models that might otherwise be quite reasonable. There are other means of evaluating how many factors you need (e.g., parallel analysis, absolute or relative indexes of model fit), but with only four indicators, you are quite limited in your modelling choices. (and 4). It seems like you have some evidence of a lack of measurement invariance between men and women (see Vandenberg & Lance, 2000, for an accessible review). Though you should test this possibility formally, this would mean that the underlying factor structures for these indicators is different for men and women. While your appraisal seems reasonable (the single-factor solution seems like it may be adequate for women), once again, your options are limited to test other possibilities with only four indicators. See above. Amount of variance explained is primarily a principal components metric, as in a common factor solution you are acknowledging that not all observed variance is meaningful true construct variance that you can account for. And while interpretability is certainly a meaningful criteria for assessing the adequacy of factor solutions, it is by no means the only one (and it's a relatively subjective one at that). Fabrigar & Wegner, 2011 have a nice accessible review of the various other empirical options (some I mentioned above). All are imperfect, so it's generally a good idea to apply different ones and select a model that multiple criteria converge on supporting. References Fabrigar, L. R., & Wegener, D. T. (2011).
