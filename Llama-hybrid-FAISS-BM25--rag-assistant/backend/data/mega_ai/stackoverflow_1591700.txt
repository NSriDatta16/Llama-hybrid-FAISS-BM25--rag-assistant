How to execute a WiX custom action DLL file with dependencies

I want to create a CustomAction C# DLL file that depends on a third-party .NET DLL (in this specific case, it's MySql.Data.dll ). I have the C# custom action DLL file working with the WiX fragment below. I'm just trying to figure out how to safely add a dependency to the custom action. Note: I don't actually need this third-party DLL file file for the installed application to run. NOT Installed Do I need to install the third-party DLL file ( MySql.Data.dll ) in order to get the custom action to run? Can I just add another Binary tag with the third-party DLL file?
