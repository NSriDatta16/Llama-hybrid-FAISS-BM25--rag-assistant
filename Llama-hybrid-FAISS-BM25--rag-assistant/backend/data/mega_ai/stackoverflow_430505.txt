What I do in cases like this is use the Flex HDividedBox containing two containers of your choice. Then you can make the HDividedBox 100% x 100%; and hide or show the two containers as you choose. It makes a pretty nice book-with-split-pages emulator. It also makes it easy use the divider bar to drag-resize the relative split between the two, so an image can scale smoothly, for instance. I use TabNavigators on the left and right sides, making it easy to riffle through page-like tabs on each side.
