How to take z scores of averages

I have a bunch of neuropsychological test scores for patients and controls which I have then grouped into cognitive domains and averaged the scores across each individual test to get domain averages for each participant. I want to use z scores of single patient vs control group to look for significance in each domain. My problem is the z score uses standard deviation and I don'd know how to calculate this for the domains in the control group. Do I sum all the standard deviations of the individual tests or do I calculate from the domain averages (so it would be the deviation of the mean of the means)?
