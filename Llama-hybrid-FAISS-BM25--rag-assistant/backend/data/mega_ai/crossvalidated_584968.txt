How to show linear combination of independent, but non-identically distributed Bernoulli's is asymptotically normal?

Summary I am curious about whether there exists theoretical justification to say a linear combination of a sufficiently large number of independent (but not identically distributed) Bernoulli random variables is asymptotically normally distributed. I know that the sum of i.i.d. Bernoulli's (i.e.,a binomial) approaches a normal distribution, but I have two particular issues which put this in question: (1) they are unequally weighted, so it is a linear combination, and (2) the probability of success is different in most of them. In other words, consider the random variable $Y$ : $$ Y=a_1X_1 + a_2X_2 + \dots + a_{25000}X_{25000}, $$ where $$X_i\sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i),\: i\in \{1,2,\dots,25000\}$$ and $$ p_i\in[0,1]\text{ and }a_i\in\mathbb{R}\:\forall i $$ Is this $Y$ asymptotically normal? I have run a basic test in R to evaluate this: data The histogram sure looks normal, and it passes the Shapiro-Wilk test, but if I am to make this assumption, I would need more explicit theoretical justification. Background I am evaluating the predicted expense for paying a 3rd party company to run transactions for us. I am using a set of about 25,000 payments made throughout the past two years, but we don't know the payment method they would have used under this system (card or check), and our expense depends greatly on which method they use. We know, using a different set of transactions which are already done using this 3rd party, that larger transactions are more likely to be done by check, and I have taken specific probabilities from a logistic regression, which I am imposing on this other set of payments. This means that we have about 25,000 bernoulli random variables, the sum of which is our total expense, but our processing fee is a percentage amount of the transactions size when it is a card, so the variables are weighted unequally, and the large ones are more and more likely to be a check, which results in a flat $1 fee.
