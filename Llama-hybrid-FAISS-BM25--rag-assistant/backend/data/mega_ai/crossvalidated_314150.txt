A quite recent method to assess causality between two times series is the Convergent Cross Mapping Method [1] available through the official R package rEDM, with its comprehensive tutorial [3]. And other one is the PC-MCI method [4] available through the Tigramite python package [5]. Some description and explanation about the above methods are discussed in a similar topic on earth stackexchange : Correlation and causation . [1] Sugihara, G., R. May, H. Ye, C.-h. Hsieh, E.
