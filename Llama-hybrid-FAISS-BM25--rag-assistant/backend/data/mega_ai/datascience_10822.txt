Time Series - Prediction

I have time series for product usage over an year on daily basis. Product usage exhibits seasonality i.e. it usage increase/decreases by more than the normal usage during that time. When i get the current day's data and its more than normal, i want to check if its exhibits seasonality or not and take some actions accordingly. I am thinking of using Double Exponential Smoothing to achieve this. Is this an right approach or is there an better approach to do it.
