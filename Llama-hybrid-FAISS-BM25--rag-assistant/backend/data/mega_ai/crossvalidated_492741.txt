Choice of test in a pre-post scenario

I would like to test whether there is a significant difference in outcome in a pre/post scenario. I have the following set-up: Measured level of concentration of A ( continuous ) in blood pre-death and measured concentration of A post-death for each individual (roughly 100 individuals in total). Working hypothesis: After death, the concentration of A falls and hence should be on average lower then pre-death concentration. So, my first impulse was to go for a paired-t-test given all assumptions are fulfilled. However, my problem arises from the fact that the post-death concentration of A is not always measured at the same time after the death has occurred. So maybe 1h after death, sometimes 12h later and so on. I wonder if this causes any problems and whether I can somehow factor in the difference in post-death time-to-test. (There are also other parameters which change on an individual basis: age, concentration, time, sex, cause of death; they are all categorical) Is there any alternative approach to this or is the "significant difference" approach, given so many loose ends, just not reasonable at all? In the paired t-test I would just ignore all other parameters, though they might affect the concentration of A as well. Another idea would be to use a one-way MANOVA with the dependent variables "pre-death_A" and "post-death_A" and the independent variables age, concentration, time, sex, cause of death. I have never done this before so I am a bit hesitant. Any other suggestions?
