MA on a non-stationary time series

I have some data I would like to do some simple forecasting on. Its is non-stationary, looking at the time plot & from ADF & KPSS tests. After differencing I now have a stationary series. I want to use a moving average to forecast some future values. Is it recommended to do this on the stationary series and then use that forecast to apply back to my original one? Or can I go ahead and use on the original? Also, good reason to believe that more recent terms have more influence, should I use EWMA?
