How to sniff IM comunicaton?

I would like to write a communication sniffer for some IM, like ICQ or MSN. Can you please help me how to start? It's quite hard to find useful info how to do this. How should I start? I know that there is the winpcap library for windows that it is good for packet sniffing.
