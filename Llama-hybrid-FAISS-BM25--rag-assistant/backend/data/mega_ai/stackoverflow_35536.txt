"Computers and Intractability: A guide to the theory of NP-Completeness" by Garey and Johnson is a great reference for this sort of thing, although the "solved" problems (in P) are obviously not given much attention in the book. I'm not aware of any good on-line resources, but Karp's seminal paper Reducibility among Combinatorial Problems (1972) on reductions and complexity is probably the "canonical" reference for Hard Problems.
