Unfortunately there isn't a straightforward way without making a complete implementation of a TextFormatter. MSDN article on the basics of an Advanced TextFormatter : The text layout and UI controls in WPF provide formatting properties that allow you to easily include formatted text in your application. These controls expose a number of properties to handle the presentation of text, which includes its typeface, size, and color. Under ordinary circumstances, these controls can handle the majority of text presentation in your application. However, some advanced scenarios require the control of text storage as well as text presentation. WPF provides an extensible text formatting engine for this purpose.
