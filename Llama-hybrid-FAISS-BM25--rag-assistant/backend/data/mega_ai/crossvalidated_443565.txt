Stationarity in a time series implying that the correlation between consecutive terms must be constant?

I'm reading this definition (from Chapter 11 of an introductory econometrics textbook from Wooldrige) as the following: each consecutive pair of terms (let's let m = 2) are assumed to have the same joint probability distribution and therefore must have the same correlation (as correlation is determined by the joint distribution - although I am a bit rusty from pure probability theory). However, the textbook posits otherwise (see image).
