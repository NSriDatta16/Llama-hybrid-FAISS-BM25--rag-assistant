I understand your annoyance at being glibly told to use weak_ptr to break cyclic references and myself I almost feel rage when I am told that cyclic references are bad programming style. Your ask specifically how do you spot cyclic references. The truth is that in a complex project some reference cycles are indirect and difficult to spot. The answer is that you should not make false declarations that leave you vulnerable to cyclic references. I am serious and I am criticizing a very popular practice - blindly using shared_ptr for everything. You should be clear in your design which pointers are owners and which are observers. For owners use shared_ptr . For observers use weak_ptr - all of them, not just those you think may be part of a cycle. If you follow this practice then the cyclic references will not cause any problems and you don't need to worry about them. Of course you will have a lot of code to write to convert all these weak_ptr s to shared_ptr s when you want to use them - Boost really isn't up to the job.
