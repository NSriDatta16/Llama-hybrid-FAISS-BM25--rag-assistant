Find SQL rows that are not shared between two tables with identical fields

I have two tables with identical fields that share many rows. I'd like to list all the rows in one table that cannot be matched in the other. Specifically, these two tables are two different versions of an experiment where the results differ slightly. An example is something like this: |TableA| -------- horse cat cow table |TableB| -------- horse cat chair I'd like to be able to see that TableA is missing chair from TableB and possibly in a different query that TableB is missing cow and table are missing from TableA . My thought was to do some sort of outer join on all fields, then sort out the rows with nulls in them, but this seems heavy handed. Is this the way to go or is there are more elegant/efficient approach?
