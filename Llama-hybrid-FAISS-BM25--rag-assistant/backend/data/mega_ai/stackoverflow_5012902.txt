However, as the organisation hasn't been smart enough to invest in MS SQL Server instances at each site, replication of the database and accessing it from the local SQL server isn't an option. This is a real bummer. How busy is are the sites? Could you get away with an "Express" version or even ( gasp ) MS Access? MySQL might even be helpful here! Have a look at the "Content expiration" tab in IIS 6. Maybe set it to a week. Also, there are equivalent HTTP headers that your ASP pages can set that will encourage caching. I was looking at simply running a scheduled task to stream the dynamic pages to static ASP files saved back to the main server (then replicated out to the remote sites), but FSO is giving me a headache so I've abandoned that plan. This sounds very reasonable, and you shouldn't abandon it. One of the many MSXML/ServerXMLHTTP COM objects should help tremendously. Please outline the "headaches" you were encountering with FSO.
