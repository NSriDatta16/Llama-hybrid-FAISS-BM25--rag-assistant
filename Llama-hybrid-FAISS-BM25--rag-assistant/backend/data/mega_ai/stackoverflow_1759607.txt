You're almost there. The full mantra is: s = new Sound(); s.loadSound ("http://url.of.shoutcaststream:8003/;",true); Notice the trailing slash and semicolon. Shoutcast servers (DNAS) look at the useragent of a request to detect what to send back in the response. If it's a broswer then it serves a page of HTML. If it's not a browser UA, it sends the stream. Trailing semicolon (for some undocumented reason) causes DNAS to ignore the UA and always send a stream. There's no satisfactory solution to playing AAC streams, although Flash has the equipment to do so, for some reason the API for AAC is completely different and cannot play AAC Shoutcast. The NetStream solution here is unlikely to provide a solution. See my blog for more info: http://www.flexiblefactory.co.uk/flexible/?p=51
