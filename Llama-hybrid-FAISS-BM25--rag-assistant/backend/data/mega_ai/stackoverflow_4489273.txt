Drupal 6 - change Author of a node

Is there an easy way to change the author of a node to another user? I can't seem to find it. I found a workaround, which was to setup an "action" to change the author of a node to a specific user, and then temporarily setup a "trigger" so that whenever i update a node, it should run that action. It works, but is ugly. I suppose I could also attack the db directly, but these both seem like rather inelegant solutions. I appreciate this shouldn't be that common an requirement. This is what happened: I setup the site, including place-holder content, which the publisher users then populated with real content. This was clearly not the right way to go about it, but it's the situation I find myself in...
