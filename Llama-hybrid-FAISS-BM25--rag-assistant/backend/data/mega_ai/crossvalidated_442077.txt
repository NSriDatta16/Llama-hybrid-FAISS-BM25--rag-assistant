Hi: Assuming the error terms have an expectation of zero and there are no AR terms, then yes, the MA model is always stationary. This is because any linear combination of zero mean variables still has an expectation of zero. Once you add in AR terms, then the answer is not necessarily yes. The question that is usually asked about pure moving average models is whether they are invertible. This is a totally different question.
