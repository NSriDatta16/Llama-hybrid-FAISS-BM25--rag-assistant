Why does a randomly initialised convolution kernel correspond to an edge detector?

In this nice tutorial about CNNs, the authors build a single-layer CNN. The initial convolution weights are set randomly, according to a uniform distribution. By the end of this scetion , the authors note that the randomly initialised kernel behaves very similar to an edge detector and give the following input and output as example. Why does the randomly initialised kernel behave like an edge detector?
