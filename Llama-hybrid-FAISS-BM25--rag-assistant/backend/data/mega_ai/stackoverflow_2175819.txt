Yes Check out PXP or Personal Extreme Programming. http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1593127 Summary from the paper: Personal Extreme Programming (PXP) is a software development process for a single person team. It is based on the values of Extreme Programming (XP) i.e. simplicity, communication, feedback, and courage. It works by keeping the important aspects of XP and refining the values so that they can fit in a lone programmer situation. PXP can still be refined and improved. It is in the tradition of XP practitioners to vary XP to encompass whatever works. We hope that PXP inherits these pragmatic roots, as well. Giving up XP tenets like pair programming is not necessarily a tragedy . We still believe that following XP strictly is a more effective way to pursue multi-person projects. But we are also convinced that many of the XP practices and methods can be applied to individual work. The PXP approach tries to balance between the "too heavy" and the "too light" methodologies. PXP will inject the right amount of rigor for the situation without overburdening the team with unnecessary bureaucracy.
