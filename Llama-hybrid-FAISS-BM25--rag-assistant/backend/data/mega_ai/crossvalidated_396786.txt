Gini index in classification tree

In Gareth etc.'s book "An introduction to statistical learning", when it's talking about Gini index, I clipped the paragraph in the following image: My question is the statement that "For this reason the Gini index is referred to as a measure of node purity -- a small value indicates that a node contains predominantly observations from a single class." I don't understand the logic behind this. So when $\hat p_{mk}$ is close to 1 (and thus Gini index is small), which means by its definition that most of the training observation in the mth region are from the kth class. If it's in income statistics, does it mean the training observation is from high-income or low-income class? If yes, however, a contradiction to this is that if Gini index is high in income statistics, it means most people are either in the high-income class or low-income class (wealth gap is large). What am I misunderstanding here? It's even more obscure to me when $\hat p_{mk}$ is close to 0.
