My experience is that using the encoded representation of the autoencoder as input to the classifier usually does not improve classification. And the augmentations you have described might make the autoencoder a bit more robust, but that doesn't mean that this benefits your classification. There is nothing in the autoencoder that forces it to create a representation that is good for some particular classification. The only aspect that might help is the dimensionality reduction, but my impression is that DNN classification methods nowadays don't really need that help.
