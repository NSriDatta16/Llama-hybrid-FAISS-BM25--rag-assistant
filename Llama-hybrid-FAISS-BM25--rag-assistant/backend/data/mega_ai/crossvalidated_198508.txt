correlation using a single transformation

I was presently working on Canonical Correlation Analysis which maximizes the correlation between two variables $X$ and $Y$ of two modalities in some transformed domain using transformations $T_1$ and $T_2$. Please refer to this paper hardoon cca where the $X$ and $Y$ modality are taken to be the image and text domain and the task is to retrieve some images based on some given text data. Specifically it solves the problem of cross-modal retrieval by mathematically solving this problem $T1,T2 = \arg \max corr(T_1X,T_2Y)$. I have already read up some variants on this such as cluster cca which is a supervised approach and can work with even unpaired data with either modality. I am trying to solve the problem $T = \arg \max corr(X,TY)$ which essentially means finding out a single transformation $T$ which will maximize the correlation of $X$ with the transformed data $TY$. I do not want to use two transformations. Does any such method exist in the literature ? I understand ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a possible choice but in OLS we seek a $T$ so as to minimize the difference/error $T = \arg \min ||TY-X||^2$. My objective instead is to instead maximize the correlation but by using a single transformation ? More specifically perhaps a better question is it possible to maximize the correlation between two sets of variables using a single transformation ? Why should we always require two transformations ?
