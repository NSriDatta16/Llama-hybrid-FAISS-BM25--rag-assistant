What are the advantages of building your own Neural Network (from scratch) over a readily available one (like in sklearn)?

I don't need the answer like "for good understanding of low level stuff happening in neural networks". I am already aware of that. I want to know why build a customized neural network when there are readily available? What are the advantages. I built my own and it did not really give me better performance than sklearn one (for the classification purpose). Then why many people are doing that? Thank you in advance.
