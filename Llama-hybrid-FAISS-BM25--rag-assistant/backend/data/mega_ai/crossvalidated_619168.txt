Finding Significant Observations from List of Data

I have a list of data that consists of the difference between two groups' averages (list C). The two original lists consist of averages across ~20 samples per group (list A and list B). In other words: list A - list B = list C. I want to find observations in list C such that they are significantly different from 0, which is my null hypothesis (there is no difference between list A and list B). Each observation consists of a single data point. These significant observations should be two tailed so I get negative and positive data points, which indicates either A is significantly greater than B at this observation or vice versa. I know how to do this with z-scores, but I cannot use them because my sample size is small and my data is likely not normally distributed. Plus, I need the variance. I'd like to use a t-test, but I'm unsure what statistics I need. I know I need the t-critical value for the alpha level of 0.05 (I want a two-tailed test, so I would need 0.025), but what would I do from here? I would also like to be able to do this in base R.
