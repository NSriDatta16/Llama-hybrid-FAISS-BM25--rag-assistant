I would use the lsmeans package to do these predicted probabilities. Load the package with library(lsmeans) , and then execute the following to get predicted probabilities of detecting a bird at each vegetation type, averaged over the levels of burn treatment: lsmeans(glm.birdpa2, ~ vegtype, type="response", data=birddata) The following will give you predicted probabilities of detecting a bird at each vegetation type within each level of burn treatment: lsmeans(glm.birdpa2, ~ vegtype | burn, type="response", data=birddata) The type="response" argument in the above tells lsmeans to back-transform the results, so the predictions will be probabilities. Leaving that argument out, lsmeans will provide log-odds rather than probabilities.
