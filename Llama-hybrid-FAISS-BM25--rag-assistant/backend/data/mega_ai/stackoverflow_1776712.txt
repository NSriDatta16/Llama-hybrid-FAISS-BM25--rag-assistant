When dragging a row in a QTableWidget, how can I find out what row index it was dragged FROM and TO?

I'm trying to keep some array data synchronized with the contents of a QTableWidget. I'd like to enable drag and drop reordering (moving items within the table, as opposed to copying), but it's not clear to me how, when the drop event is fired, I can find out what index the item was dragged FROM. Hence, I have no way of knowing what object to move within the list I'm synchronizing with. How can I get the original row index of the item being dragged?
