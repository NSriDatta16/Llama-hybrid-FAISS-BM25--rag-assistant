The problem is that deep RL (= deep learning + RL) is a whole world sometimes quite different from classical RL (e.g. tabular or linear fn approx.) From one side, Python and RL libraries are usually built from popular numerical frameworks such as tensorflow and pytorch. The benefit is that there are many RL libraries that already implement SOTA algorithms that you can directly plug in and solve your problem (indeed, assuming you define it in a suitable environment.) Also, if you want to do research you may want to start from some already avaiable implementation, which is likely to be in Python. The drawback is that you would need to learn: a new programming language that is also quite different from R, but also a Rl lib and even a ML framework (TF or PT.) But if you stick with R, you probably need to find a good DL library that allows to build and train neural networks, and then implement the RL algo from scratch, which can get quite tricky, technical and complex.
