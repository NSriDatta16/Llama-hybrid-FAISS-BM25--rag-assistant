NOsql Vs Mysql - Going schemaless with Cassandra

Here are the facts: We have a lot (L O T) of data coming in everyday. Each file we receive is in a csv format and while there are a couple of headers that reoccur more often than others, there is not really a standard. The normalization of each file to be uploaded into a mySQL database is highly time consuming and often pushes us to change the schema (new field appeared in on file that was not existing before..). While the primary key is unique, anything else can be duplicated These are customers records (i.e.: email,firstname,lastname,city,state,address...etc) We could have multiple emails for the same individual .. We read 70% of the time and we write 30% of the time Scalability could be a concern but it is not right now, though availability is key Speed is what we are looking for. Mysql is too slow to answer queries where tables are over 50 million records. Even well optimized we have too many speed issue. Breaking down the tables has become an organizational concern. Schema less noSQL seemed attractive. What would you recommend, what did you implement? (Please do not answer to optimize mysql .. pointless and off topic) --
