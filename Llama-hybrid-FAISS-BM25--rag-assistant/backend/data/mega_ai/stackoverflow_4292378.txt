You can't really tell when is the power going to die (what if the user unplugged the machine, nothing to do there). What you can do is be prepared for power out at every step. For instance, you can write the current state and data of the application to a file dedicated for this purpose. Another option is to provide checkpoints in the execution path where the partial result will be saved. For every solution, remember also to write in your persistent data storage if the application terminated normally or not It all depends on the type of data in application states you use. The good news is, it's always possible if it's important enough
