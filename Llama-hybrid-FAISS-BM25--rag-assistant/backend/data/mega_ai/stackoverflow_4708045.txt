You want to create new classes runtime? C++ is not meant to work like that. C++ classes are static and should all exist compile time. Shared, dynamically loadable libraries are not meant to solve the issue. Simplest solution might be to embed an interpreter of a language that has dynamic types (like Lua for example) and write the run-time dynamic objects in it. If you really want to interact with run-time compiled modules in platform independent way then you better use some language neutral and platform neutral interface like CORBA. Then the things compiled and ran on your Linux box and Windows box can all interact with each other and compile new members to join the gang.
