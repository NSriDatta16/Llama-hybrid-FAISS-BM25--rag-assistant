Restricted Assignment in Python's List Comprehensions?

The example is stolen from here but my goal has a restriction so that output is [8,12,-54] . How can you do it with list comprehensions? I need to somehow refer to the index like x_{i}*y_{i} , I am hesitant to add a loop there, is there some elegant solution? >>> vec1 = [2, 4, 6] >>> vec2 = [4, 3, -9] >>> [x*y for x in vec1 for y in vec2] [8, 6, -18, 16, 12, -36, 24, 18, -54]
