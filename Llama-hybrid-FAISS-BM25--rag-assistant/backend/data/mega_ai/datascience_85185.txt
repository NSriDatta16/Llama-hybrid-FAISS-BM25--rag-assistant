Ask yourself why you perform cross validation. Contrary to what Dave's answer says, the point of cross-validation is to estimate your generalization error, that is how your model will perform on future data. Model selection comes out of this, definitely, however to say that the point of CV is model selection is not true. That said, if all you are interested in is relationships between predictors and dependent variables and you aren't trying to do some sort of step-wise selection then you do not need to perform cross-validation. When was the last time a Statistics based regression textbook/class mentioned cross-validation? Never, at least not in any of the regression classes I took. One point, if you do use CV, absolutely DO NOT average the coefficients. The correct process is to use CV to estimate your error rate and then regather all of your data and run the model on all data which would give you your coefficients.
