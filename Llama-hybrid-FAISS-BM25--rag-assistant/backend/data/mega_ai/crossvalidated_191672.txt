In general, you don't want to throw data out. It can, however, make sense to put more weight on the data values that are the most reliable. In a way you are doing that already, as you are (correctly) throwing out portions of records that are technically unreliable. More generally, if data points differ in their reliability then weighted regression can preferentially incorporate information from the more reliable data points. (Note that ANOVA and regression are essentially the same problem in different guises .) So the question becomes whether having 1 minute versus 2.5 minutes of reliable data in a session makes much difference in the precision of your average "breath distention" measurement over that session. You can try to judge that based on your knowledge of the subject matter and by looking carefully at the data. For example, in cases with a full 2.5 minutes of reliable data, you could examine the variability of measurements among samples of different durations. If there isn't much evidence that cases with 1 minute of reliable recording are substantially less reliable than those with 2.5 minutes, then you should be OK with ignoring the differences among sessions with respect to reliable recording duration. In explaining your work to others, it may be easier to say "We took the average breath distention over the technically reliable portions of each recording session" rather than trying to justify a particular weighted analysis, particularly given the dangers in weighted analyses that are noted in the page linked above.
