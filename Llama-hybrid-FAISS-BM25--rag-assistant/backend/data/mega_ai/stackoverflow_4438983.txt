the fastest way will be to organize the data so it is indexed by the thing you want to search on. Currently you have it indexed by key, but you want to search by date. I think you would be best indexing it by date, if that is what you want to be able to search on. I would keep 2 dictionaries, one indexed as you do now and one where the items are indexed by date. i would decide on a time frame (say 1 minute) and add each object to a list based on the minute it happens in and then add each list to the dictionary under the key of that minute. then when you want the data for a particular time frame, generate the relevant minute(s) and get the list(s) from the dictionary. This relies on you being able to know the key in the other dictionary from the objects though.
