I like my code to be pretty too, but not where it interferes with readability. I prefer to put "happy path" first in an if statement, followed by exception paths. If I expect a certain path to happen more frequently than others, it goes first. It doesn't need to be a "positive" condition as krosenvold prefers. This way, it reads like my use cases. (blizpasta beat me to the punch with the happy-path preceding exception paths. He mentions optimization where I purposely avoided it... I prefer my code pretty and readable. Optimization comes last.) And in CSS, I prefer "structural" or layout attributes first so I can quickly see where something is going to end up, and only then what it's going to look like. I would reorganize your first CSS example to look like your second, but for my reasons - not yours. :)
