Peter is right, didEndSelector: is expecting a selector, you should try something like: def bookmark_created puts "Bookmark created" end def createBookmark(sender) NSApp.beginSheet(bookmarkSheet, modalForWindow:mainWindow, modalDelegate:self, didEndSelector:"bookmark_created:", contextInfo:nil) end Notice how I added a colon after the name of the method to call. Also, it looks like a bug with MacRuby beta release, I would encourage you to report the bug on the MacRuby tracker: http://www.macruby.org/trac/newticket Here is the example given by Apple's documentation: - (void)showCustomDialog: (NSWindow *)window // User has asked to see the dialog. Display it. { if (!myCustomDialog) [NSBundle loadNibNamed: @"MyCustomDialog" owner: self]; [NSApp beginSheet: myCustomDialog modalForWindow: window modalDelegate: nil didEndSelector: nil contextInfo: nil]; [NSApp runModalForWindow: myCustomDialog]; // Dialog is up here. [NSApp endSheet: myCustomDialog]; [myCustomDialog orderOut: self]; } As you can see, you should be able to set the end selector as nil. In the meantime, my workaround will work just fine. Good luck, Matt
