Try this; NSDictionary *fileAttributes = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] attributesOfItemAtPath:URL error:&attributesError]; NSNumber *fileSizeNumber = [fileAttributes objectForKey:NSFileSize]; long long fileSize = [fileSizeNumber longLongValue]; Note that the fileSize won't necessarily fit in an integer (especially a signed one) although you could certainly drop to a long for iOS as you'll never exceed that in reality. The example uses long long as in my code I have to be compatible with systems with much larger storage available.
