You are going to want to use something like jQuery UI . It gives you the Javascript framework to do drag, drop, rescale, etc. http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/ I would suggest starting with some basic jQuery tutorials and then move on to the UI tutorials and demos. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials jQuery is a little intimidating at first glance, but once you get the hang of it, it is very powerful and takes care of all the cross-browser incompatibilities as a bonus.
