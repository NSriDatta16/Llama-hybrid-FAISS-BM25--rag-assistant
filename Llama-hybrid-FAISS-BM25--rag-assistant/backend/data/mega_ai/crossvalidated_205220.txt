How to generate the transition matrix of Markov Chain needed for Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation?

I'm conducting a sensitivity analysis of a model using MCMC approaches. By reading the code of the sensitivity test procedure, I find the steps in Markov Chain is quite similar to random walk. Also, from my understanding of Markov Chain, a transition matrix is generally prescribed for such simulations. So I'm confused whether or not MCMC needs a transition matrix: If so, how to generate the transition matrix of Markov Chain needed for MCMC simulation? If not, why can't such a transition matrix be generated for Markov Chain?
