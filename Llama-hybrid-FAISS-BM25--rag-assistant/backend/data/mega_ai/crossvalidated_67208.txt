Reduce dimensions on a data set and its clusters' centroids

I am building a small application to calculate clusters from some input set (a n x p matrix). After I finish running the algorithm to get k clusters I also obtain the centroid of each cluster (a k x p matrix). Then I need to plot the results, so I run Principal Components Analysis to map the input set into 2 dimensions (a n x 2 matrix). My problem is that I want to plot the centroid of each cluster in the same graph. But I am not sure how to map the centroids matrix (k x p) into the projected k x 2 matrix. I used to do this by adding the centroids as new entries to the input set before running the PCA algorithm, but I think this add some bias to the process. How can I do this?
