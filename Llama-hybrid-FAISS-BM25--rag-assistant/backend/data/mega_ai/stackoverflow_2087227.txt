A little bit hacky but just putting SmtpClient smtpClient = new SmtpClient(); NetworkCredential nc = new NetworkCredential(); nc = (NetworkCredential)smtpClient.Credentials; nc.Password = Tools.Decrypt(nc.Password); smtpClient.Credentials = nc; smtpClient = null; in you global.asax might do it. And then having SmtpClient smtpClient = new SmtpClient(); smtpClient.Send(mailMessage); smtpClient = null; in you static method, though I'm sure there must be a more elegant solution. Update: You could probably try using SmtpNetworkElement and updating the password on this in the global.asax - I think as long as you do this before you use SmtpClient it may work.
