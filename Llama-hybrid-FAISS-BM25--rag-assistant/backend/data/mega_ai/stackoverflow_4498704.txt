Output in makefile at top-level

I am setting a variable in a makefile like this: SOMEVAR = foo This makefile later includes some other makefile in which the actual building of programs takes place: include generic/Makefile.common So no build targets are defined in the first makefile , it's only setting up variables which are then used by the common generic makefile to do the actual package building. Now I know that I should be careful when using foo , so to remind myself of this, I want to print a warning message whenever this makefile is used to setup the make process. The problem is that I cannot just insert an echo command after the variable definition, because we are not yet building something there. Is there a solution (more elegant than adding a fake target where the message is printed which would destroy the separation of setting variables and building)?
