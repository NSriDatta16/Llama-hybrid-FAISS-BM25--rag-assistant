Are you entering these into a web app? One you wrote? What's probably happening is they're being recognised as new lines. On Windows platforms, a paragraph/newline is done with a \r (carriage return) and \n (new line). If you're then redisplaying them on a new page or site, you'll need to sub back in some html, or else in the original submit, replace \r\n with (whitespaceofyourchoice) . \r and \n are ASCII characters and not part of HTML formatting. As such, web browsers will choose to ignore them.
