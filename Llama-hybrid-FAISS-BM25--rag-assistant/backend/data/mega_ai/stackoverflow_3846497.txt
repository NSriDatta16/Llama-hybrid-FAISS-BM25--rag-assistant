One option would be to store the known ID's into a "controller" table, and then delete rows from your main data table that have their ID show up in the controller table. That way, you could easily "batch" up your deletes, e.g. DELETE FROM dbo.YourMainDataTable WHERE ID IN (SELECT TOP (250) ID FROM dbo.DeleteControllerTable) You could easily run this delete statement in e.g. a SQL Agent Job which comes around every 15 minutes to check if there's anything to delete. In the meantime, you could add more ID's to your DeleteController table, thus you could "decouple" the process of entering the ID's to be deleted from the actual deletion process.
