in Magento, How to make a payment method that sends POST variables to an external url?

I need to make a custom payment method that gets some variables from the customer’s order and sends them as POST variables to an external url. The variables I need to get from Magento are the total amount, the order number and the products description. Those variables are sent to a url of a third party gateway, where the credit card information is asked in a secure way, and when the transaction is completed, they return the user to my magento site. I’ve searched for information and tutorials but I still feel a little confused, I’m practically new to programming in magento, so i would really appreciate it if someone could give an step-by-step explanation, or at least a link to a tutorial Thanks
