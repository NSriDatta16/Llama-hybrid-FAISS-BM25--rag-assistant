SQL Server INNER JOIN makes problems?

I need to join 5 tables using Inner Join. Is this a good practice or will it make any inconsistency in later years? Just have a look SELECT Distinct(email) FROM AP_GROUPS_INTO_ORGANIZATION M INNER JOIN GROUPSDB G on G.ID = M.GROUPID INNER JOIN aspnet_Roles r ON R.RoleName = G.GROUPNAME INNER JOIN aspnet_UsersInRoles U ON U.RoleId = R.RoleId INNER JOIN aspnet_membership a on a.UserId = U.UserId WHERE G.GROUPNAME = 'GROUP001'
