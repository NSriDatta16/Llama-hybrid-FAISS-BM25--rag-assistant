Google NLP AutoML

I am doing research for Google NLP AutoML, What methodologies they have used, techniques, models, feature selection, hyper parameter optimization, etc. I could not find any paper on how google built their NLP AutoML. Can anyone guide me on that? how to find google's research on that field for academic research? Any paper you may have will help. Thanks
