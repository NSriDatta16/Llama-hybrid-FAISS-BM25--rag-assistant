Firstly, what question are you trying to answer? Do you assume that the test reflects some underlying property of the people that gets measured by the test (perhaps imperfectly with noise) and you want to reflect that? If so, imputing by zero is certainly a bad idea. Or do you want to answer whether not taking the test predicts admission (perhaps in that case encoding no test by zero could be an idea, if that's not a score you would normally not get - alternatively you could also/additionally have a flag for missing result). Secondly, you'll have to understand why the variable is missing. E.g. if only those that passed an interview (or got some offer or thought they had some chance or fulfilled some grade average etc.) even took the test, this is a really tricky situation, because you would not have an observed values for a certain type of person. While that would technically be a missing at random assumption, you'd have to make assumptions about these people that would be to some extent untestable. However, ignoring the people with missing values would be even worse than making sensible assumptions. Perhaps in that case some multiple imputation could perhaps end up doing something sensible. On the other hand, if the occasional person misses a test because they happened to be ill on the day or something like that, then that would be a convenient missing completely at random situation (that's the one situation where leaving out the records with missingness is okay, but still inefficient). Missing not at random would occur e.g. if people took the test and then decided based on the results to tell the university or not (or perhaps if people can to some extent predict their likely score and are more likely to take the test, if they predict a better outcome). Both SVM and RF would heavily be affected by how you handle the missing values (in fact every model would be affected).
