Integrating Maven reporting plugins

I need to setup Maven plugins. I have downloaded the JARs. Can anyone please tell me what do I do next in order to integrate or setup the plugins with Maven? Should I copy the JARs into the parent directory or do I need to edit any file? The plugins are: Java2HTML JDepend Checkstyle Clover Cobertura EMMA Findbugs JavaNCSS PMD QALab Xradar Sonar
