On SQL SERVER 2005, the following happened: Entry of: SELECT TOP 1 * FROM [DevServerB\2K5].master.sys.tables Is changed to SELECT TOP 1 * FROM DevServerB\2K5.master.sys.tables by SQL Server system and you still get the error message: Incorrect syntax near '.'. I tried it with a linked server named in two different ways: '[DevServerB\2K5]' and 'DevServerB\2K5' Does anybody have any other ideas? Thank you Alan Robertson CORRECTION added the next day: I was wrong, partially. When one tries to create a view using a SQL statement like: SELECT * FROM [DevServerB\2K5].TestDB.dbo.tables then the [ and ] are removed and one cannot save the view, BUT if one just writes a query using the same SQL string then it works correctly. I was also able to execute a SQL statement like: INSERT INTO [DevServerB\2K5].TestDB.dbo.tables ( ... ) ... I can do what I wanted, but it would have been much better if I could have saved a view and used a view that would then be used for SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE of the table in the [DevServerB\2K5].TestDB database from the original server where I tried and failed to create a view because of the '\' . -ASR-
