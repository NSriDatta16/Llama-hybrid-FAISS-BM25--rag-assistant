Calculating eigenvectors for PCA and obtaining a different result from Matlab/EViews

Based on the variance-covariance matrix $$\begin{pmatrix}0.62 & 0.62\\ 0.62 & 0.72\end{pmatrix},$$ I have calculated the following eigenvalues $$λ_1 = 0.0500, \;λ_2 = 1.2840.$$ I then calculated the respective eigenvectors: $[-0.9206, 1]$ and $[1, 1.0846]$. However, in MATLAB and EViews the eigenvectors are $[-0.7352, 0.6779]$ and $[0.6779, 0.7352]$. The ratio between my eigenvectors and that in MATLAB and EViews is exactly the same, but the numbers are clearly different, which affects the results slightly. To solve for the eigenvector, I substituted one of the unknowns for $1$ for simplicity. MATLAB and EViews have substituted $0.6779$ instead, but I am wondering how this number is calculated?
