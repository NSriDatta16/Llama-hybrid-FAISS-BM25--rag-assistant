If anyone could help explain to me these formulas, or point me to concepts I need to learn to understand these formulas, I'd really appreciate it. The Simpson's Paradox is simply understandable in the case when you have two samples with very unequal size, say, 10,000 and 1,000,000. You might have the success proportion in the first group to be equal to 0.99, and the success proportion in the second group to be equal 0.01. The paradox starts when you take average over proportions (0.01 + 0.99) / 2 = 0.5 which may force you to conclude that half of observations are successes However, counting raw figures, you get (10,000 * 0.99 + 1,000,000 *0.01) = 19,900 , which is just 19,900 / (1,000,000 + 10,000) = 0.0197 , or just about 2% of observations are successes. The paradox vanishes completely if you want to summarize samples of equal size. Getting to your figures form textbook: Is that what you have looked for?
