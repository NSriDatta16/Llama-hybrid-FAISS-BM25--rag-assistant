The "f" above is a type suffix. This tells the compiler the exact type of the literal provided. This is used so the compiler can allocate the appropriate amount of storage (precision) for the literal. By default, floating point literals are given storage for a "double." If you add "f" as a suffix, the literal will only get the storage for a float, which will have less accuracy. double d = 50.1234; // given double storage double d = 50.1234f; // given float storage, which might lose precision compared to double
