You could try using &pound; or &#163; instead of embedding the character directly; if you embed it directly, you're more likely to run into encoding issues in which your editor saves the file is ISO-8859-1 but it's interpreted as UTF-8, or vice versa. If you want to embed it (or other Unicode characters) directly, make sure you actually save your file as UTF-8, and set the encoding as you did with the Content-Type header. Make sure when you get the file from the server that the header is present and correct, and that the file hasn't been transcoded by the web server.
