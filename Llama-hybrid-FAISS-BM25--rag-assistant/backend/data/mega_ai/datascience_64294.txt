How to build an overfitted network in order to increase performances

I am learning how to implement CNN, and searching on the internet I have found that a trick to design a good network is to first build it in such a way that it overfits, and then use regularization to elimnate overfitting and have a good performing network. But how do I do this? I don't understand how do I build a network that overfits on purpose? And also in which way do I use regularization after? Can someone helo me? Thanks in advance.
