Organizing a Flex Project for Team Use

I'm new to Flex/Actionscript/FlashBuilder, and I don't quite get all the organization concepts. Our teams project is primarily ASP.NET based, so it doesn't have a lot of Flex code. There hasn't really been a need for organization/reuse of common libraries. I'm adding a rather large component that has a lot of files, and I'd like to start keeping it organized for future developers. As I see it, .NET has: Solution File: Points to a bunch of project files. Project File: Contains the actual code and dependencies. Namespace: Organizes code in a hierarchical manner. In Flex, I want a hierarchy somewhat like this example: Car Dealership Business Layer Customer Employee UI Components Advertisement Window Tag Car Infrastructure Payroll Database SWF Projects InventoryViewer CarFeatureViewer CurrentFlyerViewer In .NET, I could have a InventoryViewer Project file, and a Solution file that opened the InventoryViewer project file along with the Infrastructure.Database project file which it depends on. Alternatively, I could have a Solution file that just pointed to InventoryViewer if I didn't want to work on the Database project as well, but the dependency is still there. How does this translate to Flex code organization? I'm having a hard time telling the difference between packages, projects, and just a plain folder hierarchy. Thanks in advance.
