You can use any model to update new data and retrain. The model you have may be hosted on cloud or on premise. I don't know why you said that some models can be trained online and others not. Basically you need to set a data pipeline in place which will capture the new data and send it to your model which will then retrain it. This process is called (not surprisingly!) re-training . It is an integral part of the data science life cycle. And you can use any model for re training not just neural nets! Cheers!
