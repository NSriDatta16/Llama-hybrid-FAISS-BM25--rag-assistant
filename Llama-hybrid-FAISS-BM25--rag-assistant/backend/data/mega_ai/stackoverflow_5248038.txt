It depends on how the controls are positioned around the xib, in most case you should be able to avoid coding using the properties displayed under "Autosizing" in interface builder. Basically everything you do here could be done in code using view.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizing don't forget to implement the viewDidLoad method in a way that tells the view to reposition the elements -(void)viewDidLoad{ self.view.autoresizesSubviews = YES; [super viewDidLoad]; } also, a useful bit is that on ipad, embedding viewcontrollers inside a navigationcontroller makes the ipad handle the most part of rotation and resizing issues.
