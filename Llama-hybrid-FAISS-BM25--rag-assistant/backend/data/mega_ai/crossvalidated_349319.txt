Resources on Explainable AI

I am looking into the field of explainable AI. The idea is to provide justification for the decision/outputs of Machine Learning Algorithms. I found some resources online such as: https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence from DARPA, and this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00794 . Can anyone suggest some good examples where Explainable AI was applied successfully ? Main people in the field ? main research labs ? A book ?
