I've never touched VS setup projects (played with WiX though and can recommend it). Looking at your problem it seems that your CA runs deferred (and with elevated privileges). Searching the net for VS setup projects I came across a lengthy article 1 that contained this paragraph (search for "deferred"): In other words, the Visual Studio design restricts you to custom actions that are called when your files are on the system (deferred custom actions), which means that you must use the CustomActionData property. Other tools that generate MSI files are often more flexible, so if you anticipate complex setups, investigate those tools. 1: http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/visual-studio/visual-studio-setup---projects-and-custom-actions/
