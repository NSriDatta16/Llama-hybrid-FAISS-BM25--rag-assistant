AbsoluteLayout is deprecated, so probably you would have to provide your own drag&drop layout by extending ViewGroup. In general, layout it is responsible for positioning children widgets. This is done in onLayout() method which you would have to override. It will be probably something like this: protected void onLayout(boolean changed, int l, int t, int r, int b) { final int count = getChildCount(); for(int i=0; i So, by implementing your own DragAndDropLayout - you know the position of your children. But, maybe there is simplier solution. Regards!
