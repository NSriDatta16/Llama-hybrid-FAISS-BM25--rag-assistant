LMER model with uneven time points

Does it matter that my time series are taken at random points? All the examples I've seen have nice time series, like every day or whatever. I have what is otherwise a pretty simple model: one fixed treatment condition and then a random intercept and slope for each subject, but the observations are essentially random, like s1 has observations at 1,3,7, and 14 days, whereas s2 has them at, say day 5, 6, and 15 (not even the same number of observations!) I was thinking of either binning (early/late), or considering the missing days as missing data. Can someone advise, and/or point me to a relevant example? P.s., here's the model I'm using: lmer(KPS ~ Day + Tx + (Day | Tx) + (Day | SID), data = d)
