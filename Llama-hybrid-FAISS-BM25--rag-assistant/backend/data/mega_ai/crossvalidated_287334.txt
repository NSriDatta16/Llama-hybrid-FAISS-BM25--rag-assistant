Surveys: Is 25% of a large user base representative?

My employer is currently running a company wide survey about attitudes towards the office i.e. Sentiment. In the past, they opened the survey to all areas of the business (Let's assume 10 very different departments) and all employees within them (Assume 1000 employees in total in the entire company) The amount of employees in each department is not equal and one particular department is probably 50% of the organisations total population. This year, the survey is only being opened to 25% of the total employee base and the selection is 'random' Hence, I have two queries: If it is a truly random selection of the entire employee base, how is that a statistically valid sample assuming all those employees responded? If it is random on a per department level e.g. 25% of each department, how is that a valid sample considering one department is over 50% of the total population. I would have assumed that to determine a majority sentiment in a company, one would need at least 50% of the employee base in each department to provide a true reading sentiment. Update : The survey is not enforced. There can be no guarantee of a 100% response rate from the 25% selected. There is no incentive or punitive means if the survey is or is not filled out.
