there is no one statistical measure of independence, it's impossible to test. the way people go about is to make assumptions about certain aspect of independence and test it. for instance, look at Engle's ARCH test , it tests for heteroscedasticity in time series, i.e. that variance doesn't change. another example of dependence: $var(y_t)\sim y_{t-1}$, which would be difficult to detect visually in the scatter plot you have shown.
