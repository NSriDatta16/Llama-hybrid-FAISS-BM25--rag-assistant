The const char* variant is correct. You should not change memory that comes from a string literal (referred to as static storage usually). It is read only memory. The difference is that the char* variant will allow you to write the syntax to change the data that it points to by dereferencing it. What it actually does though is undefined. //Option 1: char *p = "orkut"; *p = 'x';//undefined behavior //Option 2: const char *q = "orkut"; *q = 'x';//compiling error I would rather have option 2 happen to me.
