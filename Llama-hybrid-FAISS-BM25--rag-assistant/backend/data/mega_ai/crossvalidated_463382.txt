A "confidence interval" is a specific case of the broader concept of a "confidence set", which may or may not be a single connected interval. The broader concept can be conceived mathematically as follows. Suppose we have an observable data vector $\mathbf{X}_n \equiv (X_1,...,X_n)$ from a distribution with unknown parameter $\theta \in \Theta$ . Then a confidence set for the parameter $\theta$ is created from a set function $\mathcal{S}$ that satisfies the following conditional probability requirement: $^\dagger$ $$1-\alpha = \mathbb{P}(\theta \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbf{X}_n, \alpha)|\theta) \quad \quad \quad \text{for all } \theta \in \Theta \text{ and } 0 \leqslant \alpha \leqslant 1.$$ Note that if $\theta$ is conceived as a random variable then this requirement also implies the following weaker property pertaining to the marginal probability of inclusion: $$1-\alpha = \mathbb{P}(\theta \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbf{X}_n, \alpha)) \quad \quad \quad \text{for all } 0 \leqslant \alpha \leqslant 1. \quad \quad \quad \quad$$ Now, given a set function that comports to the above conditional probability requirement, for a given value $0 \leqslant \alpha \leqslant 1$ , the confidence set for the data $\mathbf{x}_n$ (with confidence level $1-\alpha$ ) is the fixed set $\mathcal{S}(\mathbf{x}_n, \alpha)$ . In the case where this is a single connected interval, we call it a confidence interval. As can be seen, the confidence set is a fixed set determined by the observed data. As such, it is not possible to make any non-degenerate probability statement about its coverage of a fixed parameter. However, if we treat the data as random, we can see that the random confidence set will contain the conditioning value of the parameter $\theta$ with probability equal to the confidence level. This holds regardless of the conditioning value, and so it also holds as a marginal property if $\theta$ is a random variable. As discussed in a related answer , this is an extremely useful and robust property. $^\dagger$ One slight complication here is that we sometimes form confidence intervals that only satisfy this probability requirement under some approximating assumption (e.g., distributional approximation using the central limit theorem). In these cases the probability requirement is satisfied exactly under some simplifying assumption and it holds approximately in broader cases.
