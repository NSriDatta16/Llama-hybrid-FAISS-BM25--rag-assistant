Is it possible to graph this?

Is it possible to graph this? I tried doing it on a calculator but didn't have any success. If someone can and post the graph I would greatly appreciate it. $$\frac{1}{\bar{m}_{T}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{12} \sum_{h=T-11}^{T} (m_{h} - \bar{m}_{T})^2}.$$ If the equation is hard to read, it is just the standard deviation of 12 observations $(m_{h})$, $h=T-11, T-10, \ldots, T$, over the mean of the same 12 observations. The standard deviation is the population standard deviation and the mean $\bar{m}_{T}$ is simple average.
