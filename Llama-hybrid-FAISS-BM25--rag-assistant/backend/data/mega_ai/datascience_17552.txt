Bringing this thread back to life, as this could be useful to others landing here with similar questions. Facebook recently released and open-sourced one of their internal forecasting tool called Prophet It is available as both R & Python packages, and proves to be an interesting solution for someone with little Machine Learning background. However, some additional ML knowledge allows to tune and optimize the produced models. I recommend giving Prophet a try as a first step. The quick win on this solution is the ease and speed of the model building and testing: you can literally get a descent projection in a matter of minutes. It behaves very well on time series, catching the seasonality of the data at hand "naturally". Under the hood, it's similar to a generalized additive model (GAM) - more details on the dedicated paper: https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/static/prophet_paper_20170113.pdf
