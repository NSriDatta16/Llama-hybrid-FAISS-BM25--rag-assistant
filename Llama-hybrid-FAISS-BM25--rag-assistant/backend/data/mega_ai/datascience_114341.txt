Are Soft and Bahdanau attentions different?

I have been working on a Image Captioning model. And read many articles accomplishing it. Some used both attentions interchangably while some did not. And the formulaes differed too. So, I would like to know if Soft Attention and Bahdanau Attention are any different?
