How to load static data in Mirth, avoid many roundtrips to a database

Mirth is a broker to help with healthcare application HL7 message integration. My question is about saving yourself the trouble of hitting your own datastore everytime you want to do a lookup on some data contained within the HL7. Scenario: for each message received by the channel, I want to find the facility's mnemonic/code/ID and get the full name of the facility. Unfortunately I cannot ask the sender of the HL7 message to send it along in the message for me. So I have to write my own DB access code to call a stored procedure, pass in the ID, and receive the full name. Any idea on how to create a cache of data in Mirth so that you can access the lookup from any channel, source, destination, transformer or filter?
