An alternative way, slightly more low-level than folder actions, but I suspect more flexible, is to use launchd to watch a folder. See launchd.plist(5) , or the overview documentation for launchd (unfortunately, this overview documentation is primarily concerned with daemons, but the principle is the same; the key you're interested in is WatchPaths , so searching for that might find something more like a tutorial). If you go this route, you need to create a .plist like the following, which runs the command /path/to/virus/scanner.sh /Junk/Downloads whenever the /Junk/Downloads directory is modified. Label localhost.clamav.clamscan LowPriorityIO Nice 1 ProgramArguments /path/to/virus/scanner.sh /Junk/Downloads WatchPaths /Junk/Downloads Put that in $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/foo.plist , and the command launchctl load $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/foo.plist will start it going.
