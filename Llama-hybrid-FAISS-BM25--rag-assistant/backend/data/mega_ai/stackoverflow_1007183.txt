The considerations are: Consistency . Agree on language to use, code styles, documentation format in advance Ease of collaboration . Set up SVN or GIT to ensure all changes are logged and accountable Planning . Nobody should be writting any code until you've throughly mapped out what the application does. Communication . Make sure communication is well organised. You don't want different things being said to different people. Set up an email list or forum so people are kept in the loop. Changes . How will changes and features be added. Responsibility . Where do your responsibilities end and the contractors start. If the contractor sends data your part can't handle is it your responsibility to correct the data or theirs? This is the biggest problem because it can be hard to foresee these things. Especially do not assume the lines are obvious as often responsibilities overlap. Define the limits of your responsibilities clearly and early.
