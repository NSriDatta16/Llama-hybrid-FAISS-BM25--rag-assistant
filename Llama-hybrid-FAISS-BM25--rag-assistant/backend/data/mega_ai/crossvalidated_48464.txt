Confidence intervals based on asymptotic normality

I wrote a report about confidence intervals based on asymptotic normality . However, my supervisor said that the definition in the second paragraph is wrong, but I do not know what is wrong. I have attached the report here. Can you please take a look and let me know what is wrong?
