I would personally think this type of behavior is a bit annoying. Why are you prohibiting the user from focusing on that field? A better solution would be to hide/disable the field until it is ready to have data entered into it. You should also have some text to explain why the field is disabled. Edit: The error message you posted has some results on google, but it seems like it could be any number of issues, this one http://www.francoisfaubert.com/2008/03/06/cant-move-focus-to-control/ sounds like it could be a possibility. Check your HTML to see if there are other controls with the same ID on the page.
