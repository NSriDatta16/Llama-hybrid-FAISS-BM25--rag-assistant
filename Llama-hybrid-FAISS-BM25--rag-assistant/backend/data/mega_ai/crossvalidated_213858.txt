Logistic regression seems wrong as it would assume independence between the observations at time t1 and t2 (I assume these are the same subjects). Either t1 could be a factor in the model for t2 (or vice versa) or you would want a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) or could use GEEs. Also, you probably cannot ignore the missing data of people with a response at t2 that do not have a response at t1 except under some extremely strong assumptions (MCAR). A GLMM would implicitly impute the missing data under a specific MAR assumption, which at least allows the response at one time to influence the missingness at the other time. Regarding the separation, one thing that would help is a Bayesian approach with at least weakly-informative priors.
