When thinking about PCA I visualize taking a picture of a 3d object (projecting the 3d image into 2d). Consider a partially deflated (american) football. From what perspective would the picture show the greatest amount of the football? You would certainly want a full view of the length of the football (1st PC: direction of greatest variance). The second PC would correspond to the width of the football (direction of second greatest variance), and the third would correspond to the depth (which is not much because the football has been flattened.) You would be best able to identify the 3d object in 2d using the view found by PCA: the length and width, disregarding the depth (the dimension with the lowest variance)
