LOOCV has a lower variance of the fit compared with the validation set approach, but its aim is not the fit but the estimation of the generalisation error. What we'd like to have is an estimate of the generalisation error from a fit based on $n$ observations. A validation set approach where you split the data into two halves will get you an estimate of the generalisation error from a fit based on half of the observations. As the fit will have a larger variance, the generalisation error will on average be estimated too high (variance in the fit translates into bias in the generalisation error, because a fit going very wrong in any direction of the observation you want to predict will yield a high error). LOOCV gives us an estimate of the generalisation error from a fit based on $n-1$ observations. Lower than $n$ , therefore still bias in the generlisation error, but lower, because $n-1$ observations will allow for a more precise fit.
