Get average balances from transactions?

I don't know if this forum or the DS forum is better but I'll start here. I have a project that has been presented to me but I'm trying to think of the tools that I would apply to this (or if it's even possible). I have obscured the exact details in order to protect the project, but here is a good illustration: Let's say there is a bank and you want to find the average account balance of all the people that have an account with that bank. You only have information on transactions and nothing else to go on. So you have information like: Three hundred bank members each just wrote a check for \$125 Two hundred bank members just bought coffee at $2.50 each 400 members just had deposits of various values each I do not know how many members the bank has at any given time I do not have any information on the current balances (i.e. starting balances) of any bank members Is this enough information to draw an inference on the average account balance of each member? I can track members both individually and in the aggregate but the datasets may not always be complete; I might miss individual transactions and never know it. Thoughts?
