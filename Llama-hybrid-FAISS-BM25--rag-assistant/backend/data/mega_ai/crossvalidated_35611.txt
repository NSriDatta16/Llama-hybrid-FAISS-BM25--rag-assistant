Spectral analysis detects periodicity in stationary time series. The frequency domain approach based on spectral density estimation is an approach I would recommend as your first step. If for certain periods irregularity means a much higher peak than is typical for that period then the series with such irregularities would not be stationary and spectral anlsysis would not be appropriate. But assuming you have identified the period that has the irregularities you should be able to determine approximately what the normal peak height would be and then can set a threshold at some level above that average to designate the irregular cases.
