It's not completely clear from your question how your scheme works. Does every instance of the client software have a different key? How long does the license last? Do you have a different key per customer? How is the license paid for? How is a license renewed? If you are trying to control numbers of usages of the client code then only the first one above will do it. At the end of the day, in the world you appear to inhabit, I suspect that you are going to have to live in trust that there are no blatant infringements of your license. Most decent sized organisations (which it sounds like your customers would be) have a responsibility not to infringe which can lead them to serious consequences if they break the license agreements. They will be audited on it periodically too and you probably have some statutory rights to go and check their usage (if not you should write it into your license agreement). Where it becomes very dangerous for you is if the contents of the USB keys find their way onto the web. In that regard any scheme which uses a published key is vulnerable to a wilful disclosure of the secrets. I'm certain there is a lot of literature on this subject, so it is probably worth you continuing your research. BTW I'm not sure about your reference to SLAs in the middle part about your server licensing. Licensing and SLAs are very different. A license is the clients obligation an SLA is yours.
