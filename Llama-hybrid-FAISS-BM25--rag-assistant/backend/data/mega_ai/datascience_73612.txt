I think RNNs (LSTM, GRU etc.) is more suitable for text classification. CNNs has a fixed window size, thus you will always need to pad the input into same length. I took a cursory look at the Doc2Vec document. It says Doc2Vec is a Model that represents each Document as a Vector. Given only one vector for each document, it's meaningless to use CNNs as a classifier. Since CNNs is used to capture the local pattern or something. However, you can split the document into sentences or paragraphs, but you will still need to pad it into same length.
