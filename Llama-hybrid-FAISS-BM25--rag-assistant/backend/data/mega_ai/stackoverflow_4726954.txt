Why use isolated storage in an ASP.NET application?

I need to store user preferences on a per page basis in my application. For example, several pages use a custom grid pager control that needs to keep its current page size between postbacks. Most of the settings don't need to persist once the user leaves the page, but in some situations they do need to be restored. Note: Session is disabled in this application and will not be used. I did some reading on isolated storage and understand that it can be used to store these user settings. Obviously cookies have been around a long time and are a proven approach to this scenario, but what about isolated storage? Is it going to work for all browsers and in all environments? Are permissions a problem? Does it require configuring anything on the end-user's side? Just how widely used is it? Why should one use isolated storage in an application for the given example? Thanks!
