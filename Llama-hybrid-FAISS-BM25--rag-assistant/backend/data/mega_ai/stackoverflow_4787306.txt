is it possible to restrict a Bookmarklet?

for example, if I have a Bookmarklet in my site that let's users do something, is it possible to restrict it's use to Registered users? I mean, anyone can drag a Bookmarklet into their bookmarks bar, but can we use a system to restrict bookmarklets functions to Registered users? For example, a user drags the bookmarklet into the bar and then he/she tries to execute it, but the bookmarklet somehow checks if this user is registered in the website and if not, it asks for username and password... Something like that. Can you help?
