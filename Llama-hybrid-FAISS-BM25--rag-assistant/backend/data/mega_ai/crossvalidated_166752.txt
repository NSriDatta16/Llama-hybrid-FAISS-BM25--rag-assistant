Identifiability in Parameter Estimation Problem

I have a question regarding the identifiability of parameters. I know that if $f(y;\theta)=f(y;\theta')$ then $\theta = \theta'$, otherwise it would be impossible to estimate $\theta$. However, here is my question: let's say we have a PDF of $f(y;\theta_1+\theta_2)$ then $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are not individually identifiable by the definition. However if I can find $g(y;\theta_1)=E_{\theta_2}[f(y;\theta_1+\theta_2)]$, then is $\theta_1$ now identifiable? In other words if we have an unidentifiable problem because a single parameter of the density function $\theta$ depends on two different parameters $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ can we turn this into an identifiable problem by averaging out one of the parameters?
