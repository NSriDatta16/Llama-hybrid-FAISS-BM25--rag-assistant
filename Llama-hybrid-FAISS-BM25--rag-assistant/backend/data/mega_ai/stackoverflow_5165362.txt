I'm not sure if you are running on Windows, but if you are another option is to allow perfmon gather stats about your ColdFusion instance such as Average Request Time, Queue Length etc. You can also of course gather CPU, Available Memory etc via perfmon and store them a set of log files you can read once a minute using a CF scheduled task and store in the database to summarise and graph etc. Of course your data might be up to a minute old in this case, but it can be very useful for storing metrics over days and months so you can see how your server is performing over time. We have used this solution for a few years now and while it takes some maintenance, it does give us a great overview of how all our servers perform. I would like to use something in future like New Relic but they do not support JRun. Maybe if CF allow standalone with Tomcat we'll see this option in future.
