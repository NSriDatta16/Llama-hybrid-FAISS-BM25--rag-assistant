Advice on using modules with Ruby on Rails

I am using Ruby on Rails 3 and I would know in which case is good to use Modules. I have a controller including a lot of private methods that I use in this way: class UsersController As you can see, in private methods I have things like ActiveRecords and params methods . I know that in a Module you can not use those ActiveRecords or params methods directly, but you can pass they as arguments like in this example: # In the controller file class UsersController So, what do you advice in my case? Is it good to use separate Modules? Questions of secondary importance (for now...): What about performance? P.S. I: Pay no attention to the simplicity of the examples. They are written just to understand my dilemma about passing ActiveRecords and params methods. P.S. II: If you need to have some other information, let me know.
