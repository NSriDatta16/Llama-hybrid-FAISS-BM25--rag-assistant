Invalid Adjustment Sets in causal graph

I'm reading a documentation on causal inference on graph and I'm currently on the chapter about identification. In this section, the authors give examples of invalid adjustment sets, one of which is as in Figure 4a below, followed by a description of why conditioning on a collider biases the estimate of P(B|do(A)): However, I'm confused about the first sentence of this paragraph. Why is A and B statistically independent of each other/why are they d-separated in this graph? A is shown to be adjacent to B/they are connected by a directed edge. Am I understanding this incorrectly? Is it the case that the authors put this statement in a slightly wrong way?
