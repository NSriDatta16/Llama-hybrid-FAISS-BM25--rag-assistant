How do we get output layer in skip-gram?

Could you please explain how do we get output layer in this architecture (vectors [0.2, 0.8, -1.4, 1.2] and [-0.3, 0.2, -0.7, 0.1] ). I understand that layer before are embeddings of word "brown". But how do we get vector [0.2, 0.8, -1.4, 1.2] ? I thought it should be dot product of "brown"'s embeddings with "quick"'s embeddings? Could you please describe in details how this part works?
