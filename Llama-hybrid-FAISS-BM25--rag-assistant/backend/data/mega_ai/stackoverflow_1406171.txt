http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#Origin_of_the_term Firmware Origin of the term The term "firmware" was coined by Ascher Opler in a 1967 Datamation article. 1 Originally, it meant the microcode â€“ contents of a writable control store (a specialized small area of RAM memory), which defined and implemented the computer's instruction set. The firmware could be reloaded if needed to specialize or modify the instructions that the central processing unit (CPU) could execute. As originally used, firmware was contrasted with hardware (the CPU itself) and software (normal instructions executing on a CPU). It was not composed of CPU machine instructions, but of lower-level microcode involved in the implementation of machine instructions. It existed on the boundary of hardware and software, thus the term firmware. Later the term was broadened to include any type of microcode, whether in RAM or ROM. Still later, the term was again broadened in popular usage to denote anything ROM-resident, including processor machine instructions for BIOS, bootstrap loaders, or specialized applications. When it comes to the subject of updating the firmware to a new version, a typical procedure until the mid 1990s, was to replace a storage medium containing firmware, usually a socketed ROM. Nowadays, this approach is largely abandoned in presence of firmware's capability to overwrite itself in a convenient, purely electronic operation.
