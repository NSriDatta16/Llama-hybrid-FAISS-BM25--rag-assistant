Well, Amazon EC2 is only as bad as the amount of traffic you get. So the ideal situation is to monetize your site (ads, affiliate programs, etc) so that that more traffic you get, the more you pay Amazon, but the more you make...in theory of course. As for a budget of nothing...there's not really much you can do...hosting typically always costs something, but since you are using the LAMP stack, it's pretty cheap. For example, hosting on GoDaddy.com for 1year can be about $50-60 which is not too bad. I use dreamhost which costs about $80 per year, but I get MUCH more storage and bandwidth.
