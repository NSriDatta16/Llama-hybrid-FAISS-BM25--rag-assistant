Increase in rates over time

I am looking for an appropriate method to analyse these data/situation: We sell electronic devices. Customers are encouraged to report defective devices. Around every months we calculate the cumulative rate of {defective_devices}/{all_sold_devices}. I would like to monitor for sharp increases in the rates of defectives; for example if I calculate the cumulative rates each months from 1 to 5 I will have 0.3, 0.55, 0.4, 0.78, 0.85... it appears that the slope of the curve sharply increases at 0.78 onwards. What statistical methods can I use to determine that the slope significantly increases by a certain predetermined value? I'm also worried about the arbitrary selection of monitoring every month, why not every week or even every day? How does one determine what is the proper monitoring period?
