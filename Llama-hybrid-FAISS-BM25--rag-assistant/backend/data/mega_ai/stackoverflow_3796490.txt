Error: Unable to open class file R.java

Did a fresh install of Eclipse, JDK and android-sdk. I am currently receiving this error when creating a new project [2010-09-26 16:07:56 - Test] ERROR: Unable to open class file C:\workspace\Test\gen\com\example\test\R.java: No such file or directory What's the reason for this and how do I fix it? Eclipse Helios 32 bit java version "1.6.0_21" Android sdk API 8 P.S. I'm new to Android development. EDIT: I tried most of your solutions, but nothing worked. So I started using my friend's install of Eclipse Ganymede.
