Forecasting elections by using survey data (in R)

In advance: my sincere apologies for any incompleteness, lack of knowledge and general stupidity in this post. I am doing my ultimate best to be as complete and thorough as possible - but I could imagine that this question should be posted in a more statistical forum. Context As the titles states; I am currently trying to forecast the Dutch municipal election results based on an annual survey. The survey is send out to a random sample of 10.000 inhabitants of the municipality, of which 35% is the average response rate. The survey data is available for 16 years (and can be grouped on a neighborhood level) and elections are held every 4 years. The outcomes of each election are known and grouped by neighborhood (as well). Approach The Dutch election system is an open party list system of proportional representation. In previous research forecasters have used 'Dynamic Linear Models' (also available as an R-package) for this purpose (use in elections: http://umu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:871401/FULLTEXT01.pdf ). I am aware of the fact this is 'pooled cross sectional data' and have discovered that there is a package available that deals with DLM for Panel Data. Is anyone aware of the existence of a DLM package that deals with Pooled cross sectional data or could, with the data described above, plm do the job? Would you suggest a different approach to coping with this problem? Please; if anything is unclear - ask.
