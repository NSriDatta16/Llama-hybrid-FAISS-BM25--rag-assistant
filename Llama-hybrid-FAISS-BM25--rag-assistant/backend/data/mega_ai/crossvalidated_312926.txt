No, there's no need to fall on round numbers. However, categories may be important for description (e.g. age intervals). On the other side, what if you're constructing a histogram with a variable whose sample values are between 0.23 and 1.12? Here the round numbers are simply impossible. Whether these bins make the histogram look good or horrible strongly depends on sample size; for instance, data from a bayesian MCMC are so numerous (generally > 1000) that you may well choose very small bins, way smaller than unity. Try these lines in R: hist(rnorm(10), breaks = seq(from = -3, to = 3, by = 1)) hist(rnorm(10), breaks = seq(from = -3, to = 3, by = 0.5)) hist(rnorm(10000), breaks= seq(from = -5, to = 5, by = 1)) hist(rnorm(10000), breaks= seq(from = -5, to = 5, by = 0.5)) hist(rnorm(10000), breaks= seq(from = -5, to = 5, by = 0.1)) Now compare how informative are them concerning the underlaying distribution of values (normal with mean 0 and sd 1). hist(rnorm(10000), breaks= seq(from = -5, to = 5, by = 0.1), prob = TRUE) curve(dnorm(x, 0, 1), from = -5, to = 5, add = TRUE, col = "red")
