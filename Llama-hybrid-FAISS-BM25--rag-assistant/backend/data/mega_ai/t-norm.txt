In mathematics, a t-norm (also T-norm or, unabbreviated, triangular norm) is a kind of binary operation used in the framework of probabilistic metric spaces and in multi-valued logic, specifically in fuzzy logic. A t-norm generalizes intersection in a lattice and conjunction in logic. The name triangular norm refers to the fact that in the framework of probabilistic metric spaces t-norms are used to generalize the triangle inequality of ordinary metric spaces. Definition A t-norm is a function T: [0, 1] × [0, 1] → [0, 1] that satisfies the following properties: Commutativity: T(a, b) = T(b, a) Monotonicity: T(a, b) ≤ T(c, d) if a ≤ c and b ≤ d Associativity: T(a, T(b, c)) = T(T(a, b), c) The number 1 acts as identity element: T(a, 1) = a Since a t-norm is a binary algebraic operation on the interval [0, 1], infix algebraic notation is also common, with the t-norm usually denoted by ∗ {\displaystyle *} . The defining conditions of the t-norm are exactly those of a partially ordered abelian monoid on the real unit interval [0, 1]. (Cf. ordered group.) The monoidal operation of any partially ordered abelian monoid L is therefore by some authors called a triangular norm on L. Classification of t-norms A t-norm is called continuous if it is continuous as a function, in the usual interval topology on [0, 1]2. (Similarly for left- and right-continuity.) A t-norm is called strict if it is continuous and strictly monotone. A t-norm is called nilpotent if it is continuous and each x in the open interval (0, 1) is nilpotent, that is, there is a natural number n such that x ∗ {\displaystyle *} ... ∗ {\displaystyle *} x (n times) equals 0. A t-norm ∗ {\displaystyle *} is called Archimedean if it has the Archimedean property, that is, if for each x, y in the open interval (0, 1) there is a natural number n such that x ∗ {\displaystyle *} ... ∗ {\displaystyle *} x (n times) is less than or equal to y. The usual partial ordering of t-norms is pointwise, that is, T1 ≤ T2 if T1(a, b) ≤ T2(a, b) for all a, b in [0, 1]. As functions, pointwise larger t-norms are sometimes called stronger than those pointwise smaller. In the semantics of t-norm fuzzy logics, however, the larger a t-norm, the weaker (in terms of logical strength) conjunction it represents. Prominent examples Minimum t-norm ⊤ m i n ( a , b ) = min { a , b } , {\displaystyle \top _{\mathrm {min} }(a,b)=\min\{a,b\},} also called the Gödel t-norm, as it is the standard semantics for conjunction in Gödel fuzzy logic. Besides that, it occurs in most t-norm based fuzzy logics as the standard semantics for weak conjunction. It is the pointwise largest t-norm (see the properties of t-norms below). Product t-norm ⊤ p r o d ( a , b ) = a ⋅ b {\displaystyle \top _{\mathrm {prod} }(a,b)=a\cdot b} (the ordinary product of real numbers). Besides other uses, the product t-norm is the standard semantics for strong conjunction in product fuzzy logic. It is a strict Archimedean t-norm. Łukasiewicz t-norm ⊤ L u k ( a , b ) = max { 0 , a + b − 1 } . {\displaystyle \top _{\mathrm {Luk} }(a,b)=\max\{0,a+b-1\}.} The name comes from the fact that the t-norm is the standard semantics for strong conjunction in Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic. It is a nilpotent Archimedean t-norm, pointwise smaller than the product t-norm. Drastic t-norm ⊤ D ( a , b ) = { b if a = 1 a if b = 1 0 otherwise. {\displaystyle \top _{\mathrm {D} }(a,b)={\begin{cases}b&{\mbox{if }}a=1\\a&{\mbox{if }}b=1\\0&{\mbox{otherwise.}}\end{cases}}} The name reflects the fact that the drastic t-norm is the pointwise smallest t-norm (see the properties of t-norms below). It is a right-continuous Archimedean t-norm. Nilpotent minimum ⊤ n M ( a , b ) = { min ( a , b ) if a + b > 1 0 otherwise {\displaystyle \top _{\mathrm {nM} }(a,b)={\begin{cases}\min(a,b)&{\mbox{if }}a+b>1\\0&{\mbox{otherwise}}\end{cases}}} is a standard example of a t-norm that is left-continuous, but not continuous. Despite its name, the nilpotent minimum is not a nilpotent t-norm. H
