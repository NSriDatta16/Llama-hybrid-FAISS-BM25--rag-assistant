The paper cited does not mention linear regression at all. What it does is using a neural network to predict continuous variables, and refers to that as regression. The regression that is defined (which is not linear at all), is just a CNN with convolutional layers, and fully connected layers, but in the last fully connected layer, it does not apply sigmoid or softmax, which is what is typically used in classification, as the values correspond to probabilities. Instead, what this CNN outputs are four values $(r, c, h, w)$, where $(r, c)$ specify the values of the position of the left corner and $(h, w)$ the height and width of the window. In order to train this NN, the loss function will penalize when the outputs of the NN are very different from the labelled $(r, c, h, w)$ in the training set.
