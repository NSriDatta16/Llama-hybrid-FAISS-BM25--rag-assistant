At what level of abstraction are you looking for an answer? At the physical level, they're all probably stored in gate capacitances and magnetic domains. (Maybe even photons if your swap disk is Wi-Fi or optical fiber connected.) At one hardware level, copies of any and all of these variables could exist at several places in the register, data cache (perhaps in multiple levels), main memory, and/or storage hierarchy, everything from completely swapped out to disk or non-volatile memory storage (depending on the existence, implementation, and current state of any demand-paged virtual memory subsystem), to perhaps everything in registers if your applicationâ€™s size and lifetime is tiny enough. Given the most familiar compiler and runtime implementations, memory (perhaps virtual) is chopped into things called stacks and heaps. Given the formal language definition, this chopping may or may not be required. At the compiler optimization level, many of these variable may have been optimized out of existence. They're not stored anywhere except as an abstraction.
