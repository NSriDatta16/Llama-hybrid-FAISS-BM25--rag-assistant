If you use CSS to place the floating toolbars, they'll stay put more cleanly than they will if you use JavaScript (or GWT evet handlers) to update their positions. Of course, this would only apply if you were scrolling around the content of a page, and it doesn't look like that's the case here. CSS3 supports animations - perhaps they're looking at your drag gesture, determining the speed you're moving, and then just apply velocities to the images that make up the map?
