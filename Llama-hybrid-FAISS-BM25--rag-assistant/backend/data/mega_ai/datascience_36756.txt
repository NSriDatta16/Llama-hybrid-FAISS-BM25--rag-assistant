NLP tasks that would be harmed by lemmatization: 1) Tense classification sentence | tense ------------------------------------ He cooked a nice meal | past He cooks a nice meal | present The sequence of characters at the end of verbs can help in this task. The verbs cooked and cooks differ at the last characters ed and s repectively. With lemmatization, this information is lost. Both verbs become cook , making both sentences seem (in this case) in the present tense. 2) Author identification Given a set of documents $\mathcal{P}$ written by author $a$, a set of documents $\mathcal{Q}$ written by author $b$, a set of documents $\mathcal{S}$ written by either author $a$ or $b$, classify if a document $s\in\mathcal{S}$ is written by author $a$ or $b$. One way to achieve this is by looking at the histogram of words present in $s$ and compare it to documents from $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ and select the most similar one. This works because different authors use certain words with different frequencies. However, by using lemmatization, you distort these frequencies impairing the performance of your model.
