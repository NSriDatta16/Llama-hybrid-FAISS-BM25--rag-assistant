What is the most elegant way of showing first week in a month

In C#, I want to show the first week in a calendar (in a html table) and I am trying to figure out the most elegant algorithm to generate the right days. If the first day of the week is not Sunday, I want to show the days of preceding month (like you would see on a regular calendar). So, as an input you have a current month. In this case May. I want to generate this: Month: May S M T W TH F Sa 25 26 27 28 29 30 1 so it should display something like this (ignore the alignment) S | M | T | W | Th | F | Sa | 25 - 26 - 27 - 28 - 29 - 30 - 1 given that each month would have the start of day be a different day of the week, I am trying to figure out an elegant way to get the values of this data using the DateTime object. I see it has a dayofweek property on a date. I am generating this table in C# on my server to pass down to a html page.
