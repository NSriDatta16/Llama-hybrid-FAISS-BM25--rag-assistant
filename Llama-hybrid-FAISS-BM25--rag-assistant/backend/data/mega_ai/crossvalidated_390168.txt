While this is a pure python related question which is not fitted here for CrossValidated, let me help you anyway. Both procedures find the correct eigenvectors. The difference is in its representation. While PCA() lists the entries of an eigenvectors rowwise, np.linalg.eig() lists the entries of the eigenvectors columnwise. Remember that eigenvectors are only unique up to a sign. Indeed, a simple check yields: print(abs(eig_vec.T.round(10))==abs(pca.components_.round(10))) [[ True, True, True, True], [ True, True, True, True], [ True, True, True, True], [ True, True, True, True]])
