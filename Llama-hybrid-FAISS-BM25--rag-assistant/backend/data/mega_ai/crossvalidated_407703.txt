Anomaly detection in time series data from multiple sensors

I've build a classification model based on 15 features coming in real time from 15 sensors. The window time is 60 seconds, means that the classification model needs 60 records from each sensor (the frequency is 1Hz). What i'm trying to do, is for each sensor i want to implement an anomaly detection algorithm that can detect anomalous data in the time series and fix with using interpolation, KNN or some other algorithms. So, i have a seconds time series record, how can i detect which timestamps are anomalous?
