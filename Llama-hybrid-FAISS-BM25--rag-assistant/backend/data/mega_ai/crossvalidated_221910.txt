Coefficients linear and log-linear regression model

I performed both a linear and log-linear regression to predict the price of a smartphone based on its characteristics. Now I have a question concerning the coefficients between the two models. In the linear regression model, the dummy variable GPS included or not is 37,7. This means that smartphone users pay on average 47.7 euro more for a smartphone with a GPS built in than one without, while holding other variables in the model constant. lm |t|) (Intercept) 44.62802 70.21355 0.636 0.525128 Screensize -6.78973 7.14553 -0.950 0.342155 Multitouch 11.20542 12.62356 0.888 0.374861 nbrCores 14.58104 2.67044 5.460 5.53e-08 *** Processorspeed 46.84652 9.54521 4.908 1.02e-06 *** Memory -24.12829 6.02706 -4.003 6.54e-05 *** nbrSims -9.23095 8.00187 -1.154 0.248842 CameraBack 3.10923 0.62724 4.957 7.94e-07 *** CameraFront 10.69124 2.45340 4.358 1.40e-05 *** Autofocus -20.51415 9.40548 -2.181 0.029326 * Flitsertype 10.63140 7.10996 1.495 0.135043 5-GHzOndersteuning NA NA NA NA GPS 47.68043 11.81778 4.035 5.73e-05 *** .... --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 102.3 on 1556 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.7766, Adjusted R-squared: 0.7613 F-statistic: 51.02 on 106 and 1556 DF, p-value: Next, when we take a look at the log-linear regression model, the coefficient for the GPS variable is 2.249e-02, which means that the smartphone retail price increases with 2.52% = (e2.249e-02 − 1) when GPS is included, while holding other variables in the model constant. lm3 |t|) (Intercept) 3.268e+00 2.598e-01 12.575 The average price for a smartphone in my model is 232€. So, in the log-linear model 2.52% of 232€ is +- 5.85€. How come this value is so different in comparison with the result obtained from the linear regression model?
