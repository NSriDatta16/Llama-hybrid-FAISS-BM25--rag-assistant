While loop / java

I'm doing a program which has two different questions, ohm and ampere to be exact. I know how to make this work but the problem is that in the end one more question should pop up asking "do u want to make a new calculation?" this question should work like if I press "Y" the program should continue from the beginning and if I press "N" the program should exit. I hope anyone got some ideas that could help me finish this. And the program has to be in JOptionpane.dialog/message format. //delajz this is what i got atm. //Declaring Variables Ampere = Integer.parseInt(FragaAm); Ohm = Integer.parseInt(FragaOhm); //koden do { FragaAm =JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Hur många Ampere? "); FragaOhm = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("hur hög resistans? "); svar = Ohm*Ampere; //calculate slutsvar = svar + "Volt"; //answer JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,slutsvar); borjaom =JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Igen? J eller N " ); // the question which ask for new calc } while ( borjaom == "j" ||borjaom == "J" );
