cakephp Session->write problem in linux

I have problem with cakephp's Session->write method. If I set a value like $_SESSION['..'] i'm able to read it back. But if I use the write method it's not working. My problem is same as here: http://www.nabble.com/Session-problem-td16684956.html The same code was working in windows but it's not working after I moved to linux. Any permission problem would be the reason? (but i have given rw permission fully for the cake app directory). code sample: in the link: http://www.nabble.com/Session-problem-td16684956.html Configure::write('Session.save', 'php'); Configure::write('Session.cookie', 'CAKEPHP'); Configure::write('Session.start', true); Configure::write('Session.checkAgent', false); Configure::write('Security.level', 'medium'); cake version: 1.2.3.8166
