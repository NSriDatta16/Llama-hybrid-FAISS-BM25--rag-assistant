If anyone's having the same problem and wondering how o fix it I found out the problem was being caused by my SD card. I bought a 32gb kingston sd card and just yesterday I decided to try running the same code again accept using the internal storage instead and everything worked perfectly. I also tried the stock 2gb SD card it came with and it also worked perfectly. I glad to know my code works great but a little frustrated I spent 50 bucks on a defective memory card. Thanks for everyones input.
