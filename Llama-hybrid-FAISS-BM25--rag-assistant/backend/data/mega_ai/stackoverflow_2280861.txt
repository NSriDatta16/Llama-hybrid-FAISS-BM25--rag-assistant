Breadcrumbs menu are a recurrent pattern in most Rails applications. To solve this issue, I created and released a plugin called breadcrumbs_on_rails . You define your breadcrumbs in the controller class MyController add_breadcrumb "home", root_path add_breadcrumb "my", my_path def index # ... add_breadcrumb "index", index_path end end and you render them in your view. untitled Even if you don't want to use a plugin, I encourage you to give it a look. It's open source and you can grab some idea for your app.
