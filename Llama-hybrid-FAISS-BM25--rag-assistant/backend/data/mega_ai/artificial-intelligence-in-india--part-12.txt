lture Development Trust and Microsoft in 2025 led to a 40% increase in yield and a 50% reduction in production costs due to water and pesticide usage. Through a smartphone application Agripilot.ai developed by Click2Cloud, the AI notify farmers of possible pest attacks, soil conditions, air speed, and weather conditions to determine when to apply pesticides and how much water the crop requires. Utilizing a variety of data sources, including satellite imagery, weather forecasts, soil sensors, and inputs unique to each farm, the AI generate personalized suggestions for farmers. Microsoft's Azure Data Manager for Agriculture (formerly Microsoft FarmBeats), is used to process this data. The annual fee for AI services is ₹10,000. In order to offer insights, the data is analyzed by the open-source research project FarmVibes.ai in conjunction with historical crop data. For the farmer, Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service transforms these details into easy-to-follow steps. In 100 villages, the Assam government will support the establishment of AI-powered agri-hubs, where drones and AI would assist farmers in making data-driven decisions, increasing yields, and promoting sustainability, according to the state budget for 2025–2026. Industry With an investment of ₹20 crore, Tata Consultancy Services founded the FC Kohli Centre on Intelligent Systems at International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad in 2015 to conduct research in the fields of robotics, cognitive sciences, neural language processing, and intelligent systems. In March 2018, Capillary Technologies and IIT Kharagpur established the Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence Research for financial analytics, industrial automation, digital healthcare, and intelligent transportation systems, with a combined investment of ₹56.4 million. By March 2019, a second campus at Kukatpallya will open. In July, the Karnataka government and NASSCOM jointly established the Center of Excellence for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence on a public–private partnership for helping small and medium enterprises and make big data sets for training models available. For fundamental research in deep learning, reinforcement learning, network analytics, interpretable machine learning, and domain-aware AI, Bosch established the Robert Bosch Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at IIT Madras in 2019. The center will concentrate its applied research on systems biology, smart cities, manufacturing analytics, financial analytics, and healthcare. Additionally, it is the location of India's largest deep reinforcement learning group. At the Microsoft Research Lab in Bengaluru, Microsoft introduced Societal Impact through Cloud and Artificial Intelligence in 2019 to use cloud computing and AI to address long-term societal issues in transportation, agriculture, health and wellness, and education. Accenture opened its first Nano Lab in the Asia–Pacific on 4 February 2020, in Hyderabad, for applied research in security, extended reality, and AI. The Nvidia AI Technology Center was founded at IIT Hyderabad in 2020 with the goal of accelerating AI research and commercialization. It focuses on the application of AI in language comprehension, smart cities, and agriculture. Situational awareness, operator environment analysis, smart appliances, autonomous navigation systems, edge devices for IoT and industry 4.0, and conversational user interfaces were among the AI applications that Tata Elxsi's Artificial Intelligence Centre of Excellence began deploying in 2020. In 2020, Intel established INAI, an applied artificial intelligence research center in Hyderabad, in partnership with the Public Health Foundation of India, IIIT-H, and the Government of Telangana. INAI will focus on population-level issues in the smart mobility and healthcare sectors. SiMa.ai established a new design center in Bengaluru in 2021 to work on the MLSoC platform, the first machine learning SoC specifically designe
