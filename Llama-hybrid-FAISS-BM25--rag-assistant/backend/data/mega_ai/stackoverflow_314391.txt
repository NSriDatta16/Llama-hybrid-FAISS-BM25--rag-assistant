I just found this question and thought I would add a few resources to it. I really like the Quick-R site: http://www.statmethods.net/ Muenchen has written a book about using R if you come from SAS or SPSS. Originally it was an 80 page online doc that Springer encouraged him to make a 400+ page book out of. The original short form as well as the book are here: http://rforsasandspssusers.com/ You've probably already seen these, but worth listing: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Owen-TheRGuide.pdf http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Kuhnert+Venables-R_Course_Notes.zip I don't want to sound like a trite RTFM guy, but the help files generally have great short snips of working code as examples. I'm no R pro so I end up having to deconstruct the examples to understand them. That process, while tedious, is really useful. Good luck! EDIT: well I hesitated to be self linking (it feels a bit masturbatory) but here's my own list of R resources with descriptions and comments on each: http://www.cerebralmastication.com/?page_id=62
