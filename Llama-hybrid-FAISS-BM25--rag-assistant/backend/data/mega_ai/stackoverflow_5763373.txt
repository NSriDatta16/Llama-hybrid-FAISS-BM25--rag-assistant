If you really want to use rlwrap for this, write a filter! Just define an input_handler that adds %run myfile.py to the input, and an echo_handler to echo your original input so that you won't see this happening ( man RlwrapFilter tells you all you ever wanted to know about filter writing, and then some). But isn't it more elegant to solve this within ipython itself, using IPython.hooks.pre_runcode_hook ? import os import IPython ip = IPython.ipapi.get() def runMyFile(self): ip.magic('%run myFile.py') raise IPython.ipapi.TryNext() ip.set_hook('pre_runcode_hook', runMyFile)
