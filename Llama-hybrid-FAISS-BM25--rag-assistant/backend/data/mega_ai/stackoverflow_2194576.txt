Wiki has a list of issue tracking software, maybe this list could help. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue_tracking_systems You may be able to find a hosted service and use either email or web services to create the ticket using onError. With that said, a simple issue tracking app could be created for your site using the same DB used to drive the content. 2 or 3 tables would take care of the data storage and you're already using CF so the application layer is already there. HTH.
