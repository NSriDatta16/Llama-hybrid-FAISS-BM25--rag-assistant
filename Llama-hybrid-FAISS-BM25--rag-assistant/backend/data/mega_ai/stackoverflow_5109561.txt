This is the classic issue with browser-cached resource files. Alison 's answer is one option. Another option is to change the name of the physical file. If you "version" the files, then after each change, the file name will be different. This does mean that you'll have to dynamically reference the image path so that you display the correct version, and you'll need some way to determine the file name for the current version. It does prevent the browser from displaying the previously cached file immediately after a change, though, because it's technically a new file to the browser at that point. If you are using some sort of data source (XML files or database) to store metadata for the images, then you can add a "Version" column and store a simple integer. With each change, increment the integer value and use the new value in the file name. You can even extend this by saving the previous versions and allowing your users to "undo" actions by copying an older version of the file into a new version. This might require a more robust metadata storage implementation, though.
