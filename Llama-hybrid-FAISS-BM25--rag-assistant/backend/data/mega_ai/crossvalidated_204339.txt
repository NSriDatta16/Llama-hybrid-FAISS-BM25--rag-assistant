MCMC accomplishes posterior estimation via sampling, which is not to say that sampling is the point -- I think that the focus on sampling is why you proposed LHS as an alternative. But with MCMC, we're concerned with inference . The quintessential use case for MCMC is making inferences about the posterior when the Bayes rule computation is intractable, so I don't know how you plan on going about computing the density at LHS points. That is, sampling is a cheaper way to estimate posterior densities in cases where the posterior is not analytically soluble and numerical integration is too slow. Even if the computation were possible, the return would just be a list of densities at LHS points -- I don't know how that helps to answer the question of what the posterior density looks like: what is its mode? What is is mean? Is it multi-modal? Left- or right-skewed?
