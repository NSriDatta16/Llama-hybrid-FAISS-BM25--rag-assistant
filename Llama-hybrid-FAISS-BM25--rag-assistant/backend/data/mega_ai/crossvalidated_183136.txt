There exists a Bayesian approach to the numerical resolution of integrals and differential equations: it is called probabilistic numerics. Introducing a Gaussian process prior on $g$ leads to a posterior probability on $g$ itself and on integrals depending on $g$ once observations $g(x_1),\ldots,g(x_p)$ have been made. Philipp Hennig and Michael Osborne have created a webpage on this approach, where you can find references and links.
