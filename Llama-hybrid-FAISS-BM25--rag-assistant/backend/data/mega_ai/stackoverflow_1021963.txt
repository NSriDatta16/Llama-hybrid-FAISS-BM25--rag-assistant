This seems a bit hackish, but will work for dates beteen ~ 1970 and 2030 (on 32 bit arch). You are essentially converting the datetime values to integer, averaging them, and converting the average back to a datetime value. SELECT from_unixtime( avg( unix_timestamp(date_one)-unix_timestamp(date_two) ) ) FROM some_table WHERE some-restriction-applies There is likely a better solution out there, but this will get you by in a pinch.
