Common approaches to illustrating "central" responsiveness in linear regression predictions when including categorical variables?

Consider the simple linear regression framework: $y=\beta_0+\beta_T T+X\beta_X+\varepsilon$ Where $T$ is an indicator for treatment in an RCT and $X$ is a vector of controls. One common approach I know of to illustrate the impact of treatment for "typical" individuals (or whatever the observation level is) on $y$ in such a framework is to simply get $\hat{y}$ by setting all the $X$ to their sample averages (or perhaps some other measure of central tendency, like median) like so: $\hat{y}_{control}=\hat{\beta}_0+\bar{X}\hat{\beta}_X$ $\hat{y}_{treatment}=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat\beta_T+\bar{X}\hat{\beta}_X$ There are of course drawbacks to this approach, but that's not my primary concern here. I'm wondering what are some options available to illustrate this sort of "central responsiveness" when $X$ contains categorical variables--e.g. geographic region or martial status--that can't be ordered or assigned numeric values (so plain averaging is meaningless/impossible). That is, let's suppose the framework is more specifically: $y=\beta_0+\beta_T T+\beta_{married}D_{married}+\beta_{divorced}D_{divorced}+X\beta_X+\varepsilon$ What are some options/commonly used approaches to repeating the above exercise in this particular setup? Note that I have no interest in providing group-by-group breakdowns; I strongly prefer to have two simple summary numbers, $\hat y_{control}$ and $\hat y_{treatment}$. Note that this was inspired by my related post at SO ; I've tried to translate things into more general terms than that specific problem, and I hope I've done so clearly.
