Vitaly, There is fragmentation problem. My observation: If there are small size of the objects which are getting updated frequently then in that case it generates lot of garbage. Though CMS collects the memory occupied by these objects, this memory is fragmented. Now Mark-Sweep-Compact thread comes into picture (stop the world)and try to compact this fragmented memory causing long pause. Opposite to that if the objects size is bigger then it generates less fragmented memory and Mark-Swap-Compact takes less time to compact this memory. This may cause less throughput but will help you to reduce the long pause caused by GC compaction.
