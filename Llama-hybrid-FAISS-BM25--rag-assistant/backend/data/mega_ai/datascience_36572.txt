How can discard "peaks" values from a chart?

I have this chart where you can see that some points are far away from the "trend" of the curve. The chart represents $5,000$ values where each value corresponds to a specific hour of a day, month and year. In this case, it goes from 01/01/18 until 05/08/18 (non-american format) and as you can see at the first lower peak, it was caused because at 12.00 the cost was $20$ USD but at 1.00 AM it went up to $51$ USD. I've read that some people just delete those 'peaks' values but I don't know if there's a better solution. This graph shows almost a year but I have in mind on graphing $10$ years of this prices so the situation could be worse. Do you know a better strategy? I'm thinking maybe in calculating average costs for every $6$ hours but it feels like a cheap solution to me.
