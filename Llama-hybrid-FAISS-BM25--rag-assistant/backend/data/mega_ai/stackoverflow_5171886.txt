Here is the fragment from my automated eclipse installer written in ant. This installs all features from the custom update site. The code is 'as is', but I sure would have liked to have something like this to guide me when I wrote it. This script also uses antcontrib extension to ant. Antcontrib tasks are have 'ac:' namespace prefix Hope this helps. P.S. For its usefulness and complexity Eclipse P2 is surely one of the most underdocumented features.
