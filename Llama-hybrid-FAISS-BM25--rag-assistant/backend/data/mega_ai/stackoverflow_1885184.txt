Usually you only find these out by experimentation... perhaps writing a GA to tune your GA. But that aside, I don't understand what you're asking. If you don't know what the function is, and you also don't know the points to being with, how do you determine fitness? From my current understanding of the problem, this is better fitted by a neural network. edit: 2.Recombine the remaining 80%? How? Cutting them at a random point and then putting together the first part of ADN of the father with the second part of ADN of the mother? This is called crossover. If you want to be saucey, do something like pick a random starting point and swapping a random length. For instance, you have 10 elements in an object. randomly choose a spot X between 1 and 10 and swap x..10-rand%10+1.. you get the picture... spice it up a little. 3.Mutation, how should I define in this kind of problem mutation? usually that depends more on what is defined as a legal solution than anything else. you can do mutation the same way you do crossover, except you fill it with random data (that is legal) rather than swapping with another specimen... and you do it at a MUCH lower rate. 4.Is it worth using Elitism? experiment and find out.
