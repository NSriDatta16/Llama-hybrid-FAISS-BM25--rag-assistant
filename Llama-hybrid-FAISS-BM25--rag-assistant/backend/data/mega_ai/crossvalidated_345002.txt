Interpreting regression coefficients based on Andrew Gelman's re-scaling method

I have two predictors in a binary logistic regression model: One binary and one continuous. My primary goal is to compare the coefficients of the two predictors within the same model. I have come across Andrew Gelman's suggestion to standardize continuous regression input variables: I) Original proposal (2008): divide continuous predictor by 2 SD Original manuscript: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/standardizing7.pdf II) Updated recommendation (2009): divide continuous predictor by 1 SD AND re-code binary input values from (0,1) to (-1,+1)). Updated recommendation (1 SD, recode binary): http://andrewgelman.com/2009/06/09/standardization/ Proper interpretation of the resulting coefficients still is elusive to me: SCENARIO 1: BOTH PREDICTORS ARE SIGNIFICANT IN THE SAME MODEL Outcome: non-transformed binary Y Continuous predictor: XCONT (divided by 1sd) Binary predictor: XBIN (recoded to take values -1 or 1) > orfit1c=with(data=mat0, glm(YBIN~XCONT+XBIN, family=binomial(link="logit"))) > summary(orfit1c) Call: glm(formula = YBIN ~XCONT + XBIN, family = binomial(link = "logit")) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.9842 -0.6001 -0.5481 -0.5481 1.9849 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.8197 0.1761 -10.331 SCENARIO 2: NEITHER SIGNIFICANT IN SAME MODEL (BUT when they are entered separately in two different models, their coefficients are both significant) Call: glm(formula =YBIN2 ~ XCONT2 + XBIN2, family = binomial(link = "logit")) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.0090 -0.6265 -0.5795 -0.5795 1.9573 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.7562 0.1835 -9.570 Question: For the original scaling method, it was explained that "a one-unit change in a continuous predictor covers two standard deviations of that predictor" For the updated scaling method, am I correct in my interpretation of scenario #1 that: (1) a one unit change in continuous predictor covers 1 standard deviation of the XCONT (2) and this change in 1 SD in XCONT is equivalent to a 1 unit change (i.e. absence or presence) of the binary predictor (XBIN). (3) accordingly, 1 SD change in XBIN predicts a 1 unit increase in YBIN whereas 1/3 unit increase in YCONT predicts a 1 unit increase in YBIN? QUESTIONS Does interpretation outlined in 1-3 need any correction? As the binary outcome variable was not re-coded, can I still say that 1 unit change in X predicts a 1 unit change in binary outcome (0 or 1)? What else could be said about the results, specifically when I attempt to compare the two coefficients for the continuous and binary predictors?
