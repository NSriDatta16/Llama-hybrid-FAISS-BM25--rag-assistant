I don't know if it's an option for you, but you can change paragraph delimiting in certain way by including the 'w' flag in 'formatoptions'. Check out help for 'fo-table' to read more. Basically it makes it so that lines ending in a space are like 'soft returns' and lines ending in a non-space character mark the end of paragraphs. Empty lines are not markers at all in this case. The 'w' formation flag does work with all vip, vap, etc., if I recall. If that isn't going to do the trick for you, then I suggest remapping the vip, vap, etc. sequences to a custom function of your own. That way you can set it up to select things exactly as you want.
