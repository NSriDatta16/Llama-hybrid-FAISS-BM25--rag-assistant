You don't necessarily have to go Bayesian on your model, plain maximum likelihood estimation works just fine (though has no explicit solution). Multiple R packages (eg. aod or VGAM) will fit the distribution for you. Alternatively, you can use the quasi-likelihood based overdispersed binomial model that does not assume a beta-binomial distribution, just adjusts for the overdispersion. The glm function with the quasibinomial family will fit this model in R.
