A first guess: You did not use the link-library for the DLL. The linker shouts about not finding some symbols, and TessDllAPI sound very much like a DLL. By default (read: on Project Settings Dialog Startup) all your project settings are specific to the build-configuration (Debug, Release), but you can select "All Configurations" from the GUI. This would explain why it works in one configuration, but not in another. Try a #pragma comment(lib:"tessdll") // (Of course you need to replace the `tessdll` with the name of the library.) in the header-file, or add this library for linking in the "Release" configuration.
