Using MCMC to calculate log likelihood

I have an analytical solution to finding $p(y|\beta)$ and $p(\beta)$. My goal is to find $\log p(y)$. However, the integral $\int p(y|\beta)p(\beta)\,d\beta$ is not analytical. I did manage to use a Metropolis Hastings algorithm (using $p(y|\beta)$ and $p(\beta)$) to get a posterior sample from $p(\beta|y)$. Now I'm not sure if this posterior sample is supposed to even help me to get $\log(y)$ but if it does how? I am basing this off the fact that you could get a lower bound on the log likelihood by using $$\log(y) > \frac{1}{N}\sum_{\beta\in\beta_s} p(y|\beta)p(\beta) $$ where $\beta_s$ is the sampled beta from the posterior. The above result is thanks to the EM algorithm where you set $q(\beta)=p(\beta|y)$. Edit: Perhaps I might be looking at it all wrong, maybe some numerical integration technique will be better. This function is unimodal.
