Can a Precision-Recall curve or a ROC curve be horizontal?

I am working on a binary classification task on imbalanced data. Since the accuracy is not so meaningful in this case. I use Scikit-Learn to compute the Precision-Recall curve and ROC curve in order to evaluate the model performance. But I found both of the curves would be a horizontal line when I use Random Forest with a lot of estimators, it also happens when I use a SGD classifier to fit it. The ROC chart is as following: And the Precision-Recall chart: Since Random Forest behaves randomly, I don't get a horizontal line in every run, sometimes I also get a regular ROC and PR curve. But the horizontal line is much more common. Is this normal? Or I made some mistakes in my code? Here is the snippet of my code: classifier.fit(X_train, Y_train) try: scores = classifier.decision_function(X_test) except: scores = classifier.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1] precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(Y_test, scores, pos_label=1) average_precision = average_precision_score(Y_test, scores) plt.plot(recall, precision, label='area = %0.2f' % average_precision, color="green") plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0]) plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05]) plt.xlabel('Recall') plt.ylabel('Precision') plt.title('Precision Recall Curve') plt.legend(loc="lower right") plt.show()
