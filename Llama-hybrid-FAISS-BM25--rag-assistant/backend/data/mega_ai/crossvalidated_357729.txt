Note: the score $S_c(I)$ is the score that the neural network assigns to a class before the softmax, not the probability $P_c=\frac{e^{S_c}}{\sum_ce^{S_c}}$. So the score is just the output of the last layer of the network before the softmax activation function (which creates a normalized vector of probabilities) is applied. So the score and the probability are directly related by a nonlinear function.
