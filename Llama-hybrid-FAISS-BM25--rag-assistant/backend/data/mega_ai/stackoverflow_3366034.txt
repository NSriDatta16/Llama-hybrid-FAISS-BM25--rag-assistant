You can create a new branch of the version, for which the patches were made, than apply them and merge the temp-branch into master: git checkout -b temp-branch v2.6.30 git apply/am ...patches... git checkout master git merge temp-branch This should resolve most duplicated patches (although, it won't use the commit id, but rather patch contents). Also, you could try git rebase in the last step. It's not the most elegant way, but should do the trick.
