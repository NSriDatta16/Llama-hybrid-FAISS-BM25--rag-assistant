I am not aware of any other distributions that have this property, though it would certainly be possible to construct distributions of that kind. Nevertheless, what I can offer is to give some structure to the problem by presenting the relevant functions. Following standard notation in the field, I will use $\alpha$ in place of your $p$ , so that you are referring to a HDR with coverage probability $1-\alpha$ . Consider a continuous distribution with density function $f_X$ having supremum $m_X \equiv \sup_x f_X(x)$ . We can define the function $H:[0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]$ via the equation: $$1-\alpha = \mathbb{P}(f_X(X) \geqslant m_X \cdot H(\alpha)).$$ This does not uniquely define $H$ , so it is usual to further stipulate that $H(\alpha)$ is the infimum of the set of all values for which the above equation is satisfied. If $f_X$ has no flat regions in its support then $H$ will also be continuous, but if there are flat regions in the support of the density the $H$ may have "jumps". Any any case, it is simple to show that $H$ is a non-decreasing function with $H(0) = 0$ and $H(1) = 1$ . For a HDR with coverage probability $1-\alpha$ , suppose we let $r(\alpha)$ denote the cut-off point for the density (i.e., the HDR includes all points with $f_X(x) \geqslant r(\alpha)$ ). Then we can write our function of interest as: $$H(\alpha) = \frac{r(\alpha)}{m_X}.$$ It is possible to derive this function for a number of families of distributions, though in some cases the function will only be implicitly defined. The condition of interest to you is when $H$ is the identity function (i.e., when $H(\alpha) = \alpha$ ). Below we will derive this function for various distributions, to show some distributions that have the property of interest to you, and some distributions that do not have this property. The exponential distribution: Suppose that $f_X(x) = \text{Exp}(x|\theta)$ where $\theta$ is the rate parameter. Using the coverage probability $1-\alpha$ the HDR and density cut-off are: $$\text{HDR}(1-\alpha) = \Bigg[ 0, \frac{|\ln(\alpha)|}{\theta} \Bigg] \quad \quad \quad r(\alpha) = \theta \cdot \alpha.$$ Since $m_X = \theta$ we therefore have: $$H(\alpha) = \frac{r(\alpha)}{m_X} = \frac{\theta \cdot \alpha}{\theta} = \alpha.$$ This confirms your observation that the exponential distribution has the property of interest. As you have pointed out in the comments, it also applies to the chi-squared distribution with two degrees-of-freedom, since that is an exponential distribution with $\theta=\tfrac{1}{2}$ . The normal distribution: Suppose that $f_X(x) = \text{N}(x|\mu, \sigma^2)$ where $\mu$ is the mean parameter and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation parameter. Using the coverage probability $1-\alpha$ the HDR and density cut-off are: $$\text{HDR}(1-\alpha) = \Bigg[ \mu - z_{\alpha/2} \sigma, \ \mu + z_{\alpha/2} \sigma \Bigg] \quad \quad \quad r(\alpha) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \cdot \exp \bigg( -\frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{2} \bigg).$$ Since $m_X = 1/\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}$ we therefore have: $$H(\alpha) = \frac{r(\alpha)}{m_X} = \exp \bigg( -\frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{2} \bigg).$$
