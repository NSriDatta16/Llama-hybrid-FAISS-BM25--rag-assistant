LINQ2SQL vs EF4: Entity retrieval and usage from different contexts

I am long time user of LINQ2SQL, but have not used the Entity Framework yet. One thing that is not possible in LINQ2SQL is to use tracked entities in different data contexts, or 'link' objects from different data contexts. Example: Foo f = null; using (var dc = new DB()) f = dc.Foos.Single(x => x.ID = 1); using (var dc = new DB()) { var b = new Baz(); dc.Bazs.InsertOnSubmit(b); f.Baz = b; dc.SubmitChanges(); } Note: IIRC, this can work if using disconnected objects (but IMO that is pretty useless). Today, I saw an article on EF4 implying that the pattern above can be used with EF4. So the question is: Is this in fact possible?
