I suggest you make both classes implement a common interface, and cast to that instead. I can't see that your current casts can have any effect... public interface NamedElement { String getName(); } ... NamedElement department = a == 1 ? order.getDepartment() : order.getOrganisation(); String name = department.getName(); This is assuming you have control over the DepartmentType and OrganizationType code, of course.
