Forecast multiple unevenly spaced time series

I am building a time-series forecasting model to predict some patterns in climatological data. The dataset consists of many (2 mln) time series which look for example as: However the observations all of these time series is unequally distributed (growing trend with years). Although I am still considering my approach (LSTM, exponential smoothing, etc.), I will have to deal with this unequal distribution of observations. Is there a golden standard for equalizing time series observations?
