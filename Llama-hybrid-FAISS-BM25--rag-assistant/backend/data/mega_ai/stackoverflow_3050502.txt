Quoting the Reference Manual ( Setting the Storage Engine ): If you omit the ENGINE option, the default storage engine is used. Normally, this is MyISAM, but you can change it by using the --default-storage-engine server startup option, or by setting the default-storage-engine option in the my.cnf configuration file. The default-storage-engine option must be part of the mysqld section in my.cnf ; [mysqld] default-storage-engine = innodb You may also want to change the default storage engine just for the current session. You can do this by setting the storage_engine variable: SET storage_engine=INNODB;
