Spectral analysis in R, how to interpret periodogram

I'm relatively new to spectral analysis and have been working through some online tutorials. I have some time series data that I would like to examine for periodicity / repeating patterns. When I create the periodogram there is a strong harmonic at 3Hz. (though it looks weak in the excerpt of data I have provided below). What I don't understand is how to convert from the frequency domain back to the time domain with respect to my sampling rate. The data is sampled every 5 seconds (so 0.2Hz). Does the harmonic at 3Hz represent a repeating cycle every 15 seconds in the data (as in 1Hz is 5 seconds)? How do I correctly interpret the output? Appreciate any help, example code below; y $ts, b$ y, type = 'l') trend $freq[harmonics]*length(detrended.trajectory), f.data$ spec[harmonics]/sum(f.data$spec), xlab="Harmonics (Hz)", ylab="Amplitute Density", type="h")
