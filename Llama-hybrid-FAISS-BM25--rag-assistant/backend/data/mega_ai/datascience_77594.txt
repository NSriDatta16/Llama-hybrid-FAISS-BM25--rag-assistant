to completely receive you'r answer and to have a good insight visit : https://towardsdatascience.com/counting-no-of-parameters-in-deep-learning-models-by-hand-8f1716241889 g, no. of FFNNs in a unit (RNN has 1, GRU has 3, LSTM has 4) h, size of hidden units i, dimension/size of input Since every FFNN(feed forward neural network) has h(h+i) + h parameters, we have num_params = g × [h(h+i) + h] Example 2.1: LSTM with 2 hidden units and input dimension 3. g = 4 (LSTM has 4 FFNNs) h = 2 i = 3 num_params = g × [h(h+i) + h] = 4 × [2(2+3) + 2] = 48 input = Input((None, 3)) lstm = LSTM(2)(input) model = Model(input, lstm) thanks to RAIMI KARIM
