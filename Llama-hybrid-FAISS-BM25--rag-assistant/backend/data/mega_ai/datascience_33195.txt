This comes from some standard definitions really. There is a similar question on Cross Validated SE that has good answers. There are related questions there that might be worth looking through too, like this one . The $\sigma^2_{e}$, which is basically the noise that comes with a random variable . Perhaps there isn't much of it, but we normally just write it at the end of such equations. In the context of a real world machine learning problem, I also sometimes think of that term as accounting for information that I just do not have the possibility to explain, with the data that I have. So in that particular project, it is as good as irreducible error.
