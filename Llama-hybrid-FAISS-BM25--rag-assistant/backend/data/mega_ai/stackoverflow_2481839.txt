Aggregation over a few models - Django

I'm trying to compute the average of a field over various subsets of a queryset. Player.objects.order_by('-score').filter(sex='male').aggregate(Avg('level')) This works perfectly! But... if I try to compute it for the top 50 players it does not work. Player.objects.order_by('-score').filter(sex='male')[:50].aggregate(Avg('level')) This last one returns the exact same result as the query above it, which is wrong. What am I doing wrong? Help would be very much appreciated!
