First, put an autorelease pool in your main() to shut up all the autorelease problems. Next, pay attention to compiler warnings. If there is a warning, there is a bug or potential bug in your code. And there should definitely be a warning that documents exactly what is wrong. Namely, your -init method is wrong: - (id)init { children = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; } // end method init You don't end it with return self; . Or, more specifically, you don't: - init { self = [super init]; if (self) { children = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; } return self; } Also, you should try and follow the same patterns as Apple's frameworks and APIs. Namely, don't prefix those methods with get . Finally, make sure you add a dealloc method, too.
