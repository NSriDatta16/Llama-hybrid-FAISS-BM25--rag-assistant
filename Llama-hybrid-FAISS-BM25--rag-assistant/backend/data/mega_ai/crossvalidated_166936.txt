I have recently done this kind of customer analytics and generally I would say it is wise to split this problem into two parts. But you do not necessarily need to apply survival analysis for churning since you can think it as a panel problem where initial customer set is observed and then churned customers are observed during fixed time period. Target variable could be binary and not survival in days/weeks/months since initial panel time period. Second part does not need multinomial logistic regression since channel via which customer is tried to turn is just an categorical variable where one class is baseline to which other classes are compared. Same is true for campaign. For us telephone is baseline and other methods are compared against it. Telephone is of course also the most expensive turning method to use.
