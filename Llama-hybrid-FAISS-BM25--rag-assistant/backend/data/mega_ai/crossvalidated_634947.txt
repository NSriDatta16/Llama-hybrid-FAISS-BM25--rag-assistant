How to form a professional project in python?

I am learning python especially in machine learning and computer vision. Recently, I was trying to examine codes of some papers in Github. One thing I got, is that writing codes for papers are much different from tutorials on internet. They are much more complicated, comprising of many different folders and .py files named such as utils.py, main.py, train.py, init .py etc. I have some questions regarding this matter. Firstly, does the name of these files created automatically using something or they are created manually by writers? Secondly, if it is automatically, how can I create such coding style and if they are done manually, is there any standard format for naming or coding that I should use? Finally, is there any reference to teach how to create such standard coding styles?
