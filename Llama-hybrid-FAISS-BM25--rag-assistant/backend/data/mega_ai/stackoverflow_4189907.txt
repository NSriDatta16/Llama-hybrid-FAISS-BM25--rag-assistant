My only comment is to suggest you do not do the directories as you plan to; Instead, see if you can put some sort of logical organization to the folder structure. I'd be willing to bet you might end up pulling a hair or two out with that, essentially random, directory structure. Keep in mind the possibility of exposing private information, though; You probably shouldn't have directory structure which reveals user names if they are not already public, for example. One possibility; have them be based on time... ~/Images/Upload/2010/11/15 for example. Go further if that seems good, or not as far if you prefer. (only go to the month, for example; or do week number instead of day). I'd also recommend keeping leading 0's with such a scheme, for ease of sorting. Then again; depending on how you are using them, such a structure might not be good, either. It was just the thought that popped into my head :)
