contain new elements of an "instance" in javascript

so I know there are tons of ways to simulate inheritance and other OO features. I have chosen one to use for my project and am wondering if I can create an instance and add stuff to it and keep it contained (within braces). Consider the following: function BaseClass(){ } function SubClass(){ this.superClass = BaseClass(); this.superClass(); } myObj = new SubClass(); so myObj is an instance of SubClass. I can add things to myObj like: myObj.blah = "funtimes"; What I would like is to be able to add stuff to the "instance" and keep it organized in braces much like the constructor. psuedo code like: myObj = new SubClass() { var blah = "funtimes" } Is something like this possible? Thanks!
