Define the column size as the maximum length you are prepared to deal with. For a staging table, where I'm loading a file into the database, I may use VARCHAR2(4000). Then once all the data is in the database, I can do whatever validations I need to (data types, data lengths, min/max values, acceptable characters...) and have the valid values passed into a column with the appropriate definition/constraints. I can leverage DML error logging so that data that doesn't fit the definition/constraints gets pumped off to a rejection table without any tricky row-by-row coding. If you have a VARCHAR2(1000) then, at some point you WILL get data put in there that is longer than you expect (eg you may get a string of 10 characters but which has 14 bytes because some characters are multi-byte character set values.)
