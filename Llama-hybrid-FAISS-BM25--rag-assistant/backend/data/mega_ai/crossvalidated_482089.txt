statsmodels seasonal_decompose(): What is the right "period of the series" in the context of a list column (constant vs. varying number of items)

Assume having a list column so that your time series is nested , see Convert pandas df with data in a “list column” into a time series in long format. Use three columns: [list of data] + [timestamp] + [duration] for details. The question here is not about how to unnest a list column though. Assume that you already have a long format structure with all available list elements unnested into a normal column , here for example taking 2 lists with 4 list elements, making 8 rows in the end. Part1: Assume that every list of the original list column has the same number of list elements (here, the first list with 4 items around 08:53, and the second with 4 items around 08:55). value datetimeindex 2016-05-04 08:53:20 1 2016-05-04 08:53:21 2 2016-05-04 08:53:22 1 2016-05-04 08:53:23 9 2016-05-04 08:55:00 2 2016-05-04 08:55:01 2 2016-05-04 08:55:02 3 2016-05-04 08:55:03 0 Now approaching the actual question. From statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose¶ we read: Definition of period "period, int, optional" Period of the series. Must be used if x is not a pandas object or if the index of x does not have a frequency. Overrides default periodicity of x if x is a pandas object with a timeseries index. What is meant here with "Period of the series"? Is it: the number of lists, here 2. the standard size of a list. This would be 4 in the example. something else than 1./2. Please also explain what would be different if you had a "Part2 setting", if there is any difference: Part2: Assume that every list of the original list column has a varying number of list elements (here, the first list with 4 items around 08:53, and the second with just 3 items around 08:55). value datetimeindex 2016-05-04 08:53:20 1 2016-05-04 08:53:21 2 2016-05-04 08:53:22 1 2016-05-04 08:53:23 9 2016-05-04 08:55:00 2 2016-05-04 08:55:01 2 2016-05-04 08:55:02 3 The examples shall make the question clear, no programming (especially not with the examples) needed for an accepted answer. Context: This question arose from decompose() for time series: ValueError: You must specify a period or x must be a pandas object with a DatetimeIndex with a freq not set to None .
