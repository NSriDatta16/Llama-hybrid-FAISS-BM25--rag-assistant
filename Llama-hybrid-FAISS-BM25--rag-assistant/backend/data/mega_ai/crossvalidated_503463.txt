Ridge regression was introduced before machine learning existed as a field. In the statistics literature, the ridge estimator is typically attributed to Hoerl and Kennard (1970) . Even before that, essentially the same method was introduced in different contexts by Andrey Tikhonov and independently by David Phillips. In machine learning literature ridge regression was reinvented via the name of weight decay. In the statistics literature, the lasso was introduced by Robert Tibshirani (1996) . A closely related technique (called basis pursuit) was independently introduced in signal processing literature at roughly the same time by Chen, Donoho and Saunders ( 1994 , 1998 ).
