Let me try to restate your problem using the most generic language possible, so as to direct you to appropriate ideas and resources. You have a longitudinal study where there is substantial heterogeneity across the units (which I take to be people ) in your population. You apply an experimental intervention (aka, treatment ) to the units, and observe effects upon the time series data that each unit generates. The effects of these interventions are superimposed upon a trend in each time series, so that you encounter a problem of detrending the data to identify separately the treatment effect . Furthermore, you have also sampled randomly from your design for the common reason that it is costly (e.g., in terms of time and effort) to collect all of the potentially available data. Given the complexity of your problem, I would advise that it is premature to leap to an application of statistical methods. Your first step should be graphical data exploration . There are many tools to choose from; this question includes a discussion with many links. An excellent place to start is with the sort of plot you see here . Once you can post plots like those, CV will be in a much better position to suggest appropriate statistical models and techniques to answer the scientific questions you have. I'm certain that efforts toward data visualization will help you to focus your questions, and articulate them more pointedly.
