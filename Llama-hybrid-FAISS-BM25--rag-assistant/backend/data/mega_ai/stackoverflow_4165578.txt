Some of my own findings: Basically, not possible, as BalusC points out. Making a web page which includes the remote page in a IFRAME and scrolling it to the desired place: hardly practical, cumbersome, specially when the remote page is in another domain. And, specially, it's difficult (practically impossible, I believe) to compute the desired scrolling amount. An extreme solution: make a proxy.php script which serves the remote page rewriting it, adding some id/anchors, say, at some percentage steps, counting characters. Shortcomings too numerous and evident to list. The kind of feature I was seeking seems have been discussed, but only to exist in the " proposal " area. The most fitting and powerful solution seems to be this Fragment Search Greasemonkey script. But, of course, that must be installed in the browser; it is presently not useful to make public urls to be loaded by visitors.
