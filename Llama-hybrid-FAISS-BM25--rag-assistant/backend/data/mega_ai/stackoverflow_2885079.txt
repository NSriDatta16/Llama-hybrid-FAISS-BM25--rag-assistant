Offsite data storage for simple app, or a similar supported persistence mechanism?

Question Is there a usable facebook entry point to the Data Storage API that facebook lists on their app admin page for developers, or should I consider an alternate mechanism? What alternative mechanisms exist to simply persist my information offsite (away from my server app) without stuffing it into a cookie that's prone to expire? ... Background The facebook Data Store Admin tool is made available in a facebook App's Settings as seen here: (continue reading below) However when I visit the DataStoreAdmin link nothing works (i.e. clicking the buttons to define the data store types and objects does nothing - I have tried different browsers). The Wiki page for Data Store API hasn't been updated recently and the second last update says the beta Data Store was taken offline. It seems odd the link would be readily available and highly visible at the top of the App configuration area if indeed it's defunct. I was hoping some kind of key/value pair solution to remove the data calls from my own server.
