nltk.corpus for data science related words?

from job description I scraped from the internet, I've went through all nlp processes and I've got to place where I found: freq = nltk.FreqDist(lemmatized_list) most_freq_words = freq.most_common(100) which outputs: [('data', 179), ('experience', 86), ('work', 78), ('business', 71), ('team', 59), ('learn', 56), ('model', 49), ('skills', 47), ('science', 41), ('use', 41), ('build', 39), ('machine', 37), ('ability', 36),..... and so on. My problem is I do not want to consider words like "experience", "work", and only consider keywords related to data science. I'm guessing there is a corpus for data science terms which I can use like how I use stop word corpus to not select them. Let me know if there is a way, Thanks!
