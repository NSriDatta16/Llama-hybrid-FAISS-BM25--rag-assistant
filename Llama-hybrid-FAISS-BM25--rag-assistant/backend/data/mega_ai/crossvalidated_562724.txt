How many variables can logistic regression handle?

Not from a theoretical point of view, but from a practical one: is there a point at which there are "too many" predictors for a logistic regression model to perform well? For larger datasets (with more columns) I have always used machine learning methods that I know can handle dozens or hundreds of variables. However, I've never tried something like that with logistic regression. My hypothesis: I'm guessing that the issue is that multicollinearity is more of a problem for logistic regression than it is for other methods, and with dozens or hundreds of variables, multicollinearity will be inevitable. My Question: From your experience, approximately how many variables can logistic regression effectively handle? Follow up : If my hypothesis is right and multicollinearity is the only limiting issue/factor, could logistic regression effectively handle 100 variables, given they are orthogonal?
