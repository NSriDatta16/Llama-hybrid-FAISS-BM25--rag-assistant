This is a very simple problem in terms of computer vision. I would recommend some processing to normalize the images and then trying something as simple nearest neighbors with mahalanobis distance. A CNN will likely work well but comes with the need of massive data sets and computational power. As always in ML try the simple models before increasing your complexity.
