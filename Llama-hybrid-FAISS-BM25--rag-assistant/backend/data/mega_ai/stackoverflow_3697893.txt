The part of the url that follows the # is called the "fragment identifier", and there is no way to access this information on the server. In fact, it's never even sent to the server -- the specification reserves the fragment identifier for the purpose of identifying a fragment of the document that is located by the rest of the url. The spec actually requires that the browser strip the fragment id from the url before sending the url in the HTTP request. You can access the fragment id in the browser via javascript. The property is called document.location.hash .
