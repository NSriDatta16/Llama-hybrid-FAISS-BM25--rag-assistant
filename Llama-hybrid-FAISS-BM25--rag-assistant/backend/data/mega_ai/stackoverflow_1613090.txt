busybox was my first thought as well, although you might also want to consider embedding a scripting engine like Python and doing these kind of manipulations in Python scripts. I would definitely not try to strip this kind of functionality out of GNU command line tools since they have grown significantly since the early UNIX days and sprouted an awful lot of options. If the busybox code seems too hard to adapt, then the next place I would look would be Minix source code . Look under Previous Versions and pick one of the version 1 or 2 Minixes because those were written as teaching code so they tend to be clearer and simpler.
