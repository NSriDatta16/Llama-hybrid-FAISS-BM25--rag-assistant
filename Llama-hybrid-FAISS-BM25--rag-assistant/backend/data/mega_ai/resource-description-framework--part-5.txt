abbreviation NY' , 'New York' would be the subject, 'has the postal abbreviation' the predicate and 'NY' the object. Encoded as an RDF triple, the subject and predicate would have to be resources named by URIs. The object could be a resource or literal element. For example, in the N-Triples form of RDF, the statement might look like: In this example, "urn:x-states:New%20York" is the URI for a resource that denotes the US state New York, " is the URI for a predicate (whose human-readable definition can be found here), and "NY" is a literal string. Note that the URIs chosen here are not standard, and do not need to be, as long as their meaning is known to whatever is reading them. Example 3: A Wikipedia article about Tony Benn In a like manner, given that " identifies a particular resource (regardless of whether that URI could be traversed as a hyperlink, or whether the resource is actually the Wikipedia article about Tony Benn), to say that the title of this resource is "Tony Benn" and its publisher is "Wikipedia" would be two assertions that could be expressed as valid RDF statements. In the N-Triples form of RDF, these statements might look like the following: To an English-speaking person, the same information could be represented simply as: The title of this resource, which is published by Wikipedia, is 'Tony Benn' However, RDF puts the information in a formal way that a machine can understand. The purpose of RDF is to provide an encoding and interpretation mechanism so that resources can be described in a way that particular software can understand it; in other words, so that software can access and use information that it otherwise could not use. Both versions of the statements above are wordy because one requirement for an RDF resource (as a subject or a predicate) is that it be unique. The subject resource must be unique in an attempt to pinpoint the exact resource being described. The predicate needs to be unique in order to reduce the chance that the idea of Title or Publisher will be ambiguous to software working with the description. If the software recognizes (a specific definition for the concept of a title established by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative), it will also know that this title is different from a land title or an honorary title or just the letters t-i-t-l-e put together. The following example, written in Turtle, shows how such simple claims can be elaborated on, by combining multiple RDF vocabularies. Here, we note that the primary topic of the Wikipedia page is a "Person" whose name is "Tony Benn": Applications DBpedia – Extracts facts from Wikipedia articles and publishes them as RDF data. YAGO – Similar to DBpedia extracts facts from Wikipedia articles and publishes them as RDF data. Wikidata – Collaboratively edited knowledge base hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. Creative Commons – Uses RDF to embed license information in web pages and mp3 files. FOAF (Friend of a Friend) – designed to describe people, their interests and interconnections. Haystack client – Semantic web browser from MIT CS & AI lab. IDEAS Group – developing a formal 4D ontology for Enterprise Architecture using RDF as the encoding. Microsoft shipped a product, Connected Services Framework, which provides RDF-based Profile Management capabilities. MusicBrainz – Publishes information about Music Albums. NEPOMUK, an open-source software specification for a Social Semantic desktop uses RDF as a storage format for collected metadata. NEPOMUK is mostly known because of its integration into the KDE SC 4 desktop environment. Cochrane is a global publisher of clinical study meta-analyses in evidence based healthcare. They use an ontology driven data architecture to semantically annotate their published reviews with RDF based structured data. RDF Site Summary – one of several "RSS" languages for publishing information about updates made to a web page; it is often used for disseminating news article summaries and sharing weblog content
