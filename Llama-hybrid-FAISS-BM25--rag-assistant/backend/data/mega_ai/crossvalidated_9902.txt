Your initial logistic regression approach seems reasonable, assuming good diagnostics. However, if I understand the scientific question right, you'll need an interaction between year and day to see differences between years in the tendency to be in diapause as day increases. The main effect of year only says that one year has a higher per day probability of being in diapause, which is not, I think, what you care about. Alternatively The other way to think about the problem is to have days as a dependent variable. This means you would reverse the conditional probability formulation that you implicitly started with by not asking 'are later pupae more likely to be in diapause?' i.e. P(diapause | day, year), but rather 'do pupae in dipause tend to occur later in the year' i.e. P(day | diapause, year). In such a model the observations are Pupation_Day which is classified by Diapause status which is nested within Year. The effect of interest is a difference of differences, specifically: the difference between the difference in mean Pupation_Day for Diapause==1 and Diapause==0 in Year==2005 versus Year=2006. (I'm not still sure what role the 'pairs of years' play in your design though.) The only potentially tricky bits I see are remembering that Diapause is a random effect, and making a sensible assumption about the conditional distribution of Pupation_Day. Frankly, I'd try Normal with shared variance first and then see if the model diagnostics object. If they do, I'd crack open JAGS/BUGS, and just write out the full model, which would make inference about difference in differences easier too. This alternative approach may be too much machinery for the scientific question though. If we could tell what the ideal inferential endpoint was it would be easier to recommend an approach.
