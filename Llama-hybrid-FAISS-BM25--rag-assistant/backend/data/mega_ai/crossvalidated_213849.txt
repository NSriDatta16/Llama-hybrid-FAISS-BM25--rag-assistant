I can think of two alternatives (there might be others too) : Learn a regression instead of classification. This way you obtain a "positiveness" score, and you can decide based on its value and your thresholds (you can also optimize them). Logistic regression might be helpful for this. If you already know which samples to say "I don't know", make them another class, so learn a 3-class classification. Edit Based on your comments: I would simply try thresholds in the set [0:0.05:1] (given your "positiviness" score is between 0 and 1 ) and choose the one that minimizes classification/regression error. @Timothy Nodine's answer might be more helpful though. Why is a third class not possible? Don't you have the same features from all samples? I also assumed you already had training samples that you want your predictor to have said "rest" (i.e. samples from the "rest" class, sorry, I still see it as a separate class :) and I believe you want your predictor to do so too). If this is the case, then it is possible, just label the data accordingly. If you don't have exemplary "rest" instances, then you can try one-class classification methods. This way you obtain two classifiers, the first one (the one-class one) decides whether it is "rest" or not, and if not, the second one classifies between positive and negative. Note that this is also 3-class classification, just in a multi-stage way. Hope it helps,
