Is QListView right for me?

I've been having difficulty trying to find a Qt widget that will allow me to display a list with columns. From what I understand, QListView does indeed display list data, but it doesn't allow for programmers to add a list view header -- in fact, it appears the only widget that does allow one to display headers is QTreeView (which, quite frankly, is a pain in the arse to work with). Qt certainly must offer an easy way to display a header and data organized by columns, no? Thanks so much! --Dany.
