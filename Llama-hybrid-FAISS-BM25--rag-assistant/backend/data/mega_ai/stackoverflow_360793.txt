over the years i have arrived to the decision that i do as little customization as possible since workplaces change and computers change (both at home and at work). i used to do all kinds of crazy tweaks with litestep, setting up partitions, etc. these days i pare it down to the basics, and it does not take me long to setup a machine and have a familiar environment. in addition to the usual "win32dev" setup (classic scheme, optimized for performance, no special effects, show all files, details in explorer views, blue background, etc) i have the following stack: cygwin (gcc, vim, curl, wget, perl/ruby/python, svn, git, ssh, netcat, etc; rxvt for terminal) ffox + adblock + dev plugins clipx for simple stack-like clipboard with previews textpad + a few basics syntax highlighters virtuawin - the only minimal window manager that does all i need and nothing more autoHotKey for basic app shortcuts procexp to replace task manager all other sysinternals tools tortoise svn putty + agent + keys 7zip keepass wireshark everything i install by hand goes into c:\programs (for easy no-space, lowercase paths).
