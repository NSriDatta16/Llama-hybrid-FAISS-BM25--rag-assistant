There are multiple ways how you can use text features in your machine learning algorithms. You can simply encode if a word occurred in the text (coded as 0 - no, 1 - yes), you can use bag-of-words (count their occurrences), using $n$-grams (combinations of ordered words), TF-IDF scores , Word2vec encoding , you can also consider their position in the text and there are many other possible representations. The most simple applications would be to 0-1 encode the occurrence of a word, and then you'd be dealing only with binary features in your naive Bayes algorithm. How do you do it depends on many factors, e.g. if you have a huge dataset you may be more prone to use a more simple method, or if you want to improve the performance of your algorithm, you may consider something more sophisticated.
