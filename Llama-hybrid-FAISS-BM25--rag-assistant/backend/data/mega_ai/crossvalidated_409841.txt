I would organise the data into the tidy data format and load it into a R . From here I would check the data is accurate (i.e. mis-entries, odd values, etc.)s. I would then plot the data and try and work out what kind of models would preform best. If prediction is the goal I would try a suite of models that are fit for the task, but likely beginning with something relatively simple like a generalised linear model with poisson errors. I would check the assumptions and model fit, and perhaps try a few other models depending on what makes sense. These might include things like support vector regression or tree-based models. Alternatively, I might look at time-series models if I thought there was auto-correlation between games, which there likely would be. I would probably work in a cross-validation framework to assess how accurately my models were at predicting turn-out as well. Let me know if anything is unclear.
