From my understanding of Logistic regression, you want to check that each category of yes/no's or 1/0's has a count >10*(p-1), where p is the number of covariates + 1 (for the intercept). If this holds true, you should be good as far as your dependent variables go. There is good reasoning to have closer to a 50/50 ratio of 1/0's but you don't have to. Have you considered checking for Goodness of Fit using a Hosmer-Lemeshow test Statistic to see if logistic regression is appropriate with your covariates? To do in R, you can use this code library(ResourceSelection) hoslem.test()$p.value #look up the parameters in R's help file If you aren't using R, I'm not sure how to do this test.
