You need to elaborate a bit. What kind of a dictionary? If what you want a list of word pairs, for example to translate between two languages such as English and German, and it is a fairly short list, you could use an in-memory hash table. There is a class Hashtable for this in CLDC. If you need a larger dictionary, you might want to store it on a memory card, and then it gets a bit more complicated to search it. There are also relational databases (such as Mimer SQL Mobile) that can be run under J2ME, and you might look at that option for storage and search. EDIT: The original poster added a question as a comment to this answer, about putting a list in a form. This page gives some code examples that might serve as an introduction, although the explanations are in Swedish.
