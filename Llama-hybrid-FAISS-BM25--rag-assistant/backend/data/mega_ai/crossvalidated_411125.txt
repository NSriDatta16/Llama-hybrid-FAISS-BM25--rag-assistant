Most commonly used decision tree algorithms work on labeled data set for training, hence classified under the category of 'supervised learning' algorithm. However, some of the clustering, Anomaly detection, and random forest algorithms do work in 'unsupervised setting' too. @ShivYaragatti; Please refer for the unservised version of decision trees. http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~wwc/course/cs245a/CLTrees.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01971v3.pdf%20(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01971v3.pdf)
