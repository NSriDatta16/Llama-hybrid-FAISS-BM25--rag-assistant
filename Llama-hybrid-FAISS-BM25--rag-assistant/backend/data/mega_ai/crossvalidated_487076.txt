A reference request for a population statistic---experienced population density?

We all know that countries (for example) have population densities, but suppose we want to know what is the actual experienced population density (that is, if, say, in Sweden 95% of the population live in Stockholm, and a couple of hardy Lapps live up North, then the average Swede has the experience of a densely populated country, even though the population density is quite low overall [I don't know if that is actually true of Sweden, by the way]. The obvious way to quantify this is to divide the country into square miles (or whatever). If for the $i$ th square miles the population is $p_i,$ then the quantity we seek is reasonably close to $$\frac{\sum_i p_i^2}{\sum_i p_i},$$ so the ratio of the uncentered second to the uncentered first moment. My questions are: Has this been considered? Does it have a name? Has it actually been computed/tabulated somewhere (for the geographical setting as above)?
