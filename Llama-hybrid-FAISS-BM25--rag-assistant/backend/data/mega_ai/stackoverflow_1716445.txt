There is no standard mapping of user accounts to RFC822 (i.e. user@domain) email addresses. Generally, a default setup of typical mail transfer agents will accept local mail to addresses without a domain and deliver it to the user account of the same name. But even that can't be relied on, as you may not even have an MTA.
