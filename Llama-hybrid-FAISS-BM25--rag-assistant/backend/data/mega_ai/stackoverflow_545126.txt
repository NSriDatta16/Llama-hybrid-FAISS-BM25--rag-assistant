In my opinion, GLUT is still great to learn programming OpenGL in. It is no longer maintained, as far as I know. Do look at : http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/ for the official word Extract from the above link - "The GLUT library has both C, C++ (same as C), FORTRAN, and Ada programming bindings. The GLUT source code distribution is portable to nearly all OpenGL implementations and platforms. The current version is 3.7. Additional releases of the library are not anticipated. GLUT is not open source. Mark Kilgard maintains the copyright." Also look at : http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/windowtoolkits/ for alternatives. You may also want to check out GLUX : http://code.google.com/p/glux/ As far as SDL being the rage, it is great for cross-platform stuff and many people are using it. I personally use Qt for my OpenGL work. Other windowing system alternatives also exist. It is also possible to program natively for windows or X. Edit Feb 28 2017: I should clarify that the student looking to jump into the practicalities of OpenGL would be better served by starting with SDL or Qt. As @TM rightly notes in his comment, using GLUT is far removed from the realities of programming a real world rendering application in OpenGL. My opinion that GLUT is good for learning comes from the thought that it is easier to learn when one separates the concern of learning an OpenGL from the concern of learning about the specifics of a Windowing system. Naturally, this may not match your needs.
