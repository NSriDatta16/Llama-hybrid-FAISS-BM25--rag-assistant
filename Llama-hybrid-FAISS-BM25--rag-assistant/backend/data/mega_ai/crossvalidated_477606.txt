Does wealth index created in stata (command: pca and predict) considers all the components whoese eigen value more than 1 or just first component?

I am trying to calculate the wealth index of a rural community of Nepal. For this, I used 10 household assets variables after conducting a descriptive analysis. I used the principal component analysis. I got the first four components have more than 1 eigenvalue, those four component explains 54% of the variance (the first component explains only 17.9%). The KMO measure of sampling adequacy is 0.619, Bartlett's test of sphericity is Does the wealth index create (by predict command) considers all component those eigenvalue is more than 1 or just the first component? If it is only the first component then, does it means it only explains 17.9% variance? If I add one more variable, it increases the total variance, Bartlett's test remains significant, but KMO measure drops to 0.599. Can we consider KMO 0.599 as 0.6 (as 0.6 is the minimum acceptable value)? Can I proceed with my study with the above results? Sorry If my question is not clear, I can explain it further if you want. Thank you
