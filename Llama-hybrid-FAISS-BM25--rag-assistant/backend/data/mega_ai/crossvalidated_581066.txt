Regularization for classification problems without use of neural network (using R)

I am trying to use regularization methods for a classification problem, but without neural networks. I searched online and I found that the most famous algorithms are Ridge, Lasso, Elastic net but these are for regressions, and other methods for neural network. Are they any algorithms for my problem using a random forest (using R) ? Thank you
