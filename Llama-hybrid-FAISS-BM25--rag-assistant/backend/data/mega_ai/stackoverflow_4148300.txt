Definitely use the marks , otherwise this is a hard problem. To use the marks, you just need to find their positions. To do this, start at the edges, take successive single pixel wide strips and look for periodic deviations. The classic, and fairly easy, way to do this is using the autocorrelation. Since your marks are so clear (i.e. there's very little, if any noise), you might find an even easier way, such as average the pixel value for the whole strip and everything that deviates from that by more than a small amount is a mark; or, make a histogram of you pixel values and it should have two sharp bumps, one big bump for the background, and on small bump for your marks, etc. But whatever approach you use, find the marks, and you're done.
