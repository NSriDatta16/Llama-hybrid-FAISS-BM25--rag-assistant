Advices on creating a first e-Commerce application?

I need to create a e-commerce application in PHP. As a first option I though to use Magento, that I already used one or two times in the past. But as the requirements are growing, I think Magento is not correct choice, there are too much options I don't need, and some options which are not available and/or some customization which will be difficult. So I think I'll write it from the scratch using Zend Framework which I'm used too. Do you have any advices to start ? I think for example about : Session storing (filesystem db) ? Payment module security (Paypal, CB, and checks) Computation with SQL Stored Procedures ? What is yours ?
