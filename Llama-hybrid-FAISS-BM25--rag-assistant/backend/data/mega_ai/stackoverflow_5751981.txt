What's the best way to read a very large database table in VB.NET?

I'm developing a VB.NET application to obtain data from any data source (using an odbc connection string), and because this I can't use specific .net connectors like MySql.Net connector and I can't previously know if the file/DMBS supports LIMIT parameter. This app will read data from a table in the data source and use the information to make some files. At this point there was no problem with some tables because they are less than 3,000,000 records length, but there is a table that has 5,000,000+ rows length, and when I send the query the connection is lost. I'm working with OdbcDataReader, because I read on MSDN site that this is the best way to read a table one row at time and I just use each record once. This is an example of my code: Private Sub ReadData() dim cnn as odbc.odbcConnection dim coma as odbc.odbcCommand dim reg as odbc.odbcDataReader try cnn=new odbc.odbcConnection("Driver={MySQL ODBC 3.51 Driver}; server=localhost; Database=datos; User=usuario; Password=contrasenia; option=3;") cnn.open() coma=new odbc.odbcCommand("select * from tabla") reg=coma.ExecuteReader()' In VBA or VB6 I do something like this: Private Sub ReadData() dim cnn as object dim tab as object set cnn = CreateObject("ADODB.Connection") set tab = CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset") cnn.cursorlocation=3 cnn.open "Driver={MySQL ODBC 3.51 Driver}; server=localhost; Database=datos; User=usuario; Password=contrasenia; option=3;" tab.open "tabla", cnn,,2 ...'Do anything with the data end sub And this code is executed without problem. Any idea how to retreive data in a more efficent way in VB.NET? Or there is any way to do like ADODB (just indicating the table name not the SQL sentence). Sorry if anything is incomprehensible.
