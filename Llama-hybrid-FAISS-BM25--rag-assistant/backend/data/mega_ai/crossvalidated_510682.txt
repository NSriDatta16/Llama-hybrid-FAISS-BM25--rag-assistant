We usually take latent variables to have a different meaning. SVMs use feature transformations: you can express them as (possibly infinite) polynomial expansions of the original features under any kernel. Latent variables, on the other hand, are usually meant to represent unobserved/unobservable probabilistic relationships. Under this notion, neither is PCA based on latent variables. PCA extracts feature transformations (linear combination of features), just like the SVM. Latent variable models similar to PCA are Probabilistic PCA and Factor Analysis. You can compare them to see how they differ.
