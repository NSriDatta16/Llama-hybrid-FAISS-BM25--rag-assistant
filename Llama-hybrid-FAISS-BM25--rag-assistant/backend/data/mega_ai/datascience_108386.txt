Reinforcement Learning - Model based and model free

I'm studying reinforcement learning and I found confusing information. I know there are two different types of reinforcement learning, model based and model free. In the second image, it is possible to see TD learning, so I don't understand if Td learning is another type of reinforcement learning or it is a model based.
