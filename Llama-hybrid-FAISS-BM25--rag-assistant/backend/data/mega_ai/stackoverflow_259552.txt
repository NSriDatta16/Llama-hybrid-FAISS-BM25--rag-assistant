Eliminating Windows forms refresh artifacts

We have a fairly complicated GUI in windows forms using C# and .Net 2.0. My problem is that whenever I drag any window over the GUI, it leaves artifacts over the form. I can't for the life of me figure out how to eliminate it. I've tried enabling double buffering, but it only helps, doesn't eliminate the problem. Other applications don't seem to have this issue, and I'm wondering what we're doing wrong. Update In Response to answers Most of the application is just using a set of third party controls (Infragistics) laid out on a panel. As far as I can tell there is nothing getting done in the GUI thread besides basic(non-cpu intensive) mouse click handling.
