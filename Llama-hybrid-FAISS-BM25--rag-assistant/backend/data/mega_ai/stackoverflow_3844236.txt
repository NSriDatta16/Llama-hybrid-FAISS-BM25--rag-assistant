The current version of jQuery is 1.4.2. The fact that you state 1.8.something inclines me to believe you are in fact loading jQuery-ui; which is an add-on library for jQuery. Can you load the page up on a browser in chrome or Firefox (with Firebug) and verify that jQuery is in fact working? Also the jQuery is wrong in the article you link, the following is a more succinct way of doing what you need and uses the appropriate selector: $(function(){ $("#menucontainer").tabs(); }) http://www.chadmyers.com/blog/archive/2007/12/13/using-jquery-with-asp.net-mvc.aspx This link claims to have some pretty good MVC stuff for jQuery but honestly I would encourage you to read the documentation at jquery.com and see what went wrong.
