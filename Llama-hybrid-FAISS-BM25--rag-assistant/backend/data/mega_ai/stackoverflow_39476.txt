What is the yield keyword used for in C#?

In the How Can I Expose Only a Fragment of IList<> question one of the answers had the following code snippet: IEnumerable FilteredList() { foreach(object item in FullList) { if(IsItemInPartialList(item)) yield return item; } } What does the yield keyword do there? I've seen it referenced in a couple places, and one other question, but I haven't quite figured out what it actually does. I'm used to thinking of yield in the sense of one thread yielding to another, but that doesn't seem relevant here.
