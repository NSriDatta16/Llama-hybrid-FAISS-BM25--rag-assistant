Spring custom converter for all Enums

I've built many Enum classes with int getID() and MyEnum withID(int) methods that allow me to dedicate an ID to the enum values for persistence purposes (thus avoiding changes due to order/name change with regards to external storage of the enum). I'd like to build a custom converter that does some reflection to look for these methods, and use them or back up to Ordinal/String conversions when they are not found. Does a generic Enum converter seem possible to anyone? This is only my second foray into Converters.
