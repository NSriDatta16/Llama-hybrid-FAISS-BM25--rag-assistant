This might work in two loops per word: 1) Loop over the word counting the number of distinct symbols that appear. (This will require extra storage at most equal to the length of the string - probably some sort of hash.) 2) Loop over the word counting the number of times symbol n is different from symbol n+1. If those two values aren't different by exactly one, the word is not grouped.
