Is there some dependence of one value in the sequence on previous values? In other words, if you can treat this as a time series, there are a whole host of methods to deal with predictions, starting with SARIMAX methods ( https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-forecasting-with-arima-sarima-and-sarimax-ee61099e78f6 and working up to recurrent neural networks and deep learning. If your series is truly stochastic, expect it to be challenging :-p
