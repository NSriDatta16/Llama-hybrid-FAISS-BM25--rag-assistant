As Richard Hardy writes , if you have only seven observations, this is very little data. If you first fit an explanatory variable, there is essentially nothing left to fit an ARIMA process to errors to. (Plus, with only seven data points, you don't have enough data to do proper holdout testing!) I'd recommend simply regressing your time series on one (!) predictor and working with that. Alternatively, you could try to get higher-frequency data, e.g., monthly or quarterly. Then you could actually expect some seasonal effects and should indeed try to model them.
