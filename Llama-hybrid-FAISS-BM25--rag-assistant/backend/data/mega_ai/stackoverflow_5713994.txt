I had the similar problem before few days so may be i can help with this. I am newbie but in my project i had the same question (not error). Yes, you can use a DLL built via VB.NET in a C#.NET project. If you have a VB.NET dll, you can use it without any change in C#.NET. But sometimes, you need to pay attention to platform option. Following two important features are there in .NET: The compilation produces IL (Intermediate Language) code. All .NET languages produces IL with at compile time is Compiled by the JIT (Just In Time) Compiler. The languages all use a common Type System (CTS) and run on the same Common Language Runtime (CLR) . The goal is to produce code which is easily interoperable. So, DLL is not problem. Your error may be for something else, i don't have idea about that. Hope this helps.
