Some cases where I have found it useful: mark a test that is incomplete, so it fails and warns you until you can finish it making sure an exception is thrown: try{ // do stuff... fail("Exception not thrown"); }catch(Exception e){ assertTrue(e.hasSomeFlag()); } Note: Since JUnit4, there is a more elegant way to test that an exception is being thrown: Use the annotation @Test(expected=IndexOutOfBoundsException.class) However, this won't work if you also want to inspect the exception, then you still need fail() .
