You certainly need to consider time, but longitudinal analysis is broader than just time series - there are multi-level models and generalized estimating equations and so on. But, given your problem, I think the best approach might be survival analysis with multiple events. This is a pretty complex area, but there are some good books e.g. Therneau & Grambsch . But if you haven't studied survival analysis, that book will be diving in the very deep end indeed. You could start with this little book by Allison as a very introductory level start.
