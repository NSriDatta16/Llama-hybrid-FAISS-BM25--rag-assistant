I would encourage you to browse Sitecore.SecurityModel namespace, especially Domain class. It contains the methods you'd probably find useful ( IsLoggedIn , Login , Logout ). You can download the help file of Sitecore API from here . Also, Sitecore security model is based on ASP.NET security starting from version 6 . In 5.x a user is still an item in the appropriate database. Hope this info can help you.
