You can still get started using what's availabe for 1.7, if you pay attention to how file structure changed between the two versions (ie the System and Application directories are now separate). To that, many of the tuts you'll find are applicable - bearing in mind that the paths may differ, and you'll want to verify that the functions are still supported in 2.0 by use of the User's Guide ). If you walked through the tut in your link, using the Models, Views, Controllers directories inside Application, you'd get a "Hello World" page. The User's Guide is a great tool, as are the Community Forums . Best of luck to you.
