You can use a join instead, which will allow the limit : SELECT * FROM news n JOIN ( SELECT news_id, AVG(rating) AS average_r, COUNT(*) AS amt_r FROM rates GROUP BY news_id ORDER BY average_r,amt_r DESC LIMIT 5 ) top5 ON n.news_id = top5.news_id ORDER BY top5.average_r,top5.amt_r Note: You might want to change your query to a ORDER BY average_r DESC, amt_r DESC to get the highest rated items, instead of the lowest rated.
