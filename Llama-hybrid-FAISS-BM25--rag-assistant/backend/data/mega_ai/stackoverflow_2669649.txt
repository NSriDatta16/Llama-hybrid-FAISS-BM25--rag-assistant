Adding format to properties

I have an object with a couple of DateTime properties: public DateTime Start_Date { get; set; } public DateTime? End_Date { get; set; } I would like to set a format for each of these, along the lines of Start_Date.ToString("M/d/yyyy hh:mm tt") Do I have to code the get, or is there an elegant way to do this?
