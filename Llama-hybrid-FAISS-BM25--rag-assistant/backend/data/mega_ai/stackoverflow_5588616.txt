How do you calculate server load in PHP?

How do you calculate the server load of PHP/apache? I know in vBulletin forums there's the server load displayed like 0.03 0.01 0.04 but it's not really understandable to a average joe. So I thought about a 1-100 percentile scale. I wanted to display a server load visual that reads from a DIV: $load = $serverLoad*100; //show visual for server load on a 1-100 % scale Current server load is $load% However, I don't know how to detect server load. Is it possible to do turn this server load into a percentile scale? I don't know where to start. May someone please help me out? Thanks.
