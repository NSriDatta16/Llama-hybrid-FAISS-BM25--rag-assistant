No, it's not possible to preserve draggability when you replace/remove elements in the DOM, unless you modify the jquery core (which I do not recommend.) Doing replaceWith() and remove() for DOM elements means they are destroyed, and thus any behaviors or events associated with them are destroyed as well. Try creating an outer which contains the draggable behavior and instead replace the HTML within the div when you want to change the draggable item upon drop, etc. Alternatively (and less elegant) you can call draggable() again on your elements after your do replaceWith() to restore the behavior you removed with replaceWith() . Likewise, instead of remove() try hide() to simply make elements disappear for a while but retain their behavior. In short: You are approaching the problem incorrectly. Change your approach.
