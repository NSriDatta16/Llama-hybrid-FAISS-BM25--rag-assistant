Interpret Logistic Regression with Interactions using R

I ran the following logistic regression in R where the dependent variable (Success) is 1 if the student graduates and 0 if the student does not graduate: Call: glm(formula = Success ~ Core.GPA + Lab.Yr.Taken + Frn.Lang.Yr.Taken + SAT.Converted + Incoming.Test, family = binomial, data = df) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.7123 -1.2211 0.6501 0.8495 1.3955 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -4.094e+00 6.007e-01 -6.816 9.39e-12 *** Core.GPA 1.024e+00 9.916e-02 10.329 Here are the Odds Ratio for that model: (Intercept) Core.GPA Lab.Yr.Taken Frn.Lang.Yr.Taken 0.01666638 2.78504399 1.12973489 1.06540330 SAT.Converted Incoming.Test 1.00009867 1.04099486 My interpretation here (using Incoming.Test as an example) is: "Odds of success increase by 4.1% for each additional one unit increase in Incoming Test Credit" (1.04099486-1) x 100 However, I'd like to know if being a first generation student impacts these odds ratio and if so how? (i.e., does the likelihood that a student graduates based on any of my independent variables differ for a first gen and non first gen student?) To determine this, I ran the model again and set First Generation as an interaction variable with all variables in model. Call: glm(formula = Success ~ (Core.GPA + Lab.Yr.Taken + Frn.Lang.Yr.Taken + SAT.Converted + Incoming.Test) * firstGen, family = binomial, data = df) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.6380 -1.1061 0.6362 0.8186 1.8288 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -3.5094889 0.6705484 -5.234 1.66e-07 *** Core.GPA 1.0698918 0.1087680 9.836 and odds ratio: (Intercept) Core.GPA 0.0299122 2.9150640 Lab.Yr.Taken Frn.Lang.Yr.Taken 1.1020789 1.0385226 SAT.Converted Incoming.Test 0.9998104 1.0365123 firstGenYes Core.GPA:firstGenYes 0.1703781 1.4231457 Lab.Yr.Taken:firstGenYes Frn.Lang.Yr.Taken:firstGenYes 1.0972578 1.1328434 SAT.Converted:firstGenYes Incoming.Test:firstGenYes 0.9990255 1.0301036 What I'm hoping to learn from these models is: 1. For Non-First Gen students, the odds of success increase/decrease by _% for each additional one unit increase in Incoming test Credit. My assumption on this so far is: The odds ratio for Incoming.Test (1.0365123) represents the odds ratio for NON-first Generation students (aka, for non-first gen students odds of success increase by 3% for each additional increase in incoming test credits). 2. Same question as above, but for First Gen students. ??? Is a calculation needed to determine this? 3. What is the difference in odds between first gen and non first gen students My assumption so far: The odds ratio for IncomingTestxFirstGen (1.03010136) represents the difference in odds between first gen and non first gen??? 4. Is First Generation status significant or non significant when considering odds of success based on Incoming test credits? My assumption: Yes, the difference is significant because IncomingTestxFirstGen is significant. 5. What does the "firstGenYes" odds ratio in the second model indicate/represent? ??? I would appreciate any feedback regarding my initial interpretation attempts! I have reviewed questions similar to this that have already been asked, but have not came across any explanation that fully encapsulates what Iâ€™m after. Thank you.
