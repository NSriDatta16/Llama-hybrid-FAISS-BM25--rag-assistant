What method should be used if the clusters contains different classes?

Assume that you having $N$ clusters. Each cluster have multiple classes. So we know the class ID for every major clusters, but not the class ID for the data points inside the major clusters. Each colour is its own class ID. E.g red can be class ID 1 and blue can be class ID 2. Assume that you are using Support Vector Machine to classify each major clusters. But in this case, SVM cannot classify each data point. How should this be solved If I got $X$ number of points and I don't know which class they belong to, but I know which major cluster they fit in. I found the major clusters with K-means clustering and then I'm using SVM with a linear kernel to find the mathematical expression how to classify each data point into the major clusters, but not succeed to find the class ID of the individual data points. Do you have any suggestion?
