Are there any unsupervised learning algorithms for time sequenced data?

Each observation in my data was collected with a difference of 0.1 seconds. I don't call it a time series because it don't have a date and time stamp. In the examples of clustering algorithms (I found online) and PCA the sample data have 1 observation per case and are not timed. But my data have hundreds of observations collected every 0.1 seconds per vehicle and there are many vehicles. Note: I have asked this question on quora as well.
