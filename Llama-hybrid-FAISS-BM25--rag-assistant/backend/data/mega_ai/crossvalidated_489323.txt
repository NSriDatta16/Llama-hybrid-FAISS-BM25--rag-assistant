Good books for self studying Bayesian

What are some good books with the help of which I can self-study Bayesian from the basics to advanced, mentioning why do we need Bayesian and also which contains numericals, which can boost my concept. I know the basics of Bayes theorem and conditional, but when it comes to Bayesian my knowledge is very abstract. So it would be very helpful if I am suggested a good book which I can download online. Thank You.
