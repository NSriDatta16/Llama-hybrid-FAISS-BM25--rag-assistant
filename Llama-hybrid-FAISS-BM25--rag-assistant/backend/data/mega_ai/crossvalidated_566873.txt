Posterior distributions --- what's the correct way to see it?

When running models from a bayesian perspective — a regression for example — we get posterior distribution for every parameter/statistic we want, right? I’m wondering whether I should see this this posterior distribution as a regular distribution (as in rnorm with a mean and Standard Deviation ), or as a sample mean distribution (with a mean and Standard Error ).
