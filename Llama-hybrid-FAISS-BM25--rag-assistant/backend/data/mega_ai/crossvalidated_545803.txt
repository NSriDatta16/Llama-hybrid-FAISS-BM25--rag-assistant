Find marginal distribution of X (Bayesian setting)

$X|\theta$ follows $N(\theta,w)$ and $\theta$ follows $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ Both follow a normal distribution but with different mean and variance. I assume it is a Bayesian setting. How to find the marginal distribution of X? Would mgf be a good way to do it?
