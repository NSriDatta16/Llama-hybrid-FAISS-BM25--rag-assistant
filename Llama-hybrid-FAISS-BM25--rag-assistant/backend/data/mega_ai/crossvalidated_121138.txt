Poisson Process

I would appreciate a hint on this problem: A pedestrian wishes to cross a single lane of fast-moving traffic. Suppose the number of vehicles that have passed by time $t$ is a Poisson process of rate $\lambda$ and suppose it takes time $a$ to walk across the lane. Assuming the pedestrian can foresee correctly the times at which vehicles will pass by, how long on average does it take to cross over safely? Thoughts: I know that I have to find E($T$) where $T$ is the time taken to cross over. I also know that if $J_1$ is the time the first vehicle arrives then I need to find a connection between E(T) and $\{J_1>a\}$ and $\{J_1
