Is the "prefix" part always exactly 3 characters? If not, this gets complicated. Umm, with Postgres you could order by regexp_matches(userid,"^[a-z]*")[1], substring(userid, regexp_matches(userid,"^[a-z]*")[1])::int I think that would work,I haven't tried it. Anyway, the point is, if you have some function that will do regular expressions, you couild pull off a leading string of alphas, then peal off what's left and convert it to int. If you're really embedding a number in an alpha field, a better alternative is: Don't do that. If this is two different logical data items, then make it two fields. It's a lot easier to put fields together than to take them apart.
