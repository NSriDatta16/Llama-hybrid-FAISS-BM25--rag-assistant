Log response ratio of means not agreeing with linear mixed model output

I have a linear mixed model structured like so: Richness~Time*Treatment+(1|Site) Time has two levels (Pre and Post) as does Treatment (Treatment and Control). Now, richness is count data and so I'm using a poisson distribution with a log link (residual plot looks fine). I am predicting there will no difference between Pre Treatment and control samples (before a fire, in this case), but there will be a difference in the Post samples. The model gives the following output: FIXED EFFECTS: Est. S.E. z val. p (Intercept) 0.40905 0.21488 1.90365 0.05696 . TreatmentTreatment -0.50263 0.18042 -2.78584 0.00534 ** TimePre 0.29058 0.15135 1.91993 0.05487 . TreatmentTreatment:TimePre 0.54499 0.22800 2.39028 0.01684 * and doing a pairwise comparison with emmeans: contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value Control,Post - Treatment,Post 0.50262890 0.1804227 Inf 2.786 0.0274 Control,Post - Control,Pre -0.29058074 0.1513496 Inf -1.920 0.2196 Control,Post - Treatment,Pre -0.33293869 0.1451375 Inf -2.294 0.0994 Treatment,Post - Control,Pre -0.79320964 0.1758399 Inf -4.511 Or to do the contrasts differently: Time = Post: contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value Control - Treatment 0.50262890 0.1804227 Inf 2.786 0.0053 Time = Pre: contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value Control - Treatment -0.04235795 0.1393992 Inf -0.304 0.7612 So far so good. There is clearly no difference before the fire but there is a difference after the fire. Now, the problem. It's always better to display actual data rather than modelled data (at least in my opinion), and to do that I plotted the log response ratio (using escalc(measure="ROM") from the metafor R package). I averaged richness across sites, calculated SD and used the number of sites as n. I then calculated the difference between Treatment and Control sites, for Pre and Post separately, with 95% CIs: This does not agree with the statistical results above - it shows no difference in pre or post, or at best, a difference in the Pre samples. I suspect the problem could lie in at least two places. The first is perhaps the most important. 1) Differences between sites are not accounted for in the ROM. Is there a way to weight the sites' richness prior to calculating the overall mean and SD for use in the ROM? 2) I only have a small number of sites (n=5), which can bias the ROM, and there is a fix for that, but I cannot find a way to implement it in R: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/14-2402.1 Any assistance or insights appreciated, or if this is a duplicate.
