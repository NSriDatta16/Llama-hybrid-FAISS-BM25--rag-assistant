How would I create a panel on drag drop in flex 4?

I am trying to drag a component and on drop I want it to create a panel. Here is the actionscript I have but it doesn't seem to be working, any ideas why? private function dragDrop(e:DragEvent): void { var userPanel:Panel = new Panel(); userPanel.width = 100; userPanel.height = 100; userPanel.x = 10; userPanel.y = 10; userPanel.visible = true; addChild(userPanel); }
