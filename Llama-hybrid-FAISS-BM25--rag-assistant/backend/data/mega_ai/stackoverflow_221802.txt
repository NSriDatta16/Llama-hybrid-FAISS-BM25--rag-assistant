While I never had the chance to work with a unit tester in actionscript, at work we created a framework which: compiled the script(s) inside a test application, in our case with flex set up a timer (watchdog) application, in case of loop failure ran the application which, in turn: connected to a PHP backend to get a test case fed the test to the component read the results and sent them back the watchdog would kick in and kill the application on whichever happened first: timer ran out (reasonable timeout) application sent back the results if there were other tests to run, goto 2. Definitely not elegant, but did the job (this was with AS1 scripts)
