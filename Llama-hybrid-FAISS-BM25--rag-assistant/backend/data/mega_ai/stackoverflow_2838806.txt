Other than making sure you have an index in place, you can checkout the SQLite Optimization FAQ . Using transactions can give you a very big speed increase as you mentioned and you can also try to turn off journaling. Example 1: 2.2 PRAGMA synchronous The Boolean synchronous value controls whether or not the library will wait for disk writes to be fully written to disk before continuing. This setting can be different from the default_synchronous value loaded from the database. In typical use the library may spend a lot of time just waiting on the file system. Setting "PRAGMA synchronous=OFF" can make a major speed difference. Example 2: 2.3 PRAGMA count_changes When the count_changes setting is ON, the callback function is invoked once for each DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE operation. The argument is the number of rows that were changed. If you don't use this feature, there is a small speed increase from turning this off.
