View the http headers. You should see something like Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Browsers don't pay much attention to meta tags, if there was a real http header stating a different encoding. update Whatcha get from this? echo bin2hex('é'); echo chr(0xc3) . chr(0xa9); You should get c3a9é , otherwise I'd say file encoding issue.
