PHP PDF-Generation - IE7/Acrobat8: "Website cannot be displayed"

I've got some trouble with displaying pdfs in IE7 (which were generated by R&OS' ezpdf). IE7 with Acrobat Reader 8.1.2. says "The page cannot be displayed" Other Browsers (like FF3/Acrobat 8.1.2. or IE6/Acrobat 7) have no problem with the file. The following headers are returned by the server: Date: Thu, 08 Jan 2009 10:52:40 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.8 (Win32) mod_ssl/2.2.8 OpenSSL/0.9.8g PHP/5.2.5 DAV/2 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.5 Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-Length: 4750 Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: application/pdf Does anybody know how to fix this problem?
