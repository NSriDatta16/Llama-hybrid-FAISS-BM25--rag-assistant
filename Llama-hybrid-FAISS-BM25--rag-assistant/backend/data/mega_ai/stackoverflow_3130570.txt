Replication related issue,

Replication related issue, I am explaining my architecture . I have created , its transactinal replication process 2 Publisher on table vendors script I have given below, A Distributor 2 Subscribers Data replication set up is like this as : Table VENDORS gets replicated from 2-publishers to 2-subcribers via-Distributor. While replication, ERROR issued in Distributor database as : Here, What must happen is Pub1 (creates pubs table vendors) â€“> inserts (vendors) data to Distributor. -> pull by subscribers What is happening now for me is , Pub1 (creates pubs table vendors-done) -> Throws error at distributor database as Replication-Replication Distribution Subsystem: agent abc-serv1\PRD01-star-star Billing-PROD-VREPL1\REPL01-25 failed. Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_vendors'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.vendors'. Error is issued while operation is done between Publishers to Distributor.
