I'm not an expert on time series, but I have a general advice : may I suggest you to try other packages (and various parameters) to see, if there are any differences in results. Also, unless you have to use Python , I'd recommend to take a look at the R 's extensive ecosystem for time series analysis : see http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/timeseries.html and http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html . In particular, you may want to check the standard stats package (including functions arima() and arima0 ), as well as some other packages: FitARMA ( http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FitARMA ), forecast ( http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecast ) and education-focused fArma (cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fArma), to mention just a few. I hope this is helpful.
