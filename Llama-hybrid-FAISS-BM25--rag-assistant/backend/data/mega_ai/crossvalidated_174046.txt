This is more a comment, but as I do not have enough reputation I might as well answer. From my limited experience with MCMC samplers, what I have observed is that the parameters tend to stay fixed when the hyperparameters are too narrow. As they control the spreading of the parameters, they prevent the solution space to be efficiently sampled. Try to take larger values for the hyperparameters and see what happens. This technical paper helped me a lot to understand the MCMC samplers. It is composed of two samplers, Gibbs (the one you are using), and Hybrid Monte Carlo, and rapidly explaining how to choose priors, hyperpriors and values for the parameters and hyperparameters.
