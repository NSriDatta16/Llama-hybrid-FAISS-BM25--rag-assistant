I don't think it would be practical to store files that large in a database, especially by uploading (I'm assuming the upload is through a browser.) At a minimum, you'd want to upload the file to a holding folder on the server and move it into the database once it's fully uploaded. Otherwise you'd have to figure out how to chunk the bytestream into the database using multiple updates. I don't think you can append to a BLOB that's already in a record. UPDATE : It looks like I may have been wrong about the chunking. SQL Server supports UPDATETEXT . I still think uploading files that large and "streaming" them into the database is fragile and presents reliability issues.
