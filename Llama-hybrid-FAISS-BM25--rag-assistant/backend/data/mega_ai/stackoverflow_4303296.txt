Generalization for regular expression on any list

I'm working with a large list containing integers and I would like to do some pattern matching on them (like finding certain sequences). Regular expressions would be the perfect fit, except that they always seem to only handle lists of characters, a.k.a. strings. Is there any library (in any language) that can handle lists of an arbitrary type? I'm aware that I could convert my integer list into a string and then do a normal regular expression search but that seems a bit wasteful and inelegant. edit: My requirements are fairly simple. No need for nested lists, no need for fancy character classes. Basically I'm just interested in occurrences of sequences that can get pretty complicated. (e.g. something like "[abc]{3,}.([ab]?[^a]{4,7})" etc. where a , b , c are integers). This should be possible to generalize over any type which can be checked for equality. For an enumerable type you could also get things like "[a-z]" to work.
