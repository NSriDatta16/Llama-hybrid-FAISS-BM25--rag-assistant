It seems there is an overhead of 7 bits - probably identifying a block of memory as BIT storage. This 7 bits is added to the number requestedby BIT(n) and the total is divided by 8 to give the number of bytes. The manual defines the (n+7)/8 as BYTES So 4 bits requires less than 2 bytes. The manual says 'approximately' because it depends whether you talk about whole bytes or fractions.
