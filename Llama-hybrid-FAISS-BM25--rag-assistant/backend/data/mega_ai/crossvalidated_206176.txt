As demodw mentioned in the comments, a simple regression would be great start for inter-period comparisons. However, for longer term comparisons or across time comparisons (ie the final outcome), things may get more complicated, not least because there are only 20 patients to work with it. Beyond the simple regressions, g-computations and regressions on longitudinal propensity scores (RLPS) would be two more options you should consider. It would also be possible to go Bayesian on this (check out Gustafson (2015, Biometrics). As a side note (I can't comment yet), there are elements of the question that could be clarified to help us answer your questions: -Are the treatments that the patients receive symptom dependent, time dependent, both, neither? -How were the treatments assigned? Is this a randomized controlled, blind experiment? -Are there potential risks of non-adherence to treatment?
