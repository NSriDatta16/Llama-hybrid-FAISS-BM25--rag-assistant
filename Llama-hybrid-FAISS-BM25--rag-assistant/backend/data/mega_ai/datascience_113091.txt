Usage of Word2Vec

Sorry for the basic doubt, I would like to know if I can use my Word2Vec straight for classification without using LSTM. My assumption is itâ€™s not possible because the ordering of the words will not be take into account. Hence it wont perform for classification. But we use BERT embeddings for classification. But in this case, BERT generates embedding based on context of the sentence. Hence we can use it for classification. Is my understanding right? BERT achieves what LSTM learns through ordering without sequential processing, It finds an embedding by processing the sentence as a whole. LSTM also tries to represent a sentence using some context but does it through sequential processing. Is my understanding right?
