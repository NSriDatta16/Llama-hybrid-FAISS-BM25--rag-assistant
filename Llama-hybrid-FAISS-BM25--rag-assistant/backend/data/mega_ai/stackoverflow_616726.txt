It is theoretically possible if BookNotFoundException extends RemoteExcepiton. However, I assume that you do not have control over the StudentServer interface. It appears that the intent of that interface is to not throw a BookNotFoundException. While I can understand why you want to, the interface doesn't seem to encourage that.
