You can get all sorts of weird things going with URI's and their locations relative to the Silverlight application; and data-bindings are notoriously difficult to get right. My recommendation would be to start troubleshooting this by hard-coding the absolute URI's to the MP3 files directly in the XAML. Once you've got that working, switch to relative URI's, and when that's working, switch to data-binding them to the code-behind (or ViewModel or whatever). If you've got the file placed in Isolated Storage, something like this ought to work (haven't tested it on WP7): var store = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); var iStream = store.OpenFile("a.mp3", System.IO.FileMode.Open,FileAccess.Read); firstTone.SetSource(iStream); firstTone.Play();
