How much data do I need to build a classification model?

While studying a machine learning based classification model, I started wondering how much I need to build a classification model. The way I do is that I download some specific dataset within a certain time period, do some preprocessing and feed those data into the model but I am not sure if I am doing it properly. The way I think is I can never that the right size of dataset for the classification but I can only update the model as more data are available. So, my questions are the following: when building a classification model How much data do I need? How should I choose the target data for the classification model? Are the recent ones better? Data a year ago is too old for the current model? How do you choose the data and what size of dataset do you start?
