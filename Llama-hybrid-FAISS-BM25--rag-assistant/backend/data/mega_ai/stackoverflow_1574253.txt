Ok, after combining the two fragments (why did you split it? Is there a size limit to posts here?) and installing two missing CCK modules, I was able to import the content type into my local test instance just fine. Creating a node from it worked, as well as viewing it afterwards. In short - can't reproduce :/ So something else must be wrong with your Drupal instance to cause this. I have no idea what this might be, but I'd start trying to import another (simpler) content type to see if your import functionality is generally broken or just for this specific import. If the error occurs just for this import, my next try would be ignoring the import problem and trying to debug the 404 for recruiting_form content, as this could well be related and might be easier to debug. You could start by putting a $trace = debug_backtrace() ; into the drupal_not_found() function - either var_dump() its output or look at it using a debugger. The trace should point you to the function issuing the 404. If you want to tackle the import problem, I'd start searching for the 'illegal choice' error message in your codebase (normally comes from general form validation) and check the state of things there - using a debugger and/or the trace statements, you might be able to pinpoint the cause for that error, which might give a hint on whats wrong. Good Luck!
