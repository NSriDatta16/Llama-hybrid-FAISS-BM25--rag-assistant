ASP.NET MVC: Best Way to Enable Different Modes of Authentication?

I'm currently working on an application that will likely be deployed amongst various organizations within my current workplace. I need to develop a testable and properly designed authentication framework so that for each implementation folks can choose to use either Windows Authentication, Forms Authentication, a home-grown Single-SignOn system OR OpenID. So given ASP.NET MVC (and in particular I'm using the S#arp Architecture framework) how should I go about doing this? Ideally it would be nice if folks can simply make changes to the web.config file in each case. Thanks
