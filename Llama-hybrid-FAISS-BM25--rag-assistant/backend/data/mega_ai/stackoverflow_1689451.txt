I've tried Maven, personally for home projects and professionally at my workplace, and... I hate it. I must admit I don't have a lot of experience, but it doesn't feel good. I get the idea Maven is a less-than-perfect implementation of a good idea. I'll probably get flamed by Maven enthusiasts, but this is my personal opinion. I think Maven comes into its own in organizations that deal with a network of interrelated projects, like Apache does; where dependencies tend to change a lot and need to be quite explicitly specified to avoid "jar version hell". For isolated projects dependent on a few seldom changing jars, I find it overly intrusive. To answer your question: I've read forum and blog posts on the Internet of other people doing exactly what you propagate. They use Maven for dependency management and then do their building with Ant. This undermines some of the benefits Maven is supposed to bring, such as the fact that a "normal" build is simpler to specify in Maven than Ant. However, I think you can be encouraged by the fact that you're not the only person with this idea, and it is indeed working for some other people. I'd like to give you links to quotes, but I came across this stuff in the past few weeks and didn't collect references.
