You can turn a single tree structure into a regression-like equation with the use of indicator functions to indicate the different nodes of the tree. That is, you can make an equation with the dependent variable on the left side and the independent variables on the right. These equations get cumbersome quickly, if the tree is at all complex. As far as I can see, the same ought to be possible with methods such as random forests, but I am not expert on them and can't say for sure.
