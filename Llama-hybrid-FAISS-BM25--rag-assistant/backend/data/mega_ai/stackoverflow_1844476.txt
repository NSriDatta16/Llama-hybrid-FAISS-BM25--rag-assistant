How to eliminate xmlns="" entries produced by XSLT transform of one XML doc to another XML doc

Ok, I've seen numerous variations on this question, but none exactly answer what I'm trying to solve and perhaps I'm just too dense to see how to apply one of the other answers to what I'm trying to do. I have some XML that looks something like the following: 1.0 1.0.0.0 Now I have an XSLT transform that I'm applying to this XML. The XSLT is similar to the following: The output I get is basically what I want and looks like the following: api_info 1.0 1.0.0.0 But what I don't want are the xmlns="" attributes in the and elements. Now I've found that if I explicitly specify the namespace in the XSLT for those elements, then the unwanted attribute gets pushed down one level to the children of those attributes. I could just go through my entire XSLT and explicitly add the xmlns="" http://www.companyname.com/schemas/product/Version001 " attribute to each of my xsl:element definitions, but I know that there must be a more elegant way. We programmers are far too lazy to not have a shortcut for this kind of nonsense. If my XSLT didn't consist of something as simple as the shortened example, I be tempted to do it that way. But I know there must be a better way. Does anyone know what I'm missing here? Thanks, AlarmTripper
