To quote Microsoft : This topic is specific to a legacy technology. XML Web services and XML Web service clients should now be created using Windows Communication Foundation . Decide on your own what that means to you. WCF completely replaces ASMX web services. People who complain about the complexity of WCF aren't paying attention. Go create a new WCF service and look at the actual code in the "hello world" service that the template creates. That's only more complicated than what the ASMX template created because it includes two operations not just one. Make no mistake about WSE, however. It's simply obsolete. Stop using it as soon as possible, and do not develop any new code using WSE. Don't let anybody convince you that nothing has changed. It has. ASMX has been replaced by something much better, much more powerful, and much more flexible.
