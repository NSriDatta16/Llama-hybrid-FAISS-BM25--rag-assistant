My #1 rule is use a strict doctype . HTML or XHTML is fine, but using the strict doctype removes pretty much every browser quirk there is, especially in IE7+. Imagine you opened a paragraph tag and never closed it. If you then open a list tag, did you mean it to be inside the paragraph or not? Actually you can't put any other block tags inside a tag, that's why the spec allows you to omit the closing tag. If you start a list without closing a paragraph, then the paragraph is implicitly closed. And the validator won't complain. That's not to say you shouldn't close tags, because it generally makes code easier to skim (you don't need to remember the above rules).
