Simulating data from an unknown distribution given min and max values

Let's say I have a couple of studies that have measured the values of a variable in different experimental setups. For example, the first study evaluated the effects of A & B on y and the second study evaluated the effects of C & D on y. In both studies they authors reported only the min and max of the values ( i.e., no information ragrding mean, sd, or the distribution of y is given). I want to make a regression model that accounts for A,B,C,D. Is it a valid procedure to use a triangular distribiution (or any location based distribution) to generate some random data based on the given min and max values and then make a model? I initially thought of simulating some data from a triangular distribution with different modes that lie very close to min, max, or in between the min and max values. Then, suggest that depending on the risk tolerance, any of these three models can be selected. I am not sure if this method is justified or is there a better way to simulate some data that represent the unknown distribution.
