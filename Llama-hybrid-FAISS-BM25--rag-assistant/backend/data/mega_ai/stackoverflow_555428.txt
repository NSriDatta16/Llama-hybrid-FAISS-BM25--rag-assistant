BTW: The solutions described here will work only if you want to use the 'factored' part of the code in a separate query clause (e.g. Select). If you'd like to use it as part of a clause that also does some other thing (perhaps return anonymous type with some other information), you'll need to construct the whole expression tree dynamically using Expression.Xyz methods. Alternatively you could use the trick for embedding lambda expressions that I described here: http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx
