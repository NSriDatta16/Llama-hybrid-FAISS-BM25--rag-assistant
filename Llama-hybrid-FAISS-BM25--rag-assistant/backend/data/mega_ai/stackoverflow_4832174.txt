The version is easy in terms of getting it and updating the various AssemblyInfo.cs files. I'd organise your TFS structure in a similar way to the Subversion conventions, so have a trunk, tags and branches folder. Through consistent naming you can make sure that your specific MSBuild file is always a set number of directories down from either the trunk of from a specific branch name. Have a custom MSBuild task that works this out for you (by navigating up the TFS folder hierarchy), and feed this into your property that is used to update the AssemblyInformationalAttribute. You can use the FileUpdate task from http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/ to perform a Regex replace on your AssemblyInfo.cs files.
