Measuring share contribution of each var/cov term to the standard deviation of a sum of variables

Say, for a simple example, I have a random variable $X = \alpha_1 X_1 + \alpha_2 X_2$, where $X_i$ are random variables and $\alpha_i$ are weights. I then calculate the standard deviation of $X$ as $\sigma_X = \sqrt{(\alpha_1)^2 \mathrm{Var}(X_1) + (\alpha_2)^2 \mathrm{Var}(X_2) + 2\alpha_1 \alpha_2 \mathrm{Cov}(X_1,X_2)}$. What I'm wondering is: what is a good way to calculate the "share" of each of the three individual variance/covariance terms in the total standard deviation of $X$? It seems like, because of the concavity of the square root function, e.g. $(\alpha_1)^2 \mathrm{Var}(X_1) / \mathrm{Var}(X)$ would not be a good, representative measure of the variance of $\alpha_1 X_1$'s "share contribution" to $X$'s standard deviation; and neither would the share of the square root of each variance/covariance term in the sum of these individual square roots, not the least because I would run into issues trying to take the square root of a negative covariance term. The motivation for my question is as follows: I'm measuring sampling error in survey-based economic indexes (e.g. the Institute for Supply Management's PMI). For composite indexes (i.e. indexes that are calculated from responses to multiple questions, as weighted sums--the PMI is an example of this), both variance and covariance terms enter into the sampling error formula, as in the example above. I want to look at the time series of the "contributions" to the sampling error of the composite index of each of these individual variance and covariance terms. I want to do this to examine how both dispersion in responses to different questions and co-variation in responses to different questions (a) vary with economic conditions and (b) affect uncertainty in the composite index. Does this question make sense? If so, do you have any ideas or suggestions?
