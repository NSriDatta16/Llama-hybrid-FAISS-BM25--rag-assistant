How to determine the number of convolutional operators in CNN?

In computer vision task, such as object classification, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the network provides an appealing performance. But I'm not sure how to set up the parameters in convolutional layers. For example, a grayscale image ( 480x480 ), the first convolutional layer may use a convolutional operator like 11x11x10 , where the number 10 means the number of convolutional operators. The question is how to determine the number of convolutional operators in CNN?
