Drawbacks with Cosine Similarity

I am assessing the similarity between documents represented as vectors of tf-idf values. I know that the cosine similarity is a well-defined and commonly used measure in information retrieval. However I am thinking how to deal with the case where 2 documents are "linearly dependent". Let's consider three documents: $d_1 = [1,1,3,4] $ $d_2 = [1,1,2,4] $ $d_3 = [10,10,30,40] $ At first sight, $d_1$ and $d_2$ should be more similar than $d_1$ and $d_3$. However, using the cosine similarity: import numpy as np def cos_sim(d1,d2): return np.dot(d1,d2)/ (np.sqrt(np.dot(d1,d1))* np.sqrt(np.dot(d2,d2))) I got: cos_sim(d1,d2) = 0.98473192783466179 cos_sim(d1,d3) = 1.0 How should we deal with this case?
