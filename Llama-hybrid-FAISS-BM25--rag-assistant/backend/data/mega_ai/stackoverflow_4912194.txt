Most likely test.png is not in the classpath of your application. Assuming it is a jar , the image may be in a subfolder, say, image , in which case, you would need to specify the following ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon("image/test.png"); If this is not the case, please edit the question and specify the layout of the jar - how the contents, especially the images are organized therein.
