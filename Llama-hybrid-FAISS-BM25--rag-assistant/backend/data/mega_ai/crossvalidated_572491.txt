I think the example you picked is not going to serve well to pin down the difference between the bayesian and frequentist approach in regards to hypothesis testing, because hypothesis testing is already done by the researchers to create the information below: (tested negative|is negative)=0.95 (tested positive|is negative)=0.05 (tested negative|is positive)=0.40 (tested positive|is positive)=0.60 When you have this model of the world - a probability distribution that applies to a population-, regardless of a frequentist or bayesian approach, we can apply the probability theorem and the Bayes' rule, which is a fundamental mathematical fact. There is no need to do hypothesis testing because you already have the model at hand. I would recommend to look at A/B testing with proportions - a hypothesis test to come up with probabilities for 2 groups and decide whether the difference for these proportions is significant enough to use it as a model -. It should be relatively easy to find hands-on examples from both schools of thought. I hope this helps.
