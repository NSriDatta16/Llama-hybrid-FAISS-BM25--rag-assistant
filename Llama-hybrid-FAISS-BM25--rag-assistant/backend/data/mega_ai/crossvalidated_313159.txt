After a lot of research and thought, I've concluded that in some cases, you just can't determine the answer to this question. Suppose you discover a new species of tortoise on an island, and you want to estimate their average lifespan. You can't really know whether the sample group you're looking at is representative of their typical total lifespan unless you are able to outlive all tortoises. Even if you tag them all and find that 50% are dead when you return the island 5 years later, you can't tell if there is a small cohort that lives exceptionally long, skewing the average. The only way to know for sure is to outlive them all. What I found in my case is that I could plot the average lifespan of all subscriptions up to various historical years, and see that the average was increasing linearly over time, probably due to this cohort of loyal customers. It was not exponential or asymptotic; there was no curve that flattened out that I could easily project to a maximum or minimum value. Of course, it's possible there really is a curve, but we just don’t see it yet; maybe we need another 20 years of data! (Now, if there was more of a curve to the slope as it went on far into the future, we might find that it approaches an asymptote. We could use curve fitting to determine the function and predict the future average subscription length. But of course, there could be huge effects in the future that would alter it, such as the business becoming uncompetitive, the economy declining, or whatever.) Either way, if we want to make a projection of subscription lifespan, and expected revenue, we have to limit the projection by asking, “How far in the future should we project?” In my case, I was able to do that for 10 years in the future, and base my projections on that. I could say, "10 years from now, the average length of all subscriptions will be X, and therefore if we acquire a new subscription now, we can expect that it will live on average X years (plus some bias toward recent averages.)"
