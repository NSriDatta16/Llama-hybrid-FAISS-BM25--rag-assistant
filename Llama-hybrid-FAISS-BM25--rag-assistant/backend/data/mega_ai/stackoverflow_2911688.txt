(ListenPartCount * (ListenFullCount ^ 2)) + (AverageTotalListenTime * ListenPartTimeAverage) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ((AverageTotalListenTime - ListenPartTimeAverage) + 0.0001f) This formula will produce an nice result, since user could really like just part of song, this should be seen in the score, also if user likes full song then weight should be doubled. You can tweak this folmula in various ways, f.ex include user tree of listening, f.ex if user listens one song and after that he listens another song few times, etc.
