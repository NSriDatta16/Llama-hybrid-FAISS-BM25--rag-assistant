PCA and scree plot and slope

This may be really a simple question. I know that if there are correlated variables, they may not be good to use for modeling. We have to use the PCA such that each PC is orthogonal to one meaning every PC is independent of one another. If you have 4 variables, then you will have 4 PC at maximum. You have to determine by looking at the scree plot to see how many PC you should be using to maximize the variance while minimizing the number of PC you are going to use. My question is I know that the variance for PC1 is far greater than the variance for PC3, for example. But, why is the variance for PC1 greater than PC2? Is there any good explanation?
