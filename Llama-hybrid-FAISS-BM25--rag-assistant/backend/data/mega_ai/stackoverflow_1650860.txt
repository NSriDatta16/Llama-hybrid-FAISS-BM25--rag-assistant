It sounds like what you're asking for is a type of spacial index . For a very large 2d game I'd recommend using a quadtree . Quadtree works well when you have a large area and activity tends to happen in localized regions of the area, which is the case for most RPG-type games. It will keep your storage requirements low and hopefully speed up collision detection as well. As for saving the game, things like player and monster stats can go into a database, if you're worried about those changing often. For the actual level layout I'd recommend using a binary file format specific to your game. There's not many database-type queries you usually need to perform on the level layout and you can make great optimizations using your own format. I wouldn't know how to begin storing a quadtree-like format in a database (although I'm sure its possible).
