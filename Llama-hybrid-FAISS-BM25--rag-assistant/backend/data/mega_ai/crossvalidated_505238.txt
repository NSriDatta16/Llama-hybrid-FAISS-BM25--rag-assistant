$c$ is an intercept , like the analogous parameter in Ordinary Least Squares regression. Note how the example time series at your links oscillate around $c=20$ . Without this intercept, they would oscillate around zero. The auto.arima() function in the forecast package will assume you want to fit a model with such an intercept if you don't tell it otherwise (other ARIMA fitting methods may not assume this, be careful).
