Here's from my ~/.Rprofile , designed for Mac and Linux. These make errors easier to see. options(showWarnCalls=T, showErrorCalls=T) I hate the CRAN menu choice, so set to a good one. options(repos=c("http://cran.cnr.Berkeley.edu","http://cran.stat.ucla.edu")) More history! Sys.setenv(R_HISTSIZE='100000') The following is for running on Mac OSX from the terminal (which I greatly prefer to R.app because it's more stable, and you can organize your work by directory; also make sure to get a good ~/.inputrc ). By default, you get an X11 display, which doesn't look as nice; this instead gives a quartz display same as the GUI. The if statement is supposed to catch the case when you're running R from the terminal on Mac. f = pipe("uname") if (.Platform$GUI == "X11" && readLines(f)=="Darwin") { # http://www.rforge.net/CarbonEL/ library("grDevices") library("CarbonEL") options(device='quartz') Sys.unsetenv("DISPLAY") } close(f); rm(f) And preload a few libraries, library(plyr) library(stringr) library(RColorBrewer) if (file.exists("~/util.r")) { source("~/util.r") } where util.r is a random bag of stuff I use, under flux. Also, since other people were mentioning console width, here's how I do it. if ( (numcol /dev/null") == 0) { # mac specific? probably bad in the R GUI too. numcol = as.integer(sub(".* ([0-9]+) column.*", "\\1", system("stty -a", intern=T)[1])) if (numcol > 0) options(width= numcol - 1 ) } rm(numcol) This actually isn't in .Rprofile because you have to re-run it every time you resize the terminal window. I have it in util.r then I just source it as necessary.
