Poor anti-aliasing of text drawn on Canvas

I'm drawing text on Canvas, and am disappointed with the quality of antialiasing. As far as I've been able to determine, browsers don't do subpixel antialising of text on Canvas. Is this accurate? This is particularly noticeable on iPhone and Android, where the resulting text isn't as crisp as text rendered by other DOM elements. Any suggestions for high quality text out put on Canvas?
