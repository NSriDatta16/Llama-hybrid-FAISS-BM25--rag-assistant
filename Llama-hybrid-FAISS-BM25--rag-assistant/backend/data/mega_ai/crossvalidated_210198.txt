Applying filters learned from convolutional neural networks

I have a neural network that I trained on 32 * 32 px size images. Can I use these filters learned from the network on larger images not used in training the network such as a 600 * 800 px image? Or does it not make any sense to apply filters that were learned on smaller images on larger images and vice versa? Here is an example of some images: An image from training set Here is a random image that I got online to test Here is when I applied the filter(s)
