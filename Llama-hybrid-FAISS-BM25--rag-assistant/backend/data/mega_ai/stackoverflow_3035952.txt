So what are the advantages of C# way? Encapsulation for one. It makes it more difficult to mess up your iteration limits if you do not set the iteration sequence manually. C++ example: std::vector a; std::vector b; std::vector ::iterator ba = a.begin(); std::vector ::iterator ea = a.end(); std::vector ::iterator bb = b.begin(); std::vector ::iterator eb = b.end(); // lots of code here for(auto itr = ba; itr != eb; itr++) // iterator tries to "cross" vectors // you get undefined behavior, depending // on what you do with itr Which approach is more powerful (which leads to more elegant functions based on iterators). That depends on what you mean by most powerful. The C++ approach is more flexible. The C# one is more difficult to misuse.
