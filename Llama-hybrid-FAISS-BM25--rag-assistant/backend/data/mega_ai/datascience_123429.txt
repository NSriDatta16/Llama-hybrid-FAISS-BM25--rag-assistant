In my opinion, Document Classification could be a good approach, but I think it's vague. There are much better options now. One approach you can think of is that, create a vector database of all your documents, which will have all the data that you will need in the future. And then you can do topic modeling on it to get the information you need. The catch here is that, you will get vectors of all the text data, but to get vectors for the images, you need to get embeddings of those separately and append them with the database. One way to handle this is to use OCR on it and tune your OCR and post-process it add it with the text of the pdf. Caution: This might be a good approach only if you need to extract more information than numbers only. If you are only interested in handwritten numbers then I will suggest you to start with OCR first, tune the OCR as much as possible to fulfill your demands and then post process the outputs.
