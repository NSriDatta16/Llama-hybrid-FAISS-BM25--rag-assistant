Generally, reinforcement learning is what you're looking for, though most reinforcement learning implementations focus on perfect information games (e.g. pong), not imperfect information games (e.g. poker). A deep reinforcement learning algorithm has recently achieved super-human play in full-scale Limit Hold'em. Of the machine learning approaches to AI poker, this is state-of-the-art, though it is still ~5BB/100 hands worse than the best domain-specific expert AI (excluding the AI that effectively solved the game). I suspect we'll see deep reinforcement learning approaches to no-limit start to be competitive with top domain-specific expert AI in the next 5 years.
