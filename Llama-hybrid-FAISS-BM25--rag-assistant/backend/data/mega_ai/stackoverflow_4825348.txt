This simply doesn't make sense. I tried the accepted answer, all the other answers in here, and it didn't work for me. I tried their permutations, and somehow I managed to make it work in IE like so: header("Pragma: public"); header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); header("Cache-Control: public"); header("Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-exce"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=coupons.csv" ); header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary"); header("Content-Length: " . strlen($csv)); echo $csv; die(); One thing I did is to empty the cache every freaking time I test the code. And it still doesn't make sense. Just in case someone might need this desperately ;)
