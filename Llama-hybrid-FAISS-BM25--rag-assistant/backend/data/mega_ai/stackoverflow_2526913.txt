Best approach to managing software versions via code branches?

I would like to customize an off-the-shelf software that has a Lite Edition and an Enterprise Edition. The features are almost the same so that my extended customizations can work for both, but I have to recompile for each version because they have different version assemblies. Can someone help advise me on how maintain this? I am using Visual Studio 2008 and Visual SVN. Should I create 2 completely different solutions, create one solution with duplicate projects, or create branches? Branches seem like the elegant route, but what is the idea? Create a "Lite Version" and "Enterprise Version" from the trunk... with the trunk being the "Lite Version"?
