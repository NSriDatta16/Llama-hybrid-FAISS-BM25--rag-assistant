Slightly different tactic here, but take a look at Apache2::ASP . You can use Devel::Cover and Devel::NYTProf for code-coverage and code-profiling. Example: code-coverage testing with Apache2::ASP Example: code-profiling wih Apache2::ASP Bonus - you can perform unit testing on your web application itself. Disclaimer: I wrote Apache2::ASP.
