Read http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.6/reference/en-US/html_single/#d0e7576 , and find the many-to-one description in paragraph 5.1.7.1. It says : unique (optional): enables the DDL generation of a unique constraint for the foreign-key column. By allowing this to be the target of a property-ref, you can make the association multiplicity one-to-one. This means that it's used by the database schema generation tool of Hibernate to add a unique constraint. If you don't use it, then you must add this constraint yourself.
