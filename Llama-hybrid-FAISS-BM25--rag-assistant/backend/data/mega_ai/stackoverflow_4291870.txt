jQuery draggable and droppable issue

I am having an issue related jQuery draggable and droppable. Here is description something what I want to do. First: I have two divs. One is and another is . "container" has 30 which are draggable and droppable into "selected". Here is code: 1 2 .... 29 30 Second: I want to allow any 10 s from "container" to "selected" div. If someone tries to add 11th , then it must not allow user to it. That is the 11th that is going to be inserted into "selected" must be reverted using jQuery draggable option revert. i.e. $("#container li").draggable({ revert: true }); Here is javascript code for that. $(document).ready(function(){ var total = 0; $("#selected").droppable({ drop: function() { total = $("#selected li").length; //alert(total); if (total >= 10) { $("#container li").draggable({ revert: true }); } else { //$("#container li").draggable({ revert: false }); } } }); }); This is working fine. Third: But when I drag an from "selected" to "container", the "selected" div will have only 9 s. So in this situation, later on user should be able to add another into "selected" div from "container" div. But unfortunately it is not working. All the s I try to drag and drop into "selected" are being reverted due to if (total >= 10 ) condition. Can anyone help me to solve this out? Please...
