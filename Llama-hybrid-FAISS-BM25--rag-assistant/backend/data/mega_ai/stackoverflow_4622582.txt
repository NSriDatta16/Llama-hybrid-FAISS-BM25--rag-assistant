Cocoa Touch - Alternative to viewDidLoad Method

I am creating an app that reads a text file from the web. WHen the app first runs, I want a splash page to be presented with a logo. I have a SplashViewController and a MainController. I am using some code from a tutorial that allows you to add a subview to the MainController's applicationDidFinishLaunching method and replace the main controller's view with the splash screen (follow so far? Trying my best to explain) The issue I am having is that I want the splash screen to be present until the data is loaded from the web and animate an activity indicator. However, I am retrieving the data from within the viewDidLoad method in the MainController and the app starts retrieving the data before the splash screen loads so there is a delay before the user sees anything. Is there another method that I can use to begin the retrieval process after the splash has been displayed?
