Which database to use for storing machine learning data?

I am currently storing my training data into HDF5 files and I want my team and I to switch for a database for two main reasons: the data is not used only by me and the different datasets are stored in different folders at different paths etc so I want to create a single database containing all the data we need to store a lot of metadata like hashes, insertion dates, ground truth (that may differ depending on the application) etc. I don't know which database to use. My first thought would be something like mongodb which is not relational, but I wonder if there are databases specialized in deep learning training out there. I heard of SciDB but I am not sure what to think about it, and I searched for "databases for machine learning" in google scholar without success. That is why I am asking the question here. Thank you in advance for your help.
