Time series forecast using SVM?

I have a pandas data frame like this: (index) 0 sie 0 1997-01-01 11.2 1 1997-01-03 12.3 2 1997-01-04 11.5 ... 12454 2017-02-01 13.2 I would like to use SVM to predict the future values of the sie . How can I implement python code to predict these values? I am doing something like this: model = svm.SVR().fit(df[0],df['sie']) But it is giving me this error: ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples: [1, 12455] Although both df[0] and df['sie'] have same shape of (12455,) Note : I don't have continuous data (some dates, in between, are missing), also values in 0 are datetime.date() objects.
