How to detect MouseLeave on a UIElement that is a Drag source in Silverlight when Dragging?

I have a StackPanel with MouseLeave events. I have run into an issue where MouseLeave events are not occurring for this StackPanel when elements are being dragged from this stack panel to other outside elements. How can I have the MouseLeave event detected when Dragging? Thank you.
