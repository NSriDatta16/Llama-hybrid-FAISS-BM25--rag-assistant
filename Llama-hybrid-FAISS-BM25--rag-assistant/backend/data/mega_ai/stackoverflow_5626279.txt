Multiple Blogs in PyroCMS (or other OpenSource CMS)

I have been looking round for an open-source CMS framework that I can use as the basis for a few web projects. I used to use Joomla, but I found it to be clunky and out-dated, certainly too complicated for the average user that would be faced with it. My current project requires a content-managed website, with all the usual stuff, and on the whole PyroCMS seems well suited to the task. However a core requirement of the project is that it contains four blogs. A general one for news relating to news in the client's field and then one each for the three members of the company. I can't see how to do this as it stands, but I'm sure it must be possible somehow. I'm happy to write a module myself to do it if needs be, but I'm trying to keep the project fairly simple, and I can't be the first person to want to do this! I'd considered a Wordpress network, but a key requirement is that everything is centralised in one administrator panel. In summary - is there any way to maintain several blogs using just PyroCMS and addons? Thanks, Ian
