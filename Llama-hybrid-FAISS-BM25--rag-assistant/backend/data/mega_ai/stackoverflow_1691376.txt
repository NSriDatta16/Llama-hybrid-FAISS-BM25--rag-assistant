One of the most valuable things that a development organization can do (but is rarely done) is to validate the requirements. Mock up a design, as quickly and inexpensively as possible, and review it with the customers. If at all possible, do it in a way that the review can be structured as a task walkthrough, so developers and users together can walk through use cases and decide whether the proposed design solves the problem. Then, if necessary, do it again. There's an excellent book on gathering and understanding requirements called User and Task Analysis for Interface Design by JoAnn Hackos and Janice Redish. It's a big book, but it's very readable and filled with practical tips and tools.
