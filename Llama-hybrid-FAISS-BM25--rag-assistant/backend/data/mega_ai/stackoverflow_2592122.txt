How can I use Math::Business::EMA with DBI to calculate exponential moving averages in Perl?

Script pulls data from mysql: $DBI::result = $db->prepare(qq{ SELECT close FROM $table WHERE day execute(); while($row = $DBI::result->fetchrow) { print "$row\n"; }; with the following example results: 1.560 1.560 1.550... But I need to work out the EMA using Math::Business::EMA ; and I'm not sure how to calculate this while maintaining the accuracy. EMA is weighted and My lack of Perl knowledge is not helping.
