Can a Decision Tree handle a column which is an array or strings?

I have this dataset where one of the columns (features) is an array of delays codes. Sometimes the array has got 1 single code and sometimes up to 5 codes. The codes can appear just once in the array or multiple times. Is there any way to solve this problem? I want to add that I am actually planing to use xgboost, but I ask about decision tree since xgboost is based on decisions trees and I believe the answer can be extrapolated
