From http://www.first.org/conference/2006/papers/seacord-robert-slides.pdf : An integer overflow occurs when an integer is increased beyond its maximum value or decreased beyond its minimum value. Overflows can be signed or unsigned. P.S.: The PDF has detailed explanation on overflows and other integer error conditions, and also how to tackle/avoid them.
