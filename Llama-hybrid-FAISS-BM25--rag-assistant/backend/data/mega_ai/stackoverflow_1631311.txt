Crash when building with Visual Studio 2005 on Windows 7

I ran Visual Studio 2005 on Windows Vista (32-bit). I recently upgraded to Windows 7, and Visual C++ began crashing when building release executables. The actual crash is in mt.exe. I get the message, "mt.exe has stopped working". Is there a way to solve the crash, or do I need to upgrade to Visual Studio 2008?
