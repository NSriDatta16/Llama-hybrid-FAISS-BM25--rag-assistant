Estimating the probability of a sum of events

I have n machines that use the same utility. Each machine randomly demands a unique f_n flow rate of the utility once every h_n hours on average. Each machine's demand event lasts for about m_n minutes. Is there a formulaic method to determine the probability of different possible total flow rates at any time? For example, if I have: n (machine number) f_n (flow) h_n (hours) m_n (minutes) 1 20 1 10 2 25 2 20 3 40 1 5 What is the probability that I will get a flow of 20? What about 85? I've already solved this with brute force in Python. I am looking for a simpler formulaic solution. I really don't even have the vocabulary to ask this question using better terminology. I don't know what, if any, distribution model could be used, for example. Any help is appreciated.
