Unstable p-values in logistic regression

I'm tweaking a logistic regression model in R. The model's been optimized and tested pretty extensively so far. I need to remove one variable for non-statistical reasons ( varH below) but doing so causes another of my p values to jump (for varI ). Because I had been using a 0.05 cutoff, I then go to remove varI - which causes the p value for varA to jump! What's going on here? The below table shows actual p-values for the three models. 0.0000 's are small but not small. mdl1 mdl2 mdl3 varA 0.0074 0.0472 -> 0.0568 0.2532
