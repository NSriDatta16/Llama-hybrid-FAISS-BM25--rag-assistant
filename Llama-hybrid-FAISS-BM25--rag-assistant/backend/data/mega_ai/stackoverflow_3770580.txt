Memory fragmentation is most likely to occur when you allocate and deallocate many objects of varying sizes. Suppose you have the following layout in memory: obj1 (10kb) | obj2(20kb) | obj3(5kb) | unused space (100kb) Now, when obj2 is released, you have 120kb of unused memory, but you cannot allocate a full block of 120kb, because the memory is fragmented. Common techniques to avoid that effect include ring buffers and object pools . In the context of the STL, methods like std::vector::reserve() can help.
