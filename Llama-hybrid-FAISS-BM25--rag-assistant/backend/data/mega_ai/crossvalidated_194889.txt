Different results using Brier score and Logarithmic scoring rule

Let $X_i\sim B(\pi_i), \text{for }i=1,2,\cdots,n$. I have two models and I want to compare which of them forecast better. Model 1: Estimates the parameters with maximum likelihood. Model 2: Estimates the parameters with Bayes. I use the Brier score and the Logarithmic scoring rule for comparison. The results are: >> Model 1: 0.2505 (Brier), 0.6350 (minus log-score) >> Model 2: 0.2544 (Brier), 0.6028 (minus log-score) The smaller the score, the better the model. So, according to Brier Score Model 1 is better, and according to log-score Model 2 is better. I would like to ask, why there is this difference. Also, is there a paper for learning how to compare the forecasting ability of a frequentist model with a Bayesian one?
