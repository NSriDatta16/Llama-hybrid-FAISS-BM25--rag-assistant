We use Jenkins for our builds, but we also store the artifacts from the builds. Like Eric said above, Hudson/Jenkins store artficats using flat file storage. It is organized based on the build. Some things I have noticed from use (in reponse to Eric's questions about an alternative to souce control for binaries): Each build stores it's own artifact, so you do have a versioning of sorts. You can use the fingerprinting option when archiving. This will allow you to differentiate between versions and also check for corruption. Retention periods are completely up to you. We keep artifacts forever. FYI, our projects are not Java either (they are C/C++) and our artifacts are tar.gz/zip files and documents. It may or may not be the best way to store binaries, but it is definitely decent as long as you have regular backups (weekly in our case) and your disk is fault tolerant.
