Manual Interpretation of SARIMA Coefficients (Possible Without Pie/Psi Weights?)

I am struggling to render the output of a SARIMA model into an intelligible linear expression that I can use to make projections manually. I encountered this answer on CrossValidated, but I am not well-versed in psi/pie weights, and am hoping to avoid the need to calculate them. This sample code makes me think that I can apply the coefficient estimates for the AR terms to the lagged values of the time series, and apply the coefficient estimates for the MA terms to the error terms. I have attempted to do this manually, but have not yet been able to match the output of StatsModels predict() function. The model specification is SARIMAX(2, 1, 1)x(2, 0, [1, 2], 24), and the coefficient estimates I've estimated are as follows: The linear expression that I've tried thus far is below: Conceptually, I'm applying the AR coefficient to the appropriate time step, and then in the event that there is a MA term, I'm scaling the error term from the AR model by the MA coefficient estimate for that time. It's clear to me that something is off with my understanding regarding how these coefficient estimates are applied. Can anyone please clarify in simple terms? Thank you for your assistance.
