I recently made something similar as a filter. I use it to color the "headers" in a tail with multiple files, like this: tail -f access.log error.log foo.log | logcol.sh The headers look like this: ==> access.log I got confused by the quick changes between the different logfiles, so this logcol.sh helps. The ==> is hardcoded for the specific usage but could be a parameter as well. #!/bin/sh while read line do if test `expr "$line" : "==>.*"` -eq 0 ; then printf '\033[0m%s\n' "$line" else printf '\033[0;31m%s\n' "$line" fi done Maybe not the most elegant but I think it's quite readable. I hope I don't have any typos ;-) HTH, rob
