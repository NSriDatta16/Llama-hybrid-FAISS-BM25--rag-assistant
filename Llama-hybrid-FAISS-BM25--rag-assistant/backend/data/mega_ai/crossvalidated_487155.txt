For point effects , the shaded blue area shows pointwise 95% credible intervals, while the summary table reports the 95% credible interval for the average effect (mean over the whole post-intervention period). The interval reported in the table is therefore expected to be narrower than the intervals in the plot. For cumulative effects , the table reports the 95% credible interval at the end of the post-intervention period, therefore it agrees with the width of the blue credible interval to the right.
