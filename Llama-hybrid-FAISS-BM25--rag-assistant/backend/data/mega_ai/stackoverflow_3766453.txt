Eclipse PDE Build: how to organize plugins and features with the "fetch" step skipped?

I'm building my Eclipse plugin by means of Eclipse PDE build, i e I've defined all the required targets in "custom.xml" But I do not want to fetch my plugins from a repository, so I'm skipping this step. However, all plugins have to be located under plugins directory, and all the features have to be located under features folder accordingly. This is actually done with map files but I've skipped the step. So, I'm copying my elements as follows: That works perfect! The only thing I do not like is that in "allElements" target I have to specify the set of all plugins and features I have. And I do this only for the goal of copying. Specifying in the elements only one 'main' feature is enough for the rest of the build process. So, my question is: how to specify only one 'main' feature without need of specifying the rest set of plugins (which are already listed within this feature) to prepare the Eclipse build process? Or, it is possible to start the build without that copying? Probably, specify map files somehow? Thanks in advance!
