MOSS - Programmatically set SpecialPermissions

I have a MOSS workflow where on the first form, the user can choose a colleague to evaluate him. Say user A selects user B. After the form is submitted, a new task is created for user B to evaluate user's A. My problem is that I need to make sure the task is only accessible to user A, and not to user B, nor any other user in the system. I tried setting the SpecialPermissions property, but the property can be binded when the workflow is instantiated, so I still don't know what user will be choosen by user A (in this case user B), and then can't set the permissions. I also tried changing the SpecialPermissions property on the MethodInvoking method, but MOSS won't pay attention to the new permissions. What is the proper way to set permissions on a workflow task?
