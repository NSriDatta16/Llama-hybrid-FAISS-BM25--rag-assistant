I don't recommend the approach that is given in the answers above. Instead, look at the " DragNDropOutlineView " example in Leopard and higher. That, and the release notes, give a proper way to implement contextual menus for a single row, or multiple rows. This includes having AppKit automatically do the proper highlighting. corbin dunn (NSTableView Software Engineer)
