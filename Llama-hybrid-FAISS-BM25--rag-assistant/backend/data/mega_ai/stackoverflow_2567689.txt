I would create a class that manage my curl session. Setting a user agent, cookies, server to connect to etc. Also I would make that class to be able to save the page I get from the internet to a file temp/web.htm and then I would use something like: htmlwin->LoadPage("temp/web.htm"); Where htmlwin is a wxHtmlWindow This is the first thing that comes in my mind, maybe I can think to a better solution. EDIT 1: See this link so see a little example of wrapping curl in a C++ class
