One of the main reasons to stick to the standard c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ directory for placing your applications is Windows has set up the permissions properly on this directory to propagate to subdirectories for web applications. I would recommend sticking with this standard so you have a logical central point for your various sites/applications. It's really just organized. Now I won't deny that you can set up additional root directories, and sometimes this is needed at various client/customer sites if you have separate hard drives for particular sites, etc. Here's a link regarding setting up root directories for .net: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ha2y9493.aspx
