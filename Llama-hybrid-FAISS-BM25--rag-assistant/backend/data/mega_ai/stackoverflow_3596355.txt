You definitely want to provide the item's ID. Bear in mind that your application may be tombstoned , so the object may not even be in memory any more when you try to navigate to that page. You need to be able to restore the application to the page with no information other than the URL and whatever's been serialized to temporary or permanent storage (typically in OnNavigateFrom ). Using GetHashCode() for this not only doesn't guarantee uniqueness, but it's highly unlikely to work in terms of the newly restored application, too. Life gets a lot harder when you're trying to display the details of something where you haven't really got an ID... but it doesn't sound like you're really in that position. As it looks like you've got an ID, use it as an ID. Why would you want to use anything else? If you don't have an ID but can easily add one, do so. You want a way of uniquely identifying an object... that's exactly what an ID is for.
