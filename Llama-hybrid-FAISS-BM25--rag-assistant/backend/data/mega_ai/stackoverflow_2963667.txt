In SpecFlow 1.3 there are three methods: static members ScenarioContext ContextInjection Comments: static members are very pragmatic and in this case not so evil as we as developers might first think (there is no threading or need for mocking/replacing in step-definitions) See answer from @Si Keep in this thread If the constructor of a step definition class needs arguments, Specflow tries to inject these arguments. This can be used to inject the same context into several step-definitions. See an example here: https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow/en/latest/Bindings/Context-Injection.html
