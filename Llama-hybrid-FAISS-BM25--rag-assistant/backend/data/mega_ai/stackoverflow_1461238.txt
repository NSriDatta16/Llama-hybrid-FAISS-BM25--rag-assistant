In response to a similar question on passing non-objects to a method in performSelectorOnMainThread: , I pointed out Dave Dribin's category on NSObject , which lets you do something like the following: [[person dd_invokeOnMainThread] doSomethingWithThing1:thing1 andThing2:thing2 andAlsoThing3:thing3]; for performing your multi-argument method on the main thread. I think this is a pretty elegant solution. Behind the scenes, he wraps things in an NSInvocation, invoking that on the main thread. The Amber framework does something similar to this, as well.
