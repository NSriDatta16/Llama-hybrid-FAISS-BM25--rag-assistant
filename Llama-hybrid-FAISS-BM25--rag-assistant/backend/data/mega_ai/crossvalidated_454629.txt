Overspecification Bayesian mixed linear model

I am trying to estimate a mixed linear regression model with an individual intercept using JAGS in a Bayesian way. Therefore, I simulate data as presented and estimate the model. The code is adjusted to several examples I found in different tutorials. Nevertheless, it does not seem right to me regarding the results showing clear signs of biased estimation. Therefore I am wondering, if I am doing something wrong here or if there are other problems I am not aware of, e.g., overspecification, prior choice, etc. Is someone familiar with this type of problem and can help me? Here is my example code: #fixed effects beta Especially the estimation of the random effects variance and its impact on the fixed intercept seem wrong to me.
