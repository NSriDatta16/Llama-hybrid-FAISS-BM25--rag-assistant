I would generally include those, it's hard to say why you want to do it in your case because we don't know any specifics about the context. One example that that comes to mind: If you are trying to inspect the effect of $x_1$ on $y$ you have to take into account that you may not be including some "unobserved" effects that cause massive disturbances in your model, these might cause the estimation of the effect of $x_1$ to be wrong. Let's say that: $x_1$ is years of education of the subject $y$ how happy a person Every two years there are elections causing massive happiness spikes in the general population In this case, you would want to include a dummy $ELECTION$ to catch the spike effect that would otherwise overshadow your analysis of the pure effect of $x_1$ (essentially controlling for it). Problematically, you don't know the value of $ELECTION$ because it's unobserved. Including year might allow you to catch the spike anyway even though you didn't even know $ELECTION$ was a problem in the first place :). So if you say you don't think it's a time series, the question really is whether there might have been some things that could have disturbed the y-value anyway throughout time.
