What kind of OOP structures work well in an application that has many different modes?

What can I do to structure my application so the code stays manageable as it gets bigger? I am building an application that will be in a certain state which will change depending on how the user interacts with it, and there will be many different states the application can be in. I've tried looking for tutorials/resources, but what I find only covers an application with a couple of modes, whereas mine will have lots of different behaviors. For instance, you can click on object type A or B, so there can be a different behavior for each. If you hold the mouse down and try to drag one, they will behave differently too. But if you weren't holding your mouse down, that means it's not a drag. It's knowing what mode to move into when X event happens while you're in Y state that has me confused because I don't want to have a massive switch statement that handles everything.
