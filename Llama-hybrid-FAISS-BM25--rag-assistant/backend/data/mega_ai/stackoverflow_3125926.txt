Does NLTK have a tool for dependency parsing?

I'm building a NLP application and have been using the Stanford Parser for most of my parsing work, but I would like to start using Python. So far, NLTK seems like the best bet, but I cannot figure out how to parse grammatical dependencies. I.e. this is an example from the Stanford Parser. I want to be able to produce this in NTLK using Python from the original sentence "I am switching to Python.": nsubj(switching-3, I-1) aux(switching-3, am-2) prep_to(switching-3, Python-5) Can anyone give me a shove in the right direction to parse grammatical dependencies?
