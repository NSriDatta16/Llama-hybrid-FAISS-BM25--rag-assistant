An ANOVA compares the variances within each group (here, within each month) to the variances across groups. You just need more than one data point in each group (and more than one group) to estimate these comparisons. Beyond that, the $n$s don't have to be equal, though your test will be more powerful if the groups are nearly the same size. The problem here is actually how you're assembling the data frame. Imagine that the frame is a table. Each argument to data.frame adds a row to the table. Your command creates a data frame that looks like $$\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} & \text{July} & \text{October} & \text{January} &\text{April}\\ \hline \text{ 1} & 1.28 & 1.83 & 1.72 & 1.32 \\ \hline \text{ 2} & 1.35 & 1.62 & 1.91 & 1.40\\ \hline \text{ 3} & 1.19 & 1.78 & 1.68 & 1.22\\ \hline \text{ 4} & 1.43 & 1.49 & 1.83 & 1.28\\ \hline \text{ 5} & & 1.55 \\ \hline \end{array}$$ You might organize the data like this in a spreadsheet, but it is the wrong format for R. Each argument to data.frame needs to be the same length, so you would need to pad the shorter vectors out with NA s. However, that's still not quite right, since you typically want to arrange the data in "long" form, like this $$ \begin{array}{c|c|c} & \text{Month} & \text{Outcome} \\ \hline \text{1} & \text{July} & 1.28 \\ \hline \text{2} & \text{July} & 1.35 \\ \hline \text{3} & \text{July} & 1.19 \\ \hline \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\ \hline \text{17} & \text{April} &1.28 \\ \hline \end{array} $$ This arranges the data in a way that matches the structure of your question ("Does the outcome vary with month?"): you have one dependent variable (the outcome) and one factor (the month). To build this, you call data.frame(month, outcome) , where outcome[i] contains the outcome for the month in month[i] . Now, you can easily describe the relationship between these variables for (e.g.) aov by doing something like aov(outcome ~ month, data=mydataframe) . If you have more questions on the ANOVA itself, feel free to ask here. You'll have better luck with R syntax questions on stackoverflow, where they're more on topic.
