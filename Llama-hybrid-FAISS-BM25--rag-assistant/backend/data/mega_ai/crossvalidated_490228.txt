Machine learning and time series

I am an undergraduate student currently taking a times series analysis course this term. The course only covers statistical models, then I have two questions: Do people use machine learning methods to forecast stock price movement? Do we have to make statistical assumption to forecast time series? I know these questions are probably dumb and arrogant since I am new to this field. I googled very briefly, then I made a summary: Time series machine learning does not make any statistical assumption at all People use machine learning to forecast stock price movement, but not as much as using statistical models Statistical models are not better than machine learning methods in terms of accuracy Is my summary correct?
