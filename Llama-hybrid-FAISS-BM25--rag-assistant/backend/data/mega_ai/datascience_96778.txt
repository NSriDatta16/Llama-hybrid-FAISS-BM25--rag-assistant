Estimate best vector in one vocabulary based on input from another vocabulary

I have strings from two sources lets call them two different vocabularies maybe and I have an association defined between vectors of strings in vocab1 to vectors of strings in vocab2. vector_from_vocab_1 -> vector_from_vocab_2 and I have so many such rows in my input data. The lengths of vectors in either vocab1 or vocab2 in each row are not fixed. What machine learning algorithm can I use to estimate the vector from vocabulary 2 given a "new" vector from vocabulary 1? The input data type is all strings. It may sound like natural language translation. But the vocabularies are not related to any spoken language.
