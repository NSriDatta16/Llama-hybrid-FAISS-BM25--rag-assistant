With a sufficiently complex (or you might say overly complex or perhaps "very flexible" - think neural network) model, if you iterate long enough, you will overfit. If you are using an insufficiently complex model, then you can iterate until the cost function no longer changes (for a standard logistic regression with a suitable loss function that's simply the maximum likelihood estimate) and will not overfit. Overly complex is of course always relative to how much data you have. I.e. with lots of data it tends to be relatively harder to overfit than with less data for a given model. Many logistic regression models will tend to be in the less complex bucket, but you people do also use logistic regression models with so many parameters that they are bound to overfit for a given dataset.
