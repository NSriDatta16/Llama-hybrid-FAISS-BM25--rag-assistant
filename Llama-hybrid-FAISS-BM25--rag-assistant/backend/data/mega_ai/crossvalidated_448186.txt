users and licences

I have the following question: Suppose I have a product with $U$ users and $S$ seats (licences). Where $S . A user may only use the given product if there are seats available, and during the using of the product the user will occupy one seat. I have the following statistics on usage: The average usage time per session (per a user occupying one seat continuously), the average number of sessions per day. I'm interested in knowing what are the odds of a user being denied a seat after requesting one. Also, I'd like to know the 'utilization' of the licences. In effect, what proportion of time are the licences unoccupied. Thank you very much.
