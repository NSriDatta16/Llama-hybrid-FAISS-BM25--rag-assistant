Interpretation of BayesFactor BF01 for two sample t-test correct?

I want to test a nullinterval with bayes. So the hypothesis I have is on the absence of an effect. Group 1 and 2 do not differ in their mean (at least not beyond an effect size of $\delta > 0.2$ ). However I am very unsure if my rural understanding of Bayesian Analasis brought me to the correct interpretation of my results. I followed the instructions proided in the vignette for the R package BayesFactor available here and also in this nice guide . However I am not sure if I am interpreting the resulting Bayes Factor correctly? Here is some Simlulation Data # Loading Packages pacman::p_load(report, BayesFactor, tidyverse, see) set.seed(333) n1 And here the nullinterval bayes t-test bfInterval Is my understanding now correct that the variable bfinterval no contains two bayes factors? One for the null-interval $|\delta| compared to the null-point and One for the complement $|\delta| > 0.2 $ of the null-interval to the null-point And the complement (that there would be an effect > 0.2) is more likely, because BF $BF_1 = 0.18$ is farther away from 1, than the BF BF $BF_0 = 0.96$ for the null-interval? Would that be correct? > bfInterval Bayes factor analysis -------------- [1] Alt., r=0.707 -0.2 Now if I want to know, if, given my data, the hypothesis that there is no effect $|\delta| is more likely than the complement (there is an effect, $|\delta| > 0.2 $ ) I can just divide the two BF since they have the same denominator correct? > bfInterval[1] / bfInterval[2] Bayes factor analysis -------------- [1] Alt., r=0.707 -0.2 So this ( $BF_{01} = 5.2$ ) would now mean, given my data, it is ~5 times more likely that there is no effect (bigger than 0.2) than that there is one, correct? Also, beyond my insecurities in the interpretation I would like to know if the floor effect in the observed data could be problematic?
