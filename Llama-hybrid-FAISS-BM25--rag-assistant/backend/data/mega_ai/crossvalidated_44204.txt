Does anyone know any good open source software for visualizing data from database?

Recently I came across Tableau and tried to visualize the data from database and csv file. The user iterface enables the user to visualize time and spatial data and create plots in an instant. Such tool is really useful as it enables to observe the data graphically without writing the code. As there are many data sources from which I have to retrieve and visualize the data it would be very useful to have a tool which enabled to generate charts by simply dragging columns on axes and additionally modify the visualization with dragging the column names as well. Does anyone know any free or open source software of that kind?
