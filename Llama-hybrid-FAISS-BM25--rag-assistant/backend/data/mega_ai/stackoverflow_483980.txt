getting a property of a java bean of unknown class

I'd like to be able to call "getProgram" on objects which have that method, without knowing which class they belong to. I know I should use an interface here, but I'm working with someone else's code and can't redesign the classes I'm working with. I thought BeanUtils.getProperty might help me, but it seems it only returns strings. Is there something like Beanutils.getProperty that will return a cast-able object? Or another, smarter way to work with two similar classes that don't share an interface? thanks, -Morgan
