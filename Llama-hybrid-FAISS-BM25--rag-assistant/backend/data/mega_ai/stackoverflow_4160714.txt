Has anyone else noticed this? Yes, also for AudioServicesPlaySystemSound. It happens on my iPod touch 4G, but not my iPhone 3G. Both also running iOS4.1. I've no idea what's happening, but I'll offer a bounty try to get some helpful uberguru's attention. If not, 1 infinite loop it is. Update: apparently the problem also happens with AVAudioPlayer on the iPod 4th Gen - see https://devforums.apple.com/message/333169 It looks like it might be a bug. We'll see...
