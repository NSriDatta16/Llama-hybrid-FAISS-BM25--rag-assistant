IIS6 throws error for jquery

on my master page, I have referenced jquery file. I am doing simple hover function. When mouse hover, I change the css and when hover out, change the css back to originial. Nothing fancy. but my page throws jquery error when I run in IIS6 on server 2003. When I run on IIS5.1 on local xp machine, it works perfectly fine. Any idea? I access both pages from my machine so IE settings is not the problem. I opened the both js file and the error line is nothing but the end of the file ( i.e last line of the js file) Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; OfficeLiveConnector.1.4; OfficeLivePatch.1.3) Timestamp: Mon, 5 Apr 2010 21:59:18 UTC Message: Syntax error Line: 4377 Char: 2 Code: 0 URI: server-test/myapplication/Scripts/jquery-1.3.2.js (removed the link because stackoverflow does not allow me to put more than one link) Message: Syntax error Line: 6183 Char: 2 Code: 0 URI: server-test/myapplication/Scripts/jquery-1.3.2-vsdoc.js (removed the link because stackoverflow does not allow me to put more than one link) Message: Object expected Line: 189 Char: 9 Code: 0 URI: http://server-test/myapplication/
