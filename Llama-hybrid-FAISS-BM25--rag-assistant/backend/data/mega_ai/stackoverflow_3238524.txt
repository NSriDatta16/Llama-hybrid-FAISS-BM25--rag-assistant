User control inside update panel causing full page postback

I have a user control with linkbuttons (used for paging) and a repeater inside an update panel. The paging works correctly, but is causing a full page postback every time I click through to the next page. The update panel looks like this: Organization State Accredited Since And the contents of the user control look like this: Previous | Next &nbsp;&nbsp; results returned. So far, I have tried adding an async postback trigger for the user control, which does cause an async postback but does not update the rest of the text in the update panel. In otherwords, the async postback occurs and the next page shows up, but the original text in the repeater is there as well just below it. I have also confirmed that I have IDS set on my linkbuttons, since that can trigger a full postback inside an update panel. I have tried changing the update panel mode (Always, Conditional, ChildrenAsTriggers, etc.). None of it makes a difference - the only thing that actually causes an async postback is to use the trigger, but then the rest of the content in the update panel is not updated, so I get duplicate content. Any ideas?
