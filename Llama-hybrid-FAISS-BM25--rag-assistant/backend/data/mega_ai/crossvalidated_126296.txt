Successful applications of deep learning apart from image classification and NLP

Are there any successful applications of deep learning apart from image classification and NLP? I am aware of the winning approach of the Merck challenge on Kaggle only. However, I could not find more details on their approach. I am interested in a wider application of deep learning - preferably with open source code or at least a published paper.
