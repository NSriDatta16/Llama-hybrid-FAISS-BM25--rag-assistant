Magento grouped product options

I want to show a set of products as a table inside one product with these attributes. Dimensions Width x Gusset x Height Code Price/Case Bags/Case Weight So i chosen grouped product option but it does not match the requirement. How can i design a table like format from the grouped product option with radio button to choose only one product from it. So using grouped product or configurable product or by any way how can i achieve this. Here am attaching the screen-shot which i actually wanted
