I've widened my code out to 100 characters which fits comfortably in less than half my screen on my Macbook. 120 characters is probably the limit before lines start to get too long and complex. You don't want to get too wide else you encourage compound statements and deeply nested control structures. The right margin is nature's way of telling you to perform an extra method refactoring .
