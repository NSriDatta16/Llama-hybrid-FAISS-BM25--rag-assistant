I believe what you want to do is perform data imputation. Here is a good quick (16 pages) pdf on imputation from Columbia . Generally if you have a large enough set of data and your NAs/NANs account for ~10% of your data, you can simply remove the affected rows. If removing data will not work for you then you should look into imputation. Simple approaches include taking the average of the column and use that value, or if there is a heavy skew the median might be better. A better approach, you can perform regression or nearest neighbor imputation on the column to predict the missing values. Then continue on with your analysis/model. Another approach would be to build a RandomForest classifier. RandomForest models can neutrally deal with missing data by ignoring them when deciding splits. Berkeley has a good write up on RandomForests . If you choose to go down this road there is also a good paper discussing NAs in tree based models: An Investigation of Missing Data Methods for Classification Trees Applied to Binary Response Data by Ding and Simonoff. If you are using python, the Scipy library has an interpolation function which produces data points from within a range of known discrete data points. This is another way to fill in missing data. Hope this helps!
