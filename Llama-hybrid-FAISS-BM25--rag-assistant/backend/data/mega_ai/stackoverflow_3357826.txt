What is the Algorithm for an ORM?

I've been digging around for an ORM to use in a php/mysql application. However none quite grab my attention past "hello world" tests. So, I decided to do some research and try to code my own custom ORM. However I haven't been able to find resources that explain at code level how to handle db relationships. The concept of how an ORM works is clear but when trying to lay it out in code I don't know what the best approach is. Is it best to build several small queries or to build one complex query for every posible scenario? Any insight into the algorithm or architecture of an ORM is welcome!
