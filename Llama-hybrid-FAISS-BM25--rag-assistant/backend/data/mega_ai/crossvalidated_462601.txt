Time Series Modelling problems resources

I've read a portion of "Time Series Analysis and Forecasting" by Brockwell and Davis and I feel like I've gained some theoretical background and intuition. I'm planning on applying for positions where there's supposed to be some Time Series modelling interview problem. Unfortunately I feel like my theoretical experience with the subject would not be enough for the matter. I'm looking for some resources with example problems with Time Series modelling and predictions, preferably with example solutions in R. Thanks in advance! Apologies if this has been asked before.
