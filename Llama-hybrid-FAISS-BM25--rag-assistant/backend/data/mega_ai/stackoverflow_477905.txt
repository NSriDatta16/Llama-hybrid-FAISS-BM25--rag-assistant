good question, sorry i can't answer in depth I've been working on object normalization off and on for over 20 years. It's deep and complicated and beautiful, and is the subject of my second planned book, Object Mechanics II. ONF = Object Normal Form, you heard it here first! ;-) since potentially patentable technology lurks within, I am not at liberty to say more, except that normalizing the data is the really easy part ;-) ADDENDUM: change of plans - see https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/84598/object-oriented-normalization
