Change Magento Config to use sockets

my database config has changed so Magento is not able to connect anymore. The connection before worked but now it seems to need a socket config value... The relevant part in my local.xml config looks like this: 1 mysql5 SET NAMES utf8 pdo_mysql Since Magento uses PDO here's my testscript code that is able to connect: $user = 'username'; $pass = 'password'; // PDO Connection try { /* DB CONNECTION */ $pdoMysql = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;unix_socket=/tmp/mysql5.sock;dbname=dbname', $user, $pass); } catch (PDOException $e) { print "Error!: " . $e->getMessage() . " "; die(); } So basically I need to add "unix_socket=/tmp/mysql5.sock;" somewhere... Thx
