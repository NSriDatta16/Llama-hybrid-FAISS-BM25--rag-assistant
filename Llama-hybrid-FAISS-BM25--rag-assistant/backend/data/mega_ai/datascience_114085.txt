Following is an RBM implementation in Tensorflow 2.0. As mentioned on the website: The Restricted Boltzmann Machine is a legacy machine learning model that is no longer used anywhere. This repository is of historical and educational value only. I have updated the code using the TensorFlow 2 to run on modern systems, but I will no longer maintain it. https://github.com/meownoid/tensorflow-rbm
