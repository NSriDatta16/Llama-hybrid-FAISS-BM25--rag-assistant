WPF Animating a Run element to flash

This is kind of a weird problem I am having right now. What I am trying to do is animate a Run element to essentially flash/blink. The parent is a Hyperlink which contains multiple Inlines of type Run and Image. Now I am trying to animate the Foreground color of the element but it does not seem to work. Here is my code for a hyperlink. CallbackHyperLink callbackLink = new CallbackHyperLink(); ToolTipService.SetShowDuration(callbackLink, 3600000); ToolTipService.SetInitialShowDelay(callbackLink, 0); callbackLink.Foreground = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Magenta); // Default text color of the link callbackLink.TextDecorations = null; // Disable the underline until mouse over callbackLink.ToolTip = f.Tooltip; // Set the tooltip string DoubleAnimation opacityAnim = new DoubleAnimation(); opacityAnim.From = 1.0; opacityAnim.To = 0.0; opacityAnim.FillBehavior = FillBehavior.Stop; opacityAnim.Duration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(BlinkDurationOff); opacityAnim.AutoReverse = true; _blinkAnimation.Children.Add(opacityAnim); Storyboard.SetTarget(opacityAnim, callbackLink.Foreground); Storyboard.SetTargetProperty(opacityAnim, new PropertyPath(SolidColorBrush.OpacityProperty)); _blinkAnimation.Stop(); _blinkAnimation.Begin(); So that gets put in a storyboard which get fired. However the foreground is not getting animated and I am not seeing any warnings that im trying to animate something I shouldn't. Anybody have any ideas? Thanks
