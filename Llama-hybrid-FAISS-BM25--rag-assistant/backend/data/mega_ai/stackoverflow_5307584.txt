You need to implement the INotifyPropertyChanged object on your interface. The NotifyPropertyChanged you see there is just a method call that raises the PropertyChanged event. The MSDN page on INotifyPropertyChanged actually has a pretty good sample. Once you implement INotifyPropertyChanged, you'll be able to do this no problem. The sample even has the NotifyPropertyChanged method, same as your solution fragment.
