Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis, by John A. Rice, Third Edition If you are struggling to understand how different things in statistical relate to each other, the "glue" that you are missing is an understanding of mathematical statistics. Rice's textbook provides the theory that justifies most of the statistical tests and methods which are used in introductory statistical courses. For example, it derives the $t$ and $\chi^2$ distributions and describes how they can be used to construct statistical tests. By contrast, most introductory statistical texts list the different distributions and tests but do not derive them. It is a standard textbook in mathematical statistics. It does not assume much in the way of existing knowledge, but it does require some effort to work through the content (particularly if you are not comfortable in maths). There are lots of examples at the end of the chapters. No doubt there are other statistical textbooks of equal quality. My key point is that an understanding of mathematical statistics is the thing required in order to understand statistics at a non-superficial level and it is particularly useful if you come from a machine learning background as the basic logic is very different (i.e., proofs rather than learning by trial and error and bake-offs).
