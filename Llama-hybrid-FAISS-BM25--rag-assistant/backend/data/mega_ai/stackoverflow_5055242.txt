USB debugging issue

I'm having an issue with my phone,it not get detected in eclipse IDE as I turned on the debugging mode (nothing in LogCat also).But it's working fine with USB file transferring (get detected as USB mass storage device) I have re-installed the drivers, restart the machine/phone but no result. adb shell also reports as no device found adb devices also not listing any devices My phone is:- LG GT540 Windows XP SP2
