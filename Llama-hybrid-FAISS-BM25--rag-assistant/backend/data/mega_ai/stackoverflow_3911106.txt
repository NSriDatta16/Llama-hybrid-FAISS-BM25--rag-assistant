In a SQL command-line tool, enter the SQL one phrase at a time and see when the Linux version goes awry. For best results, do the same thing on Windows. Make sure the SQL generated is the same on windows and linux. and you're sure they are referring to exactly the same database, and using the same login? (edit - I re-read and saw I have the same data - Are You Suuuuuure?) and finally, I see this: and ro.organization.id=2 Are you sure the ID is 2 on both systems? You could get lit up by the sequence numbers/autokey IDs being different.
