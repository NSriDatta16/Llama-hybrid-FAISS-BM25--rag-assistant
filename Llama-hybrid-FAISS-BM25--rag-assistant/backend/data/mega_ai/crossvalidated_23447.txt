I think @winwaed's answer sums it up quite well, and I agree. However I would also add that I would say that NLP is part of a specific application area, namely text processing, and hence there is a lot of domain-specific knowledge that is contained within the techniques that are used. For the most part ML techniques are general purpose and can be applied in many different applications, although ML techniques are used in text processing as well, and as winwaed says by NLP practitioners too. I think it's no different to saying "what's the difference between bioinformatics and ML?"
