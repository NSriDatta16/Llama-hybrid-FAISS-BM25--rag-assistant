It's easiest to do the maths in 2-D. Every matrix corresponds to a linear transformation. Linear transformations can be visualised by taking a memorable figure on the plane and seeing how that figure is distorted by the linear transform: (pic: Flanigan & Kazdan ) Eigenvectors are the stay-the-same vectors. They point in the same direction after the transform as they used to. (blue stayed the same, so that direction is an eigenvector of $\tt{shear}$ .) Eigenvalues are how much the stay-the-same vectors grow or shrink. (blue stayed the same size so the eigenvalue would be $\times 1$ .) PCA rotates your axes to "line up" better with your data. (source: weigend.com ) PCA uses the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix to figure out how you should rotate the data. Because rotation is a kind of linear transformation , your new dimensions will be sums of the old ones, like $\langle 1 \rangle = 23\% \cdot [1] + 46\% \cdot [2] + 39\% \cdot [3]$ . The reason people who work with real data are interested in eigenvectors and linear transformations is that in different contexts, "linear" ( $f(a\cdot x+b\cdot y)=a\cdot f(x)+b \cdot f(y)$ ) can cover really interesting stuff. For example think what that property means if $+$ and $\cdot$ are given new meanings, or if $a$ and $b$ come from some interesting field, or $x$ and $y$ from some interesting space. For example : PCA itself is another example, the one most familiar to statisticians. Some of the other answers like Freya's give real-world applications of PCA. $${}$$ $\dagger$ I find it totally surprising that something as simple as "rotation" could do so many things in different areas, like lining up products for a recommender system $\overset{\text{similar how?}}{\longleftarrow\!\!\!-\!\!-\!\!-\!\!-\!\!-\!\!\!\longrightarrow}$ explaining geopolitical conflict. But maybe it's not so surprising if you think about physics, where choosing a better basis (e.g. making the $\mathrm{x}$ axis the direction of motion rather than $42.8\% [\mathrm{x}] \oplus 57.2\% [\mathrm{y}]$ will change inscrutable equations into simple ones).
