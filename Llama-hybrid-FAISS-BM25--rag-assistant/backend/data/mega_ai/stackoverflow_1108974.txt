switch versions of python

Story: One of the app that i have works on python 2.4 and other on 2.6. I tried to do a sym link of python2.4 to python and things started to break loose on ubuntu jaunty. Now i am downloading every dependency of 2.4 and installing it using python2.4 setup.py install. The dependencies seem to be endless. Question1: How will i tell any framework that go and use version so and so pf python like day django to use 2.6 and say mjango to use 2.4? Something like we say use database databasename kinda syntax. Question2: Is there more elegant way to switch between version as my hack of symlinking was a virtual disaster? Question3: Can I download a deb for say hardy and make jaunty believe its for her?
