Maximum likelihood estimation for joint probability function

Background Suppose we want to look examine the viral load from individuals on drug therapy. In the study design, there are two groups. Group one receiving no treatment (or placebo) as the control and group two as the group receiving antiviral treatment. We compare the didferences in average reduction of viral load between the two groups. Thus, let $x_1,...,x_n$ be the control group and $y_1,..., y_n$ be the group on antiviral therapy. In a scenario where there are equal observations of $n$ within each group, we assume the distribution for the control to be $\mathrm{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ and those on the antiviral therapy to be distributed by $N(\mu + \delta, \sigma^2)$ . $\delta$ denotes any additional reduction received from the antiviral treatment whilst $\mu$ denotes the mean reduction in absence of any treatment. The hypotheses proposed are \begin{align} H_{0}: \delta = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad H_{1}:\delta \neq 0 \end{align} Question What is the log-likelihood function $\ell(\mu, \delta, z$ ) if $z = \sigma^2$ and thus determine the MLE for each parameter. Approach Consider the two normal distributions and their probability density functions for $x_i$ (no treatment) and $y_i$ (treatment) with equal variance $\sigma^2 = z$ \begin{align*} f_X(x) &= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \mathrm{exp}\left\{-\frac{\left(x_i - \mu\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{z2\pi}} \mathrm{exp}\left\{-\frac{\left(x_i - \mu\right)^2}{2v}\right\} \\ f_Y(y) &= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \mathrm{exp}\left\{-\frac{\left(y_i - (\mu+\delta)\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{z2\pi}} \mathrm{exp}\left\{-\frac{\left(y_i - (\mu+\delta)\right)^2}{2v}\right\} \end{align*} The joint likelihood function would then be \begin{align*} L(x,y) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n}f_{XY}(x,y) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n}f_X(x) \cdot \prod_{i = 1}^{n} f_Y(y) \end{align*} Taking the log of the likelihood function would result in the following \begin{align} \ell(\mu,\delta,z|\mathbf{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\log f(x_i|\mu,z) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}\log f(y_i|\mu+\delta,z) \end{align} The resulting log-likelihood function would be \begin{align} \ell(\mu,\delta,v|\mathbf{x_i,y_i}) = -\frac{n}{2}\log(2\pi z) - \frac{1}{2z}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\mu)^2 -\frac{n}{2}\log(2\pi z) - \frac{1}{2z}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-(\mu+\delta))^2 \end{align} Help I understand the next step to calculate the MLE to be taking the partial derivative with respect to each parameter $\mu, \delta, z$ . However, I am having problems trouble shooting how to proceed. I am unsure if the approach I have taken to finding the joint likelihood function is correct. Any help would appreciated. Thank you in advance!
