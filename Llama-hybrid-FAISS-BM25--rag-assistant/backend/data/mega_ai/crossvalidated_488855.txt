I would more likely, in an interview context, give an answer of linking a stock's price to the expected performance of a sector. For example, in the case of a pandemic, telecommunications applications would likely benefit. How has a stock in question, within this sector performed relative to the sector average? So, based on one model of how a particular sector would likely benefit under a presumed scenario, followed by a more traditional relative performance statistical analysis at the sector level, I might be comfortable (or at least, the interviewer might feel so) so as to provide a projection of a stock price change within the time frame consistent with the first model. The advantages of this approach are that it logically integrates current macro conditions (importantly for projecting trends) and separately makes quality decisions on stock differentiation within the sector. Good luck on your next interview.
