The average to use should reflect your purpose in averaging. You might be evaluating policies for a particular customer , who has paid late in the past, Perhaps you are considering whether to continue offering them 30-day payment terms, or to insist that they pay cash upfront. You might make that decision based on their unweighted average time to pay in the last year. Or if their extra approvals for payments over $10,000 is an issue, you might average just the payments over that amount. Or you might look at their 75th percentile or maximum payment time instead. By contrast, you might be evaluating your overall needs for cash reserves given that payments are not immediate. In that case, you might take the weighted average of payment times over all invoices, weighted by the invoice amounts. Then you can identify which customers contribute the most to that average using the corresponding weighted average of payment times for each customer.
