Magento Installation Information

I am using Xampp 1.7.0 and the version of Magento I am using is 1.4.2.0 Apart from basic changes in the ini like extension=php_curl.dll extension=php_mcrypt.dll extension=php_mcrypt_filter.dll extension=php_mhash.dll I made 3 other changes First I replaced a file in apache/bin/ I replaced libmysql.dll with a newer version of libmysql.dll In the next step of the installation i used 127.0.0.1 in place of localhost After complete installation in order to login to the admin section I had to comment a section of a particular file. The location of the file was app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Session/Abstract/Varien.php The section I commented was lines 86 to 101 /* if (!$cookieParams[’httponly’]) { unset($cookieParams[’httponly’]); if (!$cookieParams[’secure’]) { unset($cookieParams[’secure’]); if (!$cookieParams[’domain’]) { unset($cookieParams[’domain’]); } } } if (isset($cookieParams[’domain’])) { $cookieParams[’domain’] = $cookie->getDomain(); } */ After This all of it seems to be working fine. My question is why the 3 changes I have mentioned are necessary in order to make Magento work.
