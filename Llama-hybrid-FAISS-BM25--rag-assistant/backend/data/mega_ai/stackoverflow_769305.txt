How do I add my fragment to the list of required-plugins on an existing plugin

I currently have an existing plugin, which references a class from a required plugin. I have replaced this code with a reference to a class which is part of my fragment. I am facing two issues. If I import my fragment as a jar file, I am not able to see the changes I have made as the plugin running as an eclipse application results in a ClassNotFoundException To overcome this, I link an additional source (of fragment) to the existing plugin project. However, the link uses an absolute path, and makes it unfit for deployment. I want to be able to package the plugin with the code modification and be able to "depend" on my fragment code. Is there a way I can add my fragment as a dependency? For example: Plugin Project I am changing : org.eclipse.*.editor it depends on org.eclipse.*.edit I have a fragment mydomain.*.edit which has org.eclipse.*.edit as host plugin I want org.eclipse.*.editor to pick up mydomain.*.edit instead of org.eclipse.*.edit ps: I have also tried packaging the jar file for the mydomain.*.edit in the plugins directory and try and pick it up from there, it doesnt show up on the list when I click add required plugins on the dependency tab on the plugin.xml file of the org.eclipse.*.editor Please let me know if I am not clear enough, I will try and rephrase it. Thanks in advance!
