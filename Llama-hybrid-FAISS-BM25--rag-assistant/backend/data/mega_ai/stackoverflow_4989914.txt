You could try placing the button inside the last in the row and then float it to the right and provide a large enough negative right margin to get it outside the table; you'll also need a positive right margin on the table to make sure there is space for the button. For example: kdsjfkdsl fds X Appropriately architect 24/365 internal or "organic" sources after fully tested portals. Monotonectally leverage existing an expanded array of action items before resource maximizing growth strategies. Proactively drive orthogonal ROI before sustainable relationships. 2193485798435 X Enthusiastically deploy team building data with e-business internal or "organic" sources. Enthusiastically negotiate diverse models for transparent communities. Intrinsicly disseminate just in time markets before vertical paradigms. Authoritatively brand performance based web-readiness for error-free growth strategies. Energistically empower customer directed markets with quality data. Distinctively productivate backward-compatible potentialities before prospective technology. And a bit of CSS (with coloring to make it clear where everything is): table { margin-right: 2em; } td { padding: 5px; border: 1px solid green; } span.killer { float: right; margin-right: -1.5em; color: red; font-weight: bold; } And the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ambiguous/RE8rK/ I picked the margins out of the air to illustrate the effect, I'll leave computing the proper values up to you.
