Gitolite One User - Many Keys - Different usernames

I have set up gitolite hopefully as per the instructions, and everything is working as planned. I am slightly unsure as to how the usernames part works, and looking through the docs hasn't helped me - perhaps I'm missing something simple. If I have two client machines, for use by one real person, but on each of those machines the usernames are, let's say dave and david. How can I organise the keys in keydir and any config file so that they both represent the same user? I get the suffix thing, dave@laptop, dave@desktop (I think), just not how to have different client machine usernames connecting, as it seems to look for this when authenticating (perhaps because of the public key containing user@host information?) I can give more details if needed - I just didn't want to bombard you all with irrelevant information. Thanks very much.
