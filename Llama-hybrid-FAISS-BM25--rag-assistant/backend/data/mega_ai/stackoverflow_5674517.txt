You can use imagettfbbox() to get the size of the text. Using this you can calculate the average button size (you just need to add the distance between the text and border of the button). However, buttons should be on the left or on the right. That's how basically every native dialog does it and staying consistent with common UI paradigms/guidelines is usually a good thing. Besides that, there's most likely a way to do it using CSS and not precalculating any sizes (and if you really have to do it, do it in JavaScript).
