You have in fact multiple ways to refer to a control with MS-Access. In addition to @Robert Harvey proposal, you can also write: forms(myFormName).controls(myControlName) Despite what @Robert says, you can access most properties of a control without setting the focus on it. One important exception is the ".text" property, which refer to the text appearing in the control, and where the focus must be set to the corresponding control. Most of the time, the .text property is equal to the .value property, that can be accessed without setting focus on the control. Thus, this property is useful only for controls of the combobox or listbox type, where the bound column (that gives the .value property) differs from the displayed column (giving the .text property).
