In case you hadn't seen the User Guide section for this method, the explanation there is pretty good: These fast estimators first bin the input samples X into integer-valued bins (typically 256 bins) which tremendously reduces the number of splitting points to consider, and allows the algorithm to leverage integer-based data structures (histograms) instead of relying on sorted continuous values when building the trees. In the usual tree-building algorithm, for a continuous feature, every split point between consecutive data values is considered. By binning, the number of split candidates is vastly reduced (for large datasets with continuous features). Memory needs are also reduced, because the actual feature values aren't always needed, just counts (and other statistics?) among the bins.
