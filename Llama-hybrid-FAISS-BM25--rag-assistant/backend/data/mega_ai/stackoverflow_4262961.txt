This technique probably won't work for your extreme demands (see end of message for more on that), but it will hopefully help other people get a much higher res image from a PDF than they could with a screenshot or the snapshot acrobat tool. It's not particularly elegant, but it gets the job done. Instructions based on Acrobat 9 Reader (earlier and later versions should also work as long as they have the Snapshot/"Marquee Select" tool) on Windows XP. I imagine it applies on most other platforms that run Adobe Reader. (Now that I think about it there could well be alternative PDF display software that can actually just do this without any tricks. Maybe something based on ghostscript?) In any case, I know this works: Zoom in on the pdf until the image on your monitor has the pixel resolution you're looking for. If you're trying to capture an image with more pixels than you have on your monitor (which is the only reason to use this technique), you will only be be seeing a portion of the image on your screen. Scroll as needed to find a corner of the PDF you want to capture. Select the Snapshot/"Marquee Select" tool. Click the corner, hold the mouse button down (drag-select) and move the mouse to the opposite corner of the window. The screen will start auto scrolling towards the opposite corner of your image. It may take a while, but it will get there. When you get to the opposite edge, take your finger off the mouse, and you should have the high-res image in your clipboard. Now, depending on the "size" of the initial image (Acrobat will only zoom up to 6400% of the original size based on the DPI information in the PDF), this technique could theoretically allow you to get to 100k x 80k pixels. Where it falls apart for most of today's PCs is that you'd need enough RAM to hold 22GB of image data in your copy buffer...
