Why does my not statistically significant regression get significant when adding my crucial x-variable?

Short background. My regression consist of both micro-level data (individual data collected by survey, up to 60 000 observations) and macro-level data (national macroeconomic statistics such as inflation, GDP, unemployment). The way I have combined the data is to for example match the country of the individual and the year the survey was carried out with the corresponding macro-level data for each individual. Since my micro-level data consists of 22 countries and apprx 1000 observation each, I get the same macroeconomic data for 1000 observation each. My problem: When I do a regression (which is an ordered logistic regression since my dependent variable is ordinal) with my micro and macro data but exclude my crucial X-variable (which itself is a aggregated macroeconomic variable), I get high p-values for all of my macro-level control variables. But when I add my crucial X-variable, I get statistical significance on all of them. Why is this so? Is this a problem that I should address and how? I have done a correlation test between all my macroeconomic data and yes, they do correlate a lot! The highest correlation is even 0.77!
