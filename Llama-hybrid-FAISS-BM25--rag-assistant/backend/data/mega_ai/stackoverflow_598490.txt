I would create two files (.cpp and .h): code.h: typedef struct Foo { Foo() {} Foo(int aa, struct Foo* ff) : a(aa), foo(ff) {} int a; struct Foo* foo; } Foo; static Foo f1; static Foo f2; code.cpp: void myfun() { f1 = Foo(1, &f2); f2 = Foo(2, &f1); } I would also prefer to put all variables like f1, f2 ... into some kind of "storage" object (of my own class or e.g. some STL container). Then, I would define this object as a static one.
