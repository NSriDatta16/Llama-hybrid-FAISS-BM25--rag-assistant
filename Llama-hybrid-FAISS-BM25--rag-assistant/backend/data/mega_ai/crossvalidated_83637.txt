I think this would depend on what you really want to know. Could you say that you are really interested in how much of the patented technologies patented eventually failed? Or is the number of failures not really a part of the number of technologies patented, and is the latter really just a control variable? If your dependent variable is in reality a proportion: the proportion of technologies that failed, you could use logistic regression on these 'real proportions'. In that case, you could say that your imaginairy binary data are aggregated but therefore still binomially distributed.
