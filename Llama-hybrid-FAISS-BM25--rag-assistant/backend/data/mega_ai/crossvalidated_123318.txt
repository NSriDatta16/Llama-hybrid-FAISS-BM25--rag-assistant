Why are there only $n-1$ principal components for $n$ data if the number of dimensions is $\ge n$?

In PCA, when the number of dimensions $d$ is greater than (or even equal to) the number of samples $N$, why is it that you will have at most $N-1$ non-zero eigenvectors? In other words, the rank of the covariance matrix amongst the $d\ge N$ dimensions is $N-1$. Example: Your samples are vectorized images, which are of dimension $d = 640\times480 = 307\,200$, but you only have $N=10$ images.
