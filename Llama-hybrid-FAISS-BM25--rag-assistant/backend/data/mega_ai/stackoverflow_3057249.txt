I would highly recommend that you examine the network traffic using Wireshark (www.wireshark.org) to see what's happening at the protocol level. Also, get a tool such as Softerra LDAP browser 2.6 (the free version at http://www.ldapbrowser.com/download.htm ) to check the A/D server and directory organization. If you still have problems, post a summary of what you find using these tools.
