Is it possible to run GAE tests in Hudson?

I have a suite of App Engine tests that are called using nose . When I run them from a terminal, every test completes successfully and all reports, like coverage , are generated. However, if I try to call the same command from Hudson, I get the following failure from coverage: nose.failure.Failure.runTest (from Failure) Parent module 'coverage' not loaded -------------------- >> begin captured logging > end captured logging However, if I remove the call to coverage , my tests still fail. I've succesfully run Python projects with Hudson . Is there a GAE nuance that's tripping me up?
