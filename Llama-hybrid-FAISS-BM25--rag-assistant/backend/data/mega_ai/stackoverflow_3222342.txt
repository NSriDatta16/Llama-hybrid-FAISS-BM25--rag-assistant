How to share an instance across several php files a-la-Wordpress?

Greetings Everyone, I'm currently using Wordpress as my CMS and leveraging Facebook's Graph API for the user account/registration "stuff". My question is how do I use Facebook's PHP SDK (found here: http://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/ ), when Wordpress compiles several php files to output a single webpage? In other words, Wordpress' templates header.php + index.php + footer.php = what you see on www.example.com If I create my instance of the Facebook Application in HEADER.PHP , how will I make references to them in INDEX.PHP and FOOTER.PHP ? Thanks in advance! ----- SAMPLE CODE --- in header.php 'xxx', 'secret' => 'xxx', 'cookie' => true, )); ?> in index.php getSession(); ?>
