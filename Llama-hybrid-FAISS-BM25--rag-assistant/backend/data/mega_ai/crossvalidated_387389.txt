Don't use any activation function in the last layer (or, just use the identity activation function). This would be using a neural network regressor to predict the latitude and longitude directly. So every sample has a corresponding 2-d vector $(lat, long)^T$ and when the network predicts it predicts a similar 2-d vector, where each element of the vector is continuous.
