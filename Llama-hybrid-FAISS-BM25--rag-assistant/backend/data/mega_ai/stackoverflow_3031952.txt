Drawing lines between windows just like in Interface Builder

I have two windows, each with a round NSView : ------------------ ------------ |X-+ Oscillator | |X-+ Mixer | |----------------| |----------| | | | | | O | | O | | | | | | | | | ------------------ ------------ Both windows are in a seperate NIB. I want to be able to draw a line between the two round NSView s at runtime, using drag'n'drop, just like connecting IBOutlets in Interface Builder: ------------------ ------------ |X-+ Oscillator | |X-+ Mixer | |----------------| |----------| | | | | | O-------+-----+-----O | | | | | | | | | ------------------ ------------ I also want to be able to determine to which NSView s the NSView s are connected using the drawn lines. I need this to connect Oscillators to Mixers. I also want to be able to remove the connections by dragging into empty space. Can anyone explain me how to do this? Thanks.
