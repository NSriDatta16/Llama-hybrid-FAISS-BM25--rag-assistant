MCMC sampler will find the values of the parameters with the highest probability together with an estimate of the uncertainty. In other words, from what I understood, MCMC methods find the configuration that maximize the posterior distributions of the parameters. This is not correct. An MCMC sample produces a sample of parameters values (approximately) distributed from the posterior distribution, with obviously a proportion of likely values larger than the proportion of unlikely values. But there is no immediate derivation of the highest posterior (density) value of the parameter or posterior mode. Instead, the sample is treated as an actual simulation from the posterior distribution whose (e.g.) mean and variance can be derived. you use a neural network trained through the maximum likelihood method to extend the number of points of your dataset to build up an augmented dataset that extend in an area where the original dataset did not cover. It is unclear (to me) what you mean by this as, in general, learning the distribution of the data leads to a predictive that covers the same area, unless constraints are introduced. The answer to the question thus requires much more detail on the construction and purpose of this neural network.
