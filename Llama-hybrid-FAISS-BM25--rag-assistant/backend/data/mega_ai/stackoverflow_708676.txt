I wrote my own tool ( WCFStorm ). These are the features: General : ◦Dynamically invoke and test WCF Services ◦Dynamically invoke and test Web services written in any language ◦Save your opened service and its test cases into a "project" which can be reloaded anytime ◦Dynamically invoke service methods even those containing complex data types ◦UI-based, dynamic editing of complex data types ◦Test multiple WCF and Web services within a single UI. ◦Multiple-tabbed interface ◦Basic and windows authentication ◦Test services sitting behind a proxy ◦Dynamically modify the URL endpoint of a WCF or Web service. ◦Dynamically edit the service binding. Functional Testing : ◦Create functional test cases and save it as part of a project ◦Create and save functional test cases containing Expected results. ◦Graphically compare (side-by-side) the expected results with the actual response of a service. Performance Testing: ◦Create performance test cases and save it as part of a project ◦Graphically display charts in real-time as the performance test progresses. ◦Configurable test parameters (# of Agents, Test duration, interval etc.). You can stress out your service as much as you want. Check out the screenshot. (source: geekswithblogs.net )
