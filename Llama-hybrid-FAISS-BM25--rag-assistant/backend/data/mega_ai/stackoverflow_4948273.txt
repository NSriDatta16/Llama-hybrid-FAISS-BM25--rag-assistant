Attaching multiple draggable/droppable to one element

The following shows my attempt to add two draggable stop event handlers to a paragraph. Only the second will fire... How can I get both to fire? $(document).ready(function(){ var dragg1 = { stop: function(event, ui){alert('stop dragg1')} }; var dragg2 = { stop: function(event, ui){alert('stop dragg2')} }; $(".makeDraggable").draggable(dragg1); $(".makeDraggable").draggable(dragg2); }); Multi Handler Test Hello I am trying to create two libraries and stack them, both add drag and drop functionality to the underlying elements.
