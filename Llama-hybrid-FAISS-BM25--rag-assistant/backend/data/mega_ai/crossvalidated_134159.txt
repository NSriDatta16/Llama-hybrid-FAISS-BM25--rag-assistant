Analysis of many companies over a period

I'm trying to see the relationship between some variables, for example, with the model below $$\text{Profitability} = \varepsilon + \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{DoL} + \beta_2 \text{DFL} + \beta_3 \text{SZ}$$ with: DoL = Degree of Operating Leverage DFL = Degree of Financial Leverage SZ = Firm size and those data are taken from financial statements However, I don't know how to perform the regression analysis because I have data of many companies, and for each companies, I have data for 10 years. So i'm not sure should I use the average of all companies (this will become the sector) for each year, or should I run the regression with average of each company over the period.
