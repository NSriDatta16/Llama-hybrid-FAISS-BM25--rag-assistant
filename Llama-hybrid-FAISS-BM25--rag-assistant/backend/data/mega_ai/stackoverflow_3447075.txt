This is a classic little problem that is usually solved with a simple boolean flag. private bool suppressHtmlChanged = false; private static void HtmlChangedCallback(DependencyObject d, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e) { var rte = (RichTextEditor)d; if (!rte.suppressHtmlChanged) rte.TextBox.LoadHtml((string)e.NewValue); } private void rtb_ContentChanged(object sender, RichTextBoxEventArgs e) { suppressHtmlChanged = true; SetValue(HtmlProperty, rtb.SaveHtml()); suppressHtmlChanged = false; } These days such solutions seem so old fashioned don't they, often we can convince ourselves that such a "low-tech" solutions can't be right because they're not "elegant".
