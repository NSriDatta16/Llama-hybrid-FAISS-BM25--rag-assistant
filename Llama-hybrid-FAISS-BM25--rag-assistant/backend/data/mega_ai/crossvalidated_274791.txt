I don't really think that what you are describing is a Bayesian updating problem. If the expert' opinions are (or can be assumed) independent, then together they form a joint distribution $$ g(x) = f_1(x) \times f_2(x) \times \dots \times f_k(x)$$ Triangular distribution has a fixed support, so the product of the distribution would zero-out the non-overlapping regions (this may be seen as a advantage, or a disadvantage depending on your aim). On another hand, you can combine together the opinions into a mixture distribution $$ g(x) = \sum_i w_i f_i(x) $$ (a.k.a. linear opinion pool ) where $w_i$ are the non-negative weights such that $\sum_i w_i = 1$, with $w_1 = w_2 = \dots = w_k = 1/k$ if you want to treat all the opinions as equally trustworthy. Yet another alternative is logarithmic opinion pool : $$ g(x) = \frac{ \prod_i f_i(x)^{w_i} } { \int \, \prod_i f_i(x)^{w_i} \, d\mu }$$ For more examples and further details see Clemen, R.T. and Winkler, R.L.
