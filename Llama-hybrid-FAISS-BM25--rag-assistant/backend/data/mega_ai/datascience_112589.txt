DeepSORT features

I'm reading about Detection and Tracking algorithms and I'm unclear about the DeepSORT algorithm: How does the DeepSORT algorithm gets the features? Does it "hijack" the feature vector from the upstream detection algorithm? (such as YOLO? or others?). This seems unreasonable to me, since not all methods would make it easy to get the feature vector. Does it create features on its own, using a pretrained CNN network? This seems to make sense, and also makes it independent from the Detection algorithm. So I would imagine that DeepSORT gets the bounding-box for each object, and then would need to do some image-preprocessing on its own? (such as crop/resize the part of the image that's related to the BB?) Thanks.
