When using mozilla programmatically / embedding in other apps you should use the provided components: "The right way" as recommended by mozilla ... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPCOM "The easy way", general consensus from Mozilla dev guys ... http://www.iol.ie/~locka/mozilla/control.htm Need to "execute processes", simply instantiate an instance of the component and talk to that, you should then have everything you need. However ... If you really do insist on looking after the actual process for a firefox instance, you may want to call Process.Start("...\firefox.exe"); Then try this (i believe this works on MAC OS too) ... C#/mono: get list of child processes on Windows and Linux The basic idea / thought pattern being that if it is in fact executing another process right away you should be able to find that as would be a "child" process instead of being just one from a list in the "task list" / process manager for the machine.
