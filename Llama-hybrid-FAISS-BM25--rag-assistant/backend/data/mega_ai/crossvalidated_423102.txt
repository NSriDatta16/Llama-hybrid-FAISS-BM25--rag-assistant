neural networks and optimization problems in general

Neural networks are efficient at solving optimization problems. The topic of optimization problems is divided into linear and nonlinear problems and in linear and nonlinear conditions. I just wonder how a network will be categorized accordingly. For example, how do we set conditions? Do these terms fit anyway?
