Find the optimal number of clusters in large dataset using R

I've a got a data which I did a PCA on. I want to do a kmeans on the individuals coordinates on the 5 first principal components. Therefore I have a 200000 x 5 matrix of the coordinates. I'm looking to find a way to determine the optimal number of cluster so I can run a kmeans on my coordinates data using R. I found many methods to do that using R (here is a list : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15376075/cluster-analysis-in-r-determine-the-optimal-number-of-clusters ). None of those methods have worked for me because my data is too large. I get an error like : "negative length vectors are not allowed". I really need help on that because I shouldn't decide what number of cluster I should use, I have to let the statistic decide. Thank you very much.
