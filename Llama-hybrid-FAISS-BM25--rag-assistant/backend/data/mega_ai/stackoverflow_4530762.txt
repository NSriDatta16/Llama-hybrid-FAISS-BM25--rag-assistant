OLAP is not about the storage only; it is about the MDX language as well. MDX is much more powerful than SQL to handle multi-dimensional (with hierarchical dimensions) queries. You can have a look to www.icCube.com - it's pretty fast - I mean no problem to aggregate let's say 30 millions of facts over 20 dimensions in sub-seconds (without any pre-aggregation computation).
