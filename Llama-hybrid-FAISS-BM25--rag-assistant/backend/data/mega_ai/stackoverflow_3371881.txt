When designing websites, what are my options for data storage?

I am a website designer, and I design both sites and applications for the web. I use PHP. I often find I have to store information, which needs to be accessed by the user after the browser is closed. Up until now I have always used a database (MySQL to be precise) to store information, however sometimes, I feel that I am storing information that does not warrant database storage, mainly because the database does not travel with the application - it needs to be created separately. Are there any other options for storing small amounts of data? Something simpler perhaps?
