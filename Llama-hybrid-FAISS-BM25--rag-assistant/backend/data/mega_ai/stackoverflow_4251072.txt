The logical thing to do would be to set the page view controller's parentViewController property but alas, it is read-only too. Apple's does not encourage custom hierarchies of view controllers (besides the supported hierarchies with tab bar, navigation and split view controllers). In your case, I would define a custom parentVC propertyy on the PageViewController class that the PagingViewController sets to itself when it instantiates its children. The PageViewController s can then get to the nav controller via self.parentVC.navigationController
