Summarizing k-fold cross validation results

I have a project for which I had to do a 5-fold cross-validation. The dataset comprises of 5 days, so we take one day as our training set and apply on the remaining 4, rinse and repeat till we get full coverage. Pretty standard stuff. Now, here's my question, once I finished the cross-validation, I am left with True Positive and False Positive rate for each one my runs. Is there a standard way to show this data visually that would summarize the results ? In particular I want to show that the technique is fairly stable and about a day's worth of data is enough to train it successfully.
