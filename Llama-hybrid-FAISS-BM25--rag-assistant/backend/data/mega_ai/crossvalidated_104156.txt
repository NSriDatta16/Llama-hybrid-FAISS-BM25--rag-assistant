Question about PCA data recovery equation

In PCA , consider a 4 x 3 data matrix ( 4 examples each with 3 features ). After getting the 3 eigenvectors (a/b/c) and projecting data on the first 2 vectors, the equation looks like this : [ first 2 eigen vectors transposed ] x [ data set transposed ] = [ data projected ] so the first example in the data after being projected would consist of: $$[a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + a_3x_3]\\ [b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3x_3] $$ On recovering data the equation looks like this: [first 2 eigen vectors] x [projected data] = [original data set] so that the first example consists of: $$ a_1[a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + a_3x_3] + b_1[b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3x_3]\\ a_2[a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + a_3x_3] + b_2[b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3x_3]\\ a_3[a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + a_3x_3] + b_3[b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3x_3] $$ My question is how is this equivalent to what the original example looked like $[x_1 x_2 x_3]'$? I know that unit vectors will cancel each other but the equation will be like $$ a_1[a_1x_1] + b_1[b_1x_1]\\ a_2[a_2x_2] + b_2[b_2x_2]\\ a_3[a_3x_3] + b_3[b_3x_3] $$ giving : $$ x_1 + x_1\\ x_2 + x_2\\ x_3 + x_3 $$
