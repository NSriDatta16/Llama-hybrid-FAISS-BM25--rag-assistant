AS3 is superior to AS2- plenty of reasons above, including VM performance, stricter compiler for enforcing cleaner coding practice (strict typing, etc). I didn't see anyone mention that you can change an object's parent object at runtime in AS3, something you could not do in AS2, and if you ran into this issue you know what a road block disappointment that is. But, more importantly when you code things in AS3, THEY WORK AS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO. None of this quirky AS2 stuff where you discover bugs, shortcomings, and just strange results from code limitations on a fairly regular basis! If you're considering porting / rewriting, you should also consider any learning curve you might have to wait for if your dev team is experienced with AS2 but not AS3. With a 100,000 line codebase (which is pretty huge by any actionscript standard), porting is going to be a nightmare unless the code is documented, elegant and organized. You might find that re-writing from scratch by starting with building a more efficient and organized framework / design pattern for the app cuts the size of the codebase in the end significantly... maybe it only needs to be a 50,000 line codebase if it's done right? good luck!
