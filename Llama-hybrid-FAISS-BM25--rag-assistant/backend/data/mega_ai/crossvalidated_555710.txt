Any reasons to prefer neural networks over boosting methods in tabular data?

Based on Kaggle winners data, it seems that ensemble boosting methods like XGBOOST, LIGHTGBM, CATBOOST are the top choices when dealing with structured or tabular data for maximizing the prediction accuracy. However, in industry as far as I know, the trend is to move towards neural network models to solve the same problems. What are some reasons that we want to use deep learning/neural network models as opposed to boosting methods for tabular data?
