I don't understand how this is supposed to be an "anti-cracking feature", unless you plan to somehow obtain the UDIDs of all the devices of a user who has legally purchased your app through iTunes. You can't get such a list. And even if you could, it might be a violation of Apple's developer agreement, especially the section on privacy and storage of information. So in summary: This solution is fundamentally and fatally flawed. There are other anti-cracking techniques that will be more effective, especially those that use a softer approach... but none will be perfect. As St3fan says, your technique requires a working Internet connection, which is not something you can always assume. In which case, this technique does not fail gracefully. In which case, Apple can reject your app. It will not be "[Apple's] problem" if it fails. It is your problem.
