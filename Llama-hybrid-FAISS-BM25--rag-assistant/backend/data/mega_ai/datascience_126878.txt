Structure for text message categorisation

I have a load of online chat messages and need to categorise them based on certain criteria, such as the topic, intention, tone of voice, type of information (e.g. dates & amounts), etc. Once categorised, these are used to train a model to automatically categorise new messages. Currently, the categories (around 20) are a big hot mess that has been built up, ad-hoc, and doesn't have any particular structure to speak of. My question is, what is a good approach to structuring the categories that would best capture the information and also be logical/orthogonal enough to train the model effectively. Some stuff I've been considering: I've come across Searle's 5 types of "speech acts", which could be a useful way to differentiate messages at a more fundamental level than the particular business logic. What other models might be useful? Would a hierarchical structure make sense? Would it make sense to separate nouns, verbs, adjectives, and then drill down into specifics? What about "tagging" as opposed to a hierarchy to avoid similar nodes in different branches of the hierarchy. Any good resources to get started in this research? Another approach I've looked into but haven't tried is a transformer-based clustering method where the centroids would then become the basis for categories. If anyone has experience of doing this or just some thoughts, I'd be interested to hear!
