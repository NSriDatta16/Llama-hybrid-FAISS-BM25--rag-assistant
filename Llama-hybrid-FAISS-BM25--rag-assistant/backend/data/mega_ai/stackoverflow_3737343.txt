"And get this error ... Is it that bad what I do?" Well, it's not giving you an Error . It's giving you a Notice . Notices are "ignored" (that is, not echoed) on production servers. Essentially, PHP is telling you what Extrakun is saying in his answer. You should take notice to a potential mistake that could lead to a real error later. So, "Is it that bad what I do?" ... maybe not. But, then again, PHP is also not giving you an error. It is giving you the right amount attention that the code segment deserves - a Notice .
