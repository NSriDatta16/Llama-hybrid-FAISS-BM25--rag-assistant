T-test : Average Time Spent on Website

I'm trying to A/B test (using a t-test) if a test variation leads to an increase in time spent on the website. Should I: Method 1: Treat time spent by a user on two different days as two different data points or Method Method 2: Average them out and treat them as a single data point? (A user stays in the same group on all days) In Method 1, my data (illustrative) would like this: User,Day,TimeSpent,Variation U1,D1,12,V1(Test) U1,D2,14,V1(Test) U2,D1,11,V2(Control) And my sample size for V1 would be 2 and for V2 it would be 1 In Method 2, my data would like this: User,TimeSpent,Variation U1,13,V1(Test) U2,11,V2(Control) And my sample size for V1(Test) would be 1 and for V2(Control) also it would be 1. I'm trying to identify if variation one causes a user to spend more time on the website per day. (P.S. the data is illustrative. I will have thousands of users)
