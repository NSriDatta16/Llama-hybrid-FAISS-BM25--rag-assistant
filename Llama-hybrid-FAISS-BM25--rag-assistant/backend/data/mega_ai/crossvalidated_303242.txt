Interesting question! Yes, tree species can be validly treated as sampling units (your rows, indexed by i), with the nesting bird species (columns, indexed by j) as the entities being scored for each sampling unit. But I am assuming that the actual (i,j) counts in your table represent "the number of individual trees of Tree Species i that have at least one nest of Bird Species j." If that is what you intend, then sample-based rarefaction, with tree species as sampling units, will ignore the actual (i,j) counts and treat them as 0 if (i,j) = 0 (undetected) and 1 (detected) otherwise. (But I must say, there is notable absence of 0s in your matrix, compared to any real dataset I can imagine.) With this approach, you can answer not only "With N tree species, on average, how many nesting bird species could we find?", but also, "If we double the number of tree species examined, in the same forest using the same methods, how many nesting bird species could we expect to find (with confidence intervals)? Or "What is the asymptotic estimate of the number of nesting bird species in this forest (with confidence intervals)?" See Colwell et al. (2012a) and Chao et al. (2016). But, since you have counts (not just detected/undetected) for (i,j), you could also use abundance-based rarefaction, within tree species (rows), to estimate the asymptotic number (or the expected number for some number of bird species examined) of nesting bird species in each tree species. And/or you could use abundance-based rarefaction, within bird species (columns), to estimate the asymptotic number (or the expected number for some number of tree species examined) of tree species used by each bird species. One example of a species-as-sampling unit rarefaction comes to mind. In Colwell et al. (2012b) we turned sample-based rarefaction around to estimate the number of extinct parasites that met their doom with the extinction of their hosts. Chao, A., N. J. Gotelli, T. C. Hsieh, E. L.
