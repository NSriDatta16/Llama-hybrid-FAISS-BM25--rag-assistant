I agree with the others I would go for a solution that uses a mixture of STI and delegation would be much easier to implement. At the heart of your problem is where to store a record of all the subclasses of Target. ActiveRecord chooses the database via the STI model. You could store them in a class variable in the Target and use the inherited callback to add new ones to it. Then you can dynamically generate the code you'll need from the contents of that array and leverage method_missing.
