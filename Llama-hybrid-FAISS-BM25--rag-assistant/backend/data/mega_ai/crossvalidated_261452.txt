Use loess regression with many zero values

I have measuments of vegetation coverage on Y plotted against surface height (and hence flooding frequency) on X. The vegetation often has two herb layers, which are estimated seperately. If only one layer is present, the coverage of the upper layer is 0 (and if no vegetation is present, both are 0). Therefore, the upper layer has many zero estimates in the graph. There are two treatments: grazed and non-grazed (exclosure). I've plotted a loess curve with 95%CI to show the general trend and differences between the treatments. However, I know Loess is a non-parametric method, but was wondering if it's usage in this case is correct, especially for the high vegetation layer. Can I use a loess curve with confidence interval regardless of the number of zeros? If not, how can I check if it is appropriate in this case?
