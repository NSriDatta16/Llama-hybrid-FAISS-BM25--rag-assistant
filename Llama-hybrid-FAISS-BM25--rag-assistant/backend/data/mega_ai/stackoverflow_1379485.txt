I use TypeMock all the time and have found it to be a very powerful tool that can improve the coverage of my unit tests. This is because I work with SharePoint and only TypeMock can allow me to mock out SharePoint classes - since they are concrete classes and not interfaces. Mocking SharePoint classes is not possible with RhinoMock, Moq, NUNit, etc since (I believe) they require interfaces to mock objects, rather then being able to mock the actual concrete classes. If your code does use a lot of interfaces, and you don't require mocking concrete classes then TypeMock is a bit pricey, but for the power you get, it's worth it.
