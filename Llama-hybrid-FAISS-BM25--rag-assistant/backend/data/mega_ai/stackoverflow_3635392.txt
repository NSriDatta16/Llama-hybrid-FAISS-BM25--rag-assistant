If you save the file into IsolatedStorage you can set a relative path to view it from there. Here's a quick example saving a file that was included in the XAP (as a resource) into Isolated Storage. using (IsolatedStorageFile isoStore = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) { if (!isoStore.FileExists(fileName) { var sr = Application.GetResourceStream(new Uri(fileName, UriKind.Relative)); using (var br = new BinaryReader(sr.Stream)) { byte[] data = br.ReadBytes((int)sr.Stream.Length); string strBaseDir = string.Empty; const string DelimStr = "/"; char[] delimiter = DelimStr.ToCharArray(); string[] dirsPath = fileName.Split(delimiter); // Recreate the directory structure for (int i = 0; i You may also be interested in the image caching converters created by Ben Gracewood and Peter Nowaks . They both show saving images into isolated storage and loading them from there.
