Storing data on SD Card in Android

Using the data-storage page in the docs , I've tried to store some data to the SD-Card. This is my code: // Path to write files to String path = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath() + "/Android/data/"+ctxt.getString(R.string.package_name)+"/files/"; String fname = "mytest.txt"; // Current state of the external media String extState = Environment.getExternalStorageState(); // External media can be written onto if (extState.equals(Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED)) { try { // Make sure the path exists boolean exists = (new File(path)).exists(); if (!exists){ new File(path).mkdirs(); } // Open output stream FileOutputStream fOut = new FileOutputStream(path + fname); fOut.write("Test".getBytes()); // Close output stream fOut.flush(); fOut.close(); } catch (IOException ioe) { ioe.printStackTrace(); } When I create the new FileOutputStream I get a FileNotFound exception. I have also noticed that "mkdirs()" does not seem to create the directory. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? I'm testing on an AVD with a 2GB sd card and "hw.sdCard: yes", the File Explorer of DDMS in Eclipse tells me that the only directory on the sdcard is "LOST.DIR".
