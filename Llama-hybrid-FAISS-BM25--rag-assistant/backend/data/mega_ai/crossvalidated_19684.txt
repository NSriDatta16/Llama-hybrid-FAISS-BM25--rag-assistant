Given that you have an ARIMA filter, you can restate this as a pure AR by simply multiplying out the ARI and then dividing by the MA. This would be a pure auto-regressive formulation which is called the PI WEIGHTS ( see any book on time series analysis ) . The right-hand side constant might take you some to time to figure it out but I am sure you will. Use this pure right-hand side equation in conjunction with your residuals and you will get a realization of a process that will have "the same acf" as the series that was used to identify the ARIMA Model. Of course what you will have will be a realization of a sample ACF which of course would depend on the input "error/noise vector".
