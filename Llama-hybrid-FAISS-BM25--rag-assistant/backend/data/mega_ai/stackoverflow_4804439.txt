Please try reinstalling the package "Mage_All_Latest" with the Magento Connect Manager and make sure, you have set the folder-permissions right. Ensure that the file magento/var/.htaccess, the directories magento/app/etc, magento/var, and all the directories under magento/media are writable by the web server. It sounds like there was a problem while your install, so a reinstall of the latest packages maybe solves your problem.
