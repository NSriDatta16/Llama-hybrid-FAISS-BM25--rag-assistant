jQuery UI dropping elements only in special areas

I have a problem with jQuery UI's drag and drop. I create dynamically new elements which are placed on the screen in one of four areas. These elements are draggable and I can place them all over the screen. But I want that these elements can only be dropped on one of the three areas. I created a full working example here: http://jsbin.com/enusu4/ By clicking the text in the red bordered area, a new element is created and placed in the green area drop1 . This element should now only be droppable to one of the green areas ( drop1 , drop2 or drop3 ), nowhere else. How can I do this? Best Regards, Tim.
