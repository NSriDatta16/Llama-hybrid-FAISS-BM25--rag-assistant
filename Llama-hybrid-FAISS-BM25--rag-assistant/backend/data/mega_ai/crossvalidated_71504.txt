It is generally easier to reject a claim than to "accept" it and if you consider failing to reject a claim to be the same as accepting it then that leads to poor science based on too small of sample sizes ( http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2004-04-13/ ). Traditional hypothesis testing could look at testing "At least 80%" or "At Most 80%". There are also tests of equivalence, but you need to determine what you mean by "equivalent", e.g. you could establish equivalence if you were 95% confident that the true percentage was between 75% and 85% (or another meaningful region), but the given data will not support that. If you really need proof that the value is exactly 80% then you will need an infinite amount of data (or at least the entire population).
