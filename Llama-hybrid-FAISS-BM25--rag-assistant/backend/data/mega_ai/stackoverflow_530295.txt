A team leader has to be a coder -- they can't lead the team unless the team respects them and where they're taking everyone. A team manager , on the other hand, can either be a coder or someone who is just well organised and knows when to ask questions and interface to other management. It is possible to find both a manager and a leader in the same person, but more often the roles (should be) separate and distinct.
