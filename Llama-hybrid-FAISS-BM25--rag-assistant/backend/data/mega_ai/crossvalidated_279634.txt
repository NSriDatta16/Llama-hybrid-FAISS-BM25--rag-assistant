This is a part of the feature engineering stage in modeling. Two key concepts in features engineering are: 1) Features should represent reality(or our assumption about reality). 2) Features different values should have good distribution(where good might mean different things). Bucketing over 6 seats cars into one value lets one keep its reality representation while improving its feature values distribution.
