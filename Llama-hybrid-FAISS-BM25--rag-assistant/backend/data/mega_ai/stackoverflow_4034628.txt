Sometimes Base is still necessary, especially when you provide both a concrete class and an abstract class for someone to extend to create a concrete implementation. e.g. Controller and ControllerBase (actually Controller is also abstract, but provides signifigantly more functionality than ControllerBase) Base suffix is ugly when programming against an interface, so I think the Microsoft guideline not to use it applies when the abstract class is predominantly used like an interface. Probably what they mean by Public API. The point is that there are cases where there is no better alternative to using the Base suffix.
