You can use initialized parameters that are learned using transfer learning, but keep in mind that it also began somewhere from a non-learned initialized state. Basically, you have to start from some point, usually a bunch of zeros, and then refine by training. So, if you are not using any transfer learning mechanisms, you also have to start from a manual initial state, I am sure there might be works of literature available for manually setting the initial states. This is the simplest explanation I could put. Thank You.
