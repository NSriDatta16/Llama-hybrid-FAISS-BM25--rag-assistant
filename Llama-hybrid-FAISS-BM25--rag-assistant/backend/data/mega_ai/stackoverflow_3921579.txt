DataGridViewCombBoxColumn cell value and different dropdown list

I've a very trivial requirement which makes me go nuts. I've a DataGridView in windows forms application. This contains one databound ComboBox Column. I'm using DisplayMember and ValueMember properties of that combobox. Now my requirement is ComboBox should show the list of DisplayMembers in drop down list but when user selects one item from it, I should display the part of that DisplayMember in the combobox cell visible to the user. For example. My display member list looks as below: "Cust1 - Customer 1" "Cust2 - Customer 2" "Cust3 - Customer 3" and when user selects any one of them from the above list (Say user selected 'Cust2 - Customer 2') then I need to display the value in the combobox column cell as only "Cust2" instead of complete DisplayMember text. This DisplayMember list is a combination of two fields from the datasource bound to it i.e. First part points to CustomerCode field and second part points Customer name. I need to display only CustomerCode in the ComboBox cell after user selects one item from the drop down list. How can I do this? Or should I come up with my own control which will have a different AutoCompleteCustomSource and display member value. Even I'm confused with that approach too. Update: As no one has come up with any solution to my problem. Now I'm starting a bounty for that, also if anyone can suggest me other way to implement the same functionality, it would be great. I've even tried to come up with my own control and tried to work on simple combobox to display a different value than the selected dropdown list, even that didn't work. Is there any other way to implement this? Any tips and tricks are greatly appreciable. @Anurag: Here is the code which I've used. Created a datagridview in the design mode. Created one column of type 'DataGridViewComboBoxColumn' that and named it as CustomerColumn. In the designer file it looks like below: private System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewComboBoxColumn CustomerColumn; This is the entity class which I've used for datasource public class Customer { public int Id { get; set; } public string CustCode { get; set; } public string CustName { get; set; } public string NameWithCode { get; set; }// CustCode - CustName format } In the form load event I'm doing the following: CustomerColumn.DataSource = GetCustomers(); CustomerColumn.DisplayMember = "NameWithCode"; CustomerColumn.ValueMember = "Id";
