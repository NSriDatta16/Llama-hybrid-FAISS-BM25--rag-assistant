I haven't tried either of these, but in theory, they seem like they would work. First, if you made the ul#existing also a droppable , you could do something on the drop event, such as get the info you need from that li, like it's text() , remove that object from the DOM and generate a new element. Orrr, you could do something on the stop event of your draggable, like check whether the elements parents are now ul#existing . Hope this helps.
