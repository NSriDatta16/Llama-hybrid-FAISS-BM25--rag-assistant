A few people will think this question is rather broad but I think it is answerable. It does however require you to get a bit more info from your friend about what he's after because statistics intersects chemistry in a multitude of places. If it's physical chemistry type stuff he's after, I'd start with Statistical Thermodynamics (wikipedia) . Also G.S. Yablonsky is a good name to search for. If it's more stuff to do with experiment design and "There must be a way of squeezing more knowledge out of this data" type stuff, then there is a lot out there. Design of Experiments , Optimal design , Bayesian experimental design , are all links that should get your friend started with the question of how to apply statistics to complicated chemistry optimisation problems. There is a caveat. "Applying big data to chemistry and drug design" is an idea that seems to come up independently every few months, and it's one that hasn't met with much success. Usually, this is down to the quality of the chemical data itself - I certainly wouldn't want someone using the data from my PhD synthesis work without accounting for all the unmentioned variables, like the brand and quality of the reagents used, humidity on that day, phase of moon etc. As the phrase goes, "Garbage in, garbage out". If there is a more specific or different question you had in mind, don't hesitate to mention it, and I will attempt an answer.
