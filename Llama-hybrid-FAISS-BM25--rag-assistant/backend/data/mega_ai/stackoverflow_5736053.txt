Truthfully, either way works fine. The way you store it is a design decision you will need to make. It depends on how you want to retrieve the user information, etc. In terms of performance, storing the JSON encoded version of the user object will use less memory and take less time for storage/retrieval. That is, JSON parsing is probably faster than retrieving each field from Redis. And, even if not, it is probably more memory efficient. The difference in performance is probably minimal anyway.
