You realize you are adding an image into a panel which is draggable and insert that panel again into your main panel? It isn't the image you are making draggable, it's the panel that the image sits in which is draggable but still the code you posted looks totally wrong. I suggest you read up on ExtJS DD first to grasp the concepts of Drag and Drop in ExtJS and how that is implemented in default Components like Panels. The way of using DD on an Ext Panel is totally different than making an image draggable. A Panel is an Ext Component with alot of built in features like DD but an image is just a DOM element on which you should implement your DD behaviour yourself. Check the following links, they have some good info on DD in ExtJS http://rowen.javaeye.com/blog/479133 http://examples.extjs.eu/?ex=freedrag http://www.extensions.extjs.com/learn/Tutorial:Advanced_Custom_Drag_and_Drop_Part_1 And ofcourse the docs for Ext.dd: http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.dd.DragDrop
