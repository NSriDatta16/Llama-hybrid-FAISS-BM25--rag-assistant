The PASCAL Project's video library (PASCAL is Pattern Analysis, Statistical Modelling and Computational Learning ). I have never found anything that even comes close--either in the number of videos, in the average quality, or in scope. The Project scope is Machine Learning; each video lecture is annotated with one or more tags which represent hierarchical subject-matter rubrics. For "Data Mining" there are at least several relevant tags: Data Mining Text Mining Semantic Web Web Mining Here's the best part: aside from these subject-matter categories, there is an orthogonal classification which you access from the left-hand side panel, and which relates to the lecture format , e.g., Lecture , Keynote , Interview , and of perhaps most interest for you, Tutorial . This is one of the largest categories and includes videos that survey/introduce the entire discipline of Machine Learning (e.g., Introduction to Machine Learning) to more advanced tutorials on individual ML techniques. A few suggestions for use: The Computer Science category is perhaps the best top-level category to begin searching or browsing for videos of interest to you (for Data Mining). Every Video includes a set of slides . I would recommend downloading the slide set and accessing from your local drive during the video which saves bandwidth plus you can annotate the slides with notes as you wish. When you scan the videos, look for the solid yellow stars that appear down the left-hand side of the thumbnail image of each video--those are the rating for each video. Finally, you might want to try browsing the library this way: begin at the highest level (all videos); then in the left-hand side panel, select Tutorial , moving down, then select Highest Rated , then select the languages . These selections will only affect your results order (the order in which the videos are shown to you as thumnail images in your browser).
