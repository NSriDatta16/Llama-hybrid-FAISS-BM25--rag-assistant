Accessing shipping cost in Magento's cart and/or checkout

Please note, this question is regarding the shipping cost, not price. There is an important difference, i.e. what $$ charge the shipping method incurs for the store owner, as opposed to what is $$ charge is paid by the customer. The shipping_tablerate database table includes a cost field, which is populated in the Mage_Shipping_Model_Carrier_Tablerate object during the collectRates method. However, that field is not accessible anywhere else in the stack, e.g. from a quote's address. I need to access that value on the cart page, and I can't find anyway to achieve it, other than to instantiate a Mage_Shipping_Model_Rate_Request object to pass into collectRates() . That seems unnecessarily inefficient given that the data is already loaded from the table and should be accessible. I have tried Observing the event, but it seems that the _load event is not thrown for that model. I have also tried accessing the rate from the quote: $quote = Mage::getSingleton('checkout/cart')->getQuote(); $address = $quote->getShippingAddress(); $rate = $address->getShippingRateByCode($code ='tablerate_bestway'); I can see the calculated price , however cost is not present in that model. At this stage, I'm running out of ideas. Any suggestions gratefully received! Thanks, Jonathan
