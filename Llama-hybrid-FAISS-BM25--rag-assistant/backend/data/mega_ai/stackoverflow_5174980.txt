Using mpirun on OS X on one machine

I have trouble using mpirun in single-machine mode on OS X. When running my program using mpirun -np 5 my_program I get the following error output: [...-MacBook-Pro.local:85936] [0,0,0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Timeout in file /SourceCache/openmpi/openmpi-8/openmpi/orte/mca/pls/base/pls_base_orted_cmds.c at line 275 [...-MacBook-Pro.local:85936] [0,0,0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Timeout in file /SourceCache/openmpi/openmpi-8/openmpi/orte/mca/pls/rsh/pls_rsh_module.c at line 1158 [...-MacBook-Pro.local:85936] [0,0,0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Timeout in file /SourceCache/openmpi/openmpi-8/openmpi/orte/mca/errmgr/hnp/errmgr_hnp.c at line 90 mpirun noticed that job rank 1 with PID 85940 on node ...-MacBook-Pro.local exited on signal 6 (Abort trap). 2 additional processes aborted (not shown) Apparently, by default mpirun uses rsh for connecting to machines. I tried using ssh instead, but it didn't help: mpirun --mca pls_rsh_agent ssh -np 5 my_program Then, I tried using the shared-memory ( sm ) BTL, which didn't help either: mpirun --mca btl self,sm -np 5 my_program Finally, I tried using a machine file to specify that I only want to use localhost , which didn't help either: mpirun -np 5 -machinefile machinefile.local my_program Here, machinefile.local only contains localhost on the (single) first line. In all of the above cases, I get the above timeout error. Also, I verified that my Mac OS X firewall wasn't running and that I could ssh into my machine.
