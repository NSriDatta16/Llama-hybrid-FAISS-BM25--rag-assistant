How come the arima model predicts the prevalance rate to increase in the future ARIMA tries to find patterns in historical data and (when forecasting) to extrapolate them into the future. Based on the patterns observed over the 24 data points that you have, the model apparently "thinks" it is time for the series to trend upwards. There is no subject-matter reasoning involved, just pure pattern recognition. The question is, is it sensible to use an ARIMA model to describe this process? One way to possibly address this contra-intuitive result is by adding exogeneous data using the xreg argument. If I could include time series data on GDP, Health care expenditures,... which probably correlate with the Malaria prevalence data and thus also show a decreasing trend, I might be able to predict the future prevalence to be decreasing. Is this correct? (Also, question 2.) Including additional variables could certainly help. Prevalence of malaria should not be too difficult to explain using subject-matter reasoning and having the relevant data. Using pure pattern recognition techniques on your time series could hardly be effective. Therefore, I would certainly try including some relevant variables. If the task of predicting the future malaria prevalence rate using the 24 earlier data points is not possible, could you give a clear reasoning why this is the case? (Also, question 3.) The data generating process might be evolving over time. There are probably a lot of forces at play and the development of the series is far from stable. For example, at times the government might be introducing new programmes for fighting malaria, while at other times they might be cutting the programmes due to insufficient funding. People might be moving in or out of the malaria-infested regions in the country. Gradual changes in natural conditions might make malaria more or less prevalent over time. If you think in terms of an ARIMA model, you could say that the shocks (the errors, the innovations) are far from i.i.d., and even the AR and MA coefficients might be changing over time.
