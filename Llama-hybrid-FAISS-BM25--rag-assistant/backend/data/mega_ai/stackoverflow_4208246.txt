Data Visualization & HBase

Greetings, I have been looking through the questions on this site and I haven't found any related questions. I have currently built a Flex/PHP/MySQL app where I take an extract from my Hadoop cluster and dump to a MySQL table. There are several problems with this as my data set continues to grow. I am looking for a much more robust open-source solution, and therefore have started to examine HBase and how to leverage PHP or Java to extract my data to a visualization app. Have any of you built any visualization platforms on top of Hadoop or HBase? Thank you!
