Linq returning list of anonymous types

Caan somone advise the best approach to what i'm trying to acheive (linq to sql, returning list of data to show in a grid/list etc etc)... Its complaining about anonymous type conversion, and from what i'm reading, thats not elegant way of doing it. Public Function GetHistory(ByVal historyId As Integer) As List(Of ?????????) Using dc As New myDataContext(Application.GetConnection) Return (From t In dc.ActionTypes, a In t.MyTable Where a.HistoryID = historyId Select a.ActionOn, a.ActionBy, t.Description, a.ImpactedItem, a.ActionDescription).ToList End Using End Function
