iPhone timeIntervalSinceDate not throwing error, or working

I'm trying to find the difference between two NSDates. This worked once and printed the difference, but has never worked again. I don't remember changing any thing after the one time it worked. Any ideas? Oh, and it doesn't throw an error, and if I comment out this snippet everything works. //----------- Touches Begin - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { touchBegins = [NSDate date]; NSLog (@" Tap: %d ", tapTotal); NSLog (@" "); NSLog (@"Method: touchesBegines & Ends"); NSLog (@" Touch Begin: %@", touchBegins); // [self updateLabelsFromTouches:touches]; } //----------- Touches End - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { touchEnds = [NSDate date]; NSLog (@" Touch Ends : %@", touchEnds ); @try { NSLog(@"%@", touchEnds); NSTimeInterval elapsed = [touchEnds timeIntervalSinceDate:touchBegins]; NSLog (@" Finger Down: %f", elapsed); } @catch (NSException *ex) {} NSLog (@" "); [self updateLabelsFromTouches:touches]; } Console: [Session started at 2010-10-27 10:27:18 -0400.] Tap: 0 Method: touchesBegines & Ends Touch Begin: 2010-10-27 14:27:22 GMT Touch Ends : 2010-10-27 14:27:22 GMT
