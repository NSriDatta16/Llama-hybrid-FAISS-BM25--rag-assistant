All your source file are stored int the src folder of your project. In the apk that is generated all your classes seem to be merged to a classes.dex file. Keep your classes in the res folder and organize them into as many packages as you think you need. I normally have a data package that contains my data classes, packages like sound, database, location... that contain classes/controller for this various topics and then I have a ui package that holds several sub packages for the main branches in my User Interface.
