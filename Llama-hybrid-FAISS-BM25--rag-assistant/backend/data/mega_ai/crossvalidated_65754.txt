Is power analysis necessary in Bayesian Statistics?

I've been researching the Bayesian take on classical statistics lately. After reading about the Bayes factor I've been left wondering if power analysis is a necessity in this view of statistics. My main reason for wondering this is the Bayes factor really just appears to be a likelihood ratio. Once it's like 25:1 it seems like I can call it a night. Am I far off? Any other reading I can do to learn more? Currently reading this book: Introduction to Bayesian Statistics , by W.M. Bolstad (Wiley-Interscience; 2nd ed., 2007).
