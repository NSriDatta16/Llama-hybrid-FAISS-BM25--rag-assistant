TinyMCE is open-source, so you could take a look at how it works under the hood. :) It appears from the installation directions that an HTML form section (to allow submitting the form to the server for storage) is made with a textarea inside which gets replaced with the TineMCE editor. The source itself is referenced from the tiny_mce.js file that is referenced in the target HTML file, so that might be a good starting point to see how it works. Good luck! Edit: Although I didn't spend a lot of time, looking at the source for TinyMCE seems to indicate that the editor itself is inside of an iframe , so that may explain how the images can be displayed in an "editable" area. If you're curious, download the development package , and take a look at the tiny_mce/jscripts/tiny_mce/classes/Editor.js . From around line 400, it appears that they're setting up an iframe and adding it to the DOM of the target HTML.
