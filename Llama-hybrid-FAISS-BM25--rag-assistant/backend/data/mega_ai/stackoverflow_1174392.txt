Acceptable (by ) HIG friendly approach to temporarily highlight a UILabel

I'd like to draw attention temporarily (±1 sec) to a value in a UILabel when a user changes something elsewhere on the screen. I know Apple is pretty particular about what and how people add "pizazz" to their apps...and for the most part I think it's for good reasons but in my case I feel my UI would really benefit from a subtle animated effect of some kind. So I'm asking the UI police if there is an acceptable way to bring "tasteful" attention to a UILabel? Currently I'm animating a color change to a lighter shade and back again but it's not quite "strong" enough. Maybe some kind of a glow effect? (prolly a huge HIG no-no if there is even framework support for it?!?) Edit - Example: There's a good example of what I'm thinking might work that is right in front of our eyes. When you type the the 2nd half of a paren or "]" or "}" in XCode other, corresponding half "(", "[" or "{", is briefly highlighted. How is that accomplished? Is that just a simple view behind the character that fades in and out?
