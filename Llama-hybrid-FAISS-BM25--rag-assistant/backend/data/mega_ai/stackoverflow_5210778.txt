Elegant way to make all dirs in a path

Here are four paths: p1=r'\foo\bar\foobar.txt' p2=r'\foo\bar\foo\foo\foobar.txt' p3=r'\foo\bar\foo\foo2\foobar.txt' p4=r'\foo2\bar\foo\foo\foobar.txt' The directories may or may not exist on a drive. What would be the most elegant way to create the directories in each path? I was thinking about using os.path.split() in a loop, and checking for a dir with os.path.exists , but I don't know it there's a better approach.
