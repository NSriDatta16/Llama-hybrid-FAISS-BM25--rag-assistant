Technically you can use the first principal component of your predictors as the sole predictor (I don't think multiple regression with more than one predictor variable makes sense with 11 observations). However, the interpretation of this is then determined by the data, which determine the principal component. One thing I recommend in such cases is to think hard about how to create a meaningful index for what is relevant to you from your variables rather than using PCA to do it automatically, as the meaningful index will normally give you better interpretation. If however you think you need more than one predictor for what you want to achieve (like interpreting relative importance of the different variables), you are pretty much lost with 11 observations. Generally, in regression problems where the number of dimensions is critically high compared with the number of observations, there are various techniques for dimension reduction and variable selection. PCA is one of them, but this is typically done in situations in which interpretation of the impact of single predictor variables is not a central issue. Also you are much better off in terms of information in the data with, say, 500 observations and 600 variables than with 11 and 11. Statistics is not magic. If you plot your data you should already get a feeling for how difficult it is to precisely locate the line with one predictor and 11 observations (unless residual variance is very small). Making statements about how more predictors work together to explain the observations, taking into account their correlation, is near impossible. Also any diagnosis of the model assumptions will be extremely unreliable if possible at all.
