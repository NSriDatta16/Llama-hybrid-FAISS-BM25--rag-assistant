Help me understand scrolling in javascript(jquery) terms

When you scroll, are you changing the position of something? How can I change the position of the scroll? Specifically to match the cursors movement. What I want to do is scroll the window when I click and drag with the cursor inside the window. For example: I have a 400px by 400px div with a 900px by 900px div inside of it. I want to scroll around by click and dragging. Note, I do NOT want to move the position of the inside div (easily doable with jQuery UI via draggable), just the scroll position. Moving the actual div position messes with my other javascript applications. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!
