Why does "Depth = Semantic representation" in convolutional neural networks?

I was watching some videos online about convolutional networks, and the speaker was discussing the concept of running a filter over an image. He said, and it is also shown in the image below, that "Depth = Semantic representation". This sounds nice, but I'm not sure exactly what is so special about reducing the spatial dimension of the image in favor of increased depth? What makes depth more important than any other dimension? A dimension is just dimension, right? EDIT: I have a hunch that the reason is going to have something to do with translation independence...
