The SunStudio IDE actually used to be half-decent when it was called Forte. Nowadays it seems to be some java NetBeans derivative horror. Last time i worked on Solaris i ended up mounting my home dir onto windows over Samba and using either Eclipse or Visual Studio to edit code. You can create a dummy (in the sense that it doesn't get used for compiling) project and auto-complete and like should work. That does mean command-line compiling and debugging back on Solaris though. I think C++ on Solaris ceased to be a viable development platform once Sun shifted their attention to Java...
