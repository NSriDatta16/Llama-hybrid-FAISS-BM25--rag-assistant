I don't recommend doing this yourself unless you're fairly proficient with assembly. Using SSE will, more than likely, require careful reorganization of your data, as Skizz points out, and the benefit is often questionable at best. It would probably be much better for you to write very small loops and keep your data very tightly organized and just rely on the compiler doing this for you. Both the Intel C Compiler and GCC (since 4.1) can auto-vectorize your code, and will probably do a better job than you. (Just add -ftree-vectorize to your CXXFLAGS.) Edit : Another thing I should mention is that several compilers support assembly intrinsics , which would probably, IMO, be easier to use than the asm() or __asm{} syntax.
