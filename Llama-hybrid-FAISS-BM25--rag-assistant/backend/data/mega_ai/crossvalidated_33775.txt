It would be better to perform a COX regression with an L1 regularisation term, which would give the same type of variable selection you get from the standard least-squares LASSO approach. ISTR there has been at least one paper on this in the journal "Bioinformatics". There is a good paper by Robert Tibshirani, and @miura says that this is implemented in glmnet.
