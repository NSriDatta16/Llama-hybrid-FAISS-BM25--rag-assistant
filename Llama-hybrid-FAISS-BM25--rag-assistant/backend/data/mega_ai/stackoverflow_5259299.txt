change visibility of button on customtask

I actually have a custom task pane on my Outlook add-in that works very well. My problem is that I would like to change visibility of one button presents on my customTaskPane, but I don't know how to do that in my thisAddin. The part of code where I try to do that. Perhaps it's more comprehensible. if (person.Role == 1) { //Person is SysAdmin no Button display //How could I change state of my button ?? } else if (person.Role == 2) { //Person is ServiceAdmin display refused button } else if (person.Role == 3) { //Person is ServiceAgent display refused and considered button when mail is //not considered and respond button where mail is considered }
