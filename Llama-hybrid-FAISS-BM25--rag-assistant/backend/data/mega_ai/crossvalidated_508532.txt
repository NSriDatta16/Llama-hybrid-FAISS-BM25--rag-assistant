Panel regression with moving averages

Suppose I have a panel fixed effects regression of the form $$ Y_{it} = + \beta X_{it} + \alpha_i + \alpha_t + u_{it} $$ where Y is the outcome, X is a set of controls, ai and at constants for each panel group and time period, and uit the error term. The complication is that both Y and X are data presented as rolling averages of 7 time periods within each panel, which introduces serial correlation in the error term (I think). Do you know what approaches can be done to account for this?
