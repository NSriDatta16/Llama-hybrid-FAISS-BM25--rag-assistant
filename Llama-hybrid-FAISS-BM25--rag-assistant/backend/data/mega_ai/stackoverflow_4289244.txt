Couple of questions regarding Nant

I'm wondering about a couple of things about Nant: Can I test an execution of an .exe by using a nant script and then have it terminate immediately afterwards. Should maybe clarify that this is a form application that needs to be verified that it starts and exits normally with a build script. Are there any programs I can run through NAnt script than can take care of code coverage and code inspection that I can get online (free preferably :√ê ).
