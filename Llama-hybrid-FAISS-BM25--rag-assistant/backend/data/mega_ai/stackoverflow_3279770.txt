since you've cut out out your work to widgets the proper thing to do would be for each widget to do a single query for all its required functionality. This would also be the case even if you retrieved widgets via AJAX (which as cbp noted is not a bad idea). Secondly, i would set up some kind of mechanism for each widget to register its existence and then after all widgets have registered then i would fire a single query that would include all widget queries. (technically its again multiple queries but in a single round-trip, see MulriCriteria and MultiQueries in NH reference). Also do not forget that lazy loads are hidden db retrievals and you could have a huge performance impact by using lazy load in a situation where an eager load is proper (for example Foo.Bar.Name where you always show the Bar.Name value when you present the Foo entity) Performance degradation can occur even with less that 20-30 database call per request, but it depends on the size and complexity of your entities, queries, filters as well as the size of the data sets retrieved.
