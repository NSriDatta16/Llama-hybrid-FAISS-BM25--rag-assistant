A combo box control does not have a recordset property. It does have a RowSource property but Access is expecting a SQL string in there. You can change the RowSourceType to the name of a user defined "callback" function. Access help will give you more information including sample code by positioning yourself on the RowSourceType and pressing F1. I use this type of function when I want to give the users a list of available reports, drive letters, or other data that is not available via a SQL query. I don't understand what you mean by your third paragraph with respect to using data directly from the server side. Or rather I don't understand what the problem is with using standard queries.
