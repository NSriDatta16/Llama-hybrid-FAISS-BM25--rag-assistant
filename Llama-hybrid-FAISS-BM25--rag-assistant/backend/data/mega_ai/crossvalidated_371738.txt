Dropped 2 Categories in Dummy Variables (Logistic Regression)

I understand that when modeling, dummy variables should be k-1 and the dropped category should be the baseline. However, I do not know how to interpret if after feature selection 2 more categories of that dummy variable were removed (say I have a dummy variable with 5 categories - 1 would be the baseline, another 2 were removed after feature selection). Should I still interpret it as usual, using the original dropped category as a baseline?
