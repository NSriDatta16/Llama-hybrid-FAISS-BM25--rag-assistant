OpenMP and File I/O

I'm doing some time trials on my code, and logically it seems really easy to parallelize with OpenMP as each trial is independent of the others. As it stands, my code looks something like this: for(int size = 30; size I have a sneaking suspicion that this is kind of a faux pas, however, as two threads may simultaneously write values to the output, thus screwing up the formatting. Is this a problem, and if so, will surrounding the output code with a #pragma omp critical statement fix it?
