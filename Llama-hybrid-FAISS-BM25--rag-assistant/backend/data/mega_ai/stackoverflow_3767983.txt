A naive approach can be taking the sum of the distances between the corresponding points on the two lines.So lets assume both of the lines are of almost same length and the number of points on the lines are approximately same and equidistant. 1.Translate the line 2 so that its start point is same as line 1's starting point. 2. calculate the sum of distances between corresponding points between line 1 and line2. 3. If average distance (i.e. SUM/NUMBER_OF_POINTS) is lesser than the THRESHOLD then lines are similar otherwise they are different. This can be extended to support lines with different sizes. In that case, just enlarge the smaller line to match up to the longer line, then rest can be similar to the above approach. Apart from calculating the distance you can calculate the difference of the slopes of the lines and if different in slopes at any point (or few points, you need to some experiment for this) is way to high (above than some THRESHOLD) then they are not similar.
