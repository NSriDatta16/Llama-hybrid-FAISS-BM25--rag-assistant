Will MSE-based estimator generate symmetric residuals if the error has got symmetric support (not distribution)?

This question is more specific than : my old question Take follow regression model: $y=f(x)+e$ Where $e\sim D$ with a such symmetric support $A=(-a,a)$ , not symmetric distribution. Now given a data set $\{x_i,y_i\}_{i=1}^{N}$ and a estimator $g(.,\mathbf{\beta})$ to $f$ . Will I always get symmetric residuals if: $\beta=argmin_{\beta}(\sum_{i=1}^{N}(g(x_i,\beta)-y_i)^2)$ I've simulated a regression problem where $y=x^2+e$ with $e$ having the follow distribution: $f(e)=\frac{1}{exp(1)-exp(-1)}exp(e) I(e)_{\{-1,1\}}$ That is not symmetric at all: But using random forest with MSE impurity to train $\{x_i,y_i\}_{i=1}^{N}$ I got these residuals: Where are clearly symmetric. I think it'll always happen but I'm not able to proof it.
