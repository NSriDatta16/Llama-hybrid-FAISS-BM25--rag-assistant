Create Resource from asp.net page

is it better to create one resource for every asp.net page application. or to create a global resource for all pages? my application has about 100 pages and 200 usercontrols. if i want to create global resource can how can i use this Feature of visual studio that able us to generate resource file automatically from every page with this way : From Microsoft : 1)Open the page for which you want to create a resource file. 2)Switch to Design View. 3)In the Tools menu, click Generate Local Resource. thanks for attentions :) . Edition : Does Sharepoint has just one resource file?!
