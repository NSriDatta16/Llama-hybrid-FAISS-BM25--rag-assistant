Yes, you might want to access memory address 0x0h. Why you would want to do this is platform-dependent. A processor might use this for a reset vector, such that writing to it causes the CPU to reset. It could also be used for an interrupt vector, as a memory-mapped interface to some hardware resource (program counter, system clock, etc), or it could even be valid as a plain old memory address. There is nothing necessarily magical about memory address zero, it is just one that was historically used for special purposes (reset vectors and the like). C-like languages follow this tradition by using zero as the address for a NULL pointer, but in reality the underlying hardware may or may not see address zero as special. The need to access address zero usually arises only in low-level details like bootloaders or drivers. In these cases, the compiler can provide options/pragmas to compile a section of code without optimizations (to prevent the zero pointer from being extracted away as a NULL pointer) or inline assembly can be used to access the true address zero.
