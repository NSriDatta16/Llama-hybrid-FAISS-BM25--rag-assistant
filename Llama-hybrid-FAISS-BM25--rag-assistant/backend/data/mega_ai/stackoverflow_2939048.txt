In short, no. The generally accepted approach is to either educate your team on how to develop against your libraries or redesign. The first solution can be done quite easily by building docs with phpdoc and setting the visibility in the docbloc comments with @visibility, and of course actually documenting the classes. The second I wouldn't be able to comment on without knowing a little more detail. /** * Some helper class for LibraryInterface * * ATTENTION! * This class should not be used outside this package. * * @visibility package * @package mypackage */ class Helper { public function doStuff() { /* does stuff */ } } /** * Class for accessing some part of the library. * * @visibility public * @package mypackage */ class LibraryInterface { public function doStuff() { $this->helper->doStuff(); } }
