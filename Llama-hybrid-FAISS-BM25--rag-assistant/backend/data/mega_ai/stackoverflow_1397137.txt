There are about 2000 medical record vendors. I do not know a lot about costs, markups price points in the market but I will say that the software is usually phenomenally expensive. It seems to be based on "what the market can bear". Almost every package I have used looks completely amateur compared to software in almost any other category I have used. It maybe that the market is quite small when it is divided by 2000 vendors. Most database software and general business software would do the job quite well but there are peculiarities to medicine such as HIPAA. One of the most intelligent pieces of medical software that I have seen (at least for documenting evaluation and management encoutners) is Praxis . You have to be a doctor who is in practice to realize how genius it is. Disclaimer: I have not used it but wish I could. Penultimately, for medical software to work the patient has to have a portal into it so that they can update, or bring attention to, mistakes. Finally, all medical software is fantastic when demonstrated. One only knows its flaws when one uses it on every patient for about 6 weeks.
