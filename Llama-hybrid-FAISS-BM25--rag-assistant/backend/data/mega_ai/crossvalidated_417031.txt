Colin Carol has a nice blog series on doing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (the method by which Stan and PyMC3 do the sampling) from scratch. It's really good, and he even has a github repo called minimcmc which does some sampling. If you are interested in MCMC/HMC, I would start there. If you want to avoid MCMC/HMC all together, you are really limiting yourself. Gelman has an example of the beta binomial hierarchical model in chapter 5 of Bayesian Data Analysis. I managed to implement that model here both analytically and with pyMC3. I think these are some good resources to get you started.
