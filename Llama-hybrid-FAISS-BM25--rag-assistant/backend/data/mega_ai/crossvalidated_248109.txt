The sigmoid activation is good for outputs bounded between 0 and 1 such as probabilities for classification. In case you don't need specific bounds you can use other non-linearities like ReLU(x) = max(0,x). In case you do know some bounds for the output you can use the sigmoid and then do a linear transformation. Warning : I saw that you are trying to train a Neural Network for a time series. Note that if you're starting with Neural Networks you may want to start with a simple FeedForward network applied to some simple problem (sequences are usually handled with Recurrent Neural Nets which are harder to train).
