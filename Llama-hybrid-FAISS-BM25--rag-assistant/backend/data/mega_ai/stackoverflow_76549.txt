How are Integer arrays stored internally, in the JVM?

An array of ints in java is stored as a block of 32-bit values in memory. How is an array of Integer objects stored? i.e. int[] vs. Integer[] I'd imagine that each element in the Integer array is a reference to an Integer object, and that the Integer object has object storage overheads, just like any other object. I'm hoping however that the JVM does some magical cleverness under the hood given that Integers are immutable and stores it just like an array of ints. Is my hope woefully naive? Is an Integer array much slower than an int array in an application where every last ounce of performance matters?
