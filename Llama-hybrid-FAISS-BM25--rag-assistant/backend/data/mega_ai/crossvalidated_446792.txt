$$covariance(x,y) = {correlation(x,y) * \sigma(x) * \sigma(y)}.$$ where ${\sigma(x) \ and \ \sigma(y) }$ are standard deviation of x and y respectively For more details check out this blog post "Baffled by Covariance and Correlation???" https://towardsdatascience.com/let-us-understand-the-correlation-matrix-and-covariance-matrix-d42e6b643c22 and this video "covariance and correlation by Ben Lambert" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDw3hC2YNFc I hope this helps.
