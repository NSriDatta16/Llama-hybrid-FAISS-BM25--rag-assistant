What you used to be able to do to speed things up was to use incremental pointers to speed up accessing the array. So using a simple array. char aString[500]; for (int i=0; i becomes char aString[500]; char *aStringPtr; for (aStringPtr= &aString[0] ; aStringPtr This runs about twice as fast as the first example.
