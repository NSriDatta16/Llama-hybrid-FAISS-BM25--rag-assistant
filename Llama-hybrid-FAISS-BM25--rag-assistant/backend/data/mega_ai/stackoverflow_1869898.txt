Before you start designing a solution, I would recommend taking some time to better understand the issue. A good starting point is the CLR profiler . It will let you see what's going on with the memory allocations and garbage collector. It could be that the GC is not able to keep up with the memory allocations. The GC will normally take care of keeping the memory space tidy, including defragmentation. Depending on what you find, you may need to trigger the GC manually.
