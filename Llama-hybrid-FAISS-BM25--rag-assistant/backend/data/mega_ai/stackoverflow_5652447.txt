Relocate Line2D Java

I'm working with Java's Line2D.Float. I'm trying to accomplish some sort of drag and drop for this shape. I already get the selected Line2D object, I just need to figure out how to actually move it to the new coordinates. I need something like this: ( (Line2D)selectedShape).setLocation(newX, newY); selectedShape is a Shape Object, that's why I add the casting. Thank you.
