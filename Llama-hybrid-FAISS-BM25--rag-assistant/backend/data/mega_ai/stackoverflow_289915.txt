Interactive Statistical Analysis tool

I'm looking for a basic software for statistical analysis. Most important is simple and intuitive use, getting started "right out of the box". At least basic operations should be interactive. Free would be a bonus :) The purpose is analysis of data dumps and logs of various processes. Importing a comma/tab separated file sorting and filtering rows on conditions basic aggregates: count, average, deviation, regression, trend visualization - plotting the data,bin distribution etc. Excel fails (at least for me) for the filtering and re-combining data, I guess something like "Excel with SQL" would be nice. I've been using MS Access + Excel and copying around data before, but that's a pain. Do you have any recommendation? Clarification I am not looking for a specific tool for IIS/web server logs, but various data end event logs (mostly from custom applications) with tab-separated values.
