PCA regression coefficients recovery

Assume we have a simple linear model $$y = b^TX + \epsilon$$ for which we want to reduce the number of variables. We perform a PCA reduction on $X$ such that $$Z_{j} = \gamma^{T}_{j}(X-\mu)$$ where the $j$ th component of the rotated vector $Z$ is the $j$ th principal component of $X$ , $\gamma_{j}$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the $j$ th ordered eigenvalue and $\mu$ is the mean. Then, we run a linear regression on $$y=b_{*}^{T}Z + \epsilon$$ Is it possible to recover $b$ ?
