This should be simple. But how do I design this?

I have 2 kinds of business units; division and department. A business units has to be one or the other, but cannot be both. So this is easy enough. Have a BusinessUnit table and a BusinessUnitType lookup table containing division and department. However only divisions can contain teams. For each division there are one to many teams. Departments do not have teams. So what should I be doing here? Maybe I should have a flag on the BusinessUnitType table called hasTeam? Is that the best way to organise this data? I am not sure if this particular design has a name.
