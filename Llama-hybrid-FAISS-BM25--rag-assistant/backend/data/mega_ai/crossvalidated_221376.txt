This is more of a comment or suggestion rather than an answer, but I think you ask an important question here. As someone who works exclusively with multilevel data, I can say that I have found very little about machine learning with multilevel data. However, Dan Martin, a recent PhD graduate in quantitative psychology at the University of Virginia, did his dissertation on the use of regression trees with multilevel data. Below is a link to an R package he wrote for some of these purposes: https://github.com/dpmartin42/mleda/blob/master/README.md Also, you can find his dissertation here: http://dpmartin42.github.io/about.html
