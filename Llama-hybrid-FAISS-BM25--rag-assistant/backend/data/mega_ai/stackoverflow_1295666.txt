Using Office 2007 UI ribbon .dll file with my project

I have downloaded the official office 2007 UI ribbon .dll, but now what? I am coding in VB.net. I do not know where to place this .dll, and I do not see any additional controls anywhere at all. The readme explains how to license your copy, which I have done. Now what? I am hoping to magically see the ribbon control in the list of components I can add somewhere, but its just not there.... Is there even a way to use this as a drag-n-drop component with the WYSIWYG Design View? EDIT: To clarify, my goal is to use the Ribbon in my own work, not to modify the Office ribbon or to develop a plugin for it. I cannot find any free ribbon anywhere, and I am not sure if this .dll I have is what I need.
