How to write a complex query with this data?

I have a table type: id | text | tel | time ---------------------------- 1 | text1 | tel1 | unixtime 2 | text1 | tel1 | unixtime 3 | text1 | tel1 | unixtime 4 | text2 | tel2 | unixtime 5 | text3 | tel3 | unixtime 6 | text3 | tel3 | unixtime I want it "clean", try to delete all rows where is text = tel , and leave one with the largest time . I began like this: SELECT concat(`text`, `tel`), count(concat(`text`, `tel`)) FROM `ads` GROUP by concat(`text`, `tel`) Having count(concat(`text`, `tel`)) > 1 Something as something works, but something all wrong (but still I can not guess how to remove, leaving only a one record of repeating).
