Why aren't these sentences about confidence intervals equivalent?

Yes, I'm aware that there's similar/duplicated questions already open: Aren't these statements about confidence intervals equivalent? Why does a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) not imply a 95% chance of containing the mean? Are there any examples where Bayesian credible intervals are obviously inferior to frequentist confidence intervals When do (and don't) confidence intervals and credible intervals coincide? But funny enough, NONE of these questions has any answer marked as the right one, so this question is, technically, still unsolved in this site. I have read the answers and other related questions but I don't exactly see the difference yet so I will try to explain why I think these are equivalent expressions. Given a confidence interval $CI_D$ for some unknown fixed parameter $\theta$ calculated from a dataset $D$ , why aren't these three sentences equivalent? If I repeat the experiment an infinite amount of times and I get an infinite amount of calculated confidance intervals, 95% of them will contain $\theta$ . There's a 95% probability that $CI_D$ contains $\theta$ . There's a 95% probability that $\theta$ is in $CI_D$ . Why I think these sentences are equivalent? Sentences 1 and 2 are equivalent for me because I don't know if $CI_D$ is one of the 95% of intervals that contains $\theta$ , which is the same as saying that $CI_D$ has a probability of 95% of being one of intervals that contains $\theta$ , which is the same as saying that there's a probability of 95% that $CI_D$ contains $\theta$ . Senteces 2 and 3 are equivalent because " $CI_D$ contains $\theta$ " is equivalent to say " $\theta$ is in $CI_D$ ", because both sentences are translated as $\theta\in CI_D$ . So $P[CI_D\ contains\ \theta] = 0.95$ is the same as saying $P[\theta\ is\ in\ CI_D] = 0.95$ , because they are both the same as saying $P[\theta\in CI_D]=0.95$ . Am I right? I know that frequentists doesn't allow to say "probability of fact around $X$ " when $X$ is not a random variable (and $\theta$ is not because it's a constant), but $CI_D$ is and 2 and 3 speak about the probability of the relationship between $\theta$ and $CI_D$ . So I'm not fully convinced that "probability of $\theta\in CI_D$ " goes against the fact that $\theta$ is not a random variable, because $CI_D$ is a random variable and is also present in the same sentence (it tells something about $\theta$ , but it also tells something about the $CI_D$ ).
