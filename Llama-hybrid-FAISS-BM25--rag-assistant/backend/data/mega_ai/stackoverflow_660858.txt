Here's my go at it; this JavaScript snippet should go into the head of your page: process = function() { window.open('about:blank', 'popup', 'width=320,height=240,resizeable=no'); document.login.setAttribute('target', 'popup'); document.login.setAttribute('onsubmit', ''); document.login.submit(); }; And this is a sample form for demonstration purposes: Username: Now, here's what's happening: first, we set up a form and give it an onsubmit attribute that tells it to run the function process() and return false; instead of submitting normally; from this point, that function takes over and creates a popup window, giving it a name, and some features (by all means, add any surplus ones you'd like), and then attention comes back to the form, where we now set the target attribute to the name of the window we just created. We then have to clear that onsubmit that we set earlier, or this same exact thing will happen again, and that's certainly not what you want. Finally, we just have the form submitted again and it now passes all of its information to the popped window; from there, it's just getting handle.html (or whatever you end up calling your processing page) to do its work with the data. Hope I've helped.
