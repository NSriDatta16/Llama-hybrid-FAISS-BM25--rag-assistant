jQuery convert HTML Table to XML

I am retrieving HTML from a remote host with the following jQuery code var loadUrl = "URL.html"; $("#result") .html(ajax_load) .load(loadUrl + " table.schedule"); Which gives me the following HTML Name column A column B 1 A1 B1 2 A2 B2 Name column C column D 3 C1 D1 4 C2 D2 The number of TR & TDs can change, and I want to retrieve the data for column A,B,C,D and "transform" the HTML into a list format like the following XML. A1 A2 B1 B2 C1 C2 D1 D2 I have tried the following code, which provides me with the first column data, but it also concatenates all the TDs from both Tables into one list. $("#load_get").click(function(){ var xml = " "; $("#result") .find("tr").each(function() { xml += " "; xml += $(this).find("td").eq(1).html() + "\n"; xml += " "; } ); xml += " "; alert(xml); }); Please help. EDIT Thank you Polarblau, Federic & Albert for your responses. They helped a lot, sorry to change the goal, but if i could modify the scenario slightly. This is the same HTML, except it has a header in the first TR, there are two tables and the first column is ignored as before. ignore Header1 header2 ignore A1 B1 ignore A2 B2 //second table The XML i wish to have, needs to grab the Header(TH) and use it in the TD loop to set the name attribute, like so. A1 A2 B1 B2 //second table xml I tried unsuccessfully, to modify your solutions to achieve this.
