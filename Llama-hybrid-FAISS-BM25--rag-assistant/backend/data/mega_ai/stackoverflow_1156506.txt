In addition to the other comments here about overthinking a log storage scenario, you should consider partitioning the table (by date), and if extensive reporting is required, think about transforming the data to another format (either dimensionalized or summarized) for reporting. For example, USERAGENT is a primary candidate for a (possibly snowflake) dimension, replacing your long string with a surrogate integer. You could retain minimal information in the log table after it has been archived to whatever permanent storage (potentiall transformed) is dictated by requirements.
