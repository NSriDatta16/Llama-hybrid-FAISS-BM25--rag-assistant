Is it valuable to normalize/rescale labels in neural network regression?

Have there been any papers, or does anyone have any specific experience to know whether normalizing labels in a regression problem is likely to improve the performance of a neural network? I have labels that are in the range (0,1000) applying square loss in a ConvNet. I want to know if it might be useful to normalize these to a (0,1) range, or whether that's known to not matter.
