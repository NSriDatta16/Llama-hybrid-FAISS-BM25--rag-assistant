Inference in Bayesian networks with hidden variables

Suppose I have the Bayesian network in the figure and the corresponding conditional probability table for each node, where A and B are the hidden variables, and C and D are the observed variables. What probabilistic inference algorithm can I use to get all the conditional probabilities in Table - 1? can I use likelihood weighting sampling inference algorithm ? If the network becomes the bottom one, is the likelihood weighting sampling inference algorithm appropriate?
