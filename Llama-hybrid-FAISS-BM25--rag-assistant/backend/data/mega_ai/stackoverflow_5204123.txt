C constants throwing compile-time errors

Several people have commented on my C code here, saying that I should use constants as loop counters, rather than hard-writing them. I agree with them, since that is my practice when writing Java code, but I'm having compile-time errors thrown when I try to use constants in array declarations and loop conditionals. To declare a constant in C, the syntax is #define NAME value . In my code, I have two constants, BUFFER is the file read buffer, and PACKED is the output array size. I use BUFFER to initialize char inputBuffer[BUFFER]; as a global variable, which works, but when I try to use PACKED #define PACKED 7; // this line is in the header of file, just below preprocessors int packedCount; char inputPack[PACKED]; //compression storage for (packedCount=0; packedCount I get am error: expected ‘]’ before ‘;’ token at char inputPack[PACKED] AND error: expected expression before ‘;’ token in the loop initialization line. Both errors disappear when I replace PACKED with 7.
