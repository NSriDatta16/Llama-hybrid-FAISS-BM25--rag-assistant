Would it be possible to use Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)? If you assume a distribution for the number of competitors (e.g. Poisson), select a subset of competitors each iteration and simulate your data using multinomial distributions with probabilities based on competitors' features, after discarding parameters that don't match your training data, you should be able to obtain parameters for each competitor (that is, posterior distributions) and generate more races. This might not work if the number of competitors is so important that it affects the coefficients of features for each competitor.
