which classification model allows user to choose importance of data inputs?

I am working on a match analytics project where I have to deal with the situation in which I am having some inputs like skills, experience, certifications etc. and my output is candidate selected Yes or No, my problem is, Is there any algorithm which will allow users to give weightage to one Input than the others? For example skills matters more for someone whereas for other user experience matters . I have tried neural network and Naive bayes algorithm but unable to choose importance of variable . Any help will be highly appreciable.
