DHARMa problems: Poisson or Zero-inflated negative binomial model?

I have a dataset of abundance of of rodent ( AA ) in 63 sites, which located in two main area (northern and southern part, NS ). AA only appeared in 15 sites, so there are 48 sites have 0 value(mean = 1.349; variance = 11.17). I want to know which environmental factors could explain the abundance of AA, and since there are lots of 0 in my data, so I conducted glmmTMB function to build a negative-binomial mixed model (familiy: nbinom2) with NS as the random effect. Model averaging was used to build the model (package MuMIn ), but the error kept showing up when generating all subsets using dredge , and model averaging did not work (Same results when I used nbinom1 family). Model convergence problem; non-positive-definite Hessian matrix. See vignette('troubleshooting') In fitTMB(TMBStruc) So I changed the family option to poisson and ran the model averaging again, this time the results came out, but I'm not sure if poisson distribution fit my data, then I used DHARMa to check if there is an overdispersion problem: test here is the results: Questions: Does the results mean the model is fine with poisson distribution? Even there are many 0 value in my data. I've checked the Owl example (count data) in the manuscript , but I still not sure if I could chose the poisson distribution for my model based on the diagnostic test results of DHARMa .
