C.A.R. Hoare's select algorithm is designed for precisely this purpose. It executes in [expected] linear time, with logarithmic extra storage. Edit: the obvious alternative of sorting, then picking the right element has O(N log N) complexity instead of O(N). Storing the i largest elements in sorted order requires O(i) auxiliary storage, and roughly O(N * i log i) complexity. This can be a win if i is known a priori to be quite small (e.g. 1 or 2). For more general use, select is usually better. Edit2: offhand, I don't have a good reference for it, but described the idea in a previous answer .
