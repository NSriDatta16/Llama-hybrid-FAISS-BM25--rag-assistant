Update Magento cron job setting in config.xml of a given module

I want to set the cron job in the config file of the Catalog module to be ran at a different time. Currently it is setup like this in the config.xml 0 2 * * * catalog/product_indexer_price::reindexAll I have already made overloads to classes in the Catalog Module in my own Catalog Module in the local directory. I put the following in my config.xml file but it never gets added to the cron schedule table */2 * * * * catalog/product_indexer_price::reindexAll Obviously I am trying to do it every 2 minutes for testing. Or is the only way to update the config files is to copy it and put it in a local/Mage/... directory?
