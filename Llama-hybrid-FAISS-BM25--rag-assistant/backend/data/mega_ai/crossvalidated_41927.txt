First, multiclass logistic regression is a linear classifier, are your inputs linearly separable? If they're handwritten digits I highly doubt it. Next, multiclass logistic regression uses the softmax function to assign class probabilities, $$ p(Y = i|X = x) = \frac{\exp(f_i(x))}{\sum_{j=1}^n \exp(f_j(x))}, $$ and normally you will use a $1$-of-$k$ binary encoding for your outputs. However since the output of the softmax only matches this encoding asymptotically as $f_i(x) \longrightarrow \pm\infty$, you'll always have some error and thus your gradient will never be 0. There are probably many ways you can assess convergence but here are some ideas, Use the value of the $0$-$1$ loss to assess convergence rather than whatever differentiable loss you're using for gradient descent. Stop training when your parameter changes are smaller than some threshold.
