Considering my predilection for R , I am going to do something unlikely: I would advise you not to use R or any other program . If you agree to the principle that the production should be done correctly, I think you would agree with the principle that determining the inspection criteria and the inspection itself should be as simple as possible (but you can call it a "decision tree" to justify your title): Question 1: Is the supply of your part stable? A1 == NO. Considering a type of widget: if the supply of this widget is not in a state of control , strongly consider 100% inspection (Deming, 1986). DONE. A1 == YES. OK. . . Question 2: Does the cost of testing outweigh the cost of not testing? If the supply of this part is in control , you can adopt an all-or-nothing testing strategy (Deming, 1986), given : p = [historic] average percent defective [from] incoming lots of parts (e.g. received 100 widgets Friday, 3 defective; p = 3%). Remember: stable process exists! k = cost to inspect one part l = cost to dismantle, repair, reassemble, and test an assembly that fails because a defective part was put into the production line. k/l = break even quality, or break-even point (always between 0 and 1) A2 == NO. If p > k/l inspect 100%. You will save money with each inspection by preventing expensive mistakes further down the production line. DONE. A2 == YES. If p inspect 0%. You will lose money with each inspection by spending valuable time inspecting parts that are most likely acceptable. DONE. The statistical proof of this is "exceedingly simple," but involves a chart which I might attempt to reproduce later if I'm feeling ambitious. I would encourage you to find a copy of the text which I created this answer from: Deming, W. E. (1986). Out of the Crisis (Ch 15). Cambridge, MA: MIT Center for Advanced Engineering Study.
