My understanding is that the ItemsControl is based on the idea that for each item it only creates and adds one control to the itemshost. Creating both a GridSplitter and the default itemcontainer per item goes against this principle. Since you only have one column, and only want to resize vertically, i'd suggest writing your own panel, which behaves like a StackPanel but always leaves a gap of a few pixels between the child elements. If the mouse is over this gap, and the user begins to drag, the panel can resize the nearest child elements. So the resize logic would have to be implemented on the custom panel., which is think the biggest drawback, but IMO well worth it because it is tucked away in one place only. You don't need to do anything special in your ItemsControl/ItemTemplate/ItemContainerStyle other than use this Panel as itemshost. You could also use a standard StackPanel and add mouse handlers to it which implement the resize logic. But then you'd have to set a margin in your ItemContainerStyle to create the gaps.
