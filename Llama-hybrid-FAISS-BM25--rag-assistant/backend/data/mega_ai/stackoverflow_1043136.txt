action script 3 and custom image itemrenderers

I have a custom item renderer which displays a different gif in the row depending on data value from the data object. When i set the image source url using the absolute path and not embedding it works fine however when i embed the images i find that when i scroll up and down the grid the images get messed up and sometimes sit on top of each other. Does anyone have any ideas on why embedding images in my hbox item renderer is causing so hassle; code public var equipment:Image; public var compr_icons:Bitmap = new AssetManager.COMPUTER_ICON; .. do some logic equipment.addChild(compr_icons);
