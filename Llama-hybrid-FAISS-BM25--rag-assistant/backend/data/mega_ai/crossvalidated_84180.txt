On your first question: GPs are Bayesian because they involve constructing a prior distribution (here over functions directly rather than over parameters) and updating this distribution by conditioning on the data. The Gaussian part just makes the resulting posterior friendlier to work with than it might be otherwise. On your second question: you might ask how your last equation is realised by the 'even simpler approach' described in section 4.2. Things are indeed being integrated out there.
