I would encourage you to take another look at MS sync framework. We have a situation where we want to synchronize occasionally connected C# clients apps with our Java/Oracle backend. You can use the sync framework providers for the C# client and implement your own custom subclass of KnowledgeSyncProvider for the backend. This will get you half-way there, and show you a good pattern to apply for the rest.
