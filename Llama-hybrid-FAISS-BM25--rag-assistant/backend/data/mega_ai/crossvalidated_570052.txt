How to visually interpret Augmented Dickey-Fuller test results between two time series?

Time-series #1 and #2 are daily reported disease cases in the Central vs. Southern regions, respectively. The p-values from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is less than 5% for #1 and more than 5% for #2. So that means Time-series #1 is non-stationary while Time-series #2 is stationary. Visually examining the two graphs, it seems they don't have a trend, but #1 seems to have a stronger seasonality component than #2, is it the reason why #1 is deemed non-stationary while #2 as stationary from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test?
