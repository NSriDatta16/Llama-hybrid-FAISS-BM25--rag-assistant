 Dungeon implemented a new algorithm for content moderation to prevent instances of text-based simulated child pornography created by users. The moderation process involved a human moderator reading through private stories. The filter frequently flagged false positives due to wording (terms like "eight-year-old laptop" misinterpreted as the age of a child), affecting both pornographic and non-pornographic stories. Controversy and review bombing of AI Dungeon occurred as a result of the moderation system, citing false positives and a lack of communication between Latitude and its user base following the change. Addition of advertisements In June 2022, AI Dungeon added advertisements to replace the past "energy" system, in which users would need to wait for energy to refill to generate more content. The advertisement system would allow for infinite tries of AI output, but would occasionally interrupt gameplay with advertisements. This addition received backlash from users, and Latitude would add a beta system in response, allowing storing of actions through watching advertisements. The advertisement system was removed by the end of 2022. References External links Official website Original open-source code for AI Dungeon on GitHub (archived)
