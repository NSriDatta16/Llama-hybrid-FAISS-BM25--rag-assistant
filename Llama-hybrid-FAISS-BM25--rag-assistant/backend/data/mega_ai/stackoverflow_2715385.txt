Convert webpage to image from ASP.NET

I would like to create a function in C# that takes a specific webpage and coverts it to a JPG image from within ASP.NET. I don't want to do this via a third party or thumbnail service as I need the full image. I assume I would need to somehow leverage the webbrowser control from within ASP.NET but I just can't see where to get started. Does anyone have examples?
