I created a bare HTML page with with an insane large table: 100,000 cells spread over 1000 columns and 100 rows, each filled with "x". The XHTML-valid one is about 10MB in size and the HTML-valid one is about 5MB in size. I tested it in 3 runs on FF 3.6.11 and IE8. Browsers are started clean on every run. FF took on average 2 minutes and 5 seconds for the XHTML valid one and 1 minute and 15 seconds for the HTML valid one. IE8 took on average 1 minute and 40 seconds for the XHTML valid one and the same time for the HTML valid one. It however ends up with a blank page on all occurrences. Above results are open for further interpretation. To me, I would worry more about network bandwidth and maintainability than about browser's capabilities. Network bandwidth costs more $$$.
