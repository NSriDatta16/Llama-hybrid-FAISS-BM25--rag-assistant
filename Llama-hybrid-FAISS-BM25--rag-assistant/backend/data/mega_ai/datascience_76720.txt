How can I encode a 'Name' so that similar names are represented by vectors close in n-dimensional plane?

I want to encode names of people for similarity comparison between them such that a name like 'Sarah' is closer when represented in vector to a name like 'Sarah connor', something very similar to what word2vec does but it uses sentences to train but I only have list of words. Using string matching algorithms like Levenshtein distance and Jaccard Index, I can find similarity between them but this can't be used to derive vector embeddings of these words satisfying above conditions, or can they ? If not is there a way to encode these list of names such that the condition of similar names (based on characters and other conditions) are closer in n-dimensional space, n being the vector length of these embeddings.
