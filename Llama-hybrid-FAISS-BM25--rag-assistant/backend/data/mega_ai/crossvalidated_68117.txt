Weka has a Libsvm package which includes the one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier which is quite widely used for outlier detection problems. To begin with, here is a nice lecture on one-class SVM -- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNGtj2iEw6g . And below are the two widely read references on one-class SVM: -- Sch√∂lkopf, B., J. C. Platt, et al. (2001). "Estimating the Support of a High-Dimensional Distribution." Neural Computation 13(7): 1443-1471. -- Tax, D. J. and R. W. Duin (2004). "Support Vector Data Description." Machine Learning 54(1): 45-66. Hope this helps.
