Encoding ID variables for machine learning

Is it possible to encode ID variables for an ML model in a way that the model can work with IDs not seen before? For example, I want to predict the sentiment of a tweet, the account it may be originating from, and directed to, may help the classifier a lot to decide whether classify it as negative or positive. Hence, is it possible to pass these features to the model in a way that, if a known id (shown whilst training) appears, it can help the prediction, and if there's a new id (unseen whilst training), the model can still work with it; either by no having impact whatsoever or by weighting the fact that it is an unrecognized id? If so, how would a Python + Sklearn implementation look like?
