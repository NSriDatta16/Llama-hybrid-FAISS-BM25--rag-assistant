Just from the data entry vantage point, splitting the files on double newlines seems like an accident (or an embarrassing off-by-one error) waiting to happen. If the concept of chapter and paragraph are the same in the two translations, you'd be safer including that information in the file. Something like ... FR.txt -- :i,j,k ==> Chapter i, Paragraph j, Sentence/Clause k ------ :1,1,0 Chapter premiere :1,1,1 Une petite ville ... EN.txt ------ ... :1,1,4 No sooner has one entered the town ...Eh! It belongs to the Mayor. ... When you iterate through the French file, you keep track of the last piece of index information you saw when you found the right text, then you look for the same index information in the English file and print out the text that follows. In addition to making you less vulnerable to input errors (typing an extra newline somewhere), this approach gives you additional ways to organize the data. Maybe someday you will sort the French text alphabetically to let you find text faster, while keeping the English text ordered by index to lookup text by index. Maybe in the future you will retrieve this data out of a database. To answer your second question, it is possible to massage your warning messages, but it's not something that beginners usually try to do. It involves installing a __WARN__ handler . The perldoc for warn gives a gentle enough introduction to the concept. For your application it might look something like: $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { my $msg = shift; if ($msg =~ /Use of uninitialized value/) { warn "Oops! No value was found.\n"; # ok to call "warn" inside handler } else { warn $msg; } };
