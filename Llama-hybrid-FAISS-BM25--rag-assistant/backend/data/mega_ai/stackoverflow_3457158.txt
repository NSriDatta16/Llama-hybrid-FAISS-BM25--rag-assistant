How to Solve a Machine Learning Challenge?

There is a container, for example lets say which has a volume of "V". The container needs to be filled with various types of boxes, where each type has a unique size (volume), for example lets say Box Type A - has a volume of K Box Type B - has a volume of L Now the problem is that there is a requirement to find out whats the maximum number of boxes of both types which could be fit into the container (combination of both boxes) To simplify lets say that "W" and "R" are quantities, then we get (K * W) + (L * R) = V AND how the cartons(boxes) should be stacked up in the container. For example the first row (by row I mean when the boxes are laid x co-ordinate wise) of boxes in the container should contain 4 stacks (starting from the floor of the container) of "Box Type A" and the topmost two stacks (nearing the top ceiling of the container) with "Box Type B" (By stacks I mean when the boxes are laid on top of each other [z co-ordinate wise]).Thereafter a new row is laid after the previous one is complete till the whole container is full. The problem is what is the best way to layout these boxes in the container as to utilize all (or most) of the space in the container, and pack in the maximum possible number of boxes which can be a combination of 1 or more (max around 5 type of boxes in one container). The program should simply take the inputs of the types and details of the boxes, the container and voil√† you get a full detailed analysis. The problem is that I have not touched the area of machine learning or solving this kind of problem. I would appreciate if I was given advice on as what algorithm/s to use, where to start learning to solving this problem and such, whats the best way to approach this, any helpful machine learning libraries to use, etc.
