How can I create a GUI in Java using only code and not the graphical drag and drop? [uber-newbie]

I've been told that creating GUI's using drag and drop generates unnecesary code and is frowned upon by most Java developers. I'm used to dragging and dropping things using Windows Forms **but ** I'm also very comfortable creating things using XAML for WPF applications. I'm a bit lost however on how to create a basic GUI in Java using only code. What I'm using: Netbeans 6.8 What I want to do: Create a simple Window that will act as the main one that opens up when the application launches. How can I create a simple Window with the standard window buttons (close, minimize, maximize) and have a little button on the middle of it. Using only code. Also, what type of project do I create using NetBeans? Thanks for the help.
