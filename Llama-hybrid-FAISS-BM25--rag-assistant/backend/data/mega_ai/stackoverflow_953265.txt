Visual Studio will do this for you. So too will Altova Xml Spy. There are also a number of free tools that can do this for you; check out DanSharp XmlViewer @ http://www.bizbert.com/bizbert/2007/11/25/DanSharp+XmlViewer.aspx this does a great job of assisting with XPath statements and XSD validations etc.
