In your model you should store the values in one type of measurement unit. You don't "do the math" differently depending on what unit is being used, the calculations are always the same. You just need to accept and display units of different types. In order to display and accept the values, your text fields should use an NSValueTransformer . A subclass of NSValueTransformer allows you to display a transformed version of a value and optionally, to reverse transform the value on input. So if your model stores values in centimetres, you'd use an NSValueTransformer that converts centimetres to inches and in its -reverseTransformValue: method, converts inches to centimetres. So, when the user types a value in inches, the value is stored in your model in centimetres. In your case, your NSValueTransformer would need to use the current units setting that has been stored in NSUserDefaults to change the way it transforms the units.
