Exploratory factor analysis: Should one use factor scores or the mean of items?

When we are trying to measure a latent construct (let's call it $C$), we often give people a number of items $X$ to fill out (let's call them $x_1, ..., x_q$ where $q$ is the number of items) that we assume measure this latent construct $C$. Let's assume that all of $x_i$ are a valid measure of $C$. When we do an exploratory factor analysis (as we generally do in my field, psychology) or a principal components analysis (as its substitute), we tend to look if all of the items "hang together" (highly loaded) on a factor. Let's assume that they do. The analyst now has a choice. How do the items approximate $C$ given all the $x$s? I see two broad options to estimate the value of $C$ for a person: Average all the items together Save factor score The first choice above is used in 100% of the studies I have ever read. My question: Is it more accurate to use factor scores than averaging the items together as an estimate of the construct value? I tried to get at this with a very simple simulation example. The code is: library(tidyverse) library(psych) set.seed(1839) fscores_diff % mutate( X_fscores = factor.scores(dat[,2:5], efa, method="tenBerge")$scores, # save factor scores X_average = (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4)/4 # make average ) actual_cor Here are what the correlations looked like on the first loop: Actual correlation: .170 Correlation when approximating $X$ using factor score: .164 ...using average of the items: .163 And here is what the summary statistics look like for the difference between actual and the approximations: > # about the same difference > mean(fscores_diff) [1] 0.002969406 > mean(average_diff) [1] 0.002908312 > > # about the same variance, as well > sd(fscores_diff) [1] 0.02516624 > sd(average_diff) [1] 0.02469756 However, my example relies on a specific number of variables and all assumptions of a factor analysis are met. Also, I specified that each item was influenced equally by $C$. I got some issues with the fa function when estimating it otherwise. Anyone know of a paper that addresses this? Is there any benefit to using factor scores over averages among the items?
