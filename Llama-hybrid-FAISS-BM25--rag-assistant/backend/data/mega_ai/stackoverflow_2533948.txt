You have several magic numbers, whose purpose I'm not sure of, e.g numcount1 = -2.3 In general you want to avoid magic numbers. You might want to give your variables more descriptive names than num1, num2, etc. Could you explain more precisely what the parameters are for your assignment? EDIT: I've noticed that you are using very weird conditions to control your loop. You are continuing until numcount1 is = 2.9, which is a very fragile sort of setup. The first thing I would do in your shoes is to rewrite your program so that the loop terminates when there are no more numbers to add. (Alternatively, you could just make it stop after, say 12 values.) EDIT AGAIN: OK, how about this int sumOfPos = 0, sumOfNeg = 0, currentValue = -2.3, terminationValue = 2.9; while (currentValue
