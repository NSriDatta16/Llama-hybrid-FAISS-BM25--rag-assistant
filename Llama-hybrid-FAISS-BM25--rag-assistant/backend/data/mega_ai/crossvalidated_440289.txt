Visualizing categorical data with 7 variables

I'm working with a grouped data set on the presence of a particular disease (Byssinosis): >head(data) Employment Smoking Sex Race Workspace Byssinosis Non.Byssinosis 1 str(data) 'data.frame': 72 obs. of 7 variables: $ Employment : Factor w/ 3 levels " =20","10-19": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 ... $ Smoking : Factor w/ 2 levels "No","Yes": 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 ... $ Sex : Factor w/ 2 levels "F","M": 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 ... $ Race : Factor w/ 2 levels "O","W": 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 ... $ Workspace : int 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ Byssinosis : int 3 25 0 2 0 6 0 1 8 8 ... $ Non.Byssinosis: int 37 139 5 22 16 75 4 24 21 30 ... And here is a description of my data set: In 1973, a large cotton textile company in North Carolina participated in a study to investigate the prevalence of byssinosis, a form of pneumoconiosis to which workers exposed to cotton dust are subject. Data was collected on 5,419 workers. Type of work place [1 (most dusty), 2 (less dusty), 3 (least dusty)] Employment, years [ Smoking [Smoker, or not in last 5 years] Sex [Male, Female] Race [White, Other] Byssinosis [number of cases having the disease] Non.Byssinosis [number of cases not having the disease] I plan on running a logistic regression on this data set to see the relationship between my response variable and my predictor variables, but I want to visualize my data before regressing. What would be the best way to do that considering I have multiple variables with some having multiple factors?
