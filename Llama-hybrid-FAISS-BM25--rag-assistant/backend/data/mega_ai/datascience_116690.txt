No. Simply not supported. You have to resort to tools such as NLTK for the stemming or lemmatization. I cannot speak for Keras or TensorFlow but this is an understandable design: You cannot do stemming or lemmatization without knowledge to the language. The rules are not generally portable from one language to another. Hence it is better to leave it to the specific NLP library rather than include it in the generic deep learning library such as TensorFlow.
