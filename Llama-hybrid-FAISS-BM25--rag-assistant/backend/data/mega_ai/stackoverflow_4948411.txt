I would recommend using a table. 1000000 rows of two ints, a double and an FK is a going to be pretty darn efficient. If you're worried about getting the data to and from the database perhaps doing something other than linq to sql is required for this data That said you could use an XML type column and store your points in there, which is supported by Linq to sql. But not without some other considerations. From the docs The SQL Server XML data type is available starting in Microsoft SQL Server 2005. You can map the SQL Server XML data type to XElement, XDocument, or String. If the column stores XML fragments that cannot be read into XElement, the column must be mapped to String to avoid run-time errors. XML fragments that must be mapped to String include the following: A sequence of XML elements Attributes Public Identifiers (PI) Comments Although you can map XElement and XDocument to SQL Server as shown in the Type Mapping Run Time Behavior Matrix, the DataContext.CreateDatabase method has no default SQL Server type mapping for these types.
