I would use a time series model for this type of analysis. That is, I would consider the data you've gathered as a broken, cyclical series of measurements. Specifically, since you're trying to measure the effect of a certain, presumably non-time-series-based "thing", I would use ARIMAX , which is a time series model that can incorporate the effects of exogenous variables (the 'x' in ARIMAX). If you're trying to measure the difference between plant species or treatments of the same plant species (for example), you could use ARIMAX to attempt to measure the impact of the treatment or species difference on growth rate. If you wanted to include other variables to control out their impact, such as precipitation and/or temperature, that would be enabled by the use of ARIMAX as well.
