Browser Detection, do's and dont's. Is this ok?

So, I understand that browser detection (ie. navigator.userAgent ) shouldn't be used to decide which object method/property to use; yet, I want to set some simple CSS with JavaScript depending on the browser. However, it's not enough to justify a completely new StyleSheet. So is it OK if I use Browser Detection to decide what CSS to apply to an element? EDIT Ok, let's be SPECIFIC. I'm talking about a text-shadow inside a button ( ) The text inside the button isn't vertically centered in all browsers, so I tweak this with JS depending on the browser.
