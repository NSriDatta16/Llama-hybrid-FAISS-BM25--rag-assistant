How is this different from a sample from X1? If X and Y are simply sets of numbers, then then is no difference. Maybe your question is analogous to this: X is a set of women, Y a set of men, and the histogram shows their heights (men are on average taller, but my wife is taller than me). So perhaps you want a subsample of men, whose height are statistically indistinguishable from the distribution of women's heights. If this is the question you are asking, then you will have to limit the sample size, since on the left the ratio between the count of blue instances and the count of yellow instances becomes large. With a large sample, a statistical test can detect that. I suggest that your sampling procedure is to iterate this approach: Select a member of the blue distribution If its value is greater than 3400, with probability equal to the ratio between the length of the yellow bar and the blue bar for this value, discard it and repeat. Otherwise, add it to the sample. Apply a statistical test to see whether the sample can be distinguished from the yellow distribution (Wilcoxons's, unless you are willing to assume the true distributions are normal). If the test passes, continue. Otherwise stop here, and discard the largest value in the sample to make the test pass again.
