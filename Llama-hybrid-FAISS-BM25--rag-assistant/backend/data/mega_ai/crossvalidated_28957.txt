How to interpret model diagnostics graphics after R linear regression?

I am interested in understanding the graph plots we get after running lm() command (for linear regression) in R like, for example lm.mod1 = lm(y ~ x1 + x2) I then get the do the summary by: summary(lm.mod1) I get the result as: Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -750.32 -160.54 -49.83 115.83 2923.74 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -345.1552 37.0393 -9.319 I then do the plotting by par(mfrow = c(2,2)) plot(lm.mod1) I get 4 graphs (I can't post the graphs since I am a new user and my experience level is below 10. :/) My questions are : How do they calculate F-statistics and t-value? Could someone explain me the what do we interpret with the last two graphs i.e. $\text{Scale-Location vs. (Standardized residuals)}^{1/2}$ and $\text{Residuals vs. Leverage}$. What do you mean by Leverage? What do you mean by Cook's Distance? I saw it on wikipedia but I didnt get it. How could we suggest if our model is a good model or not?
