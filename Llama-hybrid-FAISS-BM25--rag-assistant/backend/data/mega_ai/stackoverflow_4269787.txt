A question about the Repository pattern and MVVM

I have a repository named MemberRepository which is used by the MemberListViewModel and the MemberEditViewModel. In the repository I have my GetMember(), CreateMember, SaveMember, Rollback(), and DeleteMember(). Throughout my app I have numerous lookup tables that populate comboboxes. Example Status, Trade Code, Agent, User etc. Where do I place the GetUsers, GetStatuses(), GetTradeCodes() methods? In the appropriate repositories in which they are used? For example, the member view model needs a list of statuses, trade codes, classes, etc. So I would put the gets for these in the MemberRepository? Bill
