As Peter Flom writes , I would go with logistic regression. You can either model the probability of switching classes, or alternatively and more simply, the probability of being in a target class. In either case, include the current class membership as a predictor, possibly in an interaction with other predictors. Note that hard dichotomization into two classes when the underlying variable is numeric (spend) loses a lot of information. You might want to directly model future spend, using historic spend as one or multiple predictors (last month's spend, last year's spend, and total lifetime spend could be three different predictors to account for people leaving the platform). Consider spline transformations to capture any nonlinearities.
