Interactive area chart using Protovis

This is quite a daunting project to a Protovis newcomer, but maybe you could help me split it into digestible chunks? What I would like to build is an "interactive Area chart", as sketched here: First of all, it's the data ... I have data for provinces in Excel: Province Year 10 100 1000 10000 A 1970 2 4 6 3 A 1971 3 6 8 5 B 1970 6 9 12 6 B 1971 4 8 11 8 .... ... . . . . For each province and year, I would like to be able to draw an area chart: vis.add(pv.Area) .data(data.ProvinceA[1970]) .bottom(1) .interpolate("basis") .left(function(d) x(d.x)) .height(function(d) y(d.y)) .fillStyle("rgb(21,173,210)") .anchor("top").add(pv.Line) .lineWidth(3); Then I would like to add 2 types of interactivity: Selection of Province Time slider Together, the selection checkboxes and the time slider determine which areas are visible at any given time. If, for example, Province A is selected and the year is 1984, only that area is displayed. If the time slider is now dragged, the corresponding years are now displayed for Province A. If another Province is checked, the areas are overlayed and both areas are redrawn when the time slider moves. Protovis questions: How do I format the data (province, year, x, y) for this application? How do I achieve the binding of checkboxes to area? How do I implement the time slider? Within Protovis or like an external component with listeners that trigger re-rendering of the graph?
