It depends on the objective and the quality you want to reach. 2000 columns are a lot for most models and maybe all of them are not necessary or have very similar behavior. That's why you could start with a correlation map. In many business cases, a lot of columns are not correlated at all or have null/zero values, or noise. They could be removed easily. Then the most (anti-)correlated ones could be merged together. Finally, you could do separate study groups with specific columns to deal with different objectives. In some cases, you can apply a column transformer to prepare the data easily. As I don't know the data content, I can only give general pieces of advice.
