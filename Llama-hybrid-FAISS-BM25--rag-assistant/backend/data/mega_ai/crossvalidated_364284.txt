Modeling number of spectators in football

Can anyone give ideas on the possible best way forward to solve this specific machine learning problem for sports analytics? Data set looks like: HomeTeam AwayTeam NoOfSpectators AC Milan FC Barcelona 56900 Real Madrid Bayern Munchen 78900 The outcome variable is NoOfSpectators but there are many levels in both HomeTeam and AwayTeam . There are about 50 levels in both HomeTeam and AwayTeam. I know you can do OneHot encoding or Label encoding but what other options are worth trying? For example use RandomForest or LightGBM that can automatically handle categorical / factor variable? Also since for example: HomeTeam AwayTeam NoOfSpectators AC Milan FC Barcelona 56900 is the same as: HomeTeam AwayTeam NoOfSpectators FC Barcelona AC Milan 56900 How do you suggest that the data set should be structured / modeled before input to a ML model?
