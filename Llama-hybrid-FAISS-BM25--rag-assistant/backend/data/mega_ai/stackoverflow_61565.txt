Well....Java is actually more portable. Mono isn't implemented everywhere, and it lags behind the Microsoft implementation significantly. The Java SDK seems to stay in better sync across platforms (and it works on more platforms). I'd also say Java has more tool availability across all those platforms, although there are plenty of tools available for .NET on Windows platforms. Update for 2014 I still hold this opinion in 2014. However, I'll qualify this by saying I'm just now starting to pay some attention to Mono after a long while of not really caring, so there may be improvements in the Mono runtime (or ecosystem) that I haven't been made aware of. AFAIK, there is still no support for WPF, WCF, WF, of WIF. Mono can run on iOS, but to my knowledge, the Java runtime still runs on far more platforms than Mono. Also, Mono is starting to see some much improved tooling (Xamarin), and Microsoft seems to have a much more cross-platform kind of attitude and willingness to work with partners to make them complimentary, rather than competitive (for example, Mono will be a pretty important part of the upcoming OWIN/Helios ASP.NET landscape). I suspect that in the coming years the differences in portability will lessen rapidly, especially after .NET being open-sourced. Update for 2018 My view on this is starting to go the other way. I think .NET, broadly, particularly with .NET Core, has started to achieve "portability parity" with Java. There are efforts underway to bring WPF to .NET Core for some platforms, and .NET Core itself runs on a great many platforms now. Mono (owned by Xamarin, which is now owned by Microsoft) is a more mature and polished product than ever, and writing applications that work on multiple platforms is no longer the domain of deep gnosis of .NET hackery, but is a relatively straightforward endeavor. There are, of course, libraries and services and applications that are Windows-only or can only target specific platforms - but the same can be said of Java (broadly). If I were in the OP's shoes at this point, I can think of no reason inherent in the languages or tech stacks themselves that would prevent me from choosing .NET for any application going forward from this point.
