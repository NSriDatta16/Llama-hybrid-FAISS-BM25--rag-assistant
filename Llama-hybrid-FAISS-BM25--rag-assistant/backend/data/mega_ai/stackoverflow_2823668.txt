I cannot understand what your question is, in large part because you haven't refined it. Your question is about a schema perhaps, and possibly its corresponding object relational model. So, here is the ORM stripped to its core: class TestVersion(Base): __tablename__ = 'versions' id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) name = Column(String) class TestSuite(Base): __tablename__ = 'suites' directory = Column(String, primary_key=True) version = Column(Integer, ForeignKey ('versions.id')) parent = relationship(TestVersion, backref=backref('suites', order_by=directory)) class TestRun(Base): __tablename__ = 'runs' id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) directory = Column(String, ForeignKey ('suites.directory')) parent = relationship(TestSuite, backref=backref('runs', order_by=id)) I took a lot of liberties with your declaration: throwing out columns unrelated to your issue, reordering the declarations to make the dependency chain more obvious, etc. Perhaps against this reduced model you can better describe your problem. Also, coding standards like PEP 8 exist for a reason: if you want your code to be understandable to others, use 4 space indentions and eschew spaces between a Name and a '(', limit lines to 79 characters, etc. Yes, this seems pedantic, but you just ran into a situation where your reader had more difficulty reading your code than you'd like.
