Since it was running fine for when you had 600K records and is hanging at 800K it is likely that the inserts have caused your indexes to become fragmented. Get your DBA (or someone with db_owner rights) to run DBCC DBREINDEX(URLForPosting) . Or for versions 2005 upwards you can use ALTER INDEX REBUID .
