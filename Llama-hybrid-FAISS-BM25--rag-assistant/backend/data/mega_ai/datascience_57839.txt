Is my model overfitting? The validation loss keeps on fluctuating

I have trained a 4 layer neural network model = Sequential() #get number of columns in training data n_cols = X_train.shape[1] #add model layers model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu', input_shape=(n_cols,))) model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu')) model.add(Dropout(rate = 0.05)) model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1)) #adam = optimizers.Adam(lr=0.0001, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, epsilon=None, decay=0.0, amsgrad=False) model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mae') history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs= 200, validation_split=0.2, batch_size=128) When I plot the graph between train and validation loss the graph seems to be like The validation loss is fluctuating. Am I doing it right?
