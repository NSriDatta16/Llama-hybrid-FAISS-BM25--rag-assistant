A more conventional way to implement call recording would be to capture the RTP packets on the wire and put them together to create an audio file. There are quite a few tools around to do exactly that and it's even inbuilt into Wireshark . As far as tweaking with the SDP goes it's definitely not something that is "not allowed" at least not on a technical level. A lot of SIP Proxy's are forced to mangle the IP addresses in SDP when user agents put private IP addresses in them. You'll find most SIP servers out there have some sort of capability in this regard and it's often call NAT mangling or similar.
