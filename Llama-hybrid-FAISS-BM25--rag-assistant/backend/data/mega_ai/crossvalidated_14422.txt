(Stochastic) optimization with multivariate predictive distribution

Suppose I have a multivariate predictive distribution (dimension N). The distribution cannot be described in closed form with a mu vector and associated covariance matrix. However, I can sample from the distribution various scenarios with associated probabilities. One can imagine sampling 100,000 scenarios to construct a matrix where each row represents the joint distribution for a scenario, and a probability is associated with each scenario. Now let's say I have a weight vector and I am performing some optimization involving the distribution (for example, a mean-variance optimization) with some constraints. Naturally, for any given draw from the distribution we can search for the optimal weights that maximize the mean-variance function: weights * sampled return - weights(transposed) * E * weights. However, the optimal weights for one draw will in general not correspond to the optimal weights from another draw. Question - what is the optimal choice for the weight vector? I believe the answer may involve a stochastic optimization procedure, however, I am not familiar with this space and would like to validate this. There are also natural connections to the literature on robust optimization but the solutions here require closed form expressions for the multivariate distribution. I have explored re-sampling which has an analogy to boot-strapping. This involves constructing optimal weights for many samples from the predictive distribution and somehow averaging or combining the weights. However, this approach is flawed and lacks a theoretical basis. How might I proceed to tackle this problem with stochastic optimization or some other technique?
