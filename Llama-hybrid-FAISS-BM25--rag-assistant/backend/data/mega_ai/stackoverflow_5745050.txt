To generate an HTML document, you should write to a file. Since HTML is a text format, you would write to a text file. Doing this requires these classes java.io.File - this represents locations in your file system java.io.FileWriter - this establishes a connection from your program to a file java.io.BufferedWriter -this enables buffered writing of text, which is much faster java.io.IOException - one of these nasties is thrown if there is a problem writing to the file. It is a checked (vs. runtime) exception and you must handle it. The Head First Java book contains a very nice coverage of these classes and show you how to use them. To use these you must first know about exception handling. That is also covered in Head First Java. I hope this gets you started.
