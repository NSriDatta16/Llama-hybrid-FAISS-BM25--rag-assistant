Although DateTime.Now appears to have a resolution of 100ns, Windows actually only updates its internal clock every 15ms. Therefore, if your code takes less than about 7.5ms to run, it will appear to have taken no time at all, since on average you have to wait 7.5ms for DateTime.Now to change. If you need more accurate timing, you can (as you've found) use StopWatch. This uses a different, more accurate API to get results. EDIT The MSDN documentation for DateTime.Now gives the resolution as "approximately 10ms". The GetTickCount API (which uses the same system timer) gives its resolution as "typically in the range of 10 milliseconds to 16 milliseconds". Apparently it's hardware dependent - single processor systems are typically 10ms, multiple processor systems are typically 15ms.
