The way I look at it is, an IP address isn't in itself privileged, but it's useful information for an intruder to have. Why make it easy for him to get it? Encrypting the data may simply annoy him and slow him down while he gets that information through other means, but the longer the intrusion takes the more costly it is for him and the greater the risk that he'll be caught and stopped. Locking my wooden front door won't stop a determined burglar, but it'll slow him down and make him attract the attention of the neighbors if he tries to break in. Compared to the cost of installing the door, that's worth it!
