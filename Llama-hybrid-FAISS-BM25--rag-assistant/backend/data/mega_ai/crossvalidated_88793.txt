Interpret Variable Importance (varImp) for Factor Variables

When I run variable importance on a random forest (or any other model), the factor/categorical variable names have the factor name as the suffix. For example, SALARY ~ STATE + CITY + AGE + â€¦, the result of varImp(model) could look like, > varImp(model) rf variable importance only 20 most important variables shown (out of 1050) Importance AGE 100.00 STATECA 91.84 STATEAZ 86.24 CITYSTANFORD 74.15 STATEVT 71.27 In terms of relative importance, would it be right to interpret this as AGE is the most important predictor, followed by STATE followed by CITY? The importance values also do not say anything about the relationship between the predictor and the outcome--for example, does higher age equate to higher salary, does STATE CA mean higher salary, etc. Any suggestions on how such measures can be obtained for "black box" models such as random forest, gbm, etc. would be very helpful.
