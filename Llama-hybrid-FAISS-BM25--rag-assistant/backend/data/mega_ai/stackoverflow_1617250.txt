Storing persistent data in browser

For my web application, I need to store form inputs spanning across multiple pages, until I finally process/manipulate them to produce some results (its mostly formatting the data entered and presenting it in some layout). The options I think I have are - Keep sending user's inputs to the server, store it there in some database, do the final manipulation there only, and show the result. Store the inputs in browser's storage as the user fills the forms, and finally use this stored data to manipulate and show results. I very much want to use the second method, and perhaps a possible way is using cookies, but I'm afraid I might just hit some upper limit of cookie data storage. I'm also open to understanding the merits of the first method, or any third method. thanks.
