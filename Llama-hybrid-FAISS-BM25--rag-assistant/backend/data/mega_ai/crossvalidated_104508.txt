Random Forest - how to know if variables affect positively or negatively

I'm running a RandomForest in R on a set of data with many variables. Using varImpPlot() I know how important is each variable to explain the target variable. However, I would also like to know whether a variable affects positively or negatively the target value . For example, in predicting personal income, I may get that "age" explains a lot, but I would like to know whether "higher age -> higher income", or whether "lower age -> higher income". Is there any way to know this with Random Forest?
