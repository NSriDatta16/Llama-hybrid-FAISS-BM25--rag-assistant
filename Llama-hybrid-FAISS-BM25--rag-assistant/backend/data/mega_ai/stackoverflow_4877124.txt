Merge two-dimensional arrays in PHP

I have two two-dimensional arrays (actually they are nested associative arrays) with predefined struture: $array1 and $array2 . First array lists all objects by their id numbers: $array1 = array( array(id => 1), array(id => 2), array(id => 3), array(id => 4), array(id => 5) ); The second array lists relationships between objects (e.g., object 2 is connected to objects 3, 4, and 5): $array2 = array( array(id1 => 1, id2 => 2), array(id1 => 2, id2 => 3), array(id1 => 2, id2 => 4), array(id1 => 2, id2 => 5) ); The aim is to replace id values from the $array2 with corresponding indices from $array1 . So, in my case the result should be: 0 1 // index of value 1 (id1) in $array1 is 0, index of 2 (id2) is 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 Pasted below is my current work. First of all I "convert" $array1 to one-dimensional array: foreach ($array1 as $row) { $array3[] = $row['id']; } Then I use array_search function and go through $array2 and search the $array3 for a given value and returns the corresponding key in $array3 : foreach ($array2 as $row) { $value1 = $row['id1']; $key1 = array_search($value1, $array3); echo $key1; echo "\t"; $value2 = $row['id2']; $key2 = array_search($value2, $array3); echo $key2; echo ' '; } My question is straightforward: is there a more elegant way to do that (i.e., without using array_search function). Many thanks in advance for any ideas. Best, Andrej
