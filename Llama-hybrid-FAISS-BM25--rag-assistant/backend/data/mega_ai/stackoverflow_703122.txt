SQL Server 2000-2005-2008 Distributed Query Problem

Just set up a new server. Trying to transfer some workload from one to the other. Everything looks great, except when I come to run this code: CREATE TABLE #KEYWORD5 (ITEM_MASTER_ID NUMERIC(25) NULL) INSERT INTO #KEYWORD5 exec SQL2K801.soupftidx.dbo.P_REMOTE_SQL_EXEC 'SELECT IM.ITEM_MASTER_ID FROM ITEM_MASTER IM WHERE IM.BUYER_ORGANIZATION_ID IN (5970,5230) AND IM.ACTIVE_FLAG = ''Y'' AND CONTAINS(IM.*, '' ("SCREW*" OR FORMSOF (INFLECTIONAL, "SCREW")) '')' SELECT * FROM #KEYWORD5 DROP TABLE #KEYWORD5 By the way, the following works just fine: CREATE TABLE #KEYWORD5 (ITEM_MASTER_ID NUMERIC(25) NULL) INSERT INTO #KEYWORD5 exec P2PINDEXDA.soupftidx.dbo.P_REMOTE_SQL_EXEC 'SELECT IM.ITEM_MASTER_ID FROM ITEM_MASTER IM WHERE IM.BUYER_ORGANIZATION_ID IN (5970,5230) AND IM.ACTIVE_FLAG = ''Y'' AND CONTAINS(IM.*, '' ("SCREW*" OR FORMSOF (INFLECTIONAL, "SCREW")) '')' SELECT * FROM #KEYWORD5 DROP TABLE #KEYWORD5 The only difference between the two is the servername prefix (p2pindexda vs sql2k801). I've verified that the linked servers have the same options set. Also, I've verified that the exec statement works fine...ie: It returns results as expected. Where it goes bad is when I try to insert the results into a local Temp Table. What gives?
