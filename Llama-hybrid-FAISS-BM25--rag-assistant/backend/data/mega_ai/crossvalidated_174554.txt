Advice on predicting continuous dependent variable

My challenge: maximize $R^2$ on an out of sample data set. Constraints: Continuous dependent variable with negative values Over 150 variables with no information about them Some of these independent variables are categorical Over 50,000 observations My strategy: run a random forest, LASSO and linear regression model. Then blend (haven't done this before) them together. Thoughts on this?
