This way of organizing the repository: ReponsitoryMain Project1 branches trunk tags Project2 ... is best when your projects aren't that connected/dependent on each other. The other way around makes it easier to version your entire project suite. So if you often release/package Project1 and Project2 together, it's best to have them share the same branch. If, on the other hand, your project are very decoupled and have totally different teams working on them, then you wouldn't need to check them all out together most of the time, and so you could use the above method.
