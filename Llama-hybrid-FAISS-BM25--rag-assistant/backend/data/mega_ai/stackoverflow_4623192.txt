ExtJS, SmartClient, YUI, MooTools, etc are all rich Internet application (RIA) frameworks that allow you to integrate at the JavaScript and/or Google Web Toolkit levels. I have generally seen ExtJS and SmartClient compared most frequently. I have used SmartClient myself and one reason I did was because of the licensing differences between the two. The biggest advantage of something like ExtJS or SmartClient is that they allow you to focus on building a data-driven service that easily integrates with their rich set of widgets. This allows you to focus on your data and simply leverage their flexible, cross browser-ish, slick looking web GUI controls. In my opinion, it's a great time saver and browser robustness advantage. You can combine these with things like JQuery, etc. In fact, you can use ExtJS and SmartClient together if you like. (although most people won't)
