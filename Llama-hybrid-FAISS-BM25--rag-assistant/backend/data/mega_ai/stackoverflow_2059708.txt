How are you holding your objects behind the scenes? Do you have a List field somewhere? Just serialize / deserialize that, and let it worry about it. To be honest, this should just happen if you mark the custom collection wrapper as [Serializable] and mark any unnecessary fields (such as current ) as [NonSerialized] (i.e. without you having to implement ISerializable ). Note that in most scenarios I tend to advise against BinaryFormatter ; it is OK for sending short-lived (transient) messages, but I don't advise using it for storage purposes (in a file or in a database); you can get lots of versioning issues trying to deserialize at a later date.
