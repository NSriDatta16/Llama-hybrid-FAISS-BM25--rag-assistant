Prediction intervals for kNN regression

I would like compute prediction intervals for predictions made by kNN regression. I can't find any explicit reference to confirm, so my question is - is this approach to computing prediction intervals correct? I have a reference dataset where each row is one location (e.g. city). I have two features (say, x1 and x2), describing a sample from the population of that location (e.g. x1 could be the average income of the residents). Sample size is different for each location. I predict a target variable (say, y, e.g. the total number of cars in that city) based on x1 and x2. A prediction for a new location Z is made by finding k nearest neighbors of Z in terms of x1 and x2 (the Euclidean distance), and averaging over the target variable of those k neighbors. I compute prediction intervals as y* +- t*s, where s is the standard deviation of the target among k nearest neighbors, and t comes from the standard normal distribution (e.g. for 95% prediction interval t=1.96). I ignore x1 and x2, and I ignore the fact that x1 and x2 are estimated over different samples. Does the approach make sense?
