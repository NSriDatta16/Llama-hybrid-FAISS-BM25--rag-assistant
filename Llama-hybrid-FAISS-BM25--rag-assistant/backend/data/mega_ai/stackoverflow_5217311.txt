Setting z-index on draggable elements

I am trying to set the z-index on draggable elements using jQuery. You can see what I am talking about and what I have so far here: http://jsfiddle.net/sushik/LQ4JT/1/ It is very primitive and there are problems with it. Any ideas on how I would make the last clicked element have the highest z-index and rather than resetting all of the rest to a base z-index , have them step, so the 2nd to last clicked has the second highest z-index , etc.. Another problem I am having with it is that it only works on a full click event but the draggable functionality works by clicking and holding down. How could I have the class applied on that initial click down and not wait for the event of releasing the click?
