The slope for A~B minimizes errors between B and the model. The slope for B~A will be different, and minimize errors between A and the model. These two approaches will result in different slopes. For a visual representation, see: https://www.r-bloggers.com/principal-component-analysis-pca-vs-ordinary-least-squares-ols-a-visual-explanation/ Having said that, as someone mentioned, the wording of the question is poor, and doesn't provide context. I don't think you're supposed to go into the real world and just throw whatever model you want at data.
