jquery or javascript classic to add http header infomation in the browser (permanent value)

I was wondering if it is possible to add http header information on a browser using jquery or a classic javascript in such a way that this added info will always available during http request like the "user-agent" sent in the server? sorry on my wild imagination... ;) Best regards, - toni
