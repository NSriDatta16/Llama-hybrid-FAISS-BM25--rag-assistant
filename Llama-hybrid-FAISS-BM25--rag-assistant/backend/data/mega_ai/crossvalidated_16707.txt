Agree with @Michael Bishop. Given the current probabilities on the winner's bet there is no incentive to opt for it. Given the your data, if the gambler opts for the winners bet his payoff on an average is 95, while his payoff is deterministically 100 if he does not opt for the winners bet. These problems are best solved using a decision tree. Unfortunately I am not being allowed to post a picture showing the payoff choices for this problem. However, even a minor change in probabilities or the payoffs could change the choice the gambler needs to make to maximize his payoffs. You may play around with the numbers (probabilities / payoffs) and do some sensitivity analysis. For instance with either of the two changes mentioned below it would make more sense for the gambler to opt for the Winners bet. If the probability of wining 50, 150 and 200 were changed to 0.5, 0.25, 0.25 (keeping the payoffs same) If the maximum payoff is increased from 200 to 255, while the probabilities remained the same.
