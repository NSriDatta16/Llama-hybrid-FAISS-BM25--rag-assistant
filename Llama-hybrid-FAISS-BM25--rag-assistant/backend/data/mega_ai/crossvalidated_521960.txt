Implementation Random Forest Regression

I've been studying and searching for information for days, both here and on the internet, but I can't reach a conclusion. I've a nonlinear regression problem so I tried RF on R. This is my first ML algorithm implementation #df is the dataframe 1268x9, X=1268x8, y=1268x1 # y are â‚¬, and range(y)=[0, 73000] set.seed(123) index now I search and tune parameters (ntree, nodesize, mtry) considering their interaction for(i in 1:nrow(params)){ ntree Found the best parameters for my data! So my final model is fitControl ...RMSE=12000, slightly high. I tried different parameters and model form but RMSE is always around 11k -.-' Additionally Do you have any suggest to obtain better results? Thanks in advance :) EDIT Original df has 6 predictors(5 numerical, 1 categorical data), 1 outcome. In the code above I wrote X=1268x8 because I turned categorical feature into binary (categorical has 3 categories) to test other algorithms
