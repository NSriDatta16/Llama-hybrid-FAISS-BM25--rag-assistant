Team Foundation Server is probably the most integrated into Visual Studio. However, I personally love Kiln (which also integrates nicely into VS). This is nice for a small team, being hosted and very elegant and easy to use. Other options include Subversion and Git . However, without knowing more requirements, it's difficult to suggest the "best" option for a small .NET team. Self-hosted vs. hosted for you is probably the largest factor in making your decision...
