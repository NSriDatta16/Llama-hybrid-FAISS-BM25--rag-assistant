What exactly does scipy.stats.ttest_ind test?

From the description : " This is a two-sided test for the null hypothesis that 2 independent samples have identical average (expected) values. " Taken literally, this seems to be saying that we're testing $H_0: \bar{x} = \bar{y}$, but since we know both $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$, it doesn't make sense. Therefore I'm thinking what they really mean is that the Null Hypothesis is that both samples come from the same distribution, or that the mean of the respective populations is the same. Is that correct?
