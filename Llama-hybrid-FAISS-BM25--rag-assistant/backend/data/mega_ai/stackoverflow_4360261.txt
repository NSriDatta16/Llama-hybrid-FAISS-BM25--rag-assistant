Liferay - Exporting User-Generated Content

We are currently evaluating Liferay for our non-profit organization, and there's one concern that I have not been able to find an answer for: Is there a way to export the user-created content (e.g. blog posts, wiki articles, forum discussions) into a structured format (e.g. xml, excel)? In case we need to move away from Liferay in the future, we'd like to know that we can at least salvage all of the content that the users have created. Thanks in advance for the help! AL
