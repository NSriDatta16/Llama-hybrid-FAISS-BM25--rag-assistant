Yes you can have the best of both worlds. It's perfectly possible to write a Java application that will run in both an applet (for your online users) while also running as a standalone application in downloaded form. The key technologies are: JNLP JOGL for the graphics, which also has some good demos I'm not so familiar with it but I think jMonkeyEngine looks very promising if you want more of a full-featured game engine If it's any use, an old game I wrote called Tyrant supported running both as an applet and as a standalone downloaded .jar file, all the source is open if you want to look at it. This used simple AWT rather than 3D graphics. And finally here's another example of converting an applet into an application with a pretty minimal amount of code.
