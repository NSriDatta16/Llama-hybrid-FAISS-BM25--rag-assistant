By default, files and images uploaded to a Plone 4 site are no longer stored in the traditional 'filestorage' file (eg. Data.fs), but instead in a specially organised 'blob' storage area on the file system. This is a tremendous help in preventing huge Data.fs files. Everything else is in stored the filestorage as before. The only thing you need to worry about is how to do backups properly, as repozo doesn't support this :-)
