Delphi executables don't have any external dependency. It's true since Delphi 1 up to Delphi XE. I just wrote a post on my blog about this fact I like very much in Delphi. http://blog.synopse.info/post/2010/09/20/Dll-hell%2C-WinSXS-directory-and-Delphi-paradise No dll hell with Delphi applications! Deploying a Delphi application is very easy. If you need some database access, you could need some additional components, like the BDE, or the ODBC drivers, or whatever... But there are a lot of stand-alone frameworks, with no external dependency, available for Delphi. We provide one Client/Server Open Source solution, using SQLite3 as database storage. And one of great feature of SQLite3 is that it doesn't need to install any client software. Our framework provide the Client/Server features, in pure Delphi.
