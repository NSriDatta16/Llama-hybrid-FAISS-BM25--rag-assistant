One method is to extrapolate the trend using a regression of the last n-points of the moving average line before you start incorporating the points outside of your series. Typically if you have some seasonal pattern then n-points is set to the period size so if you have daily data for 10 years then it would be set to the last 365 points (1 period). For yours, sounds like you have a cycle of 7 so do the last 7 points of the moving average line for the regression and use those points when you run out of real estate on the right of your center.
