There is a limited set of operations that you can do (guaranteed by the standard) with a pointer to a yet uninitialized object, and storing it for further use is one of them. The compiler is probably warning as it is easy to misuse the received pointer in Base . Beware that most uses of the pointer for other than storage will be undefined behavior, but the code above is correct.
