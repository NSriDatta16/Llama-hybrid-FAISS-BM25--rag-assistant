sampling/importance resampling - why resample?

I'm trying to understand the SIR algorithm. In order to do so it seemed best to look at some existing r code (see below), taken from http://hedibert.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/example-iii.R.txt . # SIR: Uniform proposal N = 10000 m = 2000 draw1 = runif(N,-10,10) w = dnorm(draw1)/0.05 ind = sample(1:N,size=m,replace=TRUE,prob=w) draws1 = draw1[ind] length(unique(draws1))/m I don't really understand any of the steps taken after computing w. Why not just take the mean of w to approximate the integral? Why resample? Also, what is the last step about: Why calculate how many unique draws you have?
