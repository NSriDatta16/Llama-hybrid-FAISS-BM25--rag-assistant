MySQL's GET_LOCK function gets named user locks, which are an extra feature MySQL provides over and above anything to do with tables. No tables are involved so it does not invoke the storage engine and has nothing to do with myisam. GET_LOCK is available on all supported mysql versions regardless of what engines are used.
