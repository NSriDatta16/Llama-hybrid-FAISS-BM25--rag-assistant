How to calculate bias when true population mean is unknown?

I'm working on a problem with a simulation that calculated a linear regression coefficient from some randomly generated data, which was performed 100 times. In other words, I've got 100 randomly generated $\hat\beta$ values. I'm being asked to compute the bias of the average of my estimates, i.e. being asked to find $\hat\beta - \beta$ . But since I don't know $\beta$ , how do I calculate this bias?
