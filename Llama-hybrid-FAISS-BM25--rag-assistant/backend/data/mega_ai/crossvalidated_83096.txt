precision vs covariance

I have seen that when modelling the likelihood term with a multivariate Gaussian tend to parameterise the Gaussian with the inverse covariance matrix (precision) rather than the covariance matrix, claiming it might be easier for certain calculations typically done in Bayesian inferencing. Does anyone know what they are alluding to?
