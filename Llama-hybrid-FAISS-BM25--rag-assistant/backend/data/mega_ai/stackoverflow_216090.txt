You can specify '-m32' or '-m64' to select the compilation mode. When dealing with autoconf (configure) scripts, I usually set CC="gcc -m64" (or CC="gcc -m32") in the environment so that everything is compiled with the correct bittiness. At least, usually...people find endless ways to make that not quite work, but my batting average is very high (way over 95%) with it.
