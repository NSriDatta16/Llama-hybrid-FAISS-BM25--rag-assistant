Most elegant XML serialization of Color structure

One problem bugged me enough to register on Stack Overflow. Currently if I want to serialize Color to XML string as named color, or #rrggbb , or #aarrggbb , I do it like this: [XmlIgnore()] public Color color; [XmlElement(ElementName = "Color")] public String color_XmlSurrogate { get { return MyColorConverter.SetColor(color); } set { color = MyColorConverter.GetColor(value); } } Here MyColorConverter does serialization just the way I like it. But all this feels like a kludge, with additional field and all. Is there a way to make it work in less lines, maybe connecting TypeDescriptor with C# attributes related to XML?
