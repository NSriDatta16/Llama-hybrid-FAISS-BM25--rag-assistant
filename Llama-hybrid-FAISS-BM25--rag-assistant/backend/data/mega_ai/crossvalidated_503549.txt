Residual Subscript in Time Series

I am familiar with the following notation for a simple AR1 model: $ x_t = x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t $ . However, I recently came across a very well known paper in my area of research, in which the authors provide the following notation: $ x_{t+1} = x_t + \epsilon_t$ . My initial thought was, that in this case, the $\epsilon$ should have the subscript $t+1$ , thus being consistent with the logic implicitly given in the first formula, i.e. period of residual = period of dependent variable. Aren't the two formulas provided inconsistent?
