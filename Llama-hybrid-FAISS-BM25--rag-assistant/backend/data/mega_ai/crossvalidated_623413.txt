In SkLearn's Random Forests, why is ```max_samples == None``` by default?

The more uncorrelated are the trees with each other, the better the results a Random Forest ensemble may get. Sources: Nvidia , Tutorial by Tony Yiu According to the official documentation , the hyperparameter max_samples will take the value of None unless otherwise specified. This means, the whole input sample will be used every time to train every single estimator. Is this value by default of max_samples , supposed to be an advantage over a value between 0 and 1? Let's say, for example, max_samples was 0.7 by default. Wouldn't that produce more uncorrelated trees, resulting thus in better models? Any contribution is well appreciated. Thanks in advance.
