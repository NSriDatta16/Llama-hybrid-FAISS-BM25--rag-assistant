Giving the author and title of the book would be helpful in deciphering the author's intention, since readers here might have read it. But based on this information, it would appear to simply be a teaching approach intended to simplify the problem for illustrative purposes. Rather than estimating both parameters at once, the author estimates them in turn to give readers a feel for how the procedure of Bayesian regression works. Alternatively, the purpose could be to compare how inference on the parameters is influenced by the choice of priors on $\sigma^2$, compared to a scenario where $\sigma^2$ is assumed known.
