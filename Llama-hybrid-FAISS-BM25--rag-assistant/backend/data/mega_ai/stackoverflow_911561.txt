Let me explain, step by step. $('textControl').bind( binding to textControl ($.browser.opera ? 'keypress', 'keydown') tertiary expression returning keypress if the browser is opera, keydown otherwise. '.autocomplete' Autocomplete is a custom event the jQuery plugin adds to the keypress event object. So basically they just grouped it in to make it a bit more organized but it's a custom namespace event. So in reality, the event is attached to keypress/keydown, but you can bind and unbind using the namespace, keeping the workspace organized.
