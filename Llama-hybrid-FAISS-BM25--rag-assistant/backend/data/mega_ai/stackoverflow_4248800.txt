Looks like you have to use the entire word as the key. The average length of tokens can be computed by summing the lengths of each token and dividing by the number of tokens. In Java, you can find the number of tokens in the HashMap by tokenMap.size(). You can write loops that visit each member of the map like this: for(String t: tokenMap.values()){ //t is a token } and if you look up String in the Java API docs you will see that it is easy to find the length of a String.
