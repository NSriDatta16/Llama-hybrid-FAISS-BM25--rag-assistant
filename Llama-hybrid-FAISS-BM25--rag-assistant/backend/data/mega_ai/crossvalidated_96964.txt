Distribution for time between arrivals at the same location by the same entity

Given a sample of inter arrival times for an entity at the same location, is there a distribution that can fit such a sample?. I was thinking about poisson, but was concerned about the independence, since the next arrival may be dependent on the previous arrival time. Or is using a time series approach better to capture trend and seasonality?.
