Open source e-commerce solution for a tool catalog based around EAV

I'm looking for an e-commerce system that is built around EAV (entity-attribute-value) somewhat like Magento, but hopefully simpler. I'm really okay with just about any platform (Java, .NET, PHP, whatever), I just really need to be able to freely associate properties with groups of products... e.g. a drill bushing will have some inner diameter and outer diameter, a drill bit will have a certain outer diameter, etc. Thanks for the info!
