Need to Hide Tag that is generated automatically from other source

I need to put RSS viewer web part that shows Stock Quotes for JPMorgan Chase. RSS feed that I found for that is : http://www.quoterss.com/quote.php?symbol=JPM&format=0&uid=1280868448 but his feed also retrives unnecessary links such as FaceBook cheat codes, Iphone cheat codes ... I want to hide those unnecessary links for the cheat codes. XSLT for RSS viewer web part having above mentioned feed is provided below. 5 false 1033 RSS_Viewer_WebPart left True More... - More... - - More... - - More... From the above XSLT I was able to figure out that HTML is generated automatically, that is done by If I am going in the right direction, if HTML is generated automatically, I will not be able to hide those unnecessary links using XSL. So I tried to do that using JQuery. HTML that is generated automatically is as follows. &nbsp;Last 45.74 &nbsp;Change +1.18 &nbsp; &nbsp;% Change 2.65% &nbsp; &nbsp;Volume 77445704&nbsp; &nbsp;Last 4:02pm&nbsp; _ iPhone Cheat Codes _ I want to hide the link containing reference to the http:.//cheatcodes.com/iphone/ which is rendered as "iPhone Cheat Codes" in ITALIC. By using JQuery I tried $('a[href*=http://cheatcodes.com]').hide() ...... but this doesnt work. I also tried to dig into it and when I tried to fetch the value of href tag using alert($('a[href*=http://cheatcodes.com]')).attr(href) JQuery shows me undefined as a result. Also the links for the cheat codes also get updated on daily basis ... only thing that I found is this portion of the URL remains same is: http:.//cheatcodes.com/... As per my understanding as the HTML is generated automatically JQuery is not able to hide that Anchor tag. I am kind of stucked into this. If some one gives me light on the exact cause of the behaviour and the solution, I really would appreciate it. Also if some one knows about other RSS feed where I can get the stock quote for the JPMorgan Chase would be helpfull to overcome this issue. Thanks, Dhaval
