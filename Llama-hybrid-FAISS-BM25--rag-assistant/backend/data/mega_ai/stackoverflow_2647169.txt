Leaving aside the legality issues in this particular case, I would suggest the following: Trying to attack something impossible, stop and think where the impossibility comes from, and whether you chose the correct way. Do you really think that someone in his mind would issue a new http connection or even worse hold an open comet connection to look if the common storage has grown? For an anonimous user? Just look and find a function that computes a value based on some init value and the current time.
