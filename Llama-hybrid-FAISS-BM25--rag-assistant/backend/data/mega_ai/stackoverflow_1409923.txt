If you would change it globally, every user would get the theme that the last user chose. You will have to store the choise that the user made in a user specific storage, like the Session state: Session["Theme"] = "ThemeName"; Then you will have to set the theme in the Page_Init event for every page: public void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs args) { string theme = Session["Theme"] as String; if (theme != null) { Page.Theme = theme; } }
