Tuning Binary PCA using Generalized Low Rank Model

I am using h2o Generalized Low Rank Models for tuning a binary PCA (Logistic loss + Quadratic regularization) to perform a recommender system task. I am using the H2O infrastructure using the GLRM approach. Below the code where a model is run. bestGlrm Key tuning parameters are: gamma_y, gamma_x (regularizers) and k. Regarding the gamma x and y, the parameter space lies from 0 to $\inf$. I would like to know whether there is any guidance to select the gamma range on data.
