It is a bit unclear what is your aim behind this, but maybe you just need a feature selection? Try for instance training a Random Forest predicting the value you optimize from the other ones and extract its importance scores. What it does is almost explicitly a search for hyper-rectangles in your feature space with smallest possible variance and selecting those dimensions on which meaningful intervals are most frequently made.
