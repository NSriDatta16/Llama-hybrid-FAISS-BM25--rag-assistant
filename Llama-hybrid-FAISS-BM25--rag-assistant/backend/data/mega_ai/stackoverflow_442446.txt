I used to be a Java developer, doing mostly C# now. My arguments against Java are that it is (or at least was ) a real pain to get set up and running. It's also better suited for large applications that need a lot of organisation and maintainability. That, however, comes at a cost. From the sounds of your post, I think one of the dynamic languages would be better suited. Plus, they're more fun to play with (IMHO).
