Spring Webflow is excellent in flow communication of applications. The asynchronous support of webflow however specializes in fragment updating. It therefor is very difficult to handle asynchronus ajax transitions. Consider an execution contains two elements, execution number and state id. The execution number tells webflow that for this flow it has been started N number of times. The state id tells webflow the user is on this step (transition/state) of the flow which is associated to the corresponding execution number. When you try to render a fragment the tutorials will tell you to not transition to any state (that is ... . If you were to transition to another state, you will increment the state id (if it was 2 when entering the page webflow now thinks it 3) however you have not changed the page at all. So everything on the page expects the next state Id to be 3 but the next one will actually be 4. It can get very complicated, as you can imagine. My suggestion is that you should only use ajax support from webflow to update information on the page and to shy away from flow control.
