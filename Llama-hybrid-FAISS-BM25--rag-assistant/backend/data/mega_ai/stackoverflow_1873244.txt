Flex tree control drag drop .item position

just facing a difficulty with tree control drag drop.. Suppose i have tree with drag-drop enabled. I want to which node(id) is droped inside which node. 1]if i drag "Cat1" node inside "Cat3",i want to identify ids of siblings of "cat1",and "cat3". 2]in general i want to know the ids of current element being moved along with its new parent and new position and save these postions. 3] Also "cat4" when moved outside "cat3",i want know its position and its siblings id.
