Nested UIView Resizing

I'm developing my first iPad application, and the app is a split view like the mail app. Inside the detail view I have 2 sub views, one for editing data and one for just viewing data. When the user is in the view mode they press a button and the detail view flips over to reveal the edit view. I can't seem to make the two views inside the detail view resize properly with the iPad orientation change. The views are the correct size when in portrait mode, but when changed to landscape mode, the two subviews clip at the bottom and right hand edges. I thought these views were supposed to resize automatically with the view they are nested inside. In the root view controller, I have the following code: @implementation RootViewController @synthesize detailViewController; @synthesize recipies= recipies; @synthesize delegate; #pragma mark - #pragma mark View lifecycle - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; self.clearsSelectionOnViewWillAppear = NO; self.contentSizeForViewInPopover = CGSizeMake(320.0, 600.0); self.detailViewController.recipeView.autoresizingMask= (UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth ); self.detailViewController.isEdit= FALSE; self.detailViewController.editView.autoresizingMask= (UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth ); self.detailViewController.editView.hidden= YES; } The subviews that should resize are recipeView and editView. I thought by setting the autoresizeingMask, they would automatically resize. What am I missing here, do I need to explicitly set the size of each view based on the available space on orientation change? Any/All replies appreciated! Thanks in advance.
