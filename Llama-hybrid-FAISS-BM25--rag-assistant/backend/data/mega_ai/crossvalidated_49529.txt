Machine learning is about gaining knowledge/learning from data. For example, I work with machine learning algorithms that can select a few genes that may be involved in a particular type of disease from DNA Microarray data (e.g. cancers or diabetes). Scientists can then use these genes (learned models) for early diagnosis in the future (classification of unseen samples). There is a lot of statistics involved in machine learning but there are branches of machine learning that do not require statistics (e.g. genetic programming). The only time you would need statistics in these instances would be to see if a model that you have built using machine learning is statistically significantly different from some other model. In my opinion, an introduction to machine learning for statisticians would be advantageous . This will help statisticians to see real world scenarios of application of statistics. However, it shouldn't be compulsory . You may become a successful statistician and spend your whole life without ever having to go near machine learning!
