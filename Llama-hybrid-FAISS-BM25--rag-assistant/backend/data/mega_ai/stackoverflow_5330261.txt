It is not necessary to encode a colon as %3B in the query, although doing so is not illegal. URI = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ] query = *( pchar / "/" / "?" ) pchar = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@" unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~" pct-encoded = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG sub-delims = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "=" It also seems that only percent-encoded spaces are valid, as I doubt that space is an ALPHA or a DIGIT look to the URI specification for more details.
