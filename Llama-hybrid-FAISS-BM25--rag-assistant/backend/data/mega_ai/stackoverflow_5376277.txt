Bear in mind that inheriting from List isn't as fully featured as you may need, a lot of the members are not virtual so the only way of covering the base implementation is to shadow it with the new syntax (as opposed to override ). If you need to start exposing custom behaviour on standard list actions, I would implement all the list interfaces on a type that simply uses an inner list for the actual storage. This is heavily dependent on your final requirements.
