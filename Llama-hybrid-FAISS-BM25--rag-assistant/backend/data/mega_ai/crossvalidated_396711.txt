Just because the values of a function are bounded, does not mean that its derivatives are bounded. Think about the function $$ f(x)=\sin(1/x) $$ Clearly bounded, isin't it? But guess what happens when you do $x\to 0$ ? The local variations and therefore the gradient will explode. In fact, in the logistic regression there is no restriction on the parameter values $\beta_i$ so why should the expression $(a+\beta_i*x_j)*boundedterm$ be bounded? The left-side multiplier can be anything.
