The first approach makes the entities more organized. The downside is that you have too many endpoints. Your client needs to initialize multiple service instance to perform a operation (for example: You need to initialize the customer service and the order service to save customer and order details. - But this could be prevented if you implement business process logically on each service\operation). The second approach is quite overwhelming to the client app developer. The advantage is performance since everything is on a single contract, it will be easier for you to optimize the code and minimize service calls.
