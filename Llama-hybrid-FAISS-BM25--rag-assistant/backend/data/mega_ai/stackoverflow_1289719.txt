General advice needed - How to implement record file attachments in ASP.NET?

I have an application which will have approximately 25,000 records when the initial data import is complete. These records will each have 1-3 associated 'file attachments' (.doc, .pdf, etc). Can anyone give me advice on how to implement this functionality? Specifically, where would you store the files and how would you organize them? I am reluctant to store them directly in the database, as this would result in a huge database. Does this seem like a valid concern? If so, I don't think I would want to see up to 100,000 files in a single folder either.
