iPhone/iPad SDK: Touch-spinning an object seemingly in 3D by a series of images

Can anyone kindly put me on the right path as to how to go about animating an object as though it's being rotated by touch+drag? We took images of an object sitting on a rotating tray at 10-degree intervals. I was tinkering with Titanium and had a demo running whereby I simply changed the image to the next (or previous) image in an array depending on which way I caught the swipeLeft or swipeRight. It's not beautiful, but it worked in the simulator. Once I put it on the iPad it ran slow and crashed. I've switched to Xcode and I've been in the throes of learning Cocoa/Cocoa Touch. I'm just wondering if I'm on the right path by replacing the image in the UIImageView as I catch drag events or if I should make two animations that play corresponding to the direction of the drag, or if I should be looking at an entirely different approach, such as OpenGL, though that doesn't seem right. Thank you very much for any help!
