Embedding c# windows application (.exe) in a webpart

Is there is a way to embed an application executable inside a webpart? is there any kind of a webpart available in sharepoint. If not, then is it possible to create my own webpart and some how place my windows application there so that when a user login to a sharepoint site he can view the main winodws applciation screen on the webpage.
