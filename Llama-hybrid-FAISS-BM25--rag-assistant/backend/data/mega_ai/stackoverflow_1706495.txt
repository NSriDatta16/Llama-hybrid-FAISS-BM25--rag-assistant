MPSTAT show cpu usage average only during an application's execution

I want to know how much my application uses CPU time of each core while executing as well as the length of time it takes for program to end. for the latter I use linux "time" command. for the former I think I must use something like "mpstat". however I want mpstat to generate some logs only during my application execution and I don't know if it is possible to do so. Can anyone help me on this?
