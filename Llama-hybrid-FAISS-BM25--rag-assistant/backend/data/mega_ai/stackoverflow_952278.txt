No, but I can tell you that using a Java based CMS will make your life much much easier. GWT lives on RPC calls, and while translation / JSON overlays are possible, you're much better off with a Java backend. You mind find this difficult, though, because when you want to use GWT you're doing a massive amount of work on the front end, leaving the backend mostly data processing and storage. Since very few CMSs are designed to do nothing more than processing and storage, you might be better off building your own. That said, you might find it very easy if you're open to using App Engine. The GWT + App Engine stack works really well, now has a great Eclipse plugin dedicated to it, and is free to get started with.
