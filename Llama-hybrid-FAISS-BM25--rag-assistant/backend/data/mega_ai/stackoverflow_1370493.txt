You should force a permanent redirect ( HTTP status code 301 ), so the search engines won't index the main page. Apache, nginx and lighttpd can do that for you, I don't know for IIS. Here's is an example with an apache configuration ( in a virtualhost section or .htaccess for example ) : BrowserMatch Googlebot searchengine=1 RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{ENV:searchengine} =1 RewriteRule ^/$ /myrealhomepage/ [R=301,L] Indeed, you need to add every other user agent corresponding to bots, like msnbot ( apparently still used by bing ), and any other that you find relevant. I think it's better to avoid to bury that kind of fine tuning inside your site's webpages, and letting the webserver handle that will consume less resources.
