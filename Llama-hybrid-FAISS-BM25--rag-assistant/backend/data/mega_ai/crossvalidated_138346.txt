This is a clear example of using informative prior , i.e. you have some prior beliefs about the data and you include it in the model as a prior. There is much more that can be done with informative priors, Spiegelhalter et al (2004) in their paper "Incorporating Bayesian Ideas into Health-Care Evaluation" review some of the usages, where choosing different priors could facilitate hypothesis testing or decision making using the data. As about dangers, with exam scores it sometimes happens that the students that have higher abilities score lower on certain kinds of questions. For example, if there is a choice of an "obvious" or a complicated (but wrong) answer, it happens in practice that the more clever students choose the more complicated answer since the other one is "too obvious to be true". So for you this could mean that you could try a prior that gives a higher probability of positive values but allows negative values with a small probability. Finally, you could try different priors and compare the results (like Spiegelhalter et al. suggest).
