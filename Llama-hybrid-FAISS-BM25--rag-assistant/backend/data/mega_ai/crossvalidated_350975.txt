The first question on “how to make humans give feedback” seems more like a UI question. I won’t answer it here. The second question seems like active machine learning. This is where the model learns in an “online” fashion, and continually updates. There’s an entire literature on this. If that’s what you want, there are some tools: prodigy https://prodi.gy/ and NEXT http://nextml.org/ . Prodigy seems best suited for NLP, as it’s developed by the same people as spacy.
