Java 2D - Drag Mouse to rotate Image Smoothly

What is the logic that goes behind rotating an image via mouse movement. I know how to rotate using graphics2d.rotate...but having difficulty doing it with the mouse as the source for rotation. Here is basic steps: get mouse x(dx) and mouse y(dy) distances from anchoring point( in this case that would be the center of the image we want to rotate). use this point in Math.arcTan2(dy,dx) to obtain the angle or rotation. use the value from step to for Graphics2D.rotate method. With that strategy, everytime i rotate the image, the image starts rotating from -pi and after 90 degrees of rotation it go goes back to -pi. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong here, it should be pretty basic. Here is a part of the code : // mouse dragged events get sent here. public void mouseDragged( MouseEvent e ) { int mx = e.getX( ), my = e.getY( ); // just checking if it falls within bounds of the image we // want to rotate. if( mx > speedKX || mx speedKY || my
