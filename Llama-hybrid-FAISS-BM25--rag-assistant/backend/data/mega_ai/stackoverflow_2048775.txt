There are plenty of nice and interesting tutorials. One example is http://blog.interlinked.org/tutorials/vim_tutorial.html But the broad structure that most of them would give you is There are two main modes for editing - Command mode and insert mode. You can move from insert mode to command mode using the key. You can execute commands in the command mode by typing a single key or a sequence of keys. Commands can help you achieve a wide variety of things deletion of lines - dd yanking (copying of lines ) - yy pasting lines below the current line - p pasting lines above the current line - P ( and so on) Most commands in the command mode can be pre-fixed by a "count" to indicate the number of times the command has to be executed. For example, 3dd would delete three lines. One set of commands in the command mode lets you move to the insert mode. That is explained below. There are different ways of entering the insert mode from the command mode. Prominent among them are (i-insert at cursor, I-insert at beginning of line, o-insert a line below, O-insert a line above, a-append, A-append at end of line. The quick reference at http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/vim/vim.pdf Will help you understand the relevance of "count"
