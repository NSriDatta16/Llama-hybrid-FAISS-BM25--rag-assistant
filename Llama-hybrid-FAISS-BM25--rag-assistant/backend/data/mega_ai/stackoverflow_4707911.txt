To present code in HTML typically one would use the tag. Your question isn't very clear, and I don't know what you mean by "without the tags being processed". If you're saying that you want to present a fragment of HTML as code in an HTML page (for example), then you need to "escape" the HTML tags so that the web client doesn't attempt to parse them. To do this, you should use the entity &gt; for the greater-than angle bracket, and &lt; for the less-than bracket.
