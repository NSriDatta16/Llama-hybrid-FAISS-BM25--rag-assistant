You can echo and flush() output, but that's suboptimal and rather fragile solution. For long operations it might be good idea to launch script in the background and store/updte script status in shared location. e.g. you could lanuch script using fopen('http://â€¦ call, proc_open PHP CLI process or even just openg long-running script in an . You could store status in the database or in shared memory (using apc_store() ). This will let user to check status of the script at any time (by refreshing page, or using AJAX) and user won't lose track of the script if browser's connection times out. It also lets you avoid starting same long script twice.
