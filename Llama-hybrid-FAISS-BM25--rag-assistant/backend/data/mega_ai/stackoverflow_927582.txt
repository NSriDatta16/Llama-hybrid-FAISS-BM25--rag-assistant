Creating an Open XML file in .NET - schema

I'm trying to make a report generator inside of a C# application for my boss, I came across this page and looked into RichTextBoxes and think that I can build on this idea to do what my boss is looking for. http://openxmldeveloper.org/articles/OpenXMLDocFromDotNet.aspx The issue I'm running into is their example code for the XML portion assumed you were creating an application in an Office 2007 beta. The schema listed here doesn't work for retail Office 2007. Can anyone show me where I can look to find out more about schema in general, or explain what the code is doing here? Alternatively, if anyone has a different suggestion for creating a .docx file based on the contents of a rich text box, that would be greatly appreciated. I found different resources that offered advice similar to this: http://nishantrana.wordpress.com/2007/11/03/creating-word-document-using-c/ But I kept having issues getting it to recognize what a WordApp was. Here's the code from the first link with the schema issues. private void GenerateDocument_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { string _nameSpaceURI = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/word/2005/10/wordml"; string docFileName = GetSavePath(); //-- Step 1 - Creating the document xml XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument(); XmlElement _wWordDoc = doc.CreateElement("w:wordDocument", _nameSpaceURI); doc.AppendChild (_wWordDoc); XmlElement _wbody = doc.CreateElement("w:body",_nameSpaceURI); _wWordDoc.AppendChild(_wbody); // Check if the string contains a line feed string[] _SplitStr = mleTextForDocument.Text.Split('\n'); // if it contains line feed then each entry with a line feed goes to a new paragraph. for (int row = 0; row I'm sorry for the lack of a clear question, but I really don't know what question to ask. I've never used schemas before, never used XML, and never had to add references to my projects before. Any advice or suggestions are appreciated.
