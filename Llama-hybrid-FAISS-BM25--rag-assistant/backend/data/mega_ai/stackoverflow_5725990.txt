Update: The bug was caused by a typo in the .header closing tag - should have been . Here is a live link: http://jsfiddle.net/RF9cC/1/ Previous: Sounds like the color is being inherited from somewhere else or your not closing the tag properly? You could do something like: .main{ color:#000; } .main a:link{ color:#8D0D19; } That should style all the text in the DIV .main as black but any link as the burgundy. A good (and in-depth) reference to building websites is this e-book by Robert Schifreen: http://www.the-web-book.com/browse/index.html It has detailed information on pretty much all there is to know regarding web design.
