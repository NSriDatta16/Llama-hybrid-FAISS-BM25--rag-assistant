How to derive false positive and false negative from top-k accuracy?

I am working on the following "equality identification" problem and become quite confused on how to reasonably define false positive and false negative in my case. Problem: Suppose I have a large set of graphs $G$ , where for every graph $g \in G$ , there is one and only one graph $g'$ that is identical to $g$ . I am training a model $M$ which, given two graphs $g, g' \in G$ , can decide how similar these two graphs are. The output of $M$ , $o =M(g, g')$ , denotes a similarity score of these two graphs. $o$ is a floating number, ranging from $[0, 1]$ . To evaluate the performance of $M$ , I am measuring the top- $k$ accuracy of its predications in the following very standard way: for g \in G: for t \in G: // suppose here t != g and therefore comparison is meaningful accuracy[(g, t)] = M(g, t) correct_prediction = 0 total_prediction = 0 for g \in G: total_prediction += 1 sort_accuracy_array_on_graph (g); // we sort all comparisons on $g$ with other graphs \in G if g' in top- $k$ most similarity graphs with g: // g' is the ground truth, the "identical" graph with g correct_prediction += 1 correct_prediction / total_prediction // the average top- $k$ accuracy OK, so this seems very standard approach to computing the top- $k$ accuracy of $M$ . However, currently I want to take one step further and somewhat measure the false positive and false negative of $M$ . I understand that FP and FN are both very standard metrics in data mining, but just somewhat become very confused on how to define it in my problem. For instance, I can define False Negative in the following way: False Negative of $M$ : conceptually, FN denotes that $g'$ , the identical graph of $g$ , does not appear in top- $k$ most similarity graph of $g$ . Then, perhaps FN is interchangeable with top- $k$ accuracy in my case? False Positive of $M$ : but if we accept that FN is interchangeable with top- $k$ accuracy in my case, then how to define FP of $M$ ? FP denotes that $M$ aggressively treats graph $t$ , where $t != g'$ , as the "similar" graph of $g$ and appear in its top- $k$ most similar set. Then isn't it indicating that FP is ALSO interchangeable with top- $k$ accuracy in my case? That seems suspicious because in my understanding, FP should not equal to FN ? There must be something wrong. Am I clear on this confusion? Any suggestion would be appreciated. Thank you!
