Need a simple, good (fairly priced) ER Tool

I've been using ERWin for about 10 years now. My version is ancient and I do not think it's worth paying the ridiculous upgrade price! Problem is it's starting to show its age - I've been using it primarliy for MS SQL. I wish I could justify Embarcadero's ER/Studio, but I just need something that will allow me to design a DB and sync it. I've checked out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/674911/light-weight-er-diagram-tool , but nothing fits except Schemabank. But a web based tool has too many drawbacks (recurring fees, less integrated, off-site storage of data). I've also used SQL Maestro for regular queries and DB management. It was OK, but has a few definite shortcomings. Has anybody used the ER designer successfully? What do you guys use?
