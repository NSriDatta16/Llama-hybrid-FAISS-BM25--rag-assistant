If all you need is the Median, then sorting it first could be more expensive than simply running a half-version of a selection sort, depending on your sort algorithm. In an array of n elements, you know the median will be the middle (n/2+1) element if n is odd, or the average of the two middle elements (n/2, n/2+1) if even. So perform a normal selection sort, but instead of running the entire O(N) operation, run it only halfway to obtain that selected median value. You could also do the very easy Bubble Sort, but only run it n/2 times. This will ensure the median is in the middle, and is conceptually easy. Do it manually on paper if you doubt it.
