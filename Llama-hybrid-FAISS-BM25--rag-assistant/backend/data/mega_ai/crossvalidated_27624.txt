Where are the t-values in my pairwise comparisons?

I have data from a study with three conditions. The independent variable was within-subjects and within-items. I did an F1 and F2 analysis (= twice a repeated measures ANOVA) on the averages, by subject (the participants) and by item (the words). I checked/corrected for sphericity and the means do differ significantly. Now I want to know how the three conditions differ from one another. I have a "Pairwise Comparisons" box and p-values (I checked "Bonferroni" when doing the analyses). But I do not have t-values. How can I know my corresponding t-values? Or should I do some paired-samples t-tests? If so, what does this "Pairwise Comparisons" box tell me? Screenshot of the "PC" box:
