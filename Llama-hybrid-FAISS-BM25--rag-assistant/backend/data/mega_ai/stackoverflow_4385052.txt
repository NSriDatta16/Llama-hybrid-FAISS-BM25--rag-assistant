ESS: ess-request-a-process defaults to "S"

Quite often I find myself with bunch of R processes running in ESS buffers. There's a convenient Lisp function ess-request-a-process that asks for R process, and brings it to front. The only downside is that it somehow defaults to S , so each time I'm about to make a switch, I have to type R , ad nauseam. I tried customising the ess-language variable, but even if I set value to "R", i.e. 4 for current session, or even if I save settings for future session, as soon as I type C-c C-k , automagically S appears once again. It's very annoying, and I really don't want to end up with C-x C-b and then C-s for desired R session! =) I even tried setting (setq-default ess-language "R") in .emacs , but with no luck... BTW, I'm running Emacs v. 23.1.1 on Linux Mint and Emacs v. 23.2 on Arch Linux, with ESS v. 5.12. If that's relevant, I run Emacs from terminal with -nw argument. Here's my .emacs : ;; start server (server-start) ;; load ESS (require 'ess-site) (require 'ess-rutils) ;; set HTML help as default (setq inferior-ess-r-help-command "help(\"%s\", help_type = \"html\")\n") (custom-set-variables ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. '(ess-help-kill-bogus-buffers t) '(ess-rutils-keys nil) '(show-paren-mode t)) (custom-set-faces ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom. ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful. ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance. ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right. ) (put 'upcase-region 'disabled nil) So... how to set R once and for all? (I don't use S/S+/SAS)
