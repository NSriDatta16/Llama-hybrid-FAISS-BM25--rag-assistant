If you are after visualizing the relationships, then you might use some network visualization algorithms. I did this once with the tags of cross validated (Disclaimer: I am not an expert at this) . I made a matrix that keeps track of the number of times of times that the different tags are appearing together. Then I used that matrix as a matrix describing the edges in a network graph a correlation matrix in PCA and 3 after some arbitrary trial and error with transformations, as a dissimilarity matrix in an hierarchical clustering method
