Unless you have great reasons to split your docs in different dbs, that seems like is not the case according to your question, them you should keep them all on the same database and have some property on the docs to identify their type (like a "type: user" and "type: project"). That way you can get the desired result on a single couchdb view without too much trouble. In your view map function you will just need to emit keys like ["username",0] and ["username","projectname"]. In Javascript that would be: function(doc) { if (doc.type == "user") { emit([doc._id,0],null); } else if(doc.type == "project") { emit([doc.username,doc._id],null); } } Them you can query that view and have an organized set of documents.
