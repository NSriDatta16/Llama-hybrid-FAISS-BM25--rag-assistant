What is the point of LOTUS if I can just compute the average of $g(X)$?

The law of the unconscious statistician (LOTUS), is a theorem used to calculate the expected value of a function $g(X)=Y$ of a random variable $X$ when one knows the probability distribution of $X$ but one does not know the distribution of $g(X)$ . If the point of LOTUS is to find the expectation $E[g(X)]$ , then the theorem suggests using $X$ 's probability density and $g(X)$ 's values: $$E[g(X)]=\sum_x\,g(x)f_X(x),\;\text{(discrete)}$$ or $$E[g(X)]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\,g(x)f_X(x)\,dx,\;\text{(continuous).}$$ However, and here is my question : If we know and have access to all realizations $y=g(x)$ , why don't we just compute the average of $g$ then? Why would I want to involve $X$ 's PDF/PMF?
