This is a good question. If you take the principles of Bayesian inference literally, then the prior should indeed be specified before you've looked at the data. In practice, we often don't do this. Using the data to inform our choice of prior has a long history (for example, look up empirical Bayes). In modern Bayesian inference, it is common to treat the prior as another part of our model. For example, a reference prior (such as a Unif(0,1) for a Binomial probability) can give sensible results in some cases but very poor results in others. We can only find out by performing the analysis and carefully exploring the output. I highly recommend this paper by Gelman, Simpson & Betancourt: https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/19/10/555
