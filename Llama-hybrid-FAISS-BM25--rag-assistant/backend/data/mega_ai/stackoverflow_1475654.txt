I only have 100% coverage on new pieces of code that have been written with testability in mind. With proper encapsulation, each class and function can have functional unit tests that simultaneously give close to 100% coverage. It's then just a matter of adding some additional tests that cover some edge cases to get you to 100%. You shouldn't write tests just to get coverage. You should be writing functional tests that test correctness/compliance. By a good functional specification that covers all grounds and a good software design, you can get good coverage for free.
