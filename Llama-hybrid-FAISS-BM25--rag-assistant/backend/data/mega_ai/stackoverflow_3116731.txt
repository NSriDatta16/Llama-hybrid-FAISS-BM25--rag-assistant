You should the appropriate tags because they convey the semantics of your data. There is a difference between saying "this is a header" and "this is large, bold text". This information is valuable to screen readers, search engines and other kinds of user agents that aren't your "normal" browsers. Furthermore, people who don't use your stylesheets (for whatever reason) will still be able to read it, but they won't if all your tags are divs and spans (at least not as easily).
