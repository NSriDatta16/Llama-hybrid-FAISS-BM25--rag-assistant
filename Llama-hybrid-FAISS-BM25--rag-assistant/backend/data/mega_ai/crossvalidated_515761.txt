How to best visualize time interval difference and compute a single measure

I have a table like as shown below subject_id lab_test_id lab_test_date value difference "10005606" "20364112" "2143-12-06 02:32:00" "1.3" "13:10:00" "10005606" "20364112" "2143-12-06 15:42:00" "1.3" "02:02:00" "10005606" "20364112" "2143-12-06 17:44:00" "1.3" "10:11:00" "10005606" "20364112" "2143-12-07 03:55:00" "1.3" NULL "10005866" "20364112" "2149-10-01 19:30:00" "2.1" "07:42:00" "10005866" "20364112" "2149-10-02 03:12:00" "2.2" "08:51:00" "10005866" "20364112" "2149-10-02 12:03:00" "2.1" "04:59:00" "10005866" "20364112" "2149-10-02 17:02:00" "1.6" NULL the difference column indicates the time difference between each of the lab tests Now, the doctor likes to know how often these measurements are done for each patient? How can I best convey this information? Should I capture the average difference between lab tests? For example, for patient = 10005606, it is 8 hours. Meaning adding all different values and divide by total number of records. 25 hours, 30 mins (approx)/3 records = 8 hours approx Is there any other better way to represent this using median or any other measure etc? Can guide me with this?
