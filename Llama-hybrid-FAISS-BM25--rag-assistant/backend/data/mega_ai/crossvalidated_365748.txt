how to deal with categorical features (with distinct 10000+ values) other than conversion to one-hot encode and ordinal

Machine Learning Problem : I have a doubt in one of my feature which has an categorical value 1. One way of dealing with it would be like converting those values into numbers means in ordinal form. But the problem with this would be my model could have learned the relation as 1 Some of people said to use model like xgboost which handles the categorical values but how they internally tackle that?
