Combine results from two models on a Bayesian network

I have a Bayesian Network in two versions - one where the information flows in one direction and one where all the arrows are turned around and the information flows in the other direction. After solving each of the networks I get a marginal probability for each node, that is when I solved both the Bayesian networks there are two probabilities associated with each node. My question now is: Is there a good method for combining these probabilities and get a joint probability for each node? And could I also give the different models different weights in this process? I was thinking in terms of mixture models, but I am not sure that is the right way to go.
