Designing a training set for regression on probabiltiy values given time , categorical and continous features

Assume we have following variables out of which "Probability of sale " needs to be predicted , and this is to be done for a portable business vendor whose location changes with time : Business street address|weather description | Day of Year | Day of Week | Hour of Day | Probability of sale The above plot shows the average sales count along the time axis. So how to design the training set for forecasting the sale probability in scikit learn such that it outputs a continous proabability range and thus help in the forecast or probability of sale prediction?
