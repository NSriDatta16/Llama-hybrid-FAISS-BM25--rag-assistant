How to process values entered into an interactive PDF form on the server?

A client is asking how to create an interactive PDF form with functionality that allows the values entered into the form to be processed on the server. From what I've read, the best way to do this is to program the submission by embedding javascript into the PDF file via Acrobat, then writing code on the server side to handle the submission. Does anyone have experience doing this sort of thing? Is the best way to do this indeed by using javascript in the pdf file and using that to post the form values to the server-side form processing method? If you do that, is there any way to pass back values to the PDF file that the form processed successfully?
