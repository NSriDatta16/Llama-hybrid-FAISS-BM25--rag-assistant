how is countvectorizer used in real production environment?

how is countvectorizer used in real production environment? do you keep training the model with new features/vocabulary everyday and save the vocab into a flat file and reload them up on the next day? do you use a pipeline to streamline the process? what is the best practice? we are going to implement a combination of countvectorizer,tfidf and some machine learning algo in production system soon and any tips or practical experiences will be appreciated. thanks!
