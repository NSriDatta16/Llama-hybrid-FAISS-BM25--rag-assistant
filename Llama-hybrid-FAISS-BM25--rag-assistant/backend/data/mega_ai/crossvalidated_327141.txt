Markov Chains: Dice Problem I'm not sure how to start

The Problem: You start with five dice. Roll all the dice and put aside those dice that come up 6. Then roll the remaining dice, putting aside those dice that come up 6. And so on. Let $X_n$ be the number of dice that are sixes after $n$ rolls. a) Describe the transition matrix $P$ for this Markov Chain. I'm just trying to figure out how to construct this transition matrix.. At first I thought I can just have something like (I just put the first row for simplicity since I realized this was wrong) $$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1/4 &1/4 & 1/4 &1/4 \\ \end{bmatrix} $$ I realize this is wrong since the sum exceeds 1. I also realize that I was trying to construct a 5x5 matrix but I would just have the probability that the other dice come up six after rolling one individual dice. Can someone give me some advice on how to start this? Thank you in advance. Edit: The only thing I've thought of is creating a massive matrix that has a row for the probability of a success with dice 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1&2, 1&3, 1&4 etc. etc. I.e. each row represents a different possibility. But this seems a bit too large.. Edit2: I think I realize that I can have it be a 6x6 matrix. So the first row will be conditioned on not getting any sixes the first roll.
