Like the others I think one of your assumptions must be incorrect. You don't say which compiler you're using, but if it's MS Visual C++, try putting the following inside your #ifdef to verify that SOMEMACRO really is defined. #ifdef SOMEMACRO #pragma message("SOMEMACRO is defined") case 4: case 5: #endif
