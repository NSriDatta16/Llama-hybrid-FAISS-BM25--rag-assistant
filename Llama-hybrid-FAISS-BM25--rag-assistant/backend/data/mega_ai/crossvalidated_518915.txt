How to combine independent probabilities on parts of a series to get conditional probability over the entire series?

Given a series $X_{0-2}$ if I have independent probabilities at each step for the series having a particular value say [ $p_0$ , $p_1$ , $p_2$ ], how can I calculate the total probability $P_{0-2}$ of the entire series having a certain value? Here are 2 possible analogies: [Time series prediction] Given independent probability of weather prediction for each day of a week, how can I get the weather prediction for the entire week as a single prediction? [Image classification] Looking at an image in 4 parts, if I assign each part a probability of belonging to a class, how can I combine those independent probabilities to get probability of the entire image belonging to a certain class?
