Correct http response to video stream

I'm currently developing my own little http server for video streaming, and i can't for the life of me figure out how this actually works... This is the request i get from the client: "GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:8080 Accept: / User-Agent: QuickTime.7.6.6 (qtver=7.6.6;cpu=IA32;os=Mac 10.6.4) Connection: close " To which my http server responds(actual code): response followed by the actual video as a bytearray. The video doesnt play... What am I doing wrong?
