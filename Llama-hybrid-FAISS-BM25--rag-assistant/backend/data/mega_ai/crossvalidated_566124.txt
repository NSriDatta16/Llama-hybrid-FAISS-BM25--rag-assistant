is the % difference between 2 log numbers the same as for the corresponding real numbers?

I am editing a report that has a table showing average treatment effects expressed as [log(kg/ha)] - its about growing maize. The authors have compared treatment and control values of 7.42 and 7.10 and calculated the difference as 0.32, which is 4.5% (7.42-7.10)/7.10 x 100 = 4.5% I want to convert this into real numbers. My question is, will the difference between these values expressed as real numbers be 4.5% or not? My gut instinct says not but its a long time since I did logs at school. Thanks for your help!
