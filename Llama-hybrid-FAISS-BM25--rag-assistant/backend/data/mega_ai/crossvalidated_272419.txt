What classification algorithm should one use after seeing that t-SNE separates classes well?

Let's assume we have a classification problem and at first we want to get some insight from the data and we do t-SNE. The result of t-SNE separates classes very well. This implies that it is possible to build classification model that will also separate classes very well (if t-SNE doesn't separate well then it doesn't imply much). Knowing that t-SNE focuses on local structure and that it can separate classes well: What are classification algorithms that should work well on this problem? Scikit suggests SVM with a Gaussian RBF kernel, but what are the others?
