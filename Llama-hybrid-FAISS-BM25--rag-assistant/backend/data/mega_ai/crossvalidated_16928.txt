Which link function for a regression when Y is continuous between 0 and 1?

I've always used logistic regression when Y was categorical data 0 or 1. Now I have this dependent variable that is really a ratio/probability. That means it can be any number between 0 and 1. I really think "logistic" shape would fit very nicely, but I remember categorical Y was a big deal when proving why MLE works. The point is, I am wrong using logit regression for this Y or it doesn't matter? Should I use probit instead? Am I committing a capital crime?
