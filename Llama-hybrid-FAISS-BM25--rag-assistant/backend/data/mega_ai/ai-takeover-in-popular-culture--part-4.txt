 nightmares. In 2001: A Space Odyssey and the associated novel, the artificially intelligent computer HAL 9000 becomes erratic, possibly due to some kind of "stress" from having to keep secrets from the crew. HAL becomes convinced that the crew's willingness to shut him down is imperiling the mission, and he kills most of the crew before being deactivated. The director's decision that most of the fictional crew should die may have been motivated by a desire to tie up some loose ends in the plot. 1970s Westworld (1973), an American science fiction Western directed by Michael Crichton, follows the trials and tribulations in a themed amusement park run by robots. The plot rests on malfunctioning program that allows the robots to kill the amusement park visitors. The film explores themes surrounding the dark side of technology and hints at the growing sentience and emotions of robots, though critics would say that the portrayal of AI remained basic and mechanical. World on a Wire is a 1973 German sci-fi mini-series that takes on the philosophical aspect of a world with machines. It centers on an engineer, Stiller, as he works on a program called the Simulacron, which creates identities for characters in a simulated reality. Stiller notices inconsistencies in his own world, and finds out that the simulation he work for may be closer than he realizes. Teens in the Universe is a 1974 Soviet movie featuring a planet where the local population has been driven extinct by robots. This happened because the society created not only robotic workers, but also higher ranking robots capable of improving the workers. These higher ranking robots decided to "improve" the organics as well by removing all traits that, in their opinion, stopped them from feeling happiness. Among other things, the procedure removed their reproductive drive. By the time the movie takes place, the only survivors are the descendants of those who were on an orbital station when the robots started executing their plan. The original 1978 Battlestar Galactica series and the 2003 remake, depicts a race of Cylons, sentient robots who war against their human adversaries, some of whom are just as menacing as the Cylons. The 1978 Cylons were the machine soldiers of a (long-extinct) reptilian alien race, while the 2003 Cylons were the former machine servants of humanity who evolved into near perfect humanoid imitation of humans down to the cellular level, capable of emotions, reasoning, and sexual reproduction with humans and each other. Even the average centurion robot Cylon soldiers were capable of sentient thought. In the original series the humans were nearly exterminated by treason within their own ranks while in the remake they're almost wiped out by humanoid Cylon agents. They only survived by constant hit and run fighting tactics and retreating into deep space away from pursuing Cylon forces. The remake Cylons eventually had their own civil war, and the losing rebels were forced to join with the fugitive human fleet to ensure the survival of both groups. 1980s In the "Headhunter" episode (1981) of Blake's 7, a British space drama science fiction television series created by Terry Nation and produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Blake and his crew meet a sentient android that has killed its creator and put on his severed head in order to trick them into taking it aboard their spaceship. Blake's own AI system, ORAC, detects its presence and immediately warns them of an existential threat to all human life should they fail to destroy it. In WarGames (1983), a hacked Air Force computer system is determined to launch a global thermonuclear war until it determines that both sides would "lose" and decides that "the only winning move is not to play". The Transformers (1984-1987) animated television series presents both good and bad robots. In the backstory, a robotic rebellion is presented as (and even called) a slave revolt, this alternate view is made subtler
