This seems to be the only applicable test in the manifest and it doesn't seem too useful http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/TOKUHIROM/Net-OpenID-Consumer-Lite-0.02/xt/001_mixi.t Apache2::AuthMixi also uses it a bit This module simply delegates to LWP::UserAgent . I don't like it, it should subclass LWP::UserAgent instead of delegating. You can find the docs for LWP::UserAgent on cpan, and access the base copy through the hidden method _ua (though, by convention, the preceding underscore tells you it isn't supported and it is supposed to be kept secret) my $csr = Net::OpenID::Consumer::Lite->new(); $csr->_ua->post(); # same as LWP::UserAgent::post() It seems as if you're supposed to use only handle_server_response() which calls _check_authentication() which calls _get() which delegates to ->_ua->get() . check_authentication() wants an HashRef jump-table with 5 events for not_openid , setup_required , cancelled , verified , and error . In addition I believe it wants a bunch of key ( openid. ) prefixed stuff, and values. Per the code, for a request to be sent $request->{'openid.mode'} must exist in the $request and be set (preferably to) check_authentication , and not set to 'cancel'. The openid.user_setup_url key must logically not be set or it will just call the respective callback. It must also have an op_endpoint.endpoint key set, which is where the request is destined to go. This code isn't hard to read, I'd suggesting taking a look The author also seems to have a bunch of modules which is a good sign. I don't like jump-tables with data like that, it seems kind of weird from a UI perspective.
