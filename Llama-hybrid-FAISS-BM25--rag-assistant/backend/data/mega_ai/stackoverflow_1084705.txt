First it's important to understand the web languages, html, css, javascript. A good resource would be http://www.alistapart.com/ Then understand how http works, and how servlets are modeling http requests/response cycles. This is a good book: Head First Servlets and JSP. Then try out the first java web framework that captures your attention. A good one is Spring Framework. Good luck!
