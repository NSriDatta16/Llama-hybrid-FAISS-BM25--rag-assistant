Is it ever a good idea to store BLOBs in a database?

For a while I've been working on inserting the data from a bloated Excel workbook into a SQL database. My team has suggested keeping a backup of the .xls, and they are wondering if it might be a good idea to put the Excel workbook actually inside the database so that all the relevant data from our project was together. I know some databases support the insertion of binary files, but clearly this was the not the original intended use of DB systems, and so I'm thinking that this is a bad idea. My vote would be to put URLs to the workbooks in the database and keep the workbooks in a secure location on our intranet. What are the pros (if any, besides keeping both the production data and the backup in the same place) and cons of putting BLOBs in a database? Edit: Just to clarify a little further, though I give a specific scenario, I intend this question to primarily be about BLOBs in general. But whatever I can glean for your responses that will assist me in my specific situation is, of course, appreciated. :) Thanks, -Robert P.S. For those of you that didn't know, BLOB is a backcronym for "Binary Large Object"
