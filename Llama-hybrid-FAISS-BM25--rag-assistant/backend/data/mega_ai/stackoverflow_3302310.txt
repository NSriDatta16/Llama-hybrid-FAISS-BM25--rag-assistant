Well Geries, I appreciate your help but ultimately the answer required a drastic rethinking of how I was using JQTouch. The solution was to move everything to an onclick event and make all the hrefs link to #. This might be what you were talking about Geries. In the onclick function I do the logic, preloading, loading of the page through my own GET through jquery, then use the public object jQT.goTo(div, transition). This seems to get around the WebKit bugs or whatever I was running into and this now owrks on FireFox, Chrome, Safari, iPhone, and the lot. I do run into a few animation issues with JQT but I think these are known issues that I hope Stark and the gang at JQTouch are working on.
