Look at the distribution of the features you want to consider for anomalies (e.g., user attributes) conditioned on the date, so you do not trigger a warning for normal seasonality. An anomaly then is when the current conditional distribution is significantly different from the historical average. For more information look into contextual anomaly detection . Welcome to the site and good luck!
