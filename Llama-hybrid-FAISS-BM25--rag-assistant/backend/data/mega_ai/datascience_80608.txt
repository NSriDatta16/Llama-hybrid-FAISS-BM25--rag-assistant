Selecting Transforms with sklearn pipelines

So I am currently working on a Data set, and I want to use Pipelines to select the transforms. Here is an example of what I want to do : # I missed the imports just for brevity pipeline = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), PolynomialFeatures(), PCA(), LogisticRegression()) So what I want to do, I want to try both StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler and no scaler when I am using other methods such as XGBOOST. Then I want to try to use polynomial features and then use a PCA, only if I used polynomial features. And finally, I want to try Logistic Regression and XGBOOST with GridSearch (This last part I know how to do). Anybody did something similar? Thank you!
