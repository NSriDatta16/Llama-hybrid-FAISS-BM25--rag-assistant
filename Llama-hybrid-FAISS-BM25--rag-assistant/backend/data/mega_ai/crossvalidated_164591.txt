I would suggest using dissimilarity measures created specially for time series. Dynamic Time Warping and Complexity-Invariant Distances are two popular distances that take care to some extent of the misalignment. Some practitioners apply distance measures over some type of transformation of the original time series to extract relevant features. Popular transforms are 1) estimations of spectral densities (periodograms, discrete fourier transforms, etc). 2) low pass filters (moving averages, gaussian filters, etc) 3) time frequency analysis (like wavelet transform, etc.). There is also a whole area of pitch detection methods, that are usually variants of 1),2) & 3) well suited to music. You can find a good review in the following link http://sound.eti.pg.gda.pl/student/eim/synteza/leszczyna/index_ang.htm You can also use complex techniques that combine several methods for audio analysis (see Salamon & Gomez 2012 as an example).
