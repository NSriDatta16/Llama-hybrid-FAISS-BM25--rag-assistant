It sounds like an incorrect Primary key. It's more likely that emailID is intended to be your natural key but for some reason (maybe a development standard in your organization?) you want to use a surrogate ID, AccountID but you still intend for both email ID and surrogate ID to both be unique and have a one to one relationship. If this is true then your primary key should be AccountID and you should place a unique constraint on EmailID.
