I have used jQuery extensively and love it. I have reviewed ExtJS on several occasions and would love to have the chance to use this library at some point. This is my take. jQuery The junk drawer of javascript programming. They got everything you need in there, if you're willing to dig, use some duct tape and super glue, and in general have a group of developers able and willing to hammer code. jQuery is great! It's used in way more places than you think. However, like Drupal and other community-supported frameworks/libraries, when you get free support, you get what you pay for. You can get it all done with jQuery, but sometimes you need a shovel, flashlight and perseverance. Additionally, very good documentation (on par with PHP's online docs), and tons, literally tons, of example code and blog entries out there. Will appeal to tinkerers and "advanced scripters" who are not shy to Google a phrase to find an example that can be used to scaffold a problem and speed development. ExtJS Professionally developed by a for-profit company, these are more akin to controls (in the context of Visual Studios) than widgets or plugins. Intentionally complete and robust, with an eye for detail and a higher-level organizational structure than I think exists in the wilds of jQuery, ExtJS is a get what you pay for: A professionally-developed and supported product that lives and dies by it's ability to return value. Will appeal to professionally-trained "programmers" expecting extensive testing and a higher-order or rigorousness in the development of the controls. Final Recommendation It really has to do with your shop and customers. If your group is more DIY and likes to glue together things and get it out the door, go with jQuery. It's robust for any situation. If you have a very ordered and professional shop, ExtJS might be a good choice, but jQuery will also be viable. I don't see the need to split your knowledgebase and use both, but really, if you do, use ExtJS for the client-facing portion and jQuery for the admin consoles. I don't see the benefit the other way around. Also, for you admin consoles, look into TIBCO . Possibly overkill, but very interesting.
