For the "pure" ARIMA models, That the time-series involved are weakly stationary or Integrated of some order (which implies restrictions on the values of the unknown coefficients, as well as their constancy). That all observed time series are combinations of white noises only, and perhaps a constant. Moreover, the very fact that you use the abbreviation "ARIMA", implies in itself that There are no other predictors (in which case you would have an "ARIMA-X" model) and The relations are exclusively linear (to indicate the possibility of non-linear modelling, you should abbreviate to "NARIMA").
