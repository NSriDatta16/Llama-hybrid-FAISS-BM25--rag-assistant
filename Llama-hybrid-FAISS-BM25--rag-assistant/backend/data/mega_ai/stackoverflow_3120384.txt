Virtual memory and address spaces are two separate notions. Memory paging is yet another thing. The size of the address space is limited to the range locations that can be addressed. This is a limitation of the CPU and the mode it is operating in. For example, a typical 32-bit application running on a 64-bit system with 32 GB of memory still has a 32-bit address space. The fact that more storage is available doesn't change the fact that (ignoring for the simplicity the existence of PAE) the 32-bit program only uses 32-bit addresses. Virtual memory is realy just the notion that the operating system can control a set of mappings between virtual memory pages and physical memory pages. Memory paging allows the operating system to make it so that some of the virtual pages are stored on disk instead of physical memory. This can allow more virtual memory to be allocated than there is physical memory on a system.
