getting vi and rxvt to work in cygwin

I am trying to use rxvt on my cygwin w win XP but the terminal appears and disappears. What could be wrong? This is true for all except rxvt-native . I have tried a few commands found online but with no success. I include 2 I have tried: start C:\cygwin\bin\rxvt.exe -sb -sl 3000 -fg gray -bg black -fn "Lucida Console-14" -e /bin/bash --login -i . path C:\cygwin\bin;%path% ssh-agent rxvt -e bash --login -i Another problem I am facing is trying to get vi to work in my cygwin bash shell. Setting term to xterm or vt100 does not work. Hitting enter, I see a string 78 or some other issue pops up. I have never modified my .inputrc. My main issue was trying to get vi to work properly. I just found out that if I run /etc/postinstall/terminfo.sh.done , I can now navigate properly in vi. The 78 (newline) M still appears but at least I can navigate in vi. Feb 25 - This problem went away after a few windows updates. Would it make sense to ANSWER my question on the basis that this is longer reproducible?
