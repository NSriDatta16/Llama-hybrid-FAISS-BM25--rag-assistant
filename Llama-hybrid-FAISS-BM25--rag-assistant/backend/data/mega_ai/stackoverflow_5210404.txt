How simply convert jaxws objects

HI, I have webservices calling one another using jaxws. The problem is that I pass around compex object, classes. And each time I get the object belongs to another package (proxy1.jaxs.myClass...) so i have to write converts forth and back. is there a simple way to convert between the proxy object, to origanl object or another proxy object? thanks, hope i explained myself.
