For some reason the js files weren't loading, or not loading fully, so I copied the ones I needed to my theme folder and linked to them in my .info file. scripts[] = js/jquery.ui.widget.js scripts[] = js/jquery.ui.mouse.js scripts[] = js/jquery.ui.core.js scripts[] = js/jquery.ui.draggable.js The order they are loaded is important. I found many many other threads and forums where other people have been having the same problem in the last 1-4 months. Hope this helps someone else. The js console in firebug was really helpful in getting to the root of the errors, if anyone needs to explore their own problem further.
