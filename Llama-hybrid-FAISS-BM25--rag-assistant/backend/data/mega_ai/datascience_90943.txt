Question About Discriminator of CycleGan

The Discriminator of CycleGan outputs not just a single value to say that the image is real or fake.... But It outputs a grid of numbers (like 8X8 or 7x7), where each number says whether one patch of the input image is fake or real. So, my question is that, why do we do this.. What benefits does it gives us, and what was the problem in the approach where we only outputted a single value?
