I think you might want something like this: set.seed(16) # we have 4 events, and 10 people of which 5 of them should be twice as likely # that's the same as having 15 people of which 5 belong to one group and 10 to the other sample.fun = 6))) # the proportion of events in individuals 1-5 is 0.3335 We can further check whether the events per individual do make sense samples I bet the recode part could be done much better than my inelegant ifelse() -structure.
