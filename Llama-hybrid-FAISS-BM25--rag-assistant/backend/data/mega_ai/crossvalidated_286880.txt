Need advice regarding Deep Learning for predictive model

I have been working with neural networks for generation of a predictive model using a multivariate approach. I have come across Deep Learning (or Deep neural networks) as a tool to enhance the success of these models. From what I have read so far though, it seems the most Deep Learning methods are catered towards image recognition/computer vision, for example ConvNet. Anyone knows if there are any approaches in Deep Learning meant for model building (e.g. regression types) using several predictor variables, similar to a multilayer NN? I have read up on DBN, but am unclear if it can be similarly applied for my purpose. Thank you for the advice.
