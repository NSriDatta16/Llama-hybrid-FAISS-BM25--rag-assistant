I cannot currently say that they were not related, but we can at least say that Daniel is not Samuel's son. This biography of Samuel S Wilks says [1]: On 1 September 1931 Wilks married Hattie Eugenia Orr (1906-2000), known as Gena. They had one child, a son named Stanley Neal Wilks born in 1932. However, the elder Wilks would be of the right age to perhaps be a grandfather or great uncle to the younger one (or even some other, more distant relation, of course -- ultimately we're all related) [1] J J O'Connor and E F Robertson (2014) Samuel Stanley Wilks , Biographies MacTutor History of Mathematics archive School of Mathematics and Statistics University of St Andrews, Scotland http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Wilks.html
