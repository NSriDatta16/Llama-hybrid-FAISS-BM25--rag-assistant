1. Duplicates Concurring other answers: Using Set should be the most efficient way to remove duplicates. HashSet should run in O(n) time on average. Looping and removing repeats would run in the order of O(n^2) . So using Set is recommended in most cases. There are some cases (e.g. limited memory) where iterating might make sense. 2. Arrays.asList() is a cheap operation that doesn't copy the array, with minimal memory overhead. You can manually add elements by iterating through the array. public static Set arrayToSet(T[] array) { Set set = new HashSet(array.length / 2); for (T item : array) set.add(item); return set; }
