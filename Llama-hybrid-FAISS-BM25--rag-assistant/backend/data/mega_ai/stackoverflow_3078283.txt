Does anybody knows a software that tracks multiple projects and resources?

I am looking something that: Allows me to create projects (with a duration) and assign needed roles for them (I don't care about tasks or a gantt chart in this tool, just a project view) Allows me to create people with one or more roles Set desired start range date for each project Calculate what people to assign to the project and a concrete start date: this calculation could also indicate that there is not enough people to start the project, showing the next available start date and the missing roles to start in the desired date this calculation could reallocate people to solve the problem. When a new project is received could be added to the portfolio and recalculate. I have googled a lot about this and all I was able to find were papers describing genetic algorithms or heuristics to resolve the problem, but haven't seen a software that actually solves it. (I suppose its a NP-Hard problem) Thanks in advance!
