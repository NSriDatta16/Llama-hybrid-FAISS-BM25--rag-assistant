I think using a RNN is necessary for your dataset. You should definitely try out LSTM and GRU networks. You basically input the current observation, and it will output the value of the next observation. If you want to predict 1440 observations ahead, you input the last known observation, which will give you the next observation - and you input this again, repeat this process 1440 times. However keep in mind, the lstm will not be able to detect patterns that occurred in other seasons than your measurements. 400000 samples seems a lot, but not if you're doing research about the sun - which has an annual pattern, 6 months won't cover the entire cyclus.
