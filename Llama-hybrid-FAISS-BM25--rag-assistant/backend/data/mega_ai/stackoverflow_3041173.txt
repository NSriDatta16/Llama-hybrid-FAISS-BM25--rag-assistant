I was able to create an instance of my CustomLabel in a test project. What I did differently was instead of dragging a UILabel, I pulled in an instance of CustomLabel into the view. I implemented awakeFromNib against a target for the latest sdk as follows. -(void)awakeFromNib { [self setText:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@",[self class]]]; } - (void)drawTextInRect:(CGRect)rect // called as expected { NSLog(@"drawTextInRect: called"); [super drawTextInRect:rect]; } Couple of mysteries... I implemented init and initWithFrame in CustomLabel, neither was called by the machinery that loads the view from the nib.
