The question you are asking is actually very important, and too many people will tell you that language choice is just personal preference. But you already know that, from the standpoint of an organization, this is not true. Choosing a standard set of frameworks, languages, tools, etc. is an important business decision. Your programmers should be able to use either language with a little time, encouragement and maybe a little training. C# and VB are close, and there are no significant technical reasons to choose one over the other... So my advise is to pick your organization's language based on businesses reasons. If hiring C# guys is easier, or if you find they tend to have better skillsets for the kind of work you do then score one for C#. If you write code for customers, and those customers prefer C# deliverables then score another for C#. If you have existing code in VB, score one for VB. It should be a pretty simple breakdown... just ignore technical reasons and concentrate on how the choice of language will affect your business in terms of hiring, training, ability to deliver to the customer, etc.
