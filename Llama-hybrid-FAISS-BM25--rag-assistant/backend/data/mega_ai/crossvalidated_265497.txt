Incorporating prior knowledge into artificial neural networks

Artificial neural networks have a bad reputation of being a black box. More over in cases when we do have some prior knowledge about the domain of a particular supervised learning problem it is not obvious how to introduce it to the model. On the other hand Bayesian models and the state of art of those - Bayesian networks - solve this problem naturally. But these models have their own known limitations. Is it possible to take best from the both kinds of models. Are there any theory or practical success stories of combining both kinds of models into a some hybrid. And, in general, what are the known strategies to incorporate prior knowledge into a neural network model (feed forward or recurrent)
