In a long running Common Lisp application, what strategy should be used to manage garbage?

If I am hosting a long running application such as a web server within a Common Lisp image, what strategy should I use to manage the garbage collector? I'm assuming that, by default, the garbage collector is entitled to spend long periods of time sorting out the heap, at times I can't predict. This may impact a particular browser request in ways I don't want. Is there a method in Common Lisp to control this? Perhaps by encouraging it to work in a 'little-and-often' manner?
