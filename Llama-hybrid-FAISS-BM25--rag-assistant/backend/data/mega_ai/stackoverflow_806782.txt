Move it far enough away that it's inconvenient to use, while your cheat sheet is close enough to easily lookup whenever you are in doubt about how to do something. I would not suggest unplugging it, since it is a useful tool for some operations, such as moving files around. I find drag and drop in some sort of tree like file system view is much easier than the alternatives. The majority of editing operations though, are quickly accomplished via key strokes once you remember them.
