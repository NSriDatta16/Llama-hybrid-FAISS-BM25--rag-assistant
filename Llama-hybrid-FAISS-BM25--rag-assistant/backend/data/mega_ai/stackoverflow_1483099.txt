If you add a standard library project you will not be able to use it inside Silverlight, if you add a Silverlight library project you will have the same limitations that you are finding in the Silverlight app itself. Your logic, if you need it to run clientside in the Silverlight app, will have to limit itself to what is available in the Silverlight versions of the .NET libraries. However this still represents a significant coverage of the standard .NET libraries especially from the perspective of clientside UI application. What specific .NET libraries are you unable to access?
