Custom .NET Application Search Solution Needed

We are developing a custom .NET directory listing style application for a client and we require a powerful search solution. The application will be built in ASP .NET C# on SQL Server 08. The application is based around data which users to the organisation can enter in a profile management style area. Fields can be textboxes, textareas, selection boxes, multiselects etc. A user from the main website needs to be able to use the search function to find a result, but this result should search the entire database and not only base the results on one or two fields. It could be anything within any of the fields the user can fill out or select etc. Can anyone help me find a possible solution for a .NET powered search engine we can use for this application? It must be preferably C#, running on .NET 3.5 and SQL Server 08. The database is a completely custom built schema and so there is no schema example to show or that can be shown. If you need more information to provide a satisfactory answer let me know and I'll try to provide some more information specific to what you ask. Thanks, Cian
