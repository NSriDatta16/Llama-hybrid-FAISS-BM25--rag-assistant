a/b testing with two different treatment groups

I want to run an A/B test with two machine learning models M1 and M2 (called treatment groups T1 and T2 ), and I have a control group C without using machine learning model. Is there a specific name of these A/B test with two treatment groups and a control group? How do we show that M1 is really better than M2 ? E.g., using pairwise comparison using t-Test between T1 , T2 and C or there are other methods?
