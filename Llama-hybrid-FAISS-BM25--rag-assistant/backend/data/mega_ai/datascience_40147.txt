Will reinforcement learning work if states wont get repeated again?

I am working on a information retrieval model where the user enters a query and the model has to retrieve 3 most relevant FAQ pairs.I am collecting implicit feedback in terms of page clicks etc.What I don't understand is how to define states if I want to implement this with reinforcement learning?If I define each query as a state, all states will be different .Can anyone shed some light on this please!!!
