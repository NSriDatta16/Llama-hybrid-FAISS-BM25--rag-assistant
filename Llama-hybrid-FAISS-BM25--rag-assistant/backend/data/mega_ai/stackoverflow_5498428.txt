How to enable and disable a CRM 2011 Organization using C#/VB.Net and WCF Deployment Service or CRM 2011 SDK?

I want to be able to enable/disable a CRM 2011 Organization using Deployment Service (Deployment.Svc) or using CRM 2011 SDK (Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Deployment Namespace) using C# or VB.Net application. I am using some code like this: Dim StateReq As CRM2011DeploymentSvc.DeleteRequest Dim StateResp As CRM2011DeploymentSvc.DeleteResponse StateReq.EntityType = DeploymentEntityType.Organization StateReq.InstanceTag.Id = FoundOrganization.OrganizationId StateReq.InstanceTag.Name = FoundOrganization.UniqueName StateResp = CType(_CrmDeployService.Execute(StateReq), DeleteResponse) 1. Q1: This code is OK as far as deletion of entities(Organization, accounts etc) is concerned. but i am more interested in Enabling and disabling the organization (occasionally) along deleting (when required) . 2. Q2: Lets say if i Delete an Organization, will i be able to undo delete or recover it. If yes then how and if not what else is the alternative? 3. Q3: In CRM 4.0 we can disable/Enable the organization using **SetStateOrganizationRequest** **SetStateOrganizationResponse** Classes using the Deployment web service but in CRM 2011 , the Deployment WCF Service does not contain any such method. What should i do to enable or disable the organization ? Replies are much appreciated. Thank you.
