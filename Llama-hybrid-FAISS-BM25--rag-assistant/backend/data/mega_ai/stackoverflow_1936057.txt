Maybe the STXXL library can help: STXXL provides an STL replacement using an abstraction layer to storage devices to allow for the optimal layout of data structures. This allows for multi-terabyte datasets to be held and manipulated in standard C++ data structures, whilst abstracting the complexity of managing this behaviour efficiently. STXXL utilises multi-disk I/O to speed up I/O bound calculations. STXXL has been developed at the University of Karlsruhe.
