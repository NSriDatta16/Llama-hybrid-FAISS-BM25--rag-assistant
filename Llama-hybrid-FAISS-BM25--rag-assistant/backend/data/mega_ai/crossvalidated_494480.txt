In a stable population with a life expectancy of 82 years you will have the situation that on average people die at 82 years. The number of people that die is more or less constant every year and roughly 1/82 of the people die every year (although it does not need to be exactly 1/82, but it matches roughly). So you might be indeed puzzled when covid-19 kills on average people of 82 years. If the average age of dying is the same, then is it not also the same like 'normal' death as in this stable population? But the deaths due to covid-19 are an increase of the death rate (that happens to occur at 82 years on average, and that is possible because the stable population has people that are older than the life expectancy). And now we have an unstable population (so that is the difference, it is not the same as 'normal death'). The number of people that die has increased and more people die than the year before. In the end you will always have different causes of death at different ages. And the age dependent death rates can increase and decrease. The death rate at the age of 82 is currently a few percent and not 100%, so there is still room to rise.
