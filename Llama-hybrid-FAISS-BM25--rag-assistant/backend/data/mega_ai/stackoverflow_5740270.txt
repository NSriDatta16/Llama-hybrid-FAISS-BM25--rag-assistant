Will this code block $ % # or ( as I type? No. Detecting keys pressed is futile, users can paste or drag text into form controls so the key codes don't match the text being entered (or not fire a key event at all). Also, you only care about the value when the form is submitted , whatever value it has in the meantime is irrelevant to you. Validate form control content on submit, restricting keyboard entry by any means is very, very annoying for users and easily bypassed.
