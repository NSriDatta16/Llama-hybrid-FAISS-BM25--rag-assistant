Data Science book with exercices

I'm looking for a data science book that covers statistics, probabilities, machine learning, and includes exercises for practice. I believe that having exercises will greatly help in understanding and applying the concepts. Can anyone recommend a book that covers: Basics of statistics and probabilities Different machine learning algorithms Real-world applications Exercises with solutions Etc. I've searched for resources but haven't found one that fits all these criteria. Any suggestions would be much appreciated! Thank you
