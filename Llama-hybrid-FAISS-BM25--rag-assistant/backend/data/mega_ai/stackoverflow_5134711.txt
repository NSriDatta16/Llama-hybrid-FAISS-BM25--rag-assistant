Eclipse: add import to a bunch of classes

I have 60 or so Java classes in an Eclipse project that I am reorganizing (everything was in the default package, ick!) that need to import another package in the project (newly created by other refactoring). I would rather not do a Ctrl+Shift+O on every file. Is there someway I can speed this up?
