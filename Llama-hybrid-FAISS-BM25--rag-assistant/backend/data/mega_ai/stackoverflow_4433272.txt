I would opt for mySQL and/or an in memory cache like APC or memcache. Honestly, a properly indexed database table will probably be plenty fast for most operations. And you can easily clear all the records via a DELETE statement comparing timestamps. It will definitely be faster than home-brew solution on the filesystem. And assuming you're already using mySQL for the rest of your site, you don't need to worry about an extra storage layer. EDIT: I'd also like to point out that memory is volatile. Should your server lose power, your data will disappear if it's not persisted somewhere (like a database).
