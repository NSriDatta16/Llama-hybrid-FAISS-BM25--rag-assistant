For JavaScript organization been using the following Folder for all your javascript Page level javascript gets its' own file with the same name of the page. ProductDetail.aspx would be ProductDetail.js Inside the javascript folder for library files I have a lib folder Put related library functions in a lib folder that you want to use throughout your application. Ajax is the only javascript that I move outside of the javascript folder and gets it's own folder. Then I add two sub folders client and server Client folder gets all the .js files while server folder gets all the server side files.
