How to decide whether we need to flatten our dataset (both training and testing) or not?

I'm following tutorials of recognizing handwritten digits and object detection using CNN with Keras library from these source: Digit Recognition , Object detection respectively. Now in digit recognition, they have flattened the training and testing data set into 1D vector of 784 pixels from the original 2D structure of 28*28 using following code: num_pixels = X_train.shape[1] * X_train.shape[2] X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], num_pixels).astype('float32') X_test = X_test.reshape(X_test.shape[0], num_pixels).astype('float32') But in Object detection, no such flattening is done prior to training. So my question is how do we come to know when to flatten the data set and when we need not? Data set used in digit rec. is MNIST , where as data set of obj. detection is CIFAR-10 . I'm newbie in Machine Learning and Neural networks. Thanks
