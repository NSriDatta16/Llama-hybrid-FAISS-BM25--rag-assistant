I think rather than SO, MetaOptimize might help you more. I had taken only an introductory class in ML. But from what I remember, neural networks work for many problems, but they are like black boxes. If they do not work, it is difficult to determine why they are not working. Specifically, there are no specific rules as to the number of nodes in the hidden layer (there are rules of thumb for some problems).
