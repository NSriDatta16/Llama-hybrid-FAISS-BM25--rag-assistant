Permutational MANOVA and Mahalanobis distances in R

In this paper Anderson, M.J. (2001). A new method for non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance . Austral Ecology , 26 , 32â€“46 I found very useful MANOVA approach that can, to some extent, cope with non-normality. I was wondering if it is possible and plausible to include Mahalanobis distances as similarity method. In fact my question is about R vegan package function adonis that implements this type of MANOVA but does not allow Mahalanobis distances as similarity measure. It allows though through designdist function the creation of any distance measure to be used in adonis, but I totally can't deal with that syntax. Any experiences regarding this?
