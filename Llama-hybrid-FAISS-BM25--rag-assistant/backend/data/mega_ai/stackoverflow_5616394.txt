I totally sympathize with your frustration. I think you've summed up the problem and the common approaches to address it well. I've gone both routes you've suggested in various situations. First, another, even more problematic(!) option. I don't condone the following as a best practice! ...But you could add it to the list that may fit in limited circumstances. http://jsfiddle.net/peteorpeter/J4sT9/ Basically, if you can stomach using hefty portions of absolute positioning and fixed heights, you can make the title a link and cover the other elements. It's quite fragile and rigid, really. You also can't have a background on the link or it will obscure the other elements. Ok, once you get the puke taste out of your mouth after looking at that mess, I think you should: Embrace the nice semantic markup you started with Add a link in it somewhere that looks pretty and clickable In JS, hide the link above and route clicks from the to the hidden link In JS (or CSS 2+), enhance the hover effect on the Slightly altered markup: Item 1 Meta information bla bla Paragraph one Paragraph two Item 1 Nothing too groundbreaking there, just basic progressive enhancement. Folks with less capable browsers have to hunt for a link and might not get any hover effects (but it could still be a handsome, usable interface); folks with more advanced browsers get an even more intuitive and responsive experience.
