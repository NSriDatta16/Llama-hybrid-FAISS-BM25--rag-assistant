CVS, Subversion and GIT all allow to create the repository on a network share. All of them discourage this because, in the case of a network outage, the repository may become corrupted. So if you have frequent network outages, this might not be an option but frankly, most networks are pretty stable today. And in my 15 years since I use VCS, I never had one corrupt a repo on a share. Most network file systems will try their very best to commit pending writes, so unless the server completely dies, the data will be saved when the hiccup is over. But if you're still worried, use git because it allows to restore the main repository with minimal data loss from your local copy (see this question for details).
