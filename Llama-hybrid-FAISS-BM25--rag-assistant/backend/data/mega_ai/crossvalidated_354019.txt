LSTM time series classification using keras

I have a list of time series with variable length, such that, [ts.shape for ts in ts_list] # output # [(50, 1), (56, 1), (120, 1), ...] and the label indicating whether the time series is normal or abnormal, label_list # output # [0, 1, 1, 0, ...] len(label_list) == len(ts_list) # True I searched for examples of time series classification using LSTM, but got few results. Is there an example showing how to do LSTM time series classification using keras? In my case, how should I process the original data and feed into the LSTM model in keras?
