Apart from the already mentioned XMLSpy, other commercial heavyweights include OxygenXML , and StylusStudio which apart from visualization also support XSLT transformations and debugging, WSDL, XPath, etc. Windows XML Marker does a good job of visualizing simple XML data. It is fast and light-weight. Version 2.x is a limited 30 days trial, and has JSON visualization. The older version 1.1 is fully functional freeware without limitations (scroll the download page to see the link). I have found it to be the best quick tool for visualizing XML logs. If you don't care about JSON support, then the only important limitation in v1.1. is lack of Unicode support. Version 1.1 runs fine under wine on Linux and OSX. Microsoft Excel starting with version 2003 can visualize table-like XML data - drag-and-drop an XML file into an empty Excel window (or to the Excel toolbar if you have a spreadsheet already opened), and select As an XML table when prompted. Make sure you remove the DTD schema declaration in the XML file or otherwise Excel fails to open the file. First Object is the fastest but it does not go as far as XML Marker in terms of visualization. Linux KXmlEditor is usable but not outstanding. Cross-platoform Intellij IDEs i.e. Idea, Pycharm, etc. (including the free community editions) do a good job of XML and HTML visualization, validation and navigation, running xPath queries. It can show a tree view of an XML/HTML file as well as navigation breadcrumbs reflecting the cursor position: The tree navigation is also accessible via a popup, from the menu Navigate > File Structure or the corresponding shortcut. In the popup you can type the partial node name and press Enter to quickly jump to it: You can also jump to parent/child nodes by clicking them in the breadcrumb. If you can't see the breadcrumb then enable it from the settings .
