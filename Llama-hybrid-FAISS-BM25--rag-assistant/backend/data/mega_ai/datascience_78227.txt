Binary classification using images and an external dataset

I currently have a project in which I must create a binary classifier to detect defective products. I have image data which has already been labeled (each part has been labeled as a pass or fail), as well as an external dataset which has specific measurements for each image (it contains parameters which could not be accurately captured by a camera, such as temperature, length of a particular piece, etc.). I have achieved decent accuracy by applying basic classification algorithms such as logistic regression and support vector machines (in scikit-learn) to only this external dataset, but I would like to incorporate the image data to improve accuracy. I have read about training a CNN on the images, but I do not know how to incorporate the external dataset to train the model (in fact, I don't even know if this is possible). Is there any way to use both the image data as well as the external dataset to classify these images? Any help is much appreciated.
