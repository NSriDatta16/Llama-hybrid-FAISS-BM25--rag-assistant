Haskell Parse Paragraph and em element with Parsec

I'm using Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec and Text.XHtml to parse an input like this: this is the beginning of the paragraph --this is an emphasized text-- and this is the end\n And my output should be: this is the beginning of the paragraph this is an emphasized text and this is the end\n This code parses and returns an emphasized element em = do{ ;count 2 (char '-') ; ;s But I don't know how to get the paragraphs with emphasized items Any ideas? Thanks!!
