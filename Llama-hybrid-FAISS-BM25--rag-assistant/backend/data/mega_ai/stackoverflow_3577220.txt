You need to pull in the dirty value of the changed element before it is saved to the database. It does not make sense to validate the clean value after the fact. See here for info on data storage in ExtJS: http://www.fusioncube.net/index.php/managing-dirty-rows-in-a-sencha-extjs-editorgridpanel You can use properties such as field.originalValue and field.getRawValue() to get at the data store and see the difference.
