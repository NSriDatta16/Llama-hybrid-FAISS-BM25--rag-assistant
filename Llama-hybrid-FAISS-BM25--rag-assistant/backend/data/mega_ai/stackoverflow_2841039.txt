Error trying to scan the classes at /Users/kevin/Documents/netbeans/WebAlbums/trunk/WebAlbums3/WebAlbums3-ea/dist/gfdeploy/WebAlbums3-Service.jar for annotations in which a ServletContainerInitializer has expressed interest java.util.zip.ZipException: error in opening zip file Look like the JAR file is corrupted. Recompile/replace it. If you're FTP'ing this during deploying, take care that you send binary files as binary data, not as text data. This can also be caused by the temp storage being full or not writable. Update : Google learns me that this may also be JDK specific. Try upgrading JDK to the latest.
