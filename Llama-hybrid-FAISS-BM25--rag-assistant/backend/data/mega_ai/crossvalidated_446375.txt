My training and cross validation set aren't matching

I'm new to machine learning and currently I'm doing linear regression. I split my training set into the cross validation set, the test set and the training set. The hypothesis that you see here, is of the training set. My question is, even though the model fits good and the cost is minimizing with iterations then why aren't my cross validation answers matching?
