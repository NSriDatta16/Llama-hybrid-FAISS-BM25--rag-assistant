Why don't get the expected result using a SVM training model?

I want to learn a model for recognizing facial emotions. . I used a dataset with 213 samples. I extract firstly features using the Gabor filter. Then, I reduce the data dimensionality with the PCA and the genetic algorithm. Finally, I test performance using cross validation with a test size of 25%, and I got 98% acuraccy. The problem is when I test the SVM model on other images, I don't get the expected result.
