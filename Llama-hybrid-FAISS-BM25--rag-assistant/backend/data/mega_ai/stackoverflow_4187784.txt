Texture lookup in vertex shader behaves differently on iPad device vs iPad simulator - OpenGL ES 2.0

I have a vertex shader in which I do a texture lookup to determine gl_Position. I am using this as part of a GPU particle simulation system, where particle positions are stored in a texture. It seems that: vec4 textureValue = texture2D(dataTexture, vec2(1.0, 1.0)); behaves differently on the simulator than the iPad device. On the simulator, the texture lookup succeeds (the value at that location is 0.5, 0.5) and my particle appears there. However, on the iPad itself the texture lookup is constantly returning 0.0, 0.0. I have tried both textures of the format GL_FLOAT and GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE. Has anyone else experienced this? The GLSL ES spec says that texture lookups can be done in both the vertex and fragment shaders, so I don't see what the problem is. I am using the latest GM Beta of iOS SDK 4.2
