I've been developing Flash Applications with Flex for about 2 years now and I decided to give a try to JavaFX because we are constantly getting user complains that they cant use the applications from their IPhones (and I love Java). That's one strike for Flash (no wide mobile support). To be honest I was quite impressed with JavaFX (in a very bad way). The documentation is incomplete. The script is simply awful; its this weird hybrid between JSON and R with a feeling of a Java-deja-vu. I spent the first 3 days painting polygons and making gradients with CODE... WTF!! I tried to convince my graphic department to try it and they simply don't seam to grasp how the production suite is supposed to work, they keep complaining that Flex skinning is way easy and looks better in the end (Which is absolutely true). The "CSS support" is simply a bad joke. It generally feels like a mediocre attempt to offer an option for RIA frontend. I can only think of a couple of good things about it: It can be run from an IPhone / IPad and almost all mobile devices. You have access to all the Java code you want which is great considering the limitations that ActionScript has (no overloading, no private constructors, etc). This is a great thing for us the programmers, but lets remember for a second that this is a frontend/presentation technology... that means that users will have to actually see the thing, so if it doesn't look good and have cool animations / effects they wont dig it. The Script is way less verbose that MXML files are (with the cost of being unintelligible). Talking about performance... Flash Player is this huge green blob that keeps growing and growing until no RAM is left compared to how JavaFX runs (JVM rocks! unfortunately this has nothing to do with the actual JavaFX API its just that the JVM... well it rocks!). It has this cool feature where you can drag the applet outside the Web Browser. In the end, Im happy I have an option to go mobile but this is light years way of the matureness that Flex/Flash has accomplished regarding RIA applications. The future of Flex/Flash as a wide distributed web technology is not clear (it may end up being used only for annoying banners and online games), no one wants to depend in a close technology as the Flash Player is, that's why the whole Web community is striving to get Flash out of the picture (HTML5 video support, No Flash Player for Apple devices, etc). So an attempt to have an open one is always welcomed, it's just that JavaFX feels like this incomplete rushed beta version of something that Sun felt obligated to come up with in a weekend during a bad hangover. I Hope this is useful to someone (and offensive to someone at Sun/Oracle =p ).
