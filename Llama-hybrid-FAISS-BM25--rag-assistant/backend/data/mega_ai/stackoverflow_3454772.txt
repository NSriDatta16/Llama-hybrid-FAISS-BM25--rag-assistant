A perceptron is a term from artificial intelligence/neural networks. It operates in much the same way as a single neuron is supposed to operate in the brain. It has a number of inputs and a single output. All this file is doing is specifying what the output should be for a given set of inputs. That's why the x/y and output are named differently. As to why it's morphing the output from 0 to -1 (that's all it's doing by the way: changing zeros in the third file column into negative one), I'm not sure. The outputs of perceptrons almost invariably feed into other perceptrons so passing a -1 to something that expects 0 or 1 is an ... interesting ... idea.
