Similar classes with different signatures

I have two classes: Public Class Subscribing Private _subscribingObjects As IList(Of String) Public Sub Add(ByVal obj As SubscribeObject) '...code...' End Sub Public Sub Remove(ByVal index As Integer) '...code...' End Sub End Class Public Class Providing Private _providingObjects As IList(Of String) Public Sub Add(ByVal obj As ProvideObject) '...code...' End Sub Public Sub Remove(ByVal index As Integer) '...code...' End Sub End Class Is there a more elegant way to add do this? One class would suffice, but since the Add methods have different arguments, then one really wouldn't work. Any help would be appreciated.
