Overriding Magento Admin Controller, for Beginners

In the Magento Admin section, I want to override the "Sales/Order/ShipmentController.php" controller file of the core Mage. I have tried rewriting the URL, using the "from" & "to" tags, but in vain. I don't know what is the actual & correct way of doing this, as I'm a newbie in Magento. Please anybody provide some good fundamental & correct answer, so that at least the concept gets clear. Also, if possible, please tell me, what is the actual purpose of the controller, for both the frontend & the back-end? Any help is greatly appreciated.
