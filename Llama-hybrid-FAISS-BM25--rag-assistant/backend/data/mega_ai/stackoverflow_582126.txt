Best way to upload multiple files from a browser

I'm working on a web application. There is one place where the user can upload files with the HTTP protocol. There is a choice between the classic HTML file upload control and a Java applet to upload the files. The classic HTML file upload isn't great because you can only select one file at a time, and it's quite hard to get any progress indication during the actual upload (I finally got it using a timer refreshing a progress indicator with data fetched from the server via an AJAX call). The advantage: it's always working. With the Java applet I can do more things: select multiple files at once (even a folder), compress the files, get a real progress bar, drag'n'drop files on the applet, etc... BUT there are a few drawbacks: it's a nightmare to get it to work properly on Mac Safari and Mac Firefox (Thanks Liveconnect) the UI isn't exactly the native UI and some people notice that the applet isn't as responsive as it should (could be my fault, but everything looks ok to me) there are bugs in the Java UrlConnection class with HTTPS, so I use the Apache common HTTP client to do the actual HTTP upload. It's quite big a package and slows down the download of the .jar file the Apache common HTTP client has sometimes trouble going through proxies the Java runtime is quite big I've been maintaining this Java applet for a while but now I'm fed up with all the drawbacks, and considering writing/buying a completely new component to upload theses files. Question If you had the following requirements: upload multiple files easily from a browser, through HTTP or HTTPS compress the files to reduce the upload time upload should work on any platform, with native UI must be able to upload huge files, up to 2gb at least you have carte blanche on the technology What technology/compontent would you use? Edit : Drag'n'Drop of files on the component would be a great plus. It looks like there are a lot of issues related to bugs with the Flash Player ( swfupload known issues ). Proper Mac support and upload through proxies with authentication are options I can not do without. This would probably rule out all Flash-based options :-( . I rule out all HTML/Javascript-only options because you can't select more than one file at a time with the classic HTML control. It's a pain to click n-times the "browse" button when you want to select multiple files in a folder.
