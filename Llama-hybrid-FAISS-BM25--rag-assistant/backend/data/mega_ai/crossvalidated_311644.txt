I think you're looking for a multilevel logistic regression. Multilevel = nested data Logistic = meaning dependent variable is binomial either 0 or 1. In your case blue or yellow. R's lme4 package can do this for you for free. Learning how to interpret/ set it up is another story. I found some good resources from some universities' stats department online. The output of this model will be able to tell you the overall effect of the nesting variables (lake etc).
