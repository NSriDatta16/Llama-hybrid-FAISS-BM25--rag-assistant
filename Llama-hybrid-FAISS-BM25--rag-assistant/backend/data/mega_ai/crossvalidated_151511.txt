I can explain it using salary distribution in groups. If you look at a person with medium level salary in one country, then that person can be in some European country where salary is ridiculously high and this person is rich by universal standard, or he can be in a poor country where everyone is poor and this person is also poor, or he can be in an average country and this person has average salary. So, what is the focus here? Essentially, we cannot say that the position of an object in a group does not represent the position of group members in a global sense. And likewise you cannot compare the top employee of a company with medium employee of another. Because that will be comparing apple and oranges unless you know their status in global picture. I hope I didn't just confuse you more. The main idea should be something like this: when explaining a variable varying in different groups, one cannot describe that variable properly just by the local ranking, a global ranking is a requirement for a study across whole dataset.
