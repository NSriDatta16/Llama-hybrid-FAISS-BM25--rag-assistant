Here's how I think it might work: - (void) drawRect:(NSRect)aRect { // other drawing commands // ... // other drawing commands NSDictionary *att = nil; NSMutableParagraphStyle *style = [[NSParagraphStyle defaultParagraphStyle] mutableCopy]; [style setLineBreakMode:NSLineBreakByWordWrapping]; [style setAlignment:NSCenterTextAlignment]; att = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys: style, NSParagraphStyleAttributeName, [NSColor whiteColor], NSForegroundColorAttributeName, nil]; [style release]; [self.title drawInRect:self.bounds withAttributes:att]; [att release]; } based on a bit of Objective-C knowledge on an iPhone and looking at http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?DrawingABoundedString You may or may not be comfortable with the web site example's use of a static variable. As you can probably gather I'm not. I get the impression the current graphics context is implicit in the call. You probably want to vary the text position/color depending on button state. EDIT Code edited to fix memory leak.
