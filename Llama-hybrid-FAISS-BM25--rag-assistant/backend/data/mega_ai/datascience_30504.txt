In this 2014 paper ( GitHub ), the authors compared multiple strategies of incorporating word embeddings in a CRF-based NER system, including dense embedding, binerized embedding, cluster embedding, and a novel prototype method. Using dense vectors directly as suggested by vlad is the most straightforward way but also the least effective in multiple evaluations. I implemented the prototype idea in my domain-specific NER project and it works pretty well for me.
