AIC and BIC in Latent class analysis

I am using the Latent Class Analysis feature available in Stata 15. The two statistical criterions gave me different indications: $AIC$ suggests me to use 6 classes, instead $BIC$ suggests to use 5 classes. Is this discordance unusual or not? Which is more relaible? Another thing that surprised me is that, according to the values of $AIC$ and $BIC$, the model with 2 classes is preferable to the 3-classes model..but the 4-classes model is preferable to the 2-classes and 3-classes model. I would expect that, if the 4-classes model is the best one, the 3-classes model should be preferable to the 2-classes model. Again, are these results unuasual or not? Thank you for your attention
