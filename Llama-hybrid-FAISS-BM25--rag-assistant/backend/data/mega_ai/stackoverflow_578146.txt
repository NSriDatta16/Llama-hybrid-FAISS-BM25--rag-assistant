Best examples of CRUD Web Form Design

I am looking to revamp our CRUD web forms and would appreciate any examples of good UI design. We have lots of database tables that have minimal editing needs by the user - Country Codes, Tax codes, Product prices, and so on - and these all currently use a simple format for CRUD, but it was designed by developers and looks very bland, and quite possibly could have far better usability, and certainly a better design. Our process is: Find screen - which also has an ADD NEW button. Enter values for any parameters relevant to search for and press FIND button. Matching records displayed in a grid with an EDIT link. The corresponding Edit form allows CLONE, DELETE and SAVE. Where appropriate an Edit form may display Child Records. For very complex records / relationships the Edit form is replaced by a Record Card, which displays everything including the kitchen sink! and appropriate records / sub records have EDIT links. Its functional, but uninspiring. On an 80:20 basis the code is all mechanically generated, so re-generating it for a new metaphor shouldn't be too hard. I like a lot of the UI in the Magento eCommerce Admin pages, but I would be interested in any other examples you can recommend
