Please refer to paper SVM Incremental Learning, Adaptation, and Optimization , which proposed an online SVM for binary classification. The code of above paper can be found here . In the code, two ways of online training are introduced: train the SVM incrementally on one example at a time by calling svmtrain() , and perform batch training, incrementing all the training examples into the solution simultaneously by calling svmtrain2() . Back to your question, the answer is obviously YES for stream learning one example at a time. And the code can also handle unlearn (discard) a example, i.e. exact and approximate leave-one-out (LOO) error estimation - the exact LOO error estimate can be efficiently computed by exactly unlearning one example at a time and testing the classifier on the example.
