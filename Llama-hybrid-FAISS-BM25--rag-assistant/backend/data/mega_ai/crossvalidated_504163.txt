Non-parametric tests basically have to violate reflexity or transivity (depending a bit on how you define 'non-parametric'). Suppose you have a test that you can always use to give a pre-order on all players (so for any players P, Q you have one of P is better than Q, Q is better than P, P and Q are indistinguishable -- it's sufficient to assume you could do this with enough data). A pre-order on players implies a linear order on equivalence classes of players, and under some basic sanity conditions, a linearly ordered set has the same ordering as some subset of the reals. Thus, we can label each equivalence class by a single real number and so assign a single real number to each player that gives the ordering (or we could, with enough data). [This is basically Debreu's Theorem from economics] So, if your test is transitive it can always be replaced by a test for some single-number summary statistic -- the mean or median or the average of the 17th and 69th percentiles or whatever. You might be willing to describe a test for the median as 'non-parametric'; if so, that will work. It's fairly well known that the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test is not transitive, but this argument shows there's a more general problem.
