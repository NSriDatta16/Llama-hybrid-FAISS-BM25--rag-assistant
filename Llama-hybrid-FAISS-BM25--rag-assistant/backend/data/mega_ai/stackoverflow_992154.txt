My company, Semantic Designs, offers a PHP test coverage tool that can do this just fine: http://www.semdesigns.com/Products/TestCoverage/PHPTestCoverage.jsp You set up the coverage collection, and then run your manual tests. You can group your manual tests into a single test coverage collection, or treat them separately, merging their results together later using the coverage display tool.
