I find the vast majority of "bugs" discovered by users are configuration problems with the systems on which the application is installed. Having developers that understand the common machine and network setup errors is very desirable. For example if an application sends email as part of its operation its useful to have developers knowledgable in DNS and SMTP configuration. Of course it depends on your size of business, large organisations can probably shield developers from this by using other specialists.
