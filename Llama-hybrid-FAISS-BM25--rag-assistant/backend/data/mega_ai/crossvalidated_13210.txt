Predictive models http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics include CART ( requires cross-sectional i.e. time independent data ) and TIME SERIES which exploits the information content available from correlated and auto-correlated data. It sounds to me "The problem I am trying to solve it predicting sales for an item for the next n weeks." that you need to be focusing on ARMAX Models incorporating wherever possible predictor series(X). You might pursue http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_moving_average_model .
