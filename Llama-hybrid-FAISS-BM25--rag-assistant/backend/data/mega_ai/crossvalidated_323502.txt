Neural network to play 2048

I was working on a little project and the basic idea is to have a neural network learn how to play 2048. Because the next move in the game is not dependent on the previous moves, I think a fully connected neural network would do fine here. I am just totally stuck at how to train the network.For things like the MNIST Dataset, I've used the MSE as the cost function. But how could I learn a network to play 2048 and what cost function do I have to use and on what data do I use it? Greetings, Finn
