@Demetri Pananos, I agree that if you're just contrasting B and C then you do not need to correct. Because it's just one test. But you could just do a direct comparison of proportions, e.g., prop.test( c(150,180), c(1100,1070) ) data: c(150, 180) out of c(1100, 1070) X-squared = 4.0264, df = 1, p-value = 0.04479 alternative hypothesis: two.sided 95 percent confidence interval: -0.0630087571 -0.0007125683 sample estimates: prop 1 prop 2 0.1363636 0.1682243 Which is a more powerful test. If you wanted to contrast all three combinations then you technically should correct for multiple testing I guess, whether you use logistic regression or the binomial test given here. I don't think think I follow your logic that you've already estimated the covariance matrix therefore no multiple testing is required, because you're not doing significance testing for the entries of the covariance matrix. Perhaps you can explain more clearly.
