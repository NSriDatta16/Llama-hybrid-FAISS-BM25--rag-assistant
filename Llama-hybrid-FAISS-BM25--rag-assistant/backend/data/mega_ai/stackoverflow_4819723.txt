Why not save the coordinates of the waypoint[] array and reintroduce them to the a DirectionsRequest object's waypoints member? Later on, when you reload the page, make a request to the DirectionsService as usual, but with the previously mentioned DirectionsRequest object. It should be draggable if you set draggable to true in the DirectionsRendererOptions of your renderer.
