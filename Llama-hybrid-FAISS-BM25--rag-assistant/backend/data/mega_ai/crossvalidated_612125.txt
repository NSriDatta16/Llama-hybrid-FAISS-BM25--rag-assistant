Do bayesian paired t-tests assume normality?

I'm running a bayesian paired t-test using JASP. In the software, it says that one of the assumptions is that "The difference scores are normally distributed in the population". I'm a little confused as to why this is true since the prior is a Cauchy distribution, not normal. Please let me know if you know why! Thanks!
