Instead of a list structure, you could use a set (more appropriate if you are concerned about Entity uniqueness), as Lars has suggested. Additionally, if performance is a problem, I'd look at using a TreeSet and implement a Comparator for comparing Entity instances based on their attributes. The tree structure will allow for fast (logarithmic complexity) insert, delete and retrieval operations.
