Quick comments: R is good at this, as a language for programming with data , there are plenty of interfaces There is an entire manual devoted to data import/export, and it has a section on relational databases , so start there. R has the widely-used DBI package which provides a unified interface for many backends, among them SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, ... Use that, maybe with RSQLite to get something going quickly. You can still switch backends afterwards. There is also RODBC but I find ODBC tedious to work with. R also has a specialised variant in the TSdbi package by Paul Gilbert which brings the DBI-alike abstraction to timeseries databases. It also supports multiple backends. The data.table package was written for this and is very fast on indexing and aggregation.
