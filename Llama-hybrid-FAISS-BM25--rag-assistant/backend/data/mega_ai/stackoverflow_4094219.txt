Since you are nearly out of memory, you have to count each byte of RAM. Using local variables (auto) allows to reuse the memory where you need it (local in the function). When you move the variables to global static address space, you give each variable a unique space. That's wast of address space. The Microchip compiler allows that different variables share the same address. I don't have the docs at hand, but this can be done by pragma. But what you need is a analysis of RAM requirements. When you see, that the stack cannot hold all variables but the auto variables would reduce the global memory use, you should consider to increase the stack size using startup code and the linker script.
