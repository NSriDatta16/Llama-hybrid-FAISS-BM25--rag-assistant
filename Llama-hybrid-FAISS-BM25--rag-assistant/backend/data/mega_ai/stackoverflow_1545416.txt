I'm not terribly familiar with Python and any extremely Pythonic methods, but you could look at the Interpreter pattern , which is defined in the Gang of Four book. It's designed for processing a "language", and mathematical expressions do follow a particular language with rules. In fact, the example on Wikipedia is actually a Java implementation of a RPN calculator.
