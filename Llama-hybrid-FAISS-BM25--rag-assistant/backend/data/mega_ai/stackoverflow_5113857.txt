If you have the liberty to use .Net 4.0 you might want to consider making your WCF service available via a ServiceRoute rather than via a .svc file. This will enable you to avoid having the TestService.svc file with a TestService.svc.cs code-behind. In your Global.asax.cs you will have the following: public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes, IUnityContainer container) { ... other MVC route mapping .... routes.Add(new ServiceRoute("TestService", new ServiceHostFactory(), typeof(LoaEvents))); } Your service should then be accessible via http://my-host/TestService . You might be able to change the "TestService" argument to "/content/services/TestService" or something that works better for your needs.
