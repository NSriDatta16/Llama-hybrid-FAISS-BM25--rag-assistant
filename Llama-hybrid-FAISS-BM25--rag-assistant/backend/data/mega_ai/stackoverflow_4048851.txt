Unfortunately, list/set retrieval commands such as LRANGE and SMEMBERS do not seem to distinguish between an empty list/set and a non-existent list/set. So if you absolutely need to distinguish between the two cases, I guess you'll need to do an EXISTS first. Try pipelining your commands for better performance. Most Redis client libraries support pipelining. Or you might reconsider your caching strategy so that you don't need to distinguish them.
