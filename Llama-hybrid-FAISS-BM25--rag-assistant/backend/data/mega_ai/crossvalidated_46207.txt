First of all, any variable with a coefficient of zero has been dropped from the model, so you can say it was unimportant. Second of all, you can't really make inferences about the importance of coefficients, unless you scaled them all prior to the regression, such that they all had the same mean and standard deviation (and even then you have to be careful!). If your variables are un-scaled, variables with larger averages will tend to have larger absolute coefficients. Another option would be to bootstrap sample your data, fit a model to each sample, and calculate confidence intervals around your coefficients. Finally, how are you choosing the "alpha" parameter for your model?
