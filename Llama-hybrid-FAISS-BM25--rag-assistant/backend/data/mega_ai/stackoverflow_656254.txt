Your controllers may be becoming too "Fat". I suggest creating an application tier which sit beneath your controllers. The application tier can encapsulate a lot of the orchestration going on inside your controller actions and is much more testable. It will also help you organize your code without the constraints of designated action methods. Using ServiceLocation will also help (and yes, I'm essentially reiterating Denis Troller's answer- which probably isn't good but I did vote his answer up).
