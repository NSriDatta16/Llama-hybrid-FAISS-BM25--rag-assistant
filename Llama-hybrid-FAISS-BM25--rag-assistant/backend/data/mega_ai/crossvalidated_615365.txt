no regressor is being added (hence there is no over-fitting) This is where you are going wrong. Model B can be overfit compared to model A even if the models are non-nested. The argument that "overfitting can only occur when predictors are added " is incorrect. As an illustration, imagine that you are randomly generating a time series $(Z_t)$ and fitting your third model... and that you are doing this many times, and keeping the one realization of $(Z_t)$ that gave you the highest $R^2$ in-sample. Since the $(Z_t)$ is random, its future realizations will not improve your forecasts, and the high $R^2$ is simply due to overfitting compared to any other model.
