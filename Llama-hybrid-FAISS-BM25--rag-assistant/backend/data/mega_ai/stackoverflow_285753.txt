You've got some toolkits available. For example, there are STL (Standard Template Library) and Boost/TR1 (extensions to STL) that are considered industry standards (well, STL is, at least). These provide lists, maps, sets, shared pointers, strings, streams, and all sorts of other handy tools. Best of all, they're widely supported across compilers. As for data conversions, you can either do casts or create explicit converter functions. Libraries - You can either create static libraries (get absorbed into the final executable) or DLLs (you're familiar with these, already). MSDN is an awesome resource for DLLs. Static libraries depend on your build environment. In general, this is my advice: - Get to know your IDE of choice very well - Purchase "C++ The Complete Reference" by Herbert Schildt, which I consider to be an excellent tome on all things C++ (includes STL) Considering your background, you should be well set once you do both of those.
