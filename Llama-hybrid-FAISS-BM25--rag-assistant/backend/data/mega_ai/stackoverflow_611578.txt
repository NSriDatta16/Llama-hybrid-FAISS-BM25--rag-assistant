I have been a UX/Usability/IA (whatever you want to call it) practicioner for many years. One of the better articles on the subject is right here ( Selling UX By Daniel Szuc on UXMatters ) It covers most of the obstacles and offers great insight into the age-old problem of selling something that people just do not know they actually need. The main point I think: your company, organization, group, etc. have to be ready to integrate the customer voice into the design process. It is sometimes a huge shift that some people cannot fathom. Others have been doing for years without knowing it. Keep in mind: It is almost impossible to sell usability or UX to companies that ignore or sometimes even denigrate users because they complain about their products. Marketing people are usually the most aware of the power of the customer voice. You might to get them on your side first. At first, don't even mention methods or processes. Mention potential, measurable, business results.
