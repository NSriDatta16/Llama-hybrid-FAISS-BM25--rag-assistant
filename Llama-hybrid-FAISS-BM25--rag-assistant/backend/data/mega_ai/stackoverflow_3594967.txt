For your services consider something with some oomph: Inlet , Digital Rapids , or Rhozet . Some of these players offer some form of live-stream encoding but you'll generally have limitations on hardware. They all have suitable APIs for interacting with the hardware and profiles. You can also consider using public transcoding services but keep the assets private. It's not quite as elegant as a roll-your-own but it does solve the problem. Transcode-/Encode-on-upload will probably serve your needs better if the volume of content or traffic increases. Real-time transcoding has many hurdles including race situations and bandwidth.
