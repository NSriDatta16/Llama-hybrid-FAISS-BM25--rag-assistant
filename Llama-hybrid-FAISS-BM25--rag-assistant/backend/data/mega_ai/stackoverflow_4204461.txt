At launch, it's basically IE7. If they don't upgrade it to IE9 specs pretty quickly, it'll kill the platform. Virtually all the sites written with mobile access in mind have been designed to use modern features in Webkit browsers, so throwing IE7 into the mix is just going to fail. One of the best sites for info and news about the mobile browser world is Quirksmode . The "Browsers" page (http://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/browsers.html) has a write-up of the old Windows Mobile browser (based on IE6) and a brief paragraph about the new one, which he says is IE7 at launch but he expects them move to IE9. The Quirksmode site also has a blog which is very good at keeping an ear to the ground with regard to developments in the mobile browser world. Worth having in your bookmarks.
