Flex DRAG_DROP Event - Is it possible to access the Image Being Dragged?

When you start a Flex drag action, you pass in a proxy image to be displayed when you drag across the screen. When the drop occurs, I want to be able to grab this proxy but I can't find a way to from the DragEvent object. Is it possible? What I want is to actually drop the dragged image when the mouse button is released... Flex automatically does a nice shrinking animation on the proxy but I don't want that. The Flex examples show what I don't want - the proxy is removed and a new image added but not in exactly the right place... More info: I tried adding my Proxy Image as a data item to the DragSource. I was able to access this when the drop occurred and saw there is a class mx.managers.dragClasses.DragProxy which seems to have all the info I need... but this class is not documented? So there's two questions really... how to get the proxy and find out the position of the mouse cursor within the proxy, and how to disable the Flex drop animation.
