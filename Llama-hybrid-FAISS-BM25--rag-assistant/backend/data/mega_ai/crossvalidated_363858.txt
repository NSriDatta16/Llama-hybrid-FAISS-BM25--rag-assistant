If $X,Y$ are random variables, then the ability to write $Y=f(X)$ implies maximum mutual information and then there is in fact only one hyperparameter. So the first method doesn't make sense given the statistical framework of the problem. The second method is the typical approach in Bayesian analysis in which the distribution of $\nu(X,Y)$ is approximated by sampling and the empirical CDF used to calculate credibility regions. Therefore the second method is correct. Whether the mode $(x_m,y_m)$ has a special significance in the distribution of $Z=\nu(X,Y)$ will depend on the nature of $g$, $\nu$ and of $X,Y$ as well but in general $z_m$ will not be the mode of the new distribution. For example, consider $X\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $Z=1/X$. Addressing the comment, I think I see what you meant: finding curves $(x(t),y(t))$ such that the regions they define contain some percent of the domain according to $p(z)$. This is theoretically possible but unnecessary as you would first need to know $p(z)$ and then can more easily define credibility regions in $z$-space anyway. Note that the first method you describe still doesn't make much sense (why linear integral average when you are interested in probably over region?, etc.).
