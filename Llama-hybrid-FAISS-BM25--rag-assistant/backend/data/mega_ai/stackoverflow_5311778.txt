There are some caveats when setting up HBase, especially a cluster. Be patient. First of all, the cluster is organized by Zookeeper instances. Check your zookeeper logs on both nodes that they connect to each other. It is critical that you set up DNS for your machines and configure the proper domain names for the proper external IPs (192.168.1.11x in your case) in /etc/hosts. If this works (only), then your problem maybe be a different one. Please closely follow the manual at http://hbase.eu.apache.org/book/notsoquick.html Unfortunately, there is no way around that.
