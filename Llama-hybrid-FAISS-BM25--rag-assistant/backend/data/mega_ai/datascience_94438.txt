How to know the state-of-the-art recommended approaches for data science?

Data science, AI, NLP, and visualization are changing so fast. I wonder if there is a way/blog that shares the latest updates and recommended approach using certain techniques or avoid using others. For example, many NLP books are old and they would provide examples using TF-IDF. However, nowadays there are much better approaches but they are also changing fast. I am hoping to find some source that would say use these new techniques and avoid using those old techniques. Searching the web can help, but will bring back a lot of noise.
