This is a pretty general problem in time series analysis. I'd probably start by looking at some descriptive statistics like the cross-correlation to see if the samples are roughly independent over time. You could also test whether the correlation between successive samples is significant. Or you could go the model-fitting route in which case one simple thing to do is to fit an auto-regressive model with some order k and then do model comparison versus the static model. If you assume that $\theta$ just follows a Gaussian random walk, then model you're describing is exactly a Kalman filter. So that might be another thing to look at.
