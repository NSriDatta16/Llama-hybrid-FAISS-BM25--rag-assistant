undefined $header variable in php class

I'm new to php so I'm not sure why this is throwing an error. The class I'm working with asks for the following (I assume I should enter something in the blank areas): var $headers = array( "User-Agent"=>"SkipJack 1.0", "Referer"=>"", "Host"=>"", "Accept"=>"image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*", ); The problem is, no matter what I enter there, or even if I leave it blank, I get an underfined $header variable error from this line: exec("$this->curlPath $request $headers ".$this->ROOT_HOST.$this->URLS[$this->mode],$results,$return); Can anyone help me figure out what's going on here? And what should I enter, if anything, between the quotes? I'm not sure if it's asking me for the url of the website or skipjack's... TIA, JK
