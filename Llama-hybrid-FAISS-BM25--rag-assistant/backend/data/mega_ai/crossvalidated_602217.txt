GPower: unequal number of measurements?

I'm in psych research, so typically I have my subjects do ~40 trials per condition. If I have an uneven number of trials per condition (say, 30 in one and 40 in another) and a 2 x 2 within-subjects ANOVA, how would this impact the output on a power analysis (e.g. G Power)? After cleaning my data the output is: each row is 1 participant and each column is their average across those trials for 1 condition (so 2 x 2 ANOVA = 4 conditions). Thanks in advance!
