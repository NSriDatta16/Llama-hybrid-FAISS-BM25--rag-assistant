There's a bunch going on here. First let's look at the data: library(ggplot2); theme_set(theme_bw()) (ggplot(myds) + aes(temp, development, colour = factor(storage)) + stat_sum(position = position_jitter(width = 0.5), alpha = 0.8) + scale_color_viridis_d() ) Just from looking at the picture, it's pretty obvious that a zero-inflated model is necessary (there's no way a non-zero-inflated Poisson or negative binomial can produce a bimodal distribution with many values at zero and many values far from zero). Fit first model: m_1 Simulate the model many times to look at the expected distribution of proportion zero values: set.seed(101) system.time( pp (10,000 samples is overkill here.) Again, obvious that there are way too many zero values in the response to be explained by the best-fitting NB model (p Let's dig in farther. When I fit a model with zero-inflation I get model convergence warnings (this will vary across platforms), and a huge value of sigma(m_2) : m_2 This means that a negative binomial model isn't appropriate, and we should revert to a Poisson response m_3 We can see that the estimated random effect is very small (effectively zero): VarCorr(m_3) Conditional model: Groups Name Std.Dev. storage (Intercept) 8.9098e-06 This means that the Poisson variation is enough to explain any deviations around a linear effect of storage , we don't need the random effect (although it doesn't really hurt to keep it in). m_4 However, checking residuals with DHARMa , we do still have a bit of a problem: library(DHARMa) plot(s4 It's often easiest to understand what's going on by plotting residuals vs individual factors: par(mfrow=c(1,2)) plotResiduals(s4, myds$storage, rank = FALSE) plotResiduals(s4 myds$temp, rank = FALSE) This shows fairly severe heteroscedasticity: the storage == 5 and temp == 25 conditions are much less variable than the other categories (storage == 10 is somewhat less variable). Unfortunately, it's hard to incorporate heteroscedasticity in a Poisson model (because the variance is completely determined once we know the mean). I tried a negative binomial model without the random effect and with heteroscedasticity by storage and temp (which didn't work very well), then tried a hurdle (zero-inflated) log-link Gamma with heteroscedasticity, which so far is the best of the bunch: m_5 dAIC df gamma_zi_het 0.0 7 pois_zi_noRE 197.3 4 pois_zi 199.3 5 nb2 1130.3 5 nb2_zi NA 6 nb2_zi_het NA 7 The DHARMa output still doesn't look great, but it's a lot better than when we started ...
