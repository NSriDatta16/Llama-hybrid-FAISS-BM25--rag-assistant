Can PCA help me in determining effect of multiple variables on other variable?

I have a dataset containing 2000 soil property measured values and other attributes like slope, TWI, aspect, rainfall etc for the same. I want to see how my soil property changes with the change in slope, TWI, aspect etc. and which parameter affects the most(soil property). Is PCA a useful technique for this, or shall I go for some other statistical method?
