I have no idea what you mean by a "repeated measures" t test in this situation. The terminology "repeated measures" has been used so carelessly in so many different contexts that it has become meaningless. If you have a baseline test and a post test for for each subject and if the differences between baseline and post test are normally distributed, then you need a paired t test. In that case, a paired t test amounts to a one-sample t test on the differences with the hull hypothesis being $0$ difference on average. If you are comparing normally distributed 'post-test' scores with an average from previous years (presumably for a population of subjects that is comparable with the current ones), then you need a one-sample t test with the established mean from pervious years as the hypothetical value. If you are permitted to give a clearer description of (a) whom you have tested and under what circumstances and (b) what you want to find out from your data, then maybe one of us can be of more help.
