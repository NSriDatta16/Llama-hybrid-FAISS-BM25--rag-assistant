After Working a lot with pdf like documents bank statements and the sorts the 3 major conference/workshops you want to see is ICDAR, DocEng and the Document Intelligence workshop at NeuralIPS. The chance of the paper you are looking for not being here is really low as these 3 are probably the biggest document research places. I have been going through the for a few months now and I cant find a mention of what you are looking for. A simple model that classifies pages based on text on the page as ending page might work but no guarantee. Such topics are an important part of Machine learning with documents research.
