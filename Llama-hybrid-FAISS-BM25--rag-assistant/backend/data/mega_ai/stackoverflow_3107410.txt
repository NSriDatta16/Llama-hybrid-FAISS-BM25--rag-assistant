Connecting To a Label Within A UIView Of A Tab

I am creating my first tab controller app. I have 2 tabs with 2 UIViews in them. I did this mostly from Interface Builder all I did in Xcode was add 2 files firstControllerView and SecController view. I can see the tab controller is working went I run the app (I simply changed the background color on the 2 UIViews in the tabs to see the effect). Now I want to add a label to the secondView and set its text programmatically from code. This is whats breaking for me! I am doing something wrong. In my SecondViewController.h it looks like this: @interface SecondViewController : UIViewController { IBOutlet UILabel *title; } @property (nonatomic,retain) UILabel *title; @end and the .m looks like this... #import "SecondViewController.h" @implementation SecondViewController @synthesize title; // Implement viewDidLoad to do additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib. - (void)viewDidLoad { [title setText:@"Hello Nick"]; [super viewDidLoad]; } - (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning { // Releases the view if it doesn't have a superview. [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]; // Release any cached data, images, etc that aren't in use. } - (void)viewDidUnload { [super viewDidUnload]; // Release any retained subviews of the main view. // e.g. self.myOutlet = nil; } - (void)dealloc { [title release]; [super dealloc]; } @end After this I went back to Interface Builder and dragged the outlet reference to the label. When I run the simulator it crashes. What am I missing here? It must be something simple.
