In MCMC, can I accept proposals from another MCMC process without trying to approximate the proposal distribution?

I'm trying to sample a Markov chain which takes proposal from another Markov chain. Normally one would have a proposal distribution one could sample from. However, say in this case the proposals come from a complicated Bayesian Network for which it is infeasible to infer the proposal distribution. Sampling the parameters of the Bayesian Network (using Gibb's say) could approximate the proposal distribution. Could we instead of approximating the proposal distribution use the samples from the Gibb's process as candidates in the outer Markov chain? Would the overall process still converge to the true distribution?
