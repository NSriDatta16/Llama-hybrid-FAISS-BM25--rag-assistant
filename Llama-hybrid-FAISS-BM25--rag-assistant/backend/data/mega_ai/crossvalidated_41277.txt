I take the information theoretic approach (which also requires a classifier--maybe Na√Øve Bayes, maybe SVM). To do this, I usually flip the question on its head: what features tended to be most informative for determining class. The wikipedia entry is a pretty decent reference on the specifics of mutual information. It's pretty straightforward to implement this method in a scripting language, such as Python!
