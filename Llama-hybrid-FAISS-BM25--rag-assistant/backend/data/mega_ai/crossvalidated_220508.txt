Q-Learning: is the reward cumulative or the delta between the previous and last state?

Say you are training a Q-Learning function for an agent to play a game (like Defender) in which you use the game's score as the reward: (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning ) Should the reward parameter be the cumulative score on the new state (i.e. literally the score of the game) or the delta between the old state score and the new state score?
