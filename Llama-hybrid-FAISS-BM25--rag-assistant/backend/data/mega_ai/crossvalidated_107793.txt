As always, the best visual(s) depends on what question(s) you want to answer. Possible questions that would lead to different visuals: Is a guard's pattern is predictable? Is a guard stationary too often? Are both guards are in the same zone too often? Are there zones that are never or rarely visited? How are the guards different? What's the average time spent in each zone? What's the average/maximum time between visits for each zone? Since you did ask for a visual over time, here's a heat map time view showing the time between visits to each zone over time. That is, for each time/zone combination the cell color indicates how long it's been since the zone was visited. If there is a special cut-off for acceptable time between visits, you can adjust the color scale to indicate it. I'm using whuber's simulated random walk data which has time as a continuous measure, which causes some artifacts as a heat map (some cells have no data (white stripes) and some have multiple data). The original question suggests discrete time data which will work better in a heat map.
