How to have classes of DataTemplates?

In my application, I would like to have DataTemplates such that I can say: These are the DataTemplates for use in a TreeView These are the DataTemplates to use when showing the summary of an object These are the DataTemplates to use when showing details The only way I've seen to be able to do this is to create a DataTemplateSelector and manually return the DataTemplate (possibly by a naming convention) for the class I need. Is there any more elegant way of handling this situation?
