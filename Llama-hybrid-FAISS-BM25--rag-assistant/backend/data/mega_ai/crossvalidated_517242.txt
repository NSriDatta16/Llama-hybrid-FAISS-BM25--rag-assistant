Yes, it can. Recall the definition of the expected value (in the continuous case) of a random variable having density $f(x)$ , $$ E(X)=\int xf(x)dx. $$ So, heuristically, what is random ( $X$ ) has been averaged over in the expected value. Or, while the particular realization of a random variable is uncertain ex ante, the value we expect it to take is not.
