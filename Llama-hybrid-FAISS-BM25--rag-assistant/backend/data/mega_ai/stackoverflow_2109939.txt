Pivoting a table in SQL Server 2005 to contain same column multiple times

I need to pivot the following table named tblGameRoleName - Game Role Name VolleyBall Coach Sujatha VolleyBall Player Rajendran VolleyBall Player Juno VolleyBall Player Indira VolleyBall Player Ganesh VolleyBall Player Vasanth Tennis Coach Rajeshkumar Tennis Player Vivek Tennis Player Rubala to the following table which has the 'Player' column multiple times - Game Coach Player1 Player2 Player3 Player4 Player5 VolleyBall Sujatha Rajendran Juno Indira Ganesh Vasanth Tennis Rajeshkumar Vivek Rubala NULL NULL NULL The problem is that the number of 'players' can increase for different 'games' and the result table should show all the players for all the games. For example - If I add the following 'cricket' team to this table - Cricket Coach Gary Cricket Player Viru Cricket Player Gauti Cricket Player Sachin Cricket Player Mahi Cricket Player Yuvi Cricket Player Suresh Cricket Player Virat Cricket Player Bhajji Cricket Player Zaheer Cricket Player Ishant Cricket Player Ashish Then the result table should show 11 player columns. Can this be achieved with the help of the PIVOT function? If not, please suggest the correct way to achieve the result table.
