In general, frequentist and Bayesian estimators do not coincide, unless you use a degenerate flat prior. The main reason is this: Frequentist estimators often strive to be unbiased. For example, frequentists often try to find the minimum variance unbiased estimator ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-variance_unbiased_estimator ). Meanwhile, all non-degenerate Bayes estimators are biased (in the frequentist sense of bias). See, for example, http://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoff/courses/581/LectureNotes/bayes.pdf , Theorem 5. To summarize: Most of the popular frequentist estimators strive to be unbiased, while all Bayes estimators are biased. Thus, Bayes and frequentist estimators rarely coincide.
