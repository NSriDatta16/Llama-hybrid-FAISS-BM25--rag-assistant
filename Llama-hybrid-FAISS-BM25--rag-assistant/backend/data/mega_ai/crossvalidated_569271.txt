There are a few different ways you could test for trend in this case. If you simply had one dichotomous variable and one ordinal variable, you could use a test designed for this situation, like the Cochran-Armitage test. If you are using logistic regression, as you mention, you could code your ordinal independent variable as dummy variables. For the test of trend you would use planned (post-hoc) contrasts. You might find contrasts that test for trend called "polynomial contrasts". If you have five levels of your IV, you could test for a linear trend, quadratic, and so on, up to quartic. The following document details some of this and has an example with code in SAS. ,www.ndsu.edu/faculty/horsley/Polycnst.pdf
