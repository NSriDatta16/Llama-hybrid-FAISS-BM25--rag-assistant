Rails -- Add a line break into a text area

I got a rails app where I can input a few paragraphs of text into my model. The problem is I dont know how to input any line breaks. I've tried to add " {ln}{/ln} ; {&nbsp} and {br}{/br}" but that only displays the html as text and no break. Is there anyway I can set it so the text area control will use any of the html I place within the model entry? Is there any thing I can type so rails will recognize, hey put a line here?
