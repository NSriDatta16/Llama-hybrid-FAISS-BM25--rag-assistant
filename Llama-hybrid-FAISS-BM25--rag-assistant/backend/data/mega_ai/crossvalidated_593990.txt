Logistic regression vs naive bayes and random forest

I have a dataset that is a high dimensional imbalanced dataset. The dataset is a categorical data set and I applied label encoder to transfer categorical values into numerical values. the dataset is a tabular dataset. I also use the mean imputation method to impute missing values. I use the oversampling technique on the training set and got the prediction recall around 0.800 for logistic regression. I used other classifiers like Naive bayes, random forest but did not get such a high prediction accuracy. I used weka software for data training. My question is why I got good accuracy for logistic regression and not for other classifiers? Thank you.
