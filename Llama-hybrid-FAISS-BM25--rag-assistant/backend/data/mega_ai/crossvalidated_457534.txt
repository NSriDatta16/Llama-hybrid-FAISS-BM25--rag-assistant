Proving (or disproving) a property for Markov Chains

I have to prove or disprove the following: Let $X_n$ be a Markov Chain on state space $S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ . Then $$P(X_2 = 6 | X_1 \in \{3,4\}, X_0 = 2) = P(X_2 = 6 | X_1 \in \{3,4\}).$$ This statement seems like it should be obviously true but I'm having some trouble actually proving it. My strategy has been to simply manipulate each side using basic properties of conditional probability, as well as the Markov property. I've written the LHS as follows: \begin{align*} & \quad \; P(X_2 = 6 | X_1 \in \{3,4\}, X_0 = 2 ) \\[5pt] &= \frac{P(X_2 = 6, X_1 \in \{3,4\}, X_0 = 2 )}{P(X_1 \in \{3,4\}, X_0 = 2)} \\[5pt] &= \frac{P(X_2 = 6, X_1 = 3, X_0 = 2) + P(X_2 = 6, X_1 = 4, X_0 = 2)}{P(X_1 = 3, X_0 = 2) + P(X_1 = 4, X_0 = 2)} \\[5pt] &= \frac{P(X_2 = 6 | X_1 = 3, X_0 = 2) P(X_1 = 3, X_0 = 2) + P(X_2 = 6 | X_1 = 4, X_0 = 2) P(X_1 = 4, X_0 = 2)}{P(X_1 = 3, X_0 = 2) + P(X_1 = 4, X_0 = 2)} \\[5pt] &= \frac{P(X_2 = 6 | X_1 = 3) P(X_1 = 3, X_0 = 2) + P(X_2 = 6 | X_1 = 4) P(X_1 = 4, X_0 = 2)}{P(X_1 = 3, X_0 = 2) + P(X_1 = 4, X_0 = 2)}. \end{align*} And for the RHS: \begin{align*} P(X_2 = 6 | X_1 \in \{3,4\}) &= \frac{P(X_2 = 6, X_1 \in \{3,4\})}{P(X_1 \in \{3,4\})} \\[5pt] &= \frac{P(X_2 = 6, X_1 = 3) + P(X_2 = 6, X_1 = 4)}{P(X_1 = 3) + P(X_1 = 4)}. \end{align*} But I still don't see how to show that the LHS and RHS are equal. Am I on the right track? Any help/hints would be appreciated. Edit: The "Markov Property" to which I am referring is: $P(X_{n+1} = i_{n+1} |X_n = i_n, X_{n-1} = i_{n-1}, \ldots, X_{1} = i_1) = P(X_{n+1} = i_{n+1} | X_n = i_n)$ It turns out (rather surprisingly) that $P(X_2 = 6 | X_1 \in \{3,4\}, X_0 = 2) \neq P(X_2 = 6| X_1 \in \{3,4\})$ . See my counter example below.
