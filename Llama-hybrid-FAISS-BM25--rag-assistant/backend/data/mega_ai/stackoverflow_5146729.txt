Is there a de facto standard to identify HTML elements for a JavaScript library to attach to?

I'm creating a JavaScript library. This library will attach itself to one or more div's in an HTML doc. I'd like to attach automatically to make it easy for users to integrate the library. Is there a de facto standard or best practice for how HTML elements should identify themselves to a library this way? Right now, I look for all elements with an ID that begins with a certain prefix, e.g. id="fooLibDiv1" or "fooLibMyDiv" and so on. This feels fragile. Would it be better to look for a non-standard attribute like 'attachFooLib="yes"' ? Or look for a specific CSS class? Etc. (FWIW, I don't want to require jQuery of my users. Also: not looking for code here, just what the right design approach should be.)
