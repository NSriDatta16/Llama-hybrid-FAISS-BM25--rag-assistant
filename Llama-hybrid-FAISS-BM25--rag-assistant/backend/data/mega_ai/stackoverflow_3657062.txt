Best way to implement authentication and authorization for a sharepoint 2010 website

I come across different authentication methods in Sharepoint 2010. The sharepoint website we are develpoing as of now is Intranet. Later we are planning to move it to Internet(Public) site. What will be the best way to implement authentication and authorization for our website. If windows authentication(Classic mode authentication) is default for a sharepoint website (2010) , I have a few questions ragarding windows authentication. 1) In case of windows authentication, where should we maintain users? 2) In case of windows authentication, how are the users created? 3) In case of windows authentication, how can I perform authorization. If we want to use FBA(Form based authentication) in sharepoint 2010, I have a few questions ragarding FBA in sharepoint 2010. 1) In case of FBA(using Claim based authentication) , if we want to use custom database(where we are storing user details and roles) rather than bulitin SQL membership provider, how can we achieve this? Can anyone provide some useful resources to implement authentication(Windows or FBA or dual) and authorization for a sharepoint 2010 website with sample code? Please reply ASAP.
