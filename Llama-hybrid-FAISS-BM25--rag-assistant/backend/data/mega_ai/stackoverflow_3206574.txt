SQL Server - Get time (daylight savings aware) from another time zone

I'm looking for a way in SQL Server without using the .NET framework to find out the time in a given time zone, paying attention to daylight savings. However, this method also needs to take account for states (e.g. Arizona) that do NOT follow DST. There is a workaround if the server is located somewhere that does follow DST - subtract your current time from GMT to get the offset - but I am looking for a more general-purpose solution. I know the .NET framework has ways to do this, but it would be great to avoid having this kind of dependency within this stored procedure. Thanks!
