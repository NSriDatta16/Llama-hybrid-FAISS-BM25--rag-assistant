xgboost: get error for each iteration

in XGBoost, is there a way to programmatically get the training and evaluation error per iteration of training? Will train until eval error hasn't decreased in 25 rounds. [0] train-rmspe:0.996873 eval-rmspe:0.996881 [1] train-rmspe:0.981762 eval-rmspe:0.981795 [2] train-rmspe:0.939323 eval-rmspe:0.939396 [3] train-rmspe:0.859087 eval-rmspe:0.859009 [4] train-rmspe:0.747877 eval-rmspe:0.747098 [5] train-rmspe:0.622528 eval-rmspe:0.619955 I want to get these numbers and graph them. They really help visualize parameter tuning.
