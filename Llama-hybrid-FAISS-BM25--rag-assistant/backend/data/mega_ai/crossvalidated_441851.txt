I would always recommend you use the pre-trained variables trained using a large corpus because those pretrained parameters are kind of like prior and regularization. Even if your task is very specific the low-level feature extraction or pattern learning can most probably be shared. To prevent some pitfalls you can fix some parameters, like the embedding layer(or and some lower layers). Because most of the embeddings will not be retrained and only the words in your specific task will be retrained those un-retrained embeddings may conflict with the retrained ones.
