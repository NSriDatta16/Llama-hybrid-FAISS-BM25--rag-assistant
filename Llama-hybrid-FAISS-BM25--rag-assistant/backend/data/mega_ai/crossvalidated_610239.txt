Causal identification when some ITEs are 0

Say I have some data from an RCT related to a skills training program. The data are such that: Marginally randomized binary treatment z . Those with z = 1 attended the program; Single binary outcome of interest post_program_employment . Assume the randomization went great and we have unconditional ignorability. After collecting the data, I realize that anyone for whom the binary covariate pre_program_employment = 1 will necessarily also have post_program_employment = 1 due to the way the data were collected. It is ambiguous whether these people actually got a new job after employment, or simply kept the job they had at baseline. My question is: can a logistic regression of the type shown below return an unbiased estimate of the effect of the treatment on the probability of getting a new job after graduation? I am confused about whether conditioning on pre_program_employment in this way can account for the fact a person with pre_program_employment = 1 must have an individual treatment effect of 0 in the data as collected, regardless of whether that person actually found a new job or not. m1
