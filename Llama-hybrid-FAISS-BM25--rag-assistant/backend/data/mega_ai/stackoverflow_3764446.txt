In a nutshell, the Access Runtime version allows you to distribute an Access Database application to machines that do not have Access or Office installed. It won't allow you to open the database in design view or to make any changes to the database apart from adding or editing data. They can contain the data tables or can be set up using linked tables so that you have a central database (in some cases a shared .mdb file on a network, or something like SQL server) Because many Office 2007 installations are not the professional version (Home and Student, Small Business etc) which does not include Access, making the runtime freely available is to encourage Access Developers to build databases which may be used in such cases or even in instances where office is not installed at all.
