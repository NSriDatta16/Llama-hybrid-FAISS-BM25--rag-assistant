If there is a problem with the existing toString() implementations, the developer should fix the problem. Saying the current implementations are all "pure cruft" and removing them is actively doing harm, unless the existing toString() methods are uncommonly poorly written. I would strongly discourage the developer from removing any functioning toString() method.
