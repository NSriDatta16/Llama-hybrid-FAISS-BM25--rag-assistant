Are leaf weights in XGBoost equivalent to output values?

I need to explain both XGBoost and GBM in the same text and I want to keep the notation consistent. Friedman (2002) uses $\gamma$ to denote output values for leaves in GBM. Chen and Guestrin (2016) use $w$ to denote what they refer to as "leaf weights". As far as I understand the text correctly, that's just a synonym for output values, meaning I should use the same symbol for $\gamma$ and $w$ . Am I correct, or did I misunderstand something?
