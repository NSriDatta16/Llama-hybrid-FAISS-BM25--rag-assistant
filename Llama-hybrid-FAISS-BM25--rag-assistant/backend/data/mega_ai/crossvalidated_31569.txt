Questions about how random effects are specified in lmer

I recently measured how the meaning of a new word is acquired over repeated exposures (practice: day 1 to day 10) by measuring ERPs (EEGs) when the word was viewed in different contexts. I also controlled properties of the context, for instance, its usefulness for the discovery of new word meaning (high vs. low). I am particularly interested in the effect of practice (days). Because individual ERP recordings are noisy, ERP component values are obtained by averaging over the trials of a particular condition. With the lmer function, I applied the following formula: lmer(ERPindex ~ practice*context + (1|participants), data=base) and lmer(ERPindex ~ practice*context + (1+practice|participants), data=base) I've also seen the equivalent of the following random effects in the literature: lmer(ERPindex ~ practice*context + (practice|participants) + (practice|participants:context), data=base) What is accomplished by using a random factor of the form participants:context ? Is there a good source that would allow someone with just cursory knowledge of matrix algebra understand precisely what random factors do in linear mixed models and how they should be selected?
