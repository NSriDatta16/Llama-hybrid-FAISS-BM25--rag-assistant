Is it reasonable to view each leaf node of a decision as a simple sub-model associated with a distinct class label?

section 14.4 in pattern recognition and machine learning (free) says There are various simple, but widely used, models that work by partitioning the input space into cuboid regions, whose edges are aligned with the axes, and then assigning a simple model (for example, a constant) to each region. according to which, Figure 14.5 in that book illustrates a decision tree consists of 5 simple sub-models corresponding to 5 distinct class labels? is my understanding right?
