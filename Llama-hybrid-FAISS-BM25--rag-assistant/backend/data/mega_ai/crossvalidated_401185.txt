It is much easier to describe the Brier score in terms of what it actually is: $$ BS = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2$$ It's quite intuitive, and writing the expression out consumes very little text. We rarely talk about how important it is to cut out unnecessary notation. If you must have notation, I wouldn't agree with what you've written out. An important point is that the model is not a random quantity, so it doesn't make sense to put it on the RHS of the conditioning operator |. Or if you're a fully parametric Bayesian, the set of posterior model parameters would be a random quantity and there's no reason for the training data to be on the RHS. And let's not even talk about non-parametric Bayesian! I would prefer $BS(Y, \hat{Y})$ to denote the Brier Score.
