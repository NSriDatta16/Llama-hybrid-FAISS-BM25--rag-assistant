Today, I read the first chapters of "The Design of Experiments" by RA Fisher, and one of the paragraph made me realize the fundamental flaw in my question. That is, even if the lady can really tell the difference between milk-first and tea-first cups , I can never prove she has that ability "by any finite amount of experimentation". For this reason, as an experimenter, I should start with the assumption that she doesn't have an ability(null hypothesis) and try to disprove that. And the original experimental design/testing procedure (fixed margins, Fisher exact test) is a sufficient,efficient, and justifiable procedure to do so. Here is the excerpt from "The Design of Experiments" by RA Fisher: It might be argued that if an experiment can disprove the hypothesis that the subject possesses no sensory discrimination between two different sorts of object, it must therefore be able to prove the opposite hypothesis, that she can make some such discrimination. But this last hypothesis, however reasonable or true it may be, is ineligible as a null hypothesis to be tested by experiment, because it is inexact. If it were asserted that the subject would never be wrong in her judgments we hold again have an exact hypothesis, and it is easy to see that this hypothesis could be disproved by a single failure, but could never be proved by any finite amount of experimentation .
