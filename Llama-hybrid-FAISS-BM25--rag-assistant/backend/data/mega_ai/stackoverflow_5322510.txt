One way to alleviate the animation problem is to hide your game screen when the game is paused (open a "game paused" window over the main game screen), so you save yourself the bother of stopping all the animations. If you prefer stopping the animations, the simplest solution I can think of is registering all animating objects in an array, so you can stop them all and play them all again in a simple loop. Not elegant, but better than refactoring your game for a pause function. You will definitely need to keep a "isGameRunning" boolean variable, which you'll check that is true in user input functions (keyboard events and mouse events), game logic functions (enter frame) and probably before playing sounds. This variable will save you the trouble of removing and re-adding events.
