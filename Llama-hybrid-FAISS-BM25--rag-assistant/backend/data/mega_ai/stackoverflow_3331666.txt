Question 1: I would choose A. It gives semantic meaning to the fact that it is a title. An extra class is unnecessary because it's very specific to the current layout and/or design of the page. Question 2: Go with A. A paragraph tag is inappropriate because the text contained in the footer is not actually a paragraph of text. Real paragraphs contain at least one sentence and have a single idea or topic; what the example uses is just a short snippet of information, and isn't presented to the user as a paragraph.
