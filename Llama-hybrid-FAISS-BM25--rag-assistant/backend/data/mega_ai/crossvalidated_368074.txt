The paper below talks about autoencoder indirectly and dates back to 1986.(which is a year earlier than the paper by Ballard in 1987) D.E. Rumelhart, G.E. Hinton, and R.J. Williams, "Learning internal representations by error propagation." , Parallel Distributed Processing. Vol 1: Foundations. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1986.
