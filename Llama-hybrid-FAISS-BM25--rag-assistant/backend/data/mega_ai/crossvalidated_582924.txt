Model suggestion alternative to categorical regression

I am developing a model framework in the context of online marketing: the dependent variable is purchase, the independent variables includes a mix of continuous (e.g., impressions, ad spend) and categorical variables (e.g., day of the week, channel). One of the categorical variable is creative which has about 20 different designs. The goal of the model is to measure which design is most effective in terms of driving the purchase. I know a standard procedure would be using a mixed variable regression which convert the creative variable into dummies. The regression fit was not satisfying given the p value and R square. My suspect is the data does not meet the regression requirement's of normal distribution and the relationship is non-linear. I have considered other modeling techniques such as SVM and RF. The challenge with those models are that in order to get an effect for each level in the creative variable, I would have to convert the creative variable into dummy variables. I am not sure if this is a plausible approach. If anyone can point me to some model framework that would be great. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Yao
