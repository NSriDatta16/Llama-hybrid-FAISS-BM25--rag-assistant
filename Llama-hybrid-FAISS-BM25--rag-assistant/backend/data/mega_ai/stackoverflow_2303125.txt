Extracting digits from integer and decimal parts of a double

I would like to know what would be the most elegant approach to extract digits from a double in ObjectiveC using Cocoa Touch (this needs to run on an iPhone): Let's suppose you have a double : 1.423 How would you get each "1", "4", "2", "3", that compose the double in several variables ? In the end I would like to get something like : NSLog(@"here are the digits : %d , %d %d %d ", one, two, three, four); one variable should be 1 two variable should should be 4 three variable should be 2 four variable should be 3 Any advice to achieve this in a nice way using ObjectiveC / cocoa Touch ? Thanks.
