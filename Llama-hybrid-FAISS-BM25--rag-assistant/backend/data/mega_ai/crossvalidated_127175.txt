While I agree that there's not a unique solution to the problem, I use the recommendation of this blog: http://blogs.nature.com/methagora/2013/07/data-visualization-points-of-view.html The posts on colour tackle the issues of colour-blindness and Gray-scale printing and gives an example of colour scale that solves this both issues. In the same articles is analysed also the continuous colour scales, which many uses for heat plots and so on. It is recommended not to use the rainbow, because of some sharp transitions (like the yellow zone, much smaller than the red). Instead, it is possible to make transitions between other pairs of colours. A good set of colours for this purpose is blue and orange (a classic!). You can make a test, by applying colour-blind and Gray filters and see if you can still notice the difference. For the thickness of lines, some of the issues of the blog mentioned before deal with this point. Lines, if you have many, should have the same thickness, that is "thin". Use thick lines only if you want to call attention to that object.
