EM essentially solves the maximum likelihood problem and therefore has the same properties w.r.t. sample sizes. EM for Gaussian mixture models is known to converge asymptotically to a local maximum and exhibits first order convergence (see this paper ). BTW, there are some results which quantify how good the EM solution is in terms of the parameters of the data distribution. See this paper which shows that the goodness depends on the separation of mixture components (measured by variances). A lot of papers have analyzed mixture models using this criteria. If you don't want to use EM for mixture models, you can take a fully Bayesian approach .
