Some points about it: uses a single xml file (the web.xml file required by all servlets) no dependency on Maven (or any other 3rd party tool/jar) full stack, open source (BSD) smallest number of classes of any full stack java framework SQL placed in plain text files encourages use of immutable objects minimal toolset required (JSP/JSTL, Java, SQL)
