First, in your table data source , implement the necessary methods for table row dragging. You'll put data representing the row onto the drag pasteboard in one or more data types. One type you'll use for this is NSFilenamesPboardType , which takes an array of pathnames. Then, make a subclass of NSImageView that can handle NSFilenamesPboardType in drops. (You'll need to implement methods from the NSDraggingDestination informal protocol .) Then make your image view an instance of this subclass, instead of NSImageView, and register that view for NSFilenamesPboardType .
