The biggest benefits (in addition to LocalStorage/SqlLite support) would be... Read/Write Access to the local file system (including support for native file system dialogs) Native Drag and Drop Support In addition, Air apps aren't just Flash based, but can also use HTML/JavaScript via WebKit Update: All the info you need on Air is on the Wikipedia page. (and it's external links) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime In short, if you need native filesystem and limited desktop interaction Air is the way to go, if you don't need these features, use Flex in the browser. If you need additional system integration but still cross platform, try Appcelerator/Titanium, Java/JavaFX, Python with WxWidgets, or C++/QT. It really depends on what you want to build.
