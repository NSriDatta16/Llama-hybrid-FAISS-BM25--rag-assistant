Using NOLOCK Hint in EF4?

We're evaluating EF4 and my DBA says we must use the NOLOCK hint in all our SELECT statements. So I'm looking into how to make this happen when using EF4. I've read the different ideas on how to make this happen in EF4, but all seem like a work around and not sanctioned by Microsoft or EF4. What is the "official Microsoft" response to someone who wants their SELECT statement(s) to include the NOLOCK hint when using LINQ-to-SQL / LINQ-to-Entities and EF4? By the way, the absolute best information I have found was right here and I encourage everyone interested in this topic to read this thread. Thanks.
