Not really what you asked for, but do not use Vector, use a slice instead, see here for a summary of some slice-idioms and their (deprecated/discouraged) Vector equivalents . You could do something like: for i, c := range clients { if c == client { clients = append(clients[:i], clients[i+1:]...) } } And obviously it is trivial to define your own delete method for your own types which does the same.
