Kalman filter has a frequentist or bayesian origin?

Following this not-very-formal-discussion here , a question raised in my head: is Kalman filter originally a frequentist or a bayesian tool? I know that many statistical tools can be interpreted from both a frequentist and bayesian standpoint and Kalman filter is one of them, but since I have mostly seen it applied in Bayesian context (maybe because a recursive approach is more immediate in bayesian, by update of the prior as new info comes along), I was wondering if it has been thought by a bayesian or if it has just been "imported" from classical statistics.
