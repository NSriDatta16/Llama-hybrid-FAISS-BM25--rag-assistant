Grouping data in ranges in R by summing them

I have data like this : year nb 1 1901 208 2 1902 200 3 1903 223 4 1904 215 5 1905 187 6 1906 214 And I want to specify levels, such that I can summarize the data this way : years nb 1 1901-1910 2082 2 1911-1920 6200 I had a hard time doing this either with group, aggregate, or encode until then. I found a very ugly way of doing that, like that : sum(DF$nb[DF$year> 1901 & DF$year But I would like to know if there is a more elegant way to do it. Sorry if my question is too basic, Xavier
