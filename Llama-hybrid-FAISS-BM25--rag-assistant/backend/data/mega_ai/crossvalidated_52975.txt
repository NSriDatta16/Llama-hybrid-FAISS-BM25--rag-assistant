To calculate the density of any conjugate prior see here . However, you don't need to evaluate the conjugate prior of the Dirichlet in order to perform Bayesian estimation of its parameters. Just average the sufficient statistics of all the samples, which are the vectors of log-probabilities of the components of your observed categorical distribution parameters. This average sufficient statistic are the expectation parameters of the maximum likelihood Dirichlet fitting the data $(\chi_i)_{i=1}^n$. To go from expectation parameters to source parameters, say $(\alpha_i)_{i=1}^n$, you need to solve using numerical methods: \begin{align} \chi_i = \psi(\alpha_i) - \psi\left(\sum_j\alpha_j\right) \qquad \forall i \end{align} where $\psi$ is the digamma function. To answer your first question, a mixture of Dirichlets is not Dirichlet because, for one thing, it can be multimodal.
