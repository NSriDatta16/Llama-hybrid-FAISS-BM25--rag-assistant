Netbeans Midlet Screen Flow Auto-Organize

I'm designing this JME application for a Nokia phone and when designing the MIDlet screen flow, my Netbeans is now bunching up all of the forms I designed on top of each other and not in some kind of easy to see diagram. Is there any button or setting I can use to make everything organized again?
