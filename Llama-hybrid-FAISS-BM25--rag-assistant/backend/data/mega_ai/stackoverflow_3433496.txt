Normally, all classloaders in a JVM are organized in a hierarchy such that every classloader (except for the primordial classloader that bootstraps the entire JVM) has a single parent. When asked to load a class, every compliant classloader is expected to delegate loading to its parent first and attempt to define the class only if the parent fails. Same thing is happening in your case. "RandomClass" is to be loaded, ContextClassLoader delegates to its parent an so on. And one of parent class loader was able to load "RandomClass" (RandomClass was in classpath of parent). Because of this reason your SOP doesn't show up. Reference following article little old but good: http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2003-06/01-qa-0606-load.html?page=1
