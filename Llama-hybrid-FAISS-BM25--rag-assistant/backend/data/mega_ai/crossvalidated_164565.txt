Neutral Networks with Categorical Data

I'm building a neural network in R with the neuralnet package, and the data contains categorical values. I have converted the columns into dummy variables, but I have a couple of questions: I need to normalize the dummy variables, correct? ( ($X_i$ - column mean)/column standard deviation ) Do I need to use the softmax activation function? Only on the output activation function? If so, how do I set this in neuralnet?
