I found a lot of responses dealing with arrays but not with a json object. My solution was simply to iterate through the object once while incrementing a counter and then when iterating through the object to perform your code you can increment a second counter. Then you simply compare the two counters together and get your solution. I know it's a little clunky but I haven't found a more elegant solution so far. This is my example code: var flag1 = flag2 = 0; $.each( object, function ( i, v ) { flag1++; }); $.each( object, function ( ky, val ) { /* Your code here */ flag2++; }); if(flag1 === flag2) { your function to call at the end of the iteration } Like I said, it's not the most elegant, but it works and it works well and I haven't found a better solution just yet.
