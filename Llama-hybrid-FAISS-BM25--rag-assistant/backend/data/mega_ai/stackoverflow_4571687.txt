Can I suppress UA validation of HTML5 "email" fields?

When using HTML5 "email" fields — — a lot of UAs (user agents/browsers) prevent you from submitting the form without using a "valid" (by regex) email address. They also apply the :invalid pseudoclass. However this my conflict with your own validation scheme, and the lack of direct feedback may confusing visitors. Also, :invalid is applied (in Chrome 8) to my field before anyone even attempts to submit it. I hate this. I t makes it look like the user has made a mistake, but they haven’t yet. So is it possible to use without triggering validation behavior?
