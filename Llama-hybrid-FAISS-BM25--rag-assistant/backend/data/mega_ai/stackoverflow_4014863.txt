If the English resources will always have fallback values, I'd recommend embedding that language into the main assembly itself. This way you can use: [assembly: NeutralResourcesLanguage("en-US", UltimateResourceFallbackLocation.MainAssembly)] For this to work, remove the change you did to the csproj. Also note that the language you set must not be neutral, in spite of the attribute name (i.e. use en-US instead of en ) This way, satellite assemblies will only be generated for languages other than English.
