How will using the Samsung Galaxy Tab Add-on affect/fetter my Android Market deployments?

I have run my android app against the new build target provided by the add-on mentioned here . This appears to be working correctly in the emulator, but now I am very unsure as to the implications of using this build target when delivering an app to the marketplace. It would appear that I have to use this build target to get the emulator to work. Is this true of the device in general? (i.e.) could I build against the standard android/google APIs and have it run correctly on the actual Galaxy Tab? If I deploy an app with this build target to the Android market, will this adversely affect other (smaller screen) devices that I already run on? (I.e. is the galaxy tab "special sauce" a superset of Android functionality? I see grumbles about the Google APIs for maps not working in it, etc.) Will i have to have two versions of my app in the market? One for "standard" devices and one for "large" screen devices? One for the Galaxy Tab specifically? When Android Tablet vNext (whatever that may be) comes out and has its own custom add-on and build target, will I have to clone my repository and publish/maintain a device specific version of that (presuming that any add-on special sauce for the galaxy tab will not be in vNext's add on and will not be "compatible") What I am driving at is that I can't find reliable documentation on how an add-on like this will affect the fragmentation of my app deployment and maintenance. I want to be able to support new Android devices like the Galaxy Tab, but I don't want to be building a bunch of one-off device-specific app implementations. Isn't the point to be able to have one app work on the gamut of devices? Thanks in advance for any insight you might have on the situation.
