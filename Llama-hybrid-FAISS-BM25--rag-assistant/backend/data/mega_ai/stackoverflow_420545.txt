As I understand it, a VARCHAR(MAX) data type is a SQL Server 2005 specific way of specifying a text field that can either be small (up to 8000 characters in SQL Server) or big (up to 2GB in SQL Server). The database handles the change in storage behind the scenes as the content grows from the small range to the large range. There is no equivalent in Oracle. You either have a smallish bit of text in a VARCHAR2 - which is up to 32767 bytes in pl/sql and up to 4000 bytes in SQL (i.e. in a table definition) - or you have a potentially very big bit of text in a CLOB (which is a specialised BLOB).
