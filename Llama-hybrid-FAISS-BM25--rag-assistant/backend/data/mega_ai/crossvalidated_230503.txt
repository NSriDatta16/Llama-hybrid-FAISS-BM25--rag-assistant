Classifiers work generally better with lower dimensionalities, but of higher quality. Maybe the additional features are too noisy and are detrimental to the learning? What about the training accuracy, does it go down as well as the testing accuracy? If not, then this is surely a case of overfitting. This might happen when the classifier learns from the noise. In order to reduce the noise, you might try dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA or autoencoders (I strongly suggest for autoencoders, as they learn nonlinear mappings). Then you can run your classification algorithm on the learned codes.
