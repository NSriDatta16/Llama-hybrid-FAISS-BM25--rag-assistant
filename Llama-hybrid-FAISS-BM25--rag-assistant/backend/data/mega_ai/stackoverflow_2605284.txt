It looks like you might have a name shadowing conflict where Column('id'...) hides Student.id. Changing Student.__init__.id to Student._init__.sid would be a quick test to confirm or refute this conjecture. There is mention of this connection in the third code block of the SQLAlchemy tutorial on mappings . For example, replacing your first code snippet with this fragement: class Student(object): def __init__(self, name, id): self.sid = id self.name = name # and so on Obviously other references to Student.id would have to change as well.
