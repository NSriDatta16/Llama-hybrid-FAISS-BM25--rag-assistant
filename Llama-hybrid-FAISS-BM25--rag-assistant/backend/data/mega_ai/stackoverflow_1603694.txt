SQL rounding and truncation, needs a thorough explanation

I'm a novice when it comes to SQL and PHP, and I'm trying to round an average price result and take off the extra zeroes that currently appear. Currently my result turns up as: $3.005000 My code currently reads as follows: $result = mysql_query("SELECT AVG(price) FROM milk WHERE price > 0 "); $row = mysql_fetch_row ($result); I have found several examples of SQL rounding and truncation but unfortunately the tutorials I've seen provide me with no useful information on where or how I am supposed to implement these changes. This leaves me making guesses on where to make changes -- none of which have worked out so far (obviously). If someone could provide me with an example of how to round and truncate my results, which includes where exactly I need to make these changes in my current configuration, that would be most helpful and I would be very thankful! I'm really sorry if my n00bishness makes it more difficult to explain the solution. Thanks!
