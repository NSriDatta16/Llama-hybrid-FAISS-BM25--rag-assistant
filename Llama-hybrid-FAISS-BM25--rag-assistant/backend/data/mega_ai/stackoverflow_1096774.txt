How to resolve "DomainClass XXX is not abstract, and is neither a root of the model nor embedded within it." warning

I'm getting the following warning in VisualStudio: "DomainClass ManagedField is not abstract, and is neither a root of the model nor embedded within it." The warning is correct my class isn't abstract (and shouldn't be) and it shouldn't be the root of the model. So it comes down to the last part "nor embedded within it" my class ManagedField inherits from another class which is in an embedding relationship. So why do I still get this warning and how do I get rid of it?
