Sadly, there is no easy solution for hyperparameter tuning. Basically, you have two options: Manual Adjustment: Read the documentation of the SVM and dive into the corresponding literature. Try to understand how the different kernel functions work and which functions are appropriate for your classification problem. Set the hyperparameters to the best of your knowledge and then observe what difference slight deviations make. Of course, there will still be some degree of trial and error in this approach. Grid Search: For all categoric parameters (e.g. kernel function), set up a list of all possible categories and for all metric parameters (e.g. epsilon), define a range of reasonable values. This is your hyperparameter space. Subsequently, run a multitude of SVMs with randomly selected parameters from the hyperparameter space. In the end, you choose the hyperparameter combination with the highest accuracy. ( Note: there are also other approaches with more sophisticated methods than random selection) Both methods are widely used, however, if you are not very familiar with SVM's, I highly recommend the manual adjustment. Of course, it is very tempting to simply set up a grid search, grab something to eat and later pick the best performing hyperparameter combination. But in the end, you will not learn anything and you will not know if these hyperparameters are a reasonable choice for your problem. Broadening your knowledge will be beneficial in the future, both because it reduces the effort for future manual adjustments and because in the future you will be able to narrow down the hyperparameter space for the grid search, which will significantly reduce computing time.
