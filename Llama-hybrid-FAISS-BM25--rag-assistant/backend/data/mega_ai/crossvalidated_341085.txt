Keras difference between GRU and GRUCell

In Keras documentation at this page, https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/ , I wonder what's the difference between GRU and GRUCell , which one I should use if I'd like to create a GRU recurrent network. Similarly, I have confusion between LSTM and LSTMCell , and RNN and SimpleRNN . Checking the source code : the class inheritance is like Layer => RNN Layer => GRUCell Layer => LSTMCell RNN => SimpleRNN RNN => GRU RNN => LSTM Also, GRU calls GRUCell LSTM calls LSTMCell
