You'll need to inspect the logs on your tester's device to find the cause of the crash. The console log may provide some help -- your tester can retrieve the console log by using the iPhone Configuration Utility that Apple provides. It can be downloaded from http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/enterprise/ for both OSX and Windows. If your tester downloads and runs this, it will give him a view pretty similar to the Organizer window in Xcode. Have him click his device on the left-hand side, and then the "Console" tab, and then save the log and send it to you. The other thing that might (more likely) help is the crash log. If your tester connects to iTunes and does a sync, the crash log is copied to his computer. It can be found in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/ for MacOS and either C:\Documents and Settings\ \Application Data\Apple computer\Logs\CrashReporter/ or C:\Users\ \AppData\Roaming\Apple computer\Logs\CrashReporter/MobileDevice/ for Windows. Hope that helps!
