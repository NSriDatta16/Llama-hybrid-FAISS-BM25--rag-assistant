TreeMap diagram for news feed visualisation

I would like to design a GUI for a multi-touch device to navigate through a feed of articles. The articles are tagged and organized in a few hierarchies (e.g. topic hierarchy, GEO hierarchy if the articles come from different locations, etc.) The purpose of the GUI is to navigate quickly through the tags and hierarchies and find interesting articles. I would like to build a tree map , so that each tile represents either a hierarchy or a tag. The tile displays its hierarchy/tag name and a "pile" of articles. The "pile" actually displays only the preview of the top article. User can zoom the entire tree map to see more elements of the hierarchy and enlarge the previews of the articles. User can also select a tile (or article) and zoom it separately. Does it make sense ?
