This is clearly an issue with jQuery's selector parsing. If and > are present in the selector, jQuery identifies the argument as a document fragment instead of a selector. The result is an element with a tagName of "FOO", and the same selectors would have the same issue: $('body ') $('body strong:not( ') The only difference in your case is that you've used a valid selector and jQuery is identifying it incorrectly. I made several attempts at a selector-based workaround, but Tatu Ulmanen's was the only one that worked. EDIT: it seems you can also use .find() : $(document.body).find('strong:contains(" ")')
