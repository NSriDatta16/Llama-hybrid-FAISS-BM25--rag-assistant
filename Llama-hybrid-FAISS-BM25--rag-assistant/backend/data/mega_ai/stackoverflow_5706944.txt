Excel 2007 VBA Macro reading a text file line by line how do I stop delimiting on a comma (,)

I have a simple Excel 2007 Macro that is reading a text file line by line and displaying the output. This macro is breaking on commas. I want it to simply read the entire line breaking on a carrage return. What am I doing wrong? Sub Directory() Dim strFileName As String Dim strDirectory As String Dim intFileKey As Integer Dim strLine As String strDirectory = "C:\Documents and Settings\e1009028\My Documents\embosstest" ChDir (strDirectory) strFileName = Dir("*.txt") Do While Len(strFileName) > 0 intFileKey = FreeFile Open strFileName For Input As intFileKey Do While Not EOF(intFileKey) Input #intFileKey, strLine MsgBox Mid(strLine, 1, 10) Loop strFileName = Dir Loop End Sub Here is a sample text file: 1 blahblahblabh 2 blah,blahblah
