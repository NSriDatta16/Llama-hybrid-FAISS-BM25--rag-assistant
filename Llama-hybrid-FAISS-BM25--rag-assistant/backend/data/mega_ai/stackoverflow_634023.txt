Though you have to be careful. It is not clearly said in your intro, if you are looking only at latine language. Some words can become meaningless or another meaning if you sanitize them with ascii characters only. imagine you have "forêt poésie" (forest poetry), your sanitization might give "fort-posie" (strong + something meaningless) Worse if you have to deal with chinese characters. "下北沢" your system might end up doing "---" which is doomed to fail after a while and not very helpful. So if you deal with only files I would encourage to either call them a generic chain that you control or to keep the characters as it is. For URIs, about the same.
