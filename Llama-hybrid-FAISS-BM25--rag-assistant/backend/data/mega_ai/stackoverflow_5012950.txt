With such a simple case I would use the XmlSerializer with XML serialization attributes. A good tutorial is provided here: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/XML/GameCatalog.aspx I would urge you to use properties instead of members as you'll be more flexible in implementing hooks or differentiate get/set access rights in the future. (However the latter has to remain public if you still want to use XML attributes or you'll have to switch to implementing IXmlSerializable .) The code then would look like this in your case: class CoverageInfo { [XmlElement("ClassName")] public string className; [XmlElement("BlockCovered")] public int blocksCovered; [XmlElement("BlocksNotCovered")] public int blocksNotCovered; .... } The job is then done by the XmlSerializer
