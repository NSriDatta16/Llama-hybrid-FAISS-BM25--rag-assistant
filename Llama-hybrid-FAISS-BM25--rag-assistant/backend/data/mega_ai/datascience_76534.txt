From my experience, it is better to build your own classifier using a BERT model and adding 2-3 layers to the model for classification purpose. As the builtin sentiment classifier use only a single layer. But for better generalization your model should be deeper with proper regularization. As you have around 13 class you should use deeper model with a good number of training examples for each class.
