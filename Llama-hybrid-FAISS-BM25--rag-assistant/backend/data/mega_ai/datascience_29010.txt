Clustering is not predictive. A new data point could cause DBSCAN clusters to merge, so it could drastically change the result. So if you want to classify using clusters, it usually means you are solving the wrong problem. If you really really need this (despite the warnings) just train any classifier on the cluster labels. For example, a SVM with RBF kernel could work very well for DBSCAN cluster (at least with Euclidean distance).
