Logistic Regression Odd Ratio

I am doing logistic regression in R on a binary dependent variable with only one independent variable. I found the odd ratio as 0.99 for an outcomes. This can be shown in following. Odds ratio is defined as, $ratio.odds(H) = \frac{P(X=H)}{1-P(X=H)}$. As given earlier $ratio.odds(H) = 0.99$ which implies that $P(X=H) = 0.497$ which is close to 50% probability. This implies that the probability for having a H cases or non H cases 50% under the given condition of independent variable. This does not seem realistic from the dataset as only ~20% are found as H cases. Please give clarifications and proper explanations of this kind of cases in logistic regression. What should I do further to solve this question?
