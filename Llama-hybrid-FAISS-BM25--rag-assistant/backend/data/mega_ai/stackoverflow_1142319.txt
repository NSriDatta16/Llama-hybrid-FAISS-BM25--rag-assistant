Be careful with preoptimizing databases. Most databases are reasonably fast and somewhat complicated. You want to run a test for efficiency first. Second putting everything in one table makes it more likely that the results you want are in the cache which will speed up performance immensely. Unfortunately it also makes it much more likely that you will have to search a gigantic table to find what you are looking for. This can be partly solved with an index, but indexes don't come free (they make writing more expensive, for one). My advice would be to make a test to see if the performance really matter and then test the different scenarios to see which is the fastest.
