What is affine transformation in regard to neural networks?

I have been reading a paper recently on Highway Neural Networks and found the following: $y=H(x,W_H)$ $H$ is usually an affine transform followed by a non-linear activation function, but in general it may take other forms. After Googling about affine transform I can't say I fully understand what it means. Can somebody please elaborate?
