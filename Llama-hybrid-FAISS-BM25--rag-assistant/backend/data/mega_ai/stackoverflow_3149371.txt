PHP-Based intranet application Call center

As in title, I am making a PHP-Based intranet application Call center, I've finished the DB design/UI. But now I need to automatically intercept calls and send the caller ID to the PHP webserver so the request is routed to the next free agent while his webpage refreshes with the caller's card(and previous questions maybe). Now, How can i route a call inside LAN?, My setup will be a switch where multiple telephone lines is connected this switch is connected with the server where there's a module(Maybe C++ that can intercept calls,route it to free agent,record the call and open the caller's card in the screen of the agent). So, Can any one give me a starting point for this call routing and call intercepting problem? Thanks
