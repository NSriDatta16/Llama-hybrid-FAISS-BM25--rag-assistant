Empirically estimating a project duration

What are common empirical formulas that can produce a rough estimate of project duration for waterfall methodology ( up to 20% fluctuation is acceptable). If it helps in narrowing down the answer, you can assume that following is more or less known : Number of devs is known and fixed, most devs are above average in terms of know-how, however some learning about domain-specific issues might be required. Known and fixed max. number of app users. Technology stack to be used is reasonably diverse (up to 4 different languages and up to 6 various platforms). Interfacing to up to three legacy systems is expected. Please feel free to provide estimate methods which cover a broader scope than the above points, they are just provided for basic guidance.
