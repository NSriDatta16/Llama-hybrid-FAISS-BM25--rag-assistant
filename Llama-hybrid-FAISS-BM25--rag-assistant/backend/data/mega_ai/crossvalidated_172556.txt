using the SVM for sound classification

I am new here, and I have found only this and this to be useful. However, I still have some queries to make after doing the following things: Extraction of the features from the Audio files. Scaled the features. (I also normalized just to compare which was better for my data set.) Used the Imputer for any missing data. Then use the SVM to classify the data. I find that the classification is average to say the least. The precision and recall are about 50%. I have also tried using the decision trees classifiers and also the k-neighbours technique, but none seems to improve over the SVM. Research papers suggest that using the SVM should yield values of precision close to 90%. I do not know why the values are so low! Maybe I am missing something. Can someone tell me if there is a general procedure to follow while performing Audio/Acoustic Classification ? Any suggestions in the right direction will be helpful. Thanks! Edit : Since the comment section takes only limited characters : here is some more information - I have to classify the given sounds into environmental classes - street music or siren etc. I think you can get the picture here. I have extracted the information : the feature matrices from the sound files. Extract meaning I get the MFCC, the Spectral Flatness Measure and several other features (in total 10) that are needed to classify a signal. I push them into a numpy array using python. Several of the features are multi-dimensional like the MFCC which has a min of 15 dimensions. Each of the sounds are stored in a folder with a specific name : When I read the sound file to extract the information/featureMatrix, I assign a target/classID to each of the sounds - stored as target in a numpy array. Then I perform some pre-processing to remove the empty values and normalize the data before I feed the feature matrix into the SVM. My intention is to use these features and classify the sounds into a specific class. The classifier must read a feature as input one. The other input for the classifier will be the identification number I assigned while reading it from the directory of sound files. The SVM was able to classify the sounds but not with high precision which was max of 49% ! Please tell me if this was enough. Thank you.
