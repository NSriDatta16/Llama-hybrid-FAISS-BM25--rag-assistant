Use both! Create your site and all its core features with MVC, and then use Silverlight for that "little extra". Over time, you'll be able to collect enough statistics about your users, and if you have a high percentage of them with Silverlight installed, then start adding more silverlight features. If your users aren't installing Silverlight, then stick with javascript. Also, don't be discouraged by the number of people who don't have Silverlight. Give them a reason to install, and give them a good experience installing it. People will do it if your site has something they want.
