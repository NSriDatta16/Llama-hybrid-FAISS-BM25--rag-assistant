The answer is no. It is said that there must be some particular linear combination of $I(1)$ variables, but there may not exist one. In that case we have so called spurious regression, you may find an example here . We say that two or more time series are cointegrated if they share a common stochastic drift, so it is possible for variables to be $I(1)$ and to have different stochastic drifts.
