Store a "pointer to function" in Fortran?

In Fortran, you can pass a function/subroutine A as an argument to another function/subroutine B, but can you store A for later retrieval and use? for example, this is allowed in C int foo(float, char, char) { /*whatever*/}; int (*pointerToFunction)(float, char, char); pointerToFunction = foo; In Fortran you can pass a subroutine as an argument subroutine foo ! whatever end subroutine foo subroutine bar(func) call func end subroutine bar program x call bar(foo) end program but how can you store the address of foo in a similar way to C ?
