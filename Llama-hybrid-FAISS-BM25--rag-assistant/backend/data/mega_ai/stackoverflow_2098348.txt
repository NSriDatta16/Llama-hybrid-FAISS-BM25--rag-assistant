I think its great you are questioning this. What part you are missing that could help is a Controller. Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller for an example. Basically a controller is the mediator between a model and a view. It "Controls" the application. The only thing that your view should know about is the data that is being passed to it and how to display it. The only thing your Model should know about is data. The Controller ties these two together and contains the business logic that acts on the data and prepares it to pass to the view. What you get from using this design is a loosley coupled and easy to test application. It really is elegant IMHO. Cheers, Mike
