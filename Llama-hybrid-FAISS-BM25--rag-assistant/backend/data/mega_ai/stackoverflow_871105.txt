Automate testing on Lotus Notes 8.5

The company I am working is looking for a way to automate functional tests on Lotus Notes 8.5. We have tried different tools including Testcomplete 6 and Rational Robot 7. But we have found issues recognizing objects and implement verifications. Has anyone try to automate this type of tests? Which tools(approach) you recommend for this?. I was wondering if it is possible to create code on Domino/LotusScript to automate these tests maybe using agents (have anyone implemented this approach successfully)? Thanks!
