Biasing regression by repeating variables

I'm building linear discrimination analyses and logistic regressions and I am trying to bias the regressions to favor specific variables. Each variable represents chemical information from a specific geneID. Since the pool of geneIDs is large I have to group the genes together based on biological activity pathways and direction of correlation. Chemical information is averaged together within one group. I was wondering if it was ok to duplicate chemical information for a geneID that is relevant to multiple biological pathways. In the same respect, if the direction of correlation is reversed is it ok to switch the sign of the chemical information to make the direction of correlation match the biological group. Ex: AR - reproductive organ development - spermatogenesis- positive correlation biological groups: reproductive organ development- positive correlation spermatogenesis- negative correlation Would AR chemical info have to go in the group it is most related to, or could it go in both? Biological I would want to bias the output like that to stress the importance of AR in this pathway, but is it mathematically sound?
