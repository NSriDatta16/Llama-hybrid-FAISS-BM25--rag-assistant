This is most likely the result of cache and history directives in the http headers. Pay particular attention to no-cache and no-store headers, and read about their effects (and non-effects) in differing browsers.

Many will point you at the latest HTTP RFCs, but unfortunately browser vendors - as usual - have their own unique take on RFCs.
