Exercise suggestions to help learn multi threading in C#

I want to get a good grasp of multi-threading in C#. I've read some articles like Joseph Albahari's tutorials that explain the concepts, but as you know, no matter how much you read, most of it becomes rubbish if you don't practice. I need something that has instructive and pragmatic code examples related to real life practices, not some examples that print some lines. Do you have any suggestions?
