How can you trust an AJAX recaptcha request?

The recaptcha API allows pure JavaScript captcha creating and verifying . But, how can a site trust that the user actually solved the captcha this way? How do they know they didn't just alter the javascript? If all calculations are done by the user, then as the backend how can we trust the result that they send us? For example, lets say you were using a backend function (like sending an activation email) that requires your new users to prove they are human. With the normal API your backend could call reCaptcha and confirm (since we can trust recaptcha). With an AJAX verification the user agents are basically saying "I solved the recaptcha - you can trust me !" to your backend. Am I missing something?
