But i want, that only the body is animate and the image looks like freeze at the top. That is not possible with multiple activities. How can i animate the refill of the listview Have two ListView widgets and animate one out and the other in, putting your new data into the one that is animating in. You could accomplish this with a ViewFlipper as the container, or apply the animations directly to the widgets. Or, switch to fragments (Android 3.0 and the Android Compatibility Library) and use FragmentTransactions to animate a pair of ListFragments .
