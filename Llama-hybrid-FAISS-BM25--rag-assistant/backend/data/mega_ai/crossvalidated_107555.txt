As empirically shown below, using a trend variable in ARIMAX negated the need for differencing and makes the series trend stationary. Here is the logic I used to verify. Simulated an AR process Added a deterministic trend Using ARIMAX modeled with trend as exogenous variable the above series without differencing. Checked the residuals for white noise and it is purely random Below is the R code and plots: set.seed(3215) ##Simulate an AR process x AR(1) Simulated Plot AR(1) with deterministic trend ARIMAX Residual PACF with trend as exogenous. Residuals are random, with no pattern left As can be seen above, modeling deterministic trend as an exogenous variable in the ARIMAX model negates the need for differencing. At least in the deterministic case it worked. I wonder how this would behave with stochastic trend which is very hard to predict or model. To answer your second question, YES all ARIMA including ARIMAX have to be made stationary. At least that's what text books say. In addition, as commented, see this article . Very clear explanation on Deterministic Trend vs. Stochastic trend and how to remove them to make it trend stationary and also very nice literature survey on this topic. They use it in the neural network context, but it is useful for general time series problem. Their final recommendation is when it is clearly identified as deterministic trend, the do linear detrending, else apply differencing to make the time series stationary. The jury is still out there, but most researchers cited in this article recommend differencing as opposed to linear detrending. Edit: Below is random walk with drift stochastic process, using exogenous variable and difference arima. Both appear to give same answer and in essence they are same. library(Hmisc) set.seed(3215) ## ADD Stochastic Trend to simulated Arima this is AR(1) with unit root with non zero mean y = rep(NA, 63) y[[1]]
