i think Object design is as much art as it is science. It takes time and practice to understand how to design clean & elegant classes. Perhaps if you can give an example of a simple class you've designed that you aren't happy with SO users can critique and give pointers. I'm not sure there are any general answers outside of what you've already read in the texts.
