Repeated loess smoothing for time series data

I have 3 time series and I would like to determine if there are any common patterns in the data. Zuur mentioned in one of his books that a reasonably simple approach to test this is based on repeated loess smoothing. Zuur states that to visualize the general patterns of the time series, we fit a loess smoother through each series and then plot them all on the same graph. This generally captures the long term variations, to capture the short term variations (which I am interested in) we have to apply loess smoothing again, but now on the residuals. Below, is an example data set where we have hourly values of ozone concentrations for 3 countries, I would like to perform what Zuur has explained, but to this example data set. Could anyone offer some suggestions? Please note that my knowledge of R and statistics in general is low, I apologize if this is a simplistic question. require(plyr) require(lattice) TopFolder = '2009-07-01 00:00:00' & as.Date(Dat$Date) So, here I have imported the data and taken a subset (for one month), and then plotted the values. I would now like to apply loess smoothing to represent the short term variation i.e. hourly.
