How to determine number of profile in a dataset derivated from repeated measures?

I'm currently working on datasets which have been derivated from repeated measures over time (blood concentrations). Actually the descriptors of these datasets are descripting the shape of the curves (concentrations over time) for each individual. The purpose is to distinguish if there are only one type of curve shape or two signing equivalence or not between two products. The hypothesis is : if there is only one type of shape the products are equivalent if there is more than one type of shape, the products are inequivalent Indeed, I had to generate synthetic data (which follow the tendency of the real datas). I have generated datasets in which there are equivalence between products and some where there are no equivalence. In first intention I tried to work on PCA and Kmeans clustering, searching for the optimal number of cluster to know if there products are equivalent. The fact is that this technic doesn't work at all. Now I plan to work with some classifiers like Random Forests, SVMs or ANN, trained on synthetic datas, in order to estimate the number of shape type of a real dataset. The problem is the labelling of the datas. Indeed, in this case I can't use labeled from individuals beacause the question is not to classify individuals but datasets in their integrity. I've heard about SOM and Growing Neural Gas but I don't really know how to use them in that way. I also tried to extract features from the dataset like means, sd but it doesn't seem relevant. Does someone has already worked on this type of problems ?
