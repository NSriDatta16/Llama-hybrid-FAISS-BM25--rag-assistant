Variance pooling when sample size is a predictor

Suppose that I am building a hierarchical model of performance and the data is hierarchically structured (e.g., multiple customers rating a single salesperson). I might want to use variance pooling in this situation to allow individuals who have not had many customers yet borrow information from those who have had more customers. Then again, those with fewer customers may have less experience, and may generate fewer leads because they are poor quality salespeople in general. Here, the sample size is correlated with one or more possible predictors. How to account for this in hierarchical models, especially Bayesian ones? Thanks.
