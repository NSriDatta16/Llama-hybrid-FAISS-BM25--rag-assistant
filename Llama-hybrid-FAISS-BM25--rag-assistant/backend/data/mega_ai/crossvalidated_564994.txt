Perhaps you have to make some strong assumptions along with a time series analysis. For example, you measure the blood pressures of the same individual once every morning and collect data for 30 days in a row. You may adopt an AR(1) model, with some stationary assumptions. In other words, with only one independent individual, you make assumptions to absorb correlation into some latent terms (a stationary random process, say), and finally, get back independence.
