This is just an extended comment as @whuber has already given the answer in a comment. The maximum likelihood estimator for $\lambda$ is the solution to $p=\lambda e^{-\lambda}/(1-e^{-\lambda})$ or equivalently $p=\lambda/(e^{\lambda}-1)$ where $p$ is the proportion of 1's. You essentially have a Poisson distribution truncated at 1 and censored at 2. By having just two possible data values one can just obtain a unique maximum likelihood estimator of $\lambda$ but that estimator is highly dependent on the underlying distribution actually being Poisson and with just two data values possible, there is no way to check on that assumption. So I would call this a potentially fragile estimator. The log likelihood function is given by $$(n-n_1)\log(1+\lambda/(1-e^{\lambda}))-n_1\lambda-n_1 \log(1-e^{-\lambda})$$ where there are $n$ samples and $n_1$ of those samples have a count of 1. Where $n_1/n=0.2$ (i.e., 20% of the counts are 1's) I get the mle of $\lambda$ as 2.660399. Some R code to generate such data and provide the maximum likelihood estimator and an estimate of the asymptotic standard error follows: # MLE estimation of lambda for a Poisson left-truncated at 1 and # right-censored at 2 # Generate some samples from this odd distribution lambda = 1][1:n] # Determine number of 1's n1 = sum(y==1) # MLE initial estimate for lambda lambda0
