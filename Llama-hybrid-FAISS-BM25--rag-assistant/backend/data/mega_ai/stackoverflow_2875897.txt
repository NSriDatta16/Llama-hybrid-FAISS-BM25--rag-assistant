I think the "solution" depends greatly upon what you're going to be doing with the metadata. For example, almost all of the metadata we store (Multiple datasets of scientific data) are all chopped up and stored in a database. This allows us to create datasets to preserve the common metadata between the files (as you say, categories and tags) while we have file specific structures (title, start/stop time, min/max values etc.) While we could keep these in hidden files, we do a lot of searching and open our interface to outside consumers via web services. If you're storing metadata that isn't going to be searched on, hidden files or a dedicated .xml file per "real" file isn't a bad route to take. It's readable by basically anything, can be converted to different formats easily, and won't be lost if you decide to change your storage mechanism. Metadata should help you, not hinder you. I've seen (and been a part of) systems where metadata storage has become more burdensome than storing the actual data, and became a liability. Just keep in mind what you are trying to do with it, and don't over extend yourself with "what ifs."
