Without knowing anything else about your site, I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest you're embedding a block level element inside an inline element. Maybe something like ... I say this because Googling for sporadic layout failures returns very little I've just fixed an issue that sounds similar. I was accidentally embedding a few floating divs inside an anchor tag. Most of the time, Firefox would treat the anchor as a block level element. But occasionally, it wouldn't, and the divs inside the anchor would be spewed all over the page.
