I have already answered a similar question here . The process would be: Transformation and Reduction: Involves processes like transformations, mean and median scaling, etc. Feature Selection: This can be done in a lot of ways like threshold selection, subset selection, etc. Designing predictive model: Design the predictive model on the training data depending on the features you have at hand. Cross Validation and parameter tuning: Final Prediction, Validation Always try and do feature engineering before model selection. Then, select the model according to the best features (or the features which tend to influence the problem/dependant variable better.)
