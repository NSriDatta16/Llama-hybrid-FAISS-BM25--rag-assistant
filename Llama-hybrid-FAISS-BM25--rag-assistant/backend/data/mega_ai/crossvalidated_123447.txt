It sounds like you want a system that, given some training data about a person's likes and dislikes, is able to predict whether the person will like something. That problem is known as classification . The basic idea is to collect a data table where each row is an article of clothing, the columns describe the article via numerical or discrete attributes (such as 'color'), and one column gives the label ('like' or 'dislike'). Then you can apply an algorithm such as logistic regression to learn a classifier from this data.
