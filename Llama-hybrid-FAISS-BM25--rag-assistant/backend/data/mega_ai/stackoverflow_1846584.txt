asp.net mvc force style of get url on form

I have a simple form for searching for a user Enter a user's id number to search: I want this link to go to useradmin/search/{id} but the link is rendered as useradmin/search?id={id} Both urls are valid and map to my action as I would expect, I just think the former is neater and want that style to be used. Update: Based on Michael Gattuso's answer I have this as a working solution. Not elegant, but it works. Enter a user's id number to search: public ActionResult Search(string id) { var result = _Service.SearchForUsers(id); return View(result); } [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public ActionResult SearchPost(string id) { return RedirectToAction("Search", new { id = id }); }
