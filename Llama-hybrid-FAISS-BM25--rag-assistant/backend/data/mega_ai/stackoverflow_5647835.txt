I have three big practical issues I have with websharper and other compilers that claim to avoid the pain of Javascript. If you won’t know Javascript well you can’t understand most of the examples on the web of using the DOM/ExtJs etc., so you have to learn Javascript whatever. (For the some reason all F# programmers must be able to at least read C# or VB.NET otherwise they cannot access most information about the .net framework) On any web project you need a few web experts that know the DOM and CSS inside out; would such a person be willing to work with F# rather than Javascript? Being tied into the provider of the compiler, will they be about in 5 years’ time; I want full open source or the tools to be supported by Microsoft. The 4 big positives I see with these frameworks are: Shareing code between the server/client Having fewer languages a programmer needs to know (javascript is a real pain as it looks like Jave/C# but is not anything like them) The average quality of a F# programmer is a lot better than a jscript programmer.
