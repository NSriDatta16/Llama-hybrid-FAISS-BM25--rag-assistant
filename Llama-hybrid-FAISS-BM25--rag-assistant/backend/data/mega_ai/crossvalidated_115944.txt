There is a type of Bayesian linear regression that handles the case of many features. It is called latent factor regression and you can find a good description in the paper Bayesian Factor Regression Models in the "Large p, Small n" Paradigm . If the number of latent factors is large, then it is equivalent to linear regression. Otherwise, it encourages the regression to follow the principal components of the features.
