The Book of Why, Table 8.1, Counterfactuals example

I'm reading "The Book of Why" by Judea Pearl and I'm getting an answer for a problem that doesn't match what the book says. This is my first foray into Structural Causal Models and their use, so I want to be absolutely certain that there isn't a gap in my understanding when I try to solve the problem; hence this question. Here's the problem that I'm stuck on: The Data Bert: $EX = 9$, $ED = 1$, $S_1 = 92500$. Caroline: $EX= 9$, $ED = 2$, $S_2 = 97000$ The equations According to more data in the table, the following equations hold: $$S_{ED} = 65000 + 2500 EX + 5000 ED + U_S\\ EX = 10 - 4 ED + U_{EX}$$ where $U_S$ and $U_{EX}$ are background variables that are different for Bert and Caroline. The Question The question requires that we calculate the value of $S_1(Bert) - S_1(Caroline)$ (basically subtract from 92500, the value of $S_{ED}$ for Caroline if her $ED = 1$). The problem is posed between pages 273 and 282. My confusion The book says that the final value should be 5000. My numbers are either 500, if I assume that the value of EX remains 9 like before (which would be wrong because the value of EX should be updated according to the second equation?), or -9500, if I simply plug in the new value of ED and solve the equations. Am I missing something here? It's very possible as this whole exercise is couched in the realm of operating with causal model diagrams, and I might have missed an update step to the equations...
