What is the best way to determine if a web-page is for mobile?

Should I scan for tags in the html code? Or what? What determines whether a page is optimized for mobile? One option is to scan for tags. If so, what other tags are there? Another option is to see if the HTML returned from a mobile user-agent is smaller than the HTML returned from a desktop browser. user agent... Any thoughts?
