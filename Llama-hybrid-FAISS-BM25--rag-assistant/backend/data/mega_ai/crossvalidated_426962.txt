You could indeed fit a mixed model for both groups simultaneously and allow for different fixed effects and random intercepts per group. This could also give you the means to statistically compare if there is a difference in the ICCs in the two groups. The R code below shows an example on how this could be done using the lme4 package and simulated data. # simulate some data # two groups A and B, with different variances for the random effects, # and different average outcomes set.seed(2019) n Loading required package: Matrix # we fit the two models separately for two groups fm_A Groups Name Std.Dev. #> id (Intercept) 2.2201 #> Residual 1.0240 VarCorr(fm_B) #> Groups Name Std.Dev. #> id (Intercept) 4.03766 #> Residual 0.97875 VarCorr(fm_both) #> Groups Name Std.Dev. #> id dummy(group, "A") 2.2222 #> id.1 dummy(group, "B") 4.0365 #> Residual 1.0016 # You could also formally test if the ICCs are the same in the two groups gm refitting model(s) with ML (instead of REML) #> Data: DF #> Models: #> gm: y ~ group + (1 | id) #> fm_both: y ~ group + ((0 + dummy(group, "A") | id) + (0 + dummy(group, #> fm_both: "B") | id)) #> Df AIC BIC logLik deviance Chisq Chi Df Pr(>Chisq) #> gm 4 733.66 746.85 -362.83 725.66 #> fm_both 5 729.21 745.71 -359.61 719.21 6.4465 1 0.01112 * #> --- #> Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
