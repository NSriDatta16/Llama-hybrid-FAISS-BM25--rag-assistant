Find most likely fit for subgroup size and average density from product and supergroup size

I need to find the most likely sets of group subset percent and frequency for a given result having the super group size . Let me illustrate with an example. Assume I have the following: Entity | Product | Price | Total Sales | Entity Customers ----------------------------------------------------------- BusA | Yo-Yos | $6 | $100,000 | 106,000 BusB | Yo-Yos | $4 | $173,000 | 72,000 BusC | Yo-Yos | $7 | $110,000 | 96,000 BusD | Yo-Yos | $9 | $ 80,000 | 55,000 Having only this, my charge is to back into the most likely sets of: Percent cohort buying yo-yo's out of total entity customers. Average yo-yo's purchased at each entity's price. When I model a function, I end up with: f(percentBuyer, purchaseDensity) = { totalSales / ( totalCust * percentBuyer * purchaseDensity ) } purchaseDensity representing an average per buyer. I'm seeking for the best fits against a test. A sample set: [ 5%, 1],[ 5%, 2],[ 5%, 3], [10%, 1],[10%, 2],[10%, 3], [15%, 1],[15%, 2],[15%, 3] ... et cetera ... And so on. My sense is that I can graph these against the Price and Total Sales in the different rows and which values per set fit best the Price at that entity, I'll have my best fit. I know I could be getting something fundamentally wrong up to this point; I hope not. The issue I run into is I'm unsure how to graph this where the best fits can be determined and a range for best fit be developed that present a reasonable prediction of characteristic fluctuation. Where do I go from here? Go back? Am I overlooking a direct way to handle this type of concern? Note, this is not homework; it is related to a project I am assigned at work, and involves a risk management cost-benefit depiction. If there are more appropriate tags for this, please feel free to edit them in.
