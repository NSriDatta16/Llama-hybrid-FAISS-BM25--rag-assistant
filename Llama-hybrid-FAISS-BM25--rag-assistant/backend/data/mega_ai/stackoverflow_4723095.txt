Some practices I follow for keeping my Javascript Organized: Minify all libraries into a single file Load page specific JS in page footers unless required otherwise Merge all global JS into a single file. {minify only when at production stage} and looking at your JS, it seem to be pretty organized. Since you are developing plugin, it would be a good option to have ability to cherry pick modules while downloading your plugin. Something similar to Jquery UI
