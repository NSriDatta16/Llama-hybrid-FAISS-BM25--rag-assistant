How to forecast a Macro trend by multiple Index time-series Using LSTM Model?

I am new in machine learning and I found that lots of article only train the LSTM model by only one stock and do the forecast . As a result, I am trying to group multiple Index and then predict an overall market trend to see what would happen. Therefore, I would like to know whether the below approach is correct. Sample data - close price of multiple Index ^DJI ^GSPC ^IXIC ^RUT Date 2017-01-03 19881.759766 2257.830078 5429.080078 1365.489990 2017-01-04 19942.160156 2270.750000 5477.000000 1387.949951 2017-01-05 19899.289062 2269.000000 5487.939941 1371.939941 2017-01-06 19963.800781 2276.979980 5521.060059 1367.280029 2017-01-09 19887.380859 2268.899902 5531.819824 1357.489990 For the feature engineering part, I have below 2 approaches: Take the average of the above 4 Index Close price. And add one column to hold the shifted data Keep the 4 Index Close price and add one column at the end to hold the shifted data of "DJI" (one of the Index) for supervision training. So, I would like to know which one is a better approach or other ways for featuring data are welcome since I am still learning it. Long way to go. Thanks!
