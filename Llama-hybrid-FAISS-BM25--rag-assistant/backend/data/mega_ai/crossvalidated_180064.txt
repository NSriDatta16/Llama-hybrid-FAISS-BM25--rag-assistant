There are plenty possibilities to construct one-class-classifiers. I wrote a number of simple algorithms in the context of authorship verification. Here, only positive samples of one author X are given, so that the task is to judge if a given document was written by X or not. However, it can be adapted to other fields besides authorship verification by just adjusting the features. Here are two of my papers: Oren Halvani, Lukas Graner, Inna Vogel.
