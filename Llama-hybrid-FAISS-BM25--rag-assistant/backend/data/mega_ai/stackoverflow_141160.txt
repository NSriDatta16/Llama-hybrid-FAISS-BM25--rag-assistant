What OS (specific version) are you using? The newer versions of Windows support printing graphics files without the need for MS Paint or any other graphics program. It's called the "Photo Printing Wizard" in XP, and you can even just right-click on a graphics file and choose "Print" right from Explorer - no other program required (and no command line switches needed either). If all you are trying to do is send some graphics files to the printer, and you're able to drag & drop them, then this is what I'd recommend using.
