I use very simple idea: I rename unit name from .pas to .pas_ and then build project. Compiler will report error in unit that uses the unit you are looking for. Simple and work very well but I will not name it "elegant" :( I think Delphi instead of: [Pascal Fatal Error] unit2.pas(31): F2063 Could not compile used unit 'unit2' should report: [Pascal Fatal Error] unit2.pas(31): F2063 Could not compile unit 'unit2' used by 'unit1' (maybe some of Delphi maintainers read it: it will make our lives easier)
