This is a very common scenario when you split your data into groups that differ systematically. Here's an example: set.seed(4218) N = 100 group Here, the overall slope is attenuated because we've failed to account for group . If we include group in our model, however, we can recover a weighted average of the within-group slopes (as you intuited): modelAll2 |t|) (Intercept) 1.3079814 0.45867941 2.851624 5.315169e-03 x 0.3730811 0.08017352 4.653420 1.034285e-05 group -1.5352505 0.42212272 -3.636977 4.440556e-04
