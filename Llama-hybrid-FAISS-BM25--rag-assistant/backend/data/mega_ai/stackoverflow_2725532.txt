Don't call CoCreateInstance a CLSID_FilterGraph .. this is pointless. CoCreateInstance CLSID_CreateCaptureGraph2 and post up the code you use in CoCreateInstance and any HRESULT value you get returned. The following code "should" work: ICaptureGraphBuilder2* pCapture = NULL; HRESULT hr = CoCreateInstance( CLSID_CaptureGraphBuilder, NULL, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, IID_ICaptureGraphBuilder2, (void**) &pCapture) ; If it doesn't look up the HRESULT returned in hr and tell us what it is (or look it up yourself). Other than invalid parameters the only thing that ought to be able to fail you here is that the class isn't registered. If so then this is something fairly majorly amiss ... this ought not to be possible.
