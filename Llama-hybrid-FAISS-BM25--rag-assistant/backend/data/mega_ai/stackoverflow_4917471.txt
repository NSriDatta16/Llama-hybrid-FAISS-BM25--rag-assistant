If you are trying to achieve 100% code coverage but have one or more lines that you cannot test, you can surround them with special annotations. They will be ignored in the code coverage report. if (($result = file_get_contents($url)) === false) { // @codeCoverageIgnoreStart $this->handleError($url); // @codeCoverageIgnoreEnd } Edit: I have found that Xdebug often considers the closing brace to be executable. :( If that happens, move the end tag below it.
