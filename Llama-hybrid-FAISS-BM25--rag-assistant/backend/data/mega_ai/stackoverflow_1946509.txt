There is a way to export products right through Magento, but there is no direct way to export categories. To export products, login to the admin, and go to System >> Import/Export >> Profiles and then select the "Export All Products". After you run that, the file will be in /var/export/ To import that into 1.4, go the same route but instead of selecting the "Export All Products" profile, select the "Import All Products". Upload the file and run it. Categories you'll have to get in the database and figure out everything you need to dump and move over. It is definitely doable, I just don't know off the top of my head. There's definitely more than one table you'll have to deal with. They should start with "catalog_category_" in the database.
