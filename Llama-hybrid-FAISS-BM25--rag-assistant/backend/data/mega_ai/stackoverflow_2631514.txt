Well the first thing you should know is that the amount of memory you can allocate does not depend on how much RAM you have. The OS manages virtual memory and any allocation is done in virtual memory. The chunks are then paged to RAM/Disk by the OS. You have no control over this. You may think you're allocating 5 MB in RAM but it's up to the OS to keep it in RAM or get it from disk to your program when you need it. In windows 32 bit you have 2 GB in user space to work with (the rest is used by kernel space). In 64 OS bit that amount is much larger. However just because you have 2 GB of user space that you can allocate (in 32 bit OS or more in 64 bit) doesn't mean you can always allocate a chunk that big because memory allocation requires contiguous blocks of memory. So memory fragmentation may become a problem. The third thing is JVM limits the amount of memory you can allocate. So you need to increase these by -Xms -Xmx parameters that limit the heap size. Other than these comments, I don't really have a solution for you.
