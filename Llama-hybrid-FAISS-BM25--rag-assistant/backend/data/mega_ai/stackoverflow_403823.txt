sounds like a pain, but i guess create a function that analyzes the URL for every request. First determine if it's "dirty" or "clean" URL. For that, I would first look for the presence of the question mark character and proceed from there (additional checking will obviously be requried). For the "dirty" URL, use PHP's normal Get method retrieval capabilities ($variable_name). For the "clean" one, I would use Regular Expressions. That would be the most flexible (and efficient) way to parse the URL and extract potential variables.
