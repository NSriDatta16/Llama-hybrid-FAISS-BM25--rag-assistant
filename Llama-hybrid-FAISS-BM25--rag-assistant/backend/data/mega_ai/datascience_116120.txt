Proper way to reshape a image for training using CNN

I am new to Keras and facing some problems figuring out how to reshape the input image data properly. I have $16 x 16$ images, each with three layers, i.e., R, G, and B. The image data is in the form of a NumPy array with shape (100000,768) ; the first 256 entries are for the red layers, and so on. Now, I would like to feed these images into a sequential model with an input shape of $16 x 16 x 3$ . Is it okay if I reshape my image using: X.reshape(100000,16,16,3) here I have 100000 images. The reason I am asking this is that I have seen some posts where they have recommended to use: X.reshape(100000,3,3,16).transpose(0,2,3,1) Can someone please explain the correct method?
