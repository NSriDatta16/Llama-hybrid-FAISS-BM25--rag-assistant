SVMs do not produce probabilities, so you can not obtain a probability score from just an SVM. If you want a valid probability score, use logistic regression. Since you are using lib linear, the difference in performance between a linear SVM and linear Logistic model is minimal, but the logistic model will actually have real probabilities. Note, there are various "probability calibration" techniques that can be used, such as Platt's scaling. Some more info in a blog post of mine here .
