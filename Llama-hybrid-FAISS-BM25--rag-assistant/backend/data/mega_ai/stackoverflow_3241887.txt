Visual Studio remembers the window layout for coding and debugging separately, so removing the output window while you are debugging will not affect the "coding" state - you need to close the output window before you debug or it will reappear when debugging finishes. In Tools>Options, Projects and Solutions, there are options "Always show error list if build finishes with errors" and "Show output window when build starts" which cause the error/output windows to be shown automatically just before you start debugging. These could be the culprits for adding an error/output window that then reappears when you exit debugging mode. I have the output window "dockable" and pinned open. When I want to see it I use ctrl + alt + O , and to get rid of it I click into it and shift - escape . The output window "magically" disappears whenever I dont want it, but if I pay close attention I can see that I'm hitting the hotkey automatically myself :-)
