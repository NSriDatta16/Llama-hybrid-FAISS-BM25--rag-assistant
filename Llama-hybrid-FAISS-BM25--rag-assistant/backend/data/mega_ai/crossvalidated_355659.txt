Model Correlation vs Methodology

This question is inspired by this model correlation plot from the Kaggle Zillow Competition , specifically Zillow's blog summary : The competition was to make a model that predicts house prices using historic pricing data and various house features. The correlation plot above compares the top performing models on the same houses. In particular, the blog writes: "The top two teams on the leaderboard, Zensemble and Juan Zhai, had solutions that were highly correlated suggesting that their modeling took similar approaches. Indeed, we later found out that this was the case. But, the next two teams, Silogram and Jack from Japan, had solutions that were weakly correlated with the top two solutions and each other! This means that among the top teams there were many different ways to improve on the Zestimate and that we should (and did) talk to them all to get an understanding of their approaches. Combining the highly uncorrelated solutions together is likely going to lead to a larger improvement in the Zestimate than taking improvements from the top teams solution alone." How effective is the above statement? Here's what I mean. The general trend in the machine learning community is to write papers about new models and techniques, and then present a table comparing the proposed model to other state-of-the-art approaches, and then compare error rates. Occasionally, authors go further to demonstrate the model outperforms others in particular subsets of the data. This tends to be followed by mostly heuristic arguments for why the model works better than others. I wonder though, if we could glean more information about differences in models and approaches through such correlation plots (before diving into differences on specific samples)? Related to the above, if you have two models $f,g$ and some nice convex loss function $L[h](x_i,y_i)$, where $h=f,g$, then what is the relationship between the correlation on the test set $\mbox{Corr}_{test}(f,g)$ and the performance (loss) of $af(x)+bg(x)$, i.e. a mixture of the two models? I'm hoping this should be some standard result in statistical machine learning.
