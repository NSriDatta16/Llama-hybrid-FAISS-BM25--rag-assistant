Yes you can use neural networks in this way - it's an example of multi-label learning. There are many approaches, but one is to create binary target vectors indicating which labels should be applied to each document. Or a vector of probabilities as you suggest. There are plenty of papers on multilabel learning, with or without neural nets - one recent review is Zhang & Zhou 2014 .
