If you are reasonably sure that there ought to be relationships between each of the IVs and the DV then you should plot the DV against each of the IVs. For the continuous IV you can try a scatterplot and add a loess line. For the dichotomous IVs, one fairly simple option is to jitter the IV and then do a parallel boxplot with the DV. With so much data, you will probably need quite a bit of jitter and you might also try making the points open circles. See what that reveals. For the full regression model, one possible option with a lot of IVs is a regression tree - this may reveal interesting interactions. If it looks promising, then you might investigate things like random forests.
