An ARIMA(0,3,0) process is a process where the rate of change of the rate of change is a random walk. Is that helpful? Probably not. This is one reason why I am skeptical when software fits an integrated process of order 3 . As often with ARIMA, plotting a few simulated series is helpful. See below. Note how: ARIMA(0,0,0) is random white noise ARIMA(0,1,0) shows periods of linear trends ARIMA(0,2,0) shows periods of quadratic trends ARIMA(0,3,0) shows periods of cubic trends - compare the vertical axes on the ARIMA(0,2,0) and ARIMA(0,3,0) plots! I can't think of any time series that have a cubic trend in nature, and if you use an ARIMA($p$,3,$q$) model to forecast , you will essentially be extrapolating such a cubic trend. This can of course lead to extremely bad forecasts, especially at longer horizons. Yet another reason to be very careful about integration of order 3. nn
