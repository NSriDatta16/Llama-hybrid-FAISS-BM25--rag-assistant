How do I run stats on a data set organized by bins?

I have a problem I am working on and I have data set up in the following way: I wanted to test in flowers change their bloom size given the time of day, so I sampled random flowers in the morning and in the evening, measuring the diameter of their bloom. These measurements were separated into size bins, like I am not sure how to run this data since each flower was not sampled at morning and evening, it was a different flower each time....Any help would be greatly appreciated!
