It is my understanding that terms number of dimensions and dimensionality refer to any system , which has some parameters . Thus, in the context of statistics , both terms, consequently, refer to any statistical model (where parameters are often referred to as variables ). Therefore, determining number of dimensions of a model boils down to counting number of independent and (IMHO, separately) dependent variables, or in a preferred terminology, predictor and outcome variables. Other popular compatible terms for predictor variables include features and attributes . As a starting point for learning more on the topic, I would suggest you reading corresponding Wikipedia articles: on dimensions , on dimensionality reduction and on the curse of dimensionality . Finally, addressing your main concern , I would say that dimensionality of a machine learning problem is equivalent to dimensionality of a statistical model, describing said problem .
