Is there a better way to organise javascript in a single file with specific code for multiple pages?

I have a couple of websites where I use a relatively small amount of jQuery to do various things on the pages. Generally we're talking about a couple of dozen lines of code per page. I keep all of my JS in one file so far as it's not huge and fairly clearly defined. That said, what I have trended towards is organizing it like so: $(document).ready(function(){ var onPage1 = $("#id_thing_on_1").length === 1; if( onPage1 ){ var usefulPage1Function = function(){}; //blah $("a").click(function(){}); //etc } }); $(document).ready(function(){ var onPage2 = $("#id_of_page_2").length === 1; if( onPage2 ){ $(".someClass").fadeIn().click(function(){}); //etc } }); Anything that is used on multiple pages gets taken out into a library, but for page specific stuff, this is the pattern I've been following. Is there a better approach, or is this an acceptable practice for keeping your JS in one file and loading it on multiple pages?
