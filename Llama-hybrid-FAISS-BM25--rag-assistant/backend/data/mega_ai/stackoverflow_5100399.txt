Integrating BlackBerry application with Flurry

Has anyone been able to successfully integrate Flurry with a BlackBerry mobile application? I have imported the FlurryAgent.jar into my project, yet when I go to run the application I am given the error "Module 'FlurryAgent' not found." I have tried the following: Preverifying the .jar file Adding the .jar file to the build path of a library project (that my main project references) It is still not working for me after trying the above - I'm getting ready to pull my hair out, there really isn't a helpful guide to do this. Thanks!
