Analyzing residuals in logistic regression

Greetings statistics experts, I am having a try with the kaggle titanic dataset and am wondering what to do with the residuals after fitting models. In the case of linear regression you can look at a residual plot and see if there is any discernible pattern, but this is not so straightforward with logistic regression. How can I improve on my model. Thank you.
