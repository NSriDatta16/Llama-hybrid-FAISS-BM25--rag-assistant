Test autocorrelation in irregularly(unevenly) spaced time series

I have a dataset that includes observations at different time points. There are multiple observations at the same time points and the time points are not evenly spaced. Now, I would like to test whether the data are random or autocorrelated in time. Can I call such a dataset as a time series? If so, what kind test methods I can try to use for such an irregularly spaced time series?
