In this case, higher PCA1 scores will mean "good welfare" as you've labeled it. But PCA doesn't explicitly provide you with a classification threshold like that. Zero may be a fine discriminator between the two classes you've named, but that threshold may be better chosen differently. Plot the component scores to see if there is a natural break between your good and bad welfare animals. Added detail: The PCA process reprojects your data along a number of new axes that correspond to the greatest amount of variance in your data, provided that each new axis of rotation is orthogonal to the ones that preceded it. This means that your PC1 axis is the single axis along which the variance of the data is maximized. You may be able to cleanly distinguish between clusters or groups of animals along that single axis, or you may need to bring in PC2,3, etc. In some cases, there will be an explainable relationship to an individual component. You found that PC1 correlated with the positive emotion scores, so you may find that PC2 corresponds with the negative emotions. Your implementation of PCA should give you the cumulative variance that is explained by adding more principal components. Add enough that you are comfortable with the amount of variance you are explaining with these new variables, but not so many that you are adding variance due to noise.
