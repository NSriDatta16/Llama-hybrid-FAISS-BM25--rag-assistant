Have you encountered the sort of toaster you often get in hotels. You put bread on a conveyor belt at one end and it comes out as toast at the other. Unfortunately, in the toaster at this cheap hotel, the heaters have all got moved to random heights and distances from the entrance to the toaster. You cannot move the heaters or bend the path of the belt (which is straight, by the way (this is where the linear bit comes in), but you can alter the HEIGHT and TILT of the belt . Given the positions of all the heaters, linear regression will tell you the correct height and angle to place the belt to get the most heat overall. This is because linear regression will minimise the average distance between the toast and the heaters. My first holiday job was doing linear regressions by hand. The guy who said you don't want to do that is RIGHT!!!
