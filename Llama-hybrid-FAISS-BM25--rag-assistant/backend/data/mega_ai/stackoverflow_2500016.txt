HTML Agility Pack Screen Scraping XPATH isn't returning data

I'm attempting to write a screen scraper for Digikey that will allow our company to keep accurate track of pricing, part availability and product replacements when a part is discontinued. There seems to be a discrepancy between the XPATH that I'm seeing in Chrome Devtools as well as Firebug on Firefox and what my C# program is seeing. The page that I'm scraping currently is http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=296-12602-1-ND The code I'm currently using is pretty quick and dirty... //This function retrieves data from the digikey private static List ExtractProductInfo(HtmlDocument doc) { List m_unparsedProductInfoNodes = new List (); List m_unparsedProductInfo = new List (); //Base Node for part info string m_baseNode = @"//html[1]/body[1]/div[2]"; //Write part info to list m_unparsedProductInfoNodes.Add(doc.DocumentNode.SelectSingleNode(m_baseNode + @"/table[1]/tr[1]/td[1]/table[1]/tr[1]/td[1]")); //More lines of similar form will go here for more info //this retrieves digikey PN foreach(HtmlNode node in m_unparsedProductInfoNodes) { m_unparsedProductInfo.Add(node.InnerText); } return m_unparsedProductInfo; } Although the path I'm using appears to be "correct" I keep getting NULL when I look at the list "m_unparsedProductInfoNodes" Any idea what's going on here? I'll also add that if I do a "SelectNodes" on the baseNode it only returns a div with the only significant child being "cs=####" which seems to vary with browser user agents. If I try to use this in anyway (putting /cs=0 in the path for the unidentifiable browser) it pitches a fit insisting that my expression doesn't evaluate to a node set, but leaving them still leaves the problem of all data past div[2] is returned as NULL.
