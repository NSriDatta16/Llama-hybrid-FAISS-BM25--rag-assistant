What an input space exactly is in the context of machine learning?

I've been confused about various "space"s in machine learning for a long time. I've checked out this , this and this post . I am trying to get understanding through some concrete examples like this one . Consider the example in this video Assume each channel of each pixel has 256 possible integer values and we are using rgb color scheme, which means, there are $256^3$ possible values in each pixel. Assume each image consists $64*64$ pixels, is the input space = feature space = a set of $64^2*256^3$ possible arrays that each has a dimension of $64 \times 64 \times 64$ ?
