The error you listed says that Galileo doesn't see all the plug-ins and libraries Ganymede and your program was using. Sorry for the non-answer below. Your alternative is fiddling with Galileo until it sees all your libraries and plug-ins. What I would do is install Galileo side-by-side Ganymede and port your applications over one at a time. I'm assuming you are working under Windows, but the same techniques that I list here also work for Linux. First, in theory, all you have to do to upgrade from Ganymede to Galileo is install Galileo over Ganymede. Believe that? Good. I don't either. So walk through Ganymede and note what plug-ins you have installed. Then install Galileo in a separate directory. Point the new install at your Java VM. Then install all your plug-ins. It's your choice how you do this. Finally, I'd differentiate between source and Meta in your projects. Create a new project under Galileo and move only your source. Let Galileo re-build your meta. Now, how to avoid all this pain next time: Version control. CVS, SVN, git... it doesn't matter what you use. Eclipse has a plug-in that supports them all. Then, next upgrade, simply import the source into a project in your new Eclipse installation. Much less painful, and you'll have much more control over your source. Good luck.
