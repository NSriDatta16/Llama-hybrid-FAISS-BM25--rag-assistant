Why is Functional Data Analysis (FDA) not as popular?

I am interested in FDA (data perceived as functions), as someone from a pure mathematics background and I think it can help provide solutions to some major challenges in data analysis (also data science), compared to the ordinary perspective in which data is perceived, as vectors. However, I have not found so much literature about it on the web. Could someone help me understand why this is so? Also, where can I get some good reads in FDA?
