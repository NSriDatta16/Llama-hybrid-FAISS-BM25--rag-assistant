If you are adding just one element, find the position where it should be inserted and put it there. For an array, you can do binary search for O(logN) time and insert in O(N). For a linked list, you'll have to do a linear search which will take O(N) time but then insertion is O(1). As for your question on quicksort: If you choose the first value as your pivot, then yes it will be O(N 2 ) in your case. Choose a random pivot and your case will still be O(NlogN) on average. However, the method I suggest above is both easier to implement and faster in your specific case.
