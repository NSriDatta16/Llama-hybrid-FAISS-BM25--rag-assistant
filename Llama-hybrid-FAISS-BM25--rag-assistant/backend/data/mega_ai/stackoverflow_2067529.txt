mysqldb pulls whole query result in one chunk always even if I just do a fetchone?

So if I do import MySQLdb conn = MySQLdb.connect(...) cur = conn.cursor() cur.execute("SELECT * FROM HUGE_TABLE") print "hello?" print cur.fetchone() It looks to me that MySQLdb gets the entire huge table before it gets to the "print". I previously assumed it did some sort of "cursor/state" lazy retrieval in the background, but it doesn't look like it to me. Is this right? If so is it because it has to be this way or is this due to a limitation of the MySQL wire protocol? Does this mean that java/hibernate behave the same way? I guess I need to use the "limit 1" MySQL clauses and relatives if I want to walk through a large table without pulling in the whole thing at once? Or no? Thanks in advance.
