Amending Web Config for Test Fixtures

I'm using CassiniDevLib to host an MVC app for integration testing. In order to do it I need to amend some config settings on the web server so they match the integration testing environment, first one being the connection string so it points to the test database. I know I can have two copies of the web.config file and rename them but I was wondering if there was a more elegant way. ie a way to amend the settings in code as part of the Test Fixture setup. The challenge being that I need to access the web server process from my test ficture process Would appreciate any thoughts on this.
