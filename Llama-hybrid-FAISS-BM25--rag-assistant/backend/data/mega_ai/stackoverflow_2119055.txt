the api documentation says : Note: The old location parameter 'p' has been deprecated and will be removed in the future releases. Hence users are encouraged to migrate to the 'w' parameter which provides deep integration into Y! GeoPlanet. The old documentation is archived here . so: using p doesn't seem to be the best idea for production code to me.
