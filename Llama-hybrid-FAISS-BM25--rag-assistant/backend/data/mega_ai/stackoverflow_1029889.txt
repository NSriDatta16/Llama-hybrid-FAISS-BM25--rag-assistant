In your average deployment using Passenger, you probably have multiple app processes that share nothing between them but classes within each process that maintain their (static) state from request to request. Each request, though, makes a new instance of your controllers. You might call this a cluster of distinct shared-state environments. To use your Java analogy, you can do the caching and have it work from request to request, you just can't assume that it will be available on every request.
