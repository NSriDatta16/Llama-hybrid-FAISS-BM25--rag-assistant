For simple explanations, sample codes and use cases of common software design patterns, you can check out http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns . They are generally aimed at solving common problems and can, in fact, be considered as re-usable architectures in software development. For information related to domain-specific systems, such as games, there can be other domain-specific problems that have been addressed in different architectures, such as some of the links you have provided. Finding a single source which can list all this information in a unified architecture may not be possible, at best. Generic design patterns, such as those from the Gang of Four, is a better start for this reason, I believe.
