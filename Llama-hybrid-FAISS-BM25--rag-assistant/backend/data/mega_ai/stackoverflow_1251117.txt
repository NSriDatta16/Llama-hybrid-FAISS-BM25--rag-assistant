How to verify a website certificate in Cocoa Touch?

I currently open an https connection to a web server using NSURLConnection. Everything works as it should and I am able to retrieve the page content I am after. The certificate is issued by VeriSign and I assume NSURLConnection does some work to verify the authenticity of the certificate to some extent? If I connected to the same website through mobile safari it would extract from the certificate, and display the Organization (of the website) in the navigation bar. Is it possibly to extract these same details in Cocoa Touch as I too would like to present them to the user? Also would verifying the serverâ€™s host name against that certificate be reasonable enough to assume website is legitimate?
