How to check and correct misspelling in the data of pairs of words?

I have user generated text containing names of ports often containing typos and the actual port names. I would like to correct the misspelling of user generated text containing the names of ports. Can anyone help me think of some ideas or steps to take? Perhaps using word2vec? RNN? thank you in advance.
