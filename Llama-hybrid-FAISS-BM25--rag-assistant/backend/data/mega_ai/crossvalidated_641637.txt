Recap As others have pointed out it's due to the central limit theorem which directly implies that the sum of a large number of independent random variables will follow a normal distribution. I will extend this discussion by mentioning some examples of how this applies and another perspective to answer the question. Examples Take for instance the time it takes you to get to work. This time is affected by many random factors (delays) such as the weather, road conditions, public events, construction, traffic, etc. You may find traffic not to be independent of these but the fact is it's likely itself normal by depending on may independent factors so it doesn't matter. Likewise, human height is normally distributed because it depends on a combination of (likely) independent genetic factors and environmental factors. More precisely, without these variations we'd all be as high but because they exist, the variation in height follows a normal distribution which makes height itself follow a normal distribution. Apply the same argument for time to work above given that delay would follow a normal distribution. Another Perspective Another way to ask this question, is to consider that unimodal symmetric distributions will usually be well-approxiamted by the normal distribution and that in many cases, there is no reason for the population to have an asymmetric distribution. For instance, if it's known that the average height of males is $1.7m$ then one can claim that it's equally likely to find someone who is $1.7m+Δm$ high or $1.7m-Δm$ high, simply because there is no major factor that would drive the asymmetry and make one of these more probable than the other, it's rather a combination of many independent factors. Meanwhile, if we look at something such as the time until a mechanical piece wear out then there is a good reason that asymmetry exists: the more time its operating, the more likely it will eventually stop working as its detoriated by friction.
