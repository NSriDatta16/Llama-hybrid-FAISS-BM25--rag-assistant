HTML toggle button for simple site using php possible?

I've got a simple website using plain HTML/CSS to display and PHP/MySQL for data storage. Now I'd like to add a toggle button similar to facebooks "like" button. How can I act on the user pressing the button (add database record for this item, change button text) without leaving the page? I thought this question would have been asked and diskussied to no end, but all solutions I found require some other frameworks than plain PHP as background.
