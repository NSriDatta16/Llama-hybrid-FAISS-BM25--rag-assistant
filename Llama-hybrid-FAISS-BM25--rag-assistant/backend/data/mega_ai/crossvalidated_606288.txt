How to deal with patients falling out of the study more frequent in one treatment arm

I'm doing a retrospective comparison of two treatments (A and B) for eye disease. Both procedures have the same most common side effect (dependent variable) but their indications differ slightly resulting in different average age of the patients treated (75 in treatment A and 69 in treatment B). As you would expect, older patients treated with treatment A die earlier and more frequently (of unrelated causes) resulting in a shorter observation time. How can I deal with that? Is this something that requires data imputation?
