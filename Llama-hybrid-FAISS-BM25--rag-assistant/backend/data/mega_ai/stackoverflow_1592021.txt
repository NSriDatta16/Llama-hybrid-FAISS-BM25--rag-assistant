The only thing I can add to Albert Kallal's answer is that I actually did use MS Access with two different source control providers - with MS Visual SourceSafe and with SourceGear's SourceOffSite. There were some occassional problems when our team was using SourceOffSite - like sudden failures of MS Access during some source control operations - but all in all it worked. (Perhaps those problems were caused by the fact that we sometimes "mixed" those two source control providers - i.e. one developer was using VSS and another was using SOS. So I can't really blame those problems on MS Access itself.) Now, I never used Vault. But, since SourceOffsite and Vault come from the same vendor, I think there is a very good chance that (a) SourceGear offers an MSSCCI provider for Vault and (b) MS Access can be used with Vault successfully. Hope this helps.
