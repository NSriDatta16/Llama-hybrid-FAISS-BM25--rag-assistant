Being 84% of the data any model will try to converge to no-action class. I would go with SuperCodeBrah's opinion of using under-sampling for your dataset. I encountered similar situation, but doing over-sampling on lower class's data didn't work, so i went for undersampling & used bidirectional-LSTM. It did converge to an balanced model. Yes CNN works great with numerics but i would suggest you to apply Bi-directional LSTM. You can apply different metrices with combination of LSTM & Dropout layers to reduce risk of overfitting as it is common with imbalanced data cases. Hope this little experiment works
