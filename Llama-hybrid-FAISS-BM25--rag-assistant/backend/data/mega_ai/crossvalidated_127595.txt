Those are not so much job descriptions as job titles. If you did have descriptions like this example from the SOC definitions , you could use a topic model as suggested by Chris: 1011 Chief Executives Determine and formulate policies and provide overall direction of companies or private and public sector organizations within guidelines set up by a board of directors or similar governing body. Plan, direct, or coordinate operational activities at the highest level of management with the help of subordinate executives and staff managers. In the absence of long-form text, you could use a naive Bayesian classifier (since you have a classification problem) that uses the social network as a feature, since people are likely to work in the same types of jobs as their friends. Another feature could be the string similarity to the Direct Match Title File (I think this database is just what you need), which provides a mapping between job titles and the SOC.
