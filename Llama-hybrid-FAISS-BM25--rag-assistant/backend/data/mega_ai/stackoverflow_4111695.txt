Are you perhaps passing a lot more data to the graphics card than you have pixels? This could happen if your FFT size is much larger than the height of the drawing area or the number of spectral lines is a lot more than its width. If so, it's possible that the bottle neck could be passing too much data across the bus. Try reducing the number of spectral lines by either averaging them or picking (taking the maximum in each bin for a set of consecutive lines).
