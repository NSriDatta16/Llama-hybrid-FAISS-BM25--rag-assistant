Not at all, it's expected if you've designed your classes properly. You should have a small public interface, and if the implementation is complex, you'll probably end up calling many private methods in the same class. In fact, not doing this can be an anti-pattern. If you're constantly calling methods of another class, it's called Feature Envy and you should probably combine classes. If you're putting all the implementation into one gargantuan function, that's just unmaintainable, and probably contains a lot of code duplication. Breaking things out into other reusable methods is a good thing. Your case of 3 methods calling the same one is perfect code reuse. It would be very bad if the code of that one function was duplicated in each of the calling functions.
