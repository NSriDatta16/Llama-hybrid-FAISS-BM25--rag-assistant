A very simple example often overlooked that should lie within the experience of many readers concerns the marks or grades given to academic work. Often marks for individual assignments are in essence judgement-based ordinal measurements, even when as a matter of convention they are given as (say) percent marks or marks on a scale with maximum 5 (possibly with decimal points too). That is, a teacher may read through an essay or dissertation or thesis or paper and decide that it deserves 42%, or 4, or whatever. Even when marks are based on a detailed assessment scheme the scale is at root some distance from an interval or ratio measurement scale. But then many institutions take the view that if you have enough of these marks or grades it is perfectly reasonable to average them (grade-point average, etc.) and even to analyse them in more detail. So at some point the ordinal measurements morph into a summary scale that is treated as if it were continuous. Connoisseurs of irony will note that statistical courses in many Departments or Schools often teach that this is at best dubious and at worst wrong, all the while it is implemented as a University-wide procedure.
