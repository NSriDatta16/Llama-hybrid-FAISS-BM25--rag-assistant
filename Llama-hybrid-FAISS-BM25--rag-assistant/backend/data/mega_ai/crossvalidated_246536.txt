Is every non stationary series convertible to a stationary series through differencing

Can every non stationary time series be converted to a stationary time series by applying differencing? Also, how do you decide the order of the differencing to be applied? Do you just difference with intervals 1,2...n, and perform unit root test of stationary each time to see if the resulting series is stationary?
