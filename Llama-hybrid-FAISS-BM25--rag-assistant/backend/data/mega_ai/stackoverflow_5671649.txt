It sounds like you are creating a new instance of Panel when you move it from CustomControl to Form and back and loosing it's state. You should either try to pass the actual instance owned by Form to CustomControl without creating a new one or you could capture the state of the Panel in another object which you can pass to the constructor when you create a new Panel so that it is in the same state as the one you were dragging? It seems as though you are trying to manually fire mouse events to compensate for problems in your design. Always better to give some example code if you can than lengthy textual explanations.
