Organic layout manages fairly well clustered graphs in yFiles framework. Try first in yEd to see if it does what needed. It is probably reasonable to use nested graphs alias groups for each cluster. Organic layout has feature called Group Layout Policy which can be used if layout needs to be done using different principles for inter-cluster and intra-cluster edges, with incremental layouting. With some effort, one can translate graph into GraphML to avoid manual work.
