Something else. To perform Bayesian analysis on the results of several studies that address the same parameter (or parameters) you need to get hold of their likelihoods - or approximations thereof - and multiply them by the prior. If each individual analysis has reported its just its own Bayesian inference, this will not be possible - though an approximation might be feasible. Happily, most papers will report a straight summary of the data before giving their fully Bayesian inference. For your Bayesian inference, you can start with that summary and add your prior.
