My guess is that Apple is using NSArray all over the place (and most programmers as well), so this choice comes naturally - and changing it now would come at a high cost. And if using arrays internally, a copy of an immutable array is much cheaper than building a set just for the sake of mathematical elegance. Also note that NSSet and NSArray don't have a common parent (well, except NSObject , of course), so abstracting this interface is also impossible (except for returning something that conforms to NSFastEnumeration ). Just wild speculation, of course. ;-)
