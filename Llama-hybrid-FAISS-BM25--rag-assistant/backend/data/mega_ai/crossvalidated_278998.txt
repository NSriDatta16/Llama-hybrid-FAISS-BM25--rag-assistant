The process of combining different forecasts to get a better resulting forecast than any of the constituents. Simple forecast averages are often found to outperform individual forecasts in practice. A related although different concept is model averaging. The difference is that forecasts being combined/averaged need not be produced by models (e.g. survey forecasts).
