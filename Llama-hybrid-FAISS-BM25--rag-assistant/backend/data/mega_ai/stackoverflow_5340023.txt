Correct way to call a product page using a static block in Magento

I have a content slider setup and works correctly, but when try to add a url to the content navigation I am still seeing my placeholder (#) in the link instead of see the link. What is the correct way to call a product in a static block? I tried using something along the lines of this: "/> "/> "/> however the link does not change from (#)
