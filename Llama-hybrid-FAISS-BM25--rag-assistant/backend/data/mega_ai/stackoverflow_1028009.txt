I also wanted to mention that IPSwitch makes a product called " WhatsUpGold " that does exactly this. I've been using it for the past 4 years and it can probably do everything you need out of the box. Most importantly, it's very cost effective! I'm a version behind, since I didn't need any of the new features! It supports a distributed multi-site network (agent at each site monitors status/health and reports back to your main location/hub). *As John mentioned above, the key to monitoring a device's status is defining it's health. Just getting a status of up or down is not enough, since many other things; ping latency, disk utilization, cpu utilization, etc... will be based on your unique environment.
