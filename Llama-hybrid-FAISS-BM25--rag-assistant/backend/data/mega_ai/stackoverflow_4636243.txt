Only two things needs to be done: Check if the user is logged in. If so, then continue request. If not, then go to login page. A Filter is a perfect tool for this. An example can be found in this answer . Instruct webbrowser to not cache the page so that the enduser won't be able to request the page from the browser cache and the browser is thus forced to fire a fullworthy HTTP request (which would then trigger the Filter at #1). This is to be done by adding three response headers Cache-Control , Pragma and Expires as detailed in this answer . Again, a Filter is a perfect tool for the job. It can even be done in the same Filter as in #1. Note that you definitely don't want to handle this with JavaScript since it can easily be disabled/hacked/spoofed by the enduser.
