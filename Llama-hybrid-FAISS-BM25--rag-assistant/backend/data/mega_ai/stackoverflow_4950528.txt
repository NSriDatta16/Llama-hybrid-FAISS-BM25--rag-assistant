The intent is to call DragDetect from your WM_LBUTTONDOWN handler to see if the user is trying to drag something from your application. If it returns true, this is the start of a drag operation; if it's false, then not. After a return of true you start tracking the mouse and doing hit tests to provide feedback, if any; you should at least change the cursor at this point. Finally at WM_LBUTTONUP you do a final hit test to see what the drop target is.
