From Barlow and Proschan (1981): Let $T_i$ be the duration of the $i$th functioning period and $D_i$ be the down time for the $i$th repair. Let the sequence $\{T_i+D_i\}$ be mutually independent; $T_i$ and $D_i$ are not assumed independent. Let $F$ be the common distribution of $T_i$, $H$ the common distribution of $T_i+D_i$, and $M_H(t) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty H^{(i)}(t)$ be the renewal function corresponding to $H$. Then by the Key Renewal Theorem $$A = \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} A(t) = \frac{E[T]} { E[T] + E[D]}$$ when the distribution $H$ is non-lattice. So, the equation you gave holds in the limit, with no assumptions other than that the expectations exist and the mild assumptions given above. Now, if you have a system with $n$ machines following the same assumptions, and assuming that the machines are independent of each other, then the availability in the limit as $t\rightarrow\infty$ of each machine is also $A$. Let $X_i(t)$ be equal to 1 if the $i$th machine is operating at time $t$ and 0 if it is not. Then the availability of $n$ machines at a given time $t$ is given by $$A_1(t)+\cdots + A_n(t) = E[X_1(t)]+\cdots+E[X_n(t)]= E[X_1(t) + \cdots X_n(t)].$$ So, as $t\rightarrow\infty$ we must have a limiting availability of $nA$ machines. This holds as time increases, rather than as the number of machines increases. It seems intuitively reasonable that as the number of machines increases, that the average availability at a given time will go to something, but I'm not sure that it would have to be the same quantity. The dedication in this book is very funny --- I had forgotten it. R.E. Barlow and F. Proschan (1981) Statistical Theory of Reliability and Life Testing. TO BEGIN WITH.
