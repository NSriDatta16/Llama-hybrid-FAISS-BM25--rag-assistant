In the real world, there are some guarantees made regarding data integrity. In the case of dealing with user input (whether from stdin or a file) there is some project defined paradigm for notifying the user of a problem that requires attention. For instance, when a compiler compiling code or a shell executing a script encounters an inconsistency it might halt and print the line containing the inconsistency with a second line below it that uses the "^" symbol to indicate the location of the problem. So here are some basic question to ask yourself: 1. Is every line guaranteed to contain every field? 2. Is the ordering of the fields guaranteed? If those are conditions of the input contract and are violated, you should ignore/report the line. If they are not conditions of the input, then you need to handle it .. which you currently do not.
