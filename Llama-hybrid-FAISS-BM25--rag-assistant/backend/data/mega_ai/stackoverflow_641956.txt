So, isn't it better to simply embed SQL in C# (or VB) in ways that permit you to freely state your SQL but that also give you easy parameter embedding and automatic conversion to native classes? What I usually do comes very close to this. I write the SQL in a stored procedure, so I get the freedom of real SQL. In C# I use Linq's DBML to access the stored procedures in a natural way. This feels like the best of both worlds. The real solution looks even simpler to me: embed SQL in C# code and have the compiler generate the strong classes. If Visual Studio supported that, I doubt anyone would be using anything else. (There' always people trying to create Entity Frameworks and "architecture" away the need for SQL. As far as I know, this has never really worked, if only because the result is dramatically harder to maintain and dead slow.)
