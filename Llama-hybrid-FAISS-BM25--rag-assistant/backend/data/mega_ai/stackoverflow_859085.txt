Read Jeff’s The Best Code is No Code at All . foo.CompareTo(bar) == 0 : horrible visual clutter. Takes up a lot of space and conveys no interesting meaning. In fact, it emphasizes a lot of irrelevant stuff which deflects attention away from the real problem. If there’s no well-defined reason for using this longer variant, don’t. As for performance: it simply doesn’t matter for this simple case. If the equality operator == should really perform worse than CompareTo , feel free to file a bug report with Microsoft. This must not happen.
