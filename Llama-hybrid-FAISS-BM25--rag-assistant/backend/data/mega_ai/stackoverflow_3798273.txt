You need to initialize your array b to zero. b[a[i]]||0 will not work, you don't know what is in b originally. Shorter code : int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { int a[]={1,2,3,4,4,4,5}; int n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(int ); int *b=new int [n]; fill_n(b,n,0); // Put n times 0 in b int val=0; // Value that is the most frequent for (int i=0;i = b[val]) val = a[i]; cout ATTENTION : your code (mine too) can ONLY work if the maximum value is lower than the number of values in the array a. If that's not the case and the maximum value is much greater that the number of elements, you might want to sort the array and then search in linear time (and constant space) for the maximum value.
