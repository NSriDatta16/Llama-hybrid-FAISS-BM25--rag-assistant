Also looking for an answer to this. The closest I've found so far is from the R survey package manual : Using "adjust" [ centered in Stata] is conservative, and it would often be better to combine strata in some intelligent way. The properties of "average" [ scaled ] have not been investigated thoroughly, but it may be useful when the lonely PSUs are due to a few strata having PSUs missing completely at random. The "remove" and "certainty" options [ certainty ] give the same result, but "certainty" is intended for situations where there is only one PSU in the population stratum, which is sampled with certainty (also called ‘self-representing’ PSUs or strata). With "certainty" no warning is generated for strata with only one PSU. Ordinarily, svydesign will detect certainty PSUs, making this option unnecessary. Other sources (e.g. here ) seem to suggest that selecting certainty is only appropriate when there is only a single "large" PSU in this stratum in the population, but also note that using approximate methods can give values that are too high.
