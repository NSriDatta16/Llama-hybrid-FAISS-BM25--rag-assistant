I would split my answer to 2 parts: 1) If the variable is a reference type than it is already shared since you pass its reference to all interested objects. The only thing you should pay attention is that the reference type instances are mutable. 2) If the variable is a value type than you would have to use ref or out or some wrapper that is mutable and you can change the value inside the wrapper using a method or a property. Hope that helps.
