There is a significant body of research literature on robot motion planning and robot locomotion . General Robot Locomotion Control For bipedal robots, there are at least two major approaches to robot design and control (whether the robot is simulated or physically real): Zero Moment Point - a dynamics-based approach to locomotion stability and control. Biologically-inspired locomotion - a control approach modeled after biological neural networks in mammals, insects, etc., that focuses on use of central pattern generators modified by other motor control programs/loops to control overall walking and maintain stability. Motion Control for Bipedal Soccer Robot There are really two aspects to handling the control issues for your simulated biped robot: Basic walking and locomotion control Task-oriented motion planning The first part is just about handling the basic control issues for maintaining robot stability (assuming you are using some physics-based model with gravity), walking in a straight-line, turning, etc. The second part is focused on getting your robot to accomplish specific tasks as a soccer player, e.g., run toward the ball, kick the ball, block an opposing player, etc. It is probably easiest to solve these separately and link the second part as a higher-level controller that sends trajectory and goal directives to the first part. There are a lot of relevant papers and books which could be suggested, but I've listed some potentially useful ones below that you may wish to include in whatever research you have already done.
