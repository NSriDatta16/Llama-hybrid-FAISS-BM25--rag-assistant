Bayesian Wilcoxon test

I have a pre-post dataset with 2 observations per subject (propotion data -bounded between 0 and 1-). I have analyzed the data with a classical dependent t-test under the NHST paradigm. However, as data does not follow normality and I have a relatively small sample size (i.e., 10 subjects), the p-value may be unreliable. In the NHST framework it is typical conducting a Wilcoxon test afterwards in order to compare both distributions. However, I want to conduct the analysis with Bayesian statistics due to its simple interpretation (i.e., in probability terms). Is there any equivalent to the Wilcoxon test (or in general non-parametric statistical tests) in Bayesian statistics?
