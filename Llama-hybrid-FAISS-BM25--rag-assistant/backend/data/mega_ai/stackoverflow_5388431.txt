How to classify japanese characters as either kanji or Katakana or Hiragana?

I am working on some application which require sorting of Japans languages. Sorting of Japanese needs to have Katakana and Kanji converted to Hiragana and then sorted according to the UTF-8 code. The Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji characters shall be combined together and sorted by the Hiragana equivalent “spelling.” Note: using the Hiragana “alphabet” – a, i, u, e, o, ka, ki, ku, ke, ki, etc. Now to do this task, I need : 1.Classify japanese characters as either kanji or Katakana or Hiragana. 2.Convert Katakana and Kanji to Hiragana . 3.Apply algorithm which carry out sorting base on phonetic sound(Hiragana). The Database of application is in UTF-8 . Now to carry out 1st step: "Classify japanese characters as either kanji or Katakana or Hiragana." , I want to know if there is any APIs present for C or C++ programing language in Sqlite3 , QT , ICU or any other package which can give Unicode of Character ? On the Base of Unicode, we can easily classify Japanese characters. Please correct me if I am wrong?
