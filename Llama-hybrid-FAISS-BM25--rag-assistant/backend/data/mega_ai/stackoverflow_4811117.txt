I don't know Jaxb annotations but if you ask for an attribute in ExecRpt it seems normal to have an attribute in ExecRpt no? I think you expect a bit too much of these annotations. Don't you also want an annotation that would take a string, split it with a separator and generate a list of child elements or something? And it seems to me a bad design to put these annotations directly on JPA entities. One day you could have to do some database changes for performances issues for exemple and you could not be able to generate the xml you want anymore. Why not transforming your jpa entity to a given structure jaxb friendly so that you keep the db and marshalling appart? Thus on change you would just have to modify the transformer.
