"The curriculum is a carefully calibrated mix of applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, and business disciplines." Based on this taken from the link you provided, and my personal experience with data mining and statistical machine learning, I would say it would not be worth your efforts. It seems like the program you are interested in is much more applied and would not go into the mathematical rigor that would require a prerequisite knowledge of real analysis. Could it be useful for understanding the fundamentals of calculus, sequences, and series? Sure, but you could learn this without necessarily needing to learn how to rigorously prove everything. I would spend more time with programming and linear algebra to prepare you for data mining. Unless you want to go into acedemic research in data mining at the Phd level and beyond, I would not take real analysis.
