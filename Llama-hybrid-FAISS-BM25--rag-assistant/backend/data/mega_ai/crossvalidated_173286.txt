How do you derive AIC and BIC for discrete-valued observables?

Let's say I have an experiment which yields discrete results between 1 and $N$. I am modelling the results using a number of statistical models and want to use Akaike (corrected) or Bayesian Information Criterion to choose the best model. How can I derive AICc or BIC if the predicted variables are discrete and bounded? Is there a difference in what we mean by "sample size" in AICc or BIC formula?
