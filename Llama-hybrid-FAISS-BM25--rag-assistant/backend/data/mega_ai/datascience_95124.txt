Performing such benchmark is not that easy. Meaning one can not just pick a few data set and run these models as there is a data dependency. In such cases, one need to simulate data through various process - the simulation helps to design various data in various condition. for example perhaps model one is doing a better job at binning so, the data with various binning condition must be in place before hand, or the depth of the tree. So just picking house-prices data is not enough. Bare in mind such out performance can be really really small. Don't expect 10% difference ! they lay down within 1% often. What distinguish Catboost from Xgboost is the thread safing in the production environment. Xgboost is not a thread safe - therefore, can not be used in any serious deployment environment.
