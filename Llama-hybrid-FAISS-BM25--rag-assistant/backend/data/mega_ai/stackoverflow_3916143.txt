It is not valid to have duplicate ids within the same document. If you are building this dynamically then try prepending the parent id to the child so it would be like: Note, starting an ID with a number is also invalid, so I took the liberty to prepend "r" to your row ids. I would recommend using the selector: $('#r5 .test1')
