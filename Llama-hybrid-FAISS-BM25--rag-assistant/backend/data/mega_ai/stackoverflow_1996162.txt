Creating an MS Office document-like file format to expose document properties

Our application's "documents" are single binary files. Our customers have asked if we can add MS Office-like document properties to our document files so that they are easier for users to manage. By easier to manage, I mean the ability for Windows Explorer to display common document properties in tooltips. My research seems to indicate we should consider OLE Structured Storage as the basis for our data files. I've seen this technique alternatively described as MS Structured Storage, OLE 2 Compound Document Formats, and Windows file metadata. My concerns about using OLE Structured Storage is that it does not appear that Office 2007 or 2010 use this file format any more and OLE Structured Storage requires the registration of a DSOFILE.DLL ActiveX component that many of our customers will not be able to use because they run our software on locked down workstations where users do not have admin rights to install software. (Our application software is a pure XCOPY deployment). Would appreciate hearing ideas on what our options are.
