Is there a way of comparing/ evaluating a machine learning model with a recurrent model with a statistical significance test?

Comparing two different machine learning models (to assess if the difference between the mean performance is real or not using P-value and t-Statistic) is possible and strait forward in Python. Generally, is it possible to compare LSTM (requiring creating sequential data with time steps) with a machine learning model?
