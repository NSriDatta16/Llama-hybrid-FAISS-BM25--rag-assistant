I'm afraid that your question is a bit unclear. What are you asking precisely? I can only give a partial answer because I don't fully understand what you want to know. To use Andrew Gelman's definition, Bayesian statistics refers to a statistical paradigm that makes its inferences from a posterior distribution . There are, for example, Bayesian neural networks, and Bayesian regression methods, among many other flavors of Bayesian reasoning. I don't think that the graph is making any attempt at representing itself as an exhaustive list of machine learning methods; it's just supposed to be an illustration of the kinds of tools in scikit-learn and when you might use them. You might be a geneticist interested in genetic predisposition to disease; in that case, you'd want to use a method like disease-specific genomic analysis to preprocess your data prior to applying some other analysis method. Or perhaps you have a pile of unlablled data that you want to explore; KODAMA might be helpful. I don't know why the diagram omits neural networks or any of the other of myriads of methods not appearing there. Certainly you can use a neural network for classification tasks; this is very common.
