As Marc stated, this question depends on how you define more than strictly necessary. It may also depend on what you mean by overfitting. If you mean selecting a model that contains parameters that are not in the "true" model, then the penalty is correct asymptotically. There is a corrected version of AIC for smaller samples, but if you have small sample sizes you may want to run simulations based on what your goal is for your model to determine the best approach. This paper provides a pretty readable discussion of AIC and BIC for model selection: http://www.sortie-nd.org/lme/Statistical%20Papers/Burnham_and_Anderson_2004_Multimodel_Inference.pdf If you mean overfitting in the sense that your out of sample predictions are worse than optimal, then AIC may or may not penalize appropriately. From Applied Econometric Time Series by Enders: "forecasts using overly parsimonious models with little parameter uncertainty can provide better forecasts than models consistent with the actual data-generating process."
