We are using a tool (open source - saf.codeplex.com) to automate the Sharepoint components using MSBuild/Features/STSADM etc. Recently they have upgraded this to use WIX so that we can deploy any SharePoint components. saf.codeplex.com It has got an very good documentation and also we got a good support in fixing and implementing the SharePoint automated deployment in our premise.
