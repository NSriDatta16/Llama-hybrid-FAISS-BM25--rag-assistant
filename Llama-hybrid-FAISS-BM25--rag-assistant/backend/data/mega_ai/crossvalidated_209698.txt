I think the confusion is due to what exactly is meant here to be linear or non-linear. Using the notation of your quote, operation $w(X)$ maps a data matrix $X$ into a projector $P_k$ on the first $k$ principal axes of $X$. Let us be completely clear about the notation here; for simplicity let us fix $k=1$ and assume that $X$ is centered. Then $X\in\mathbb R^{n\times p}$ and $P\in \mathbb P^p \subset \mathbb R^{p\times p}$, where by $\mathbb P^p$ I mean the space of all matrices of the form $P=\mathbf{uu}^\top$ with $\mathbf u\in \mathbb R^p$ and $\|\mathbf u\|=1$. Now: Operation $w:\mathbb R^{n\times p} \to \mathbb P^p$ is non-linear. Operation $P:\mathbb R^p \to \mathbb R$ is linear. The quote talks about the $w(\cdot)$ function; it transforms a data matrix into a projection operator. It is non-linear. Your script investigates the $P(\cdot)$ function; it transforms a high-dimensional vector into a low-dimensional PCA projection, given a fixed dataset . It is linear. So $w(\cdot)$ is a non-linear mapping into linear projections. No contradiction.
