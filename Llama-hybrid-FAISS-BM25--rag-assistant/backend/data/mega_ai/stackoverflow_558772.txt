For something completely different, the best way to do Agile Development with Trac may be to simply migrate everything to Redmine . It supports Trac's core features with some extras including multiple projects, Gantt charts, forums, DCVS, etc. though it looks like it's not completely there yet . Some good things in the pipeline. Daniel Srb (in the comments) has a redmind agile plugin he's been working on that looks promising. You may be able to contact and see if he's planning to release it (was a long time ago). We've had success using two products in concert in the past, Trac for tickets, xplanner for planning.
