Previous comments about using a photo sensor are good suggestions, although they might be harder to find/make something that will plug into a USB port. If you do go the camera route, I'd suggest you emulate a simple sensor; perhaps take an average of the left and right halves of the input as an indication to drive straight/left/right. But, if you want to spend less time building the custom pieces, you might check out the LEGO NXT kit . They come with an optical sensor and a graphical programming environment. Even if you don't buy one, you might learn from the community discussions surrounding it. http://mindstorms.lego.com/nxtlog/projectlist.aspx?SearchText=castor http://www.nxtprograms.com/NXT2/castor_bot/steps.html
