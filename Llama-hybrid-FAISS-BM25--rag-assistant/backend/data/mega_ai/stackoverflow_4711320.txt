Elegantly alter a list of variables: Generalization of AddTo, TimesBy, etc

Suppose I've defined a list of variables {a,b,c} = {1,2,3} If I want to double them all I can do this: {a,b,c} *= 2 The variables {a,b,c} now evaluate to {2,4,6}. If I want to apply an arbitrary transformation function to them, I can do this: {a,b,c} = f /@ {a,b,c} How would you do that without specifying the list of variables twice? (Set aside the objection that I'd probably want an array rather than a list of distinctly named variables.)
