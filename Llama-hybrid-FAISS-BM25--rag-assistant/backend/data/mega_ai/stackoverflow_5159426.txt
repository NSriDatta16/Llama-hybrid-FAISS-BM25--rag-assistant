How to get support vectors and rho values from svm_model (in Python)?

After I get the svm_model from svm_train using libsvm, how do I get the rho and SVs from the model? I know that these values are printed out when I get the model, but I have no idea how to get the SVs. ex: svm_model = svmutil.svm_train(Labels,X, svm_options) Now, how to get the rho values and SVs from svm_model ?
