Factor Analysis in R with FAMD / PCA - Explained variance very low

I used a the FAMD algorithm of R on my own dataset. My dataset contains about 10 columns of numerical(float) data, 6 columns of one-hot-encoded data and 1 column with categorical data (zip codes) with a lot of unique string values(unique values>8000). I use the following code: res.famd This is pretty much their example from the tutorial website and it works fine, however my results are far from understandable. The problem is, when I print the scree plot, the cumulated percentage of explained variance is less than 0.5% for all features combined. I tried to increase component number, but this did not produce any changes in my results. I do not know the reason for this, but I suspect that the categorical zip codes, which are probably converted into some kind of scaled one-hot-encoded columns, distort the result? Maybe you can give me a hint, since I do not find much information on how to interprete these results - or maybe I just made a mistake in my code/dataset and you can help me out. best regards
