How can I manually add a root node in XGBoost tree(s)?

I have a binary feature {0, 1} and only when its value is 1 , I would like my XGBoost model to "evaluate" a set of trees. The goal is to save on prediction time by not evaluating a set of trees when the binary feature's value is 0 . So I was thinking if this feature is the root node of those trees, with rest of the tree being the subtree on the value of 1 of this feature, I may achieve my goal. Is it possible to tweak XGBoost model in such a way?
