Embedding numerical and categorical into one vector!

I have a set of features as follows: Where gift is categorical features and value of gift is value of the gift (numerical features). Both are the promotion. The objective is that I would like to forecast the sale for next day (or week). My idea is embedding gift and value of gift into one vector (I call: Promotional characteristics), then It will be the new feature. I will use this features and sale to forecast. Will my idea be correct and if possible, what is the technique to embedding gift and value of gift into one vectors?
