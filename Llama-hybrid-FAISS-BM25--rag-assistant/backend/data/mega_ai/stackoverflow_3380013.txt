UIWebView with Touch Event

I need to be able to catch touch events on a UIWebView and still be able to use the webview's contents (html links, etc...) I have subclassed UIWebView and implemented methods: - (UIView *)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; I am now able to catch touch events, but the view has become ususable :( I then tried to set the following on the webview object in my UIViewController, but that changed nothing. [webview setDelegate:self]; [webview setUserInteractionEnabled:YES]; Can anyone help? Do you need further info? Tia, S.
