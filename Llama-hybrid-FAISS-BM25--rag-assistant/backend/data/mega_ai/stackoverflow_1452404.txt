Any time you should use relative links for internal pages?

So, I know some software (like KompoZer, and probably some CMSs) will use relative links when linking to pages on the same site. Whereas, say you're writing a post with your free Blogger blog and you link to an older post, you're probably going to use an absolute link (because you just navigated to the old post and copied its full URI). So, what I'm really asking is, should you pay much attention to using relative links when appropriate? Or are there tools to make changing the URIs around when you so need that negate that habit?
