Counter-intuitive results from kpss test (Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin), on perfectly linear series

I would assume that a perfectly linear time series would exhibit trend-stationarity. This is not what I find when I use run this test in both Python and R. The KPSS test for stationarity around a trend suggests that the perfectly linear relationship is not stationary. Can someone please help me explain what I am missing? 1. Python from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import kpss # Running the KPSS test on the generated time series # Testing for stationarity around a trend (regression='ct') df = pd.DataFrame({'Time': x, 'value': y}) kpss(df.value, regression='ct') # Displaying the results kpss_stat, p_value, critical_values >>> KPSS Statistic: 6.170364219353778 p-value: 0.01 critical_values: {'10%': 0.119, '5%': 0.146, '2.5%': 0.176, '1%': 0.216} Result: **The series is not stationary** 2. In R, I get similar results library(tseries) # Create the time series x >>Result: **The series is not stationary**
