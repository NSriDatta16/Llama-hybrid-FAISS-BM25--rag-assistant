It is a semi-MDP because the process is Markovian at the level of decision points/epochs (at the level of the decisions over options) but not at the "flat" level. That is, if you don't observe the current choice of options along the trajectories and only see state-action pairs, that process won't be Markovian. It is "semi" in that sense. You can read Puterman 1994 chapter 8 for more background on SMDPs in the control literature.
