How to set Eclipse compiler level to 1.1

Hi I use Eclipse 3.4 Ganymade which uses JRE 1.4/1.5 alternatively. Now I have to use JDK1.1 for one of my application. As far as I know Eclipse uses JRE1.3 as the default level of compiler. Is there any way to work with JRE1.1. I had installed both JDK 1.1 and 1.4 as well.
