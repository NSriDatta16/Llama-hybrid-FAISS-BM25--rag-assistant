A wxs file is just XML. You can edit it in your application with any XML API. In .NET, you can do this by loading the file in a System.Xml.XmlDocument or System.Xml.Linq.XDocument . Alternatively, you can use the heat.exe tool included in wix to "harvest" (i.e. generate a wxs file for) individual files or an entire folder. This doesn't allow you to edit a wxs file exactly, but that is not a problem because a wix setup can consist of multiple wxs files. From the heat.exe documentation : Harvest a file heat file -ag -template:fragment -out file.wxs ".\My Files\File.dll" This will harvest the file "File.dll" as a single fragment to the file file.wxs. The component guid will be set to "*".
