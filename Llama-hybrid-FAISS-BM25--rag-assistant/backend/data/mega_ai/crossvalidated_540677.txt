Single Embedding Layer for Multiple Categorical columns?

I have 100 binary categorical columns to train a neural network model. Each row will be a vector-like [1,1,0,...1] of length 100. I fed this vector to a neural network for a classification problem and found its MRR score. Then I experimented by using an Embedding Layer. I did it by first converting each vector to tokens (Ex: [1,0,...] = 23, where 23 is the token) and providing it to the same neural network. I experimented with different embedding sizes, but the performance I get from using the embedding layer is lower than I got by feeding the raw muti-hot vector to a neural network. Why is this happening? If I set the embedding dimension to a larger size (>100), will it help?
