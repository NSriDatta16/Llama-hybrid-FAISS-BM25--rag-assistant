MS Access Application - Convert data storage from Access to SQL Server

Bear in mind here, I am not an Access guru. I am proficient with SQL Server and .Net framework. Here is my situation: A very large MS Access 2007 application was built for my company by a contractor. The application has been split into two tiers BY ACCESS; there is a front end portion that holds all of the Ms Access forms, and then on the back end part, which are access tables, queries, etc., that is stored on a computer on the network. Well, of course, there is a need to convert the data storage portion to SQL Server 2005 while keeping all of these GUI forms which were built in Ms Access. This is where I come in. I have read a little, and have found that you can link the forms or maybe even the access tables to SQL Server tables, but I am still very unsure on what exactly can be done and how to do it. Has anyone done this? Please comment on any capabilities, limitations, considerations about such an undertaking. Thanks!
