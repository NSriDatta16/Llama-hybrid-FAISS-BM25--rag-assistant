relational_database vs config_file vs spreadsheet usage

I have heard some genuine arguments for the use of relational database vs spreadsheet before. Relational database provides fast reporting and (relatively speaking) reliable data warehousing,where spreadsheets are lightweight, fast replicating, and easy to float around the organization to different audience. Although I notice the advantages of either, I can rarely distinguish what's better in which scenario, and always end up using database. In development, it's easy to forget to consider other options when one can place config settings in the database. I've ran into quite a few apps where user menus, work flows and their orders, and constants are defined in the database level. While this is good if these entities were subject to change by end user from application level, it was not the case. So, what's your take on the roles of databases, config files, and spread sheets?
