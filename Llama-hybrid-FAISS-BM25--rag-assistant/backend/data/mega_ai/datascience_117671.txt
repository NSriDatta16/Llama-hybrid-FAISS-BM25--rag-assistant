You can first create new features, if you believe they might have something to do with the occurrence of events - such as day of the week, weekend/work day, season, month. After you have created the new features, you want to run a classification model - Random Forest, XGB, LightGBM, KNN. Definitely try multiple models. You can also experiment with using less straightforward features - such as time passed from last event, number of previously occurred events on a specific object, whether neighboring ID-s have events, etc.
