R: Logistic Regression with L2-Penalty and output of coefficient significance

I'm trying to run a logistic regression with a L2-Penalty on a dataset I have. For the regression coefficient I also want to have the p-values of the signifance or at least the standard errors. My plan was to do it with Python but unfortunately none of the package fulfilled my needs. As I need a solution for this problem really quick, I thought to use R in this case. Unfortunately I don't have the time to read all about the package R offers, so I just liked to ask if there is any way to do the above mentioned in R?
