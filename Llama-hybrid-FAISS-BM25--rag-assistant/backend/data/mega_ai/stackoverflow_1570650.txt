Vertices selection and state of model after rotation

I'm currently writing an application that actually acts as a "cut" tool for 3D meshes. Well, I had some problems with it now which I am clueless on how to solve, since it is my first application. I have loaded a model from an object file onto the canvas, then on the same canvas, I use the mouse drag event to draw lines to define the cutting point. Let us say I want to cut a ball into half and I draw the line in the middle. How do I detect the vertices of the ball under the line. Secondly, if I rotate/translate the ball, would all the the vertices information change?
