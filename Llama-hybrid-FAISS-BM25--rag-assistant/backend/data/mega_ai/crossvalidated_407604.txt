KDE that better-preserves percentile distributions

My understanding is that a Gaussian KDE, because the kernel is symmetric, preserves the statistical mean of a distribution. For my particular case, I'd really prefer a KDE that preserved the median, or even better, the median and roughly the 1-sigma region. Is there a transformation or procedure for doing this? Here the red histogram is my data, and the blue curve is resampled using the gaussian KDE from the scipy python package (scipy.stats.gaussian_kde) , in log-space (i.e. I transform the x variable to log space, then the resampled values back to linear space). The vertical solid-lines are the averages, and match nicely. The vertical dashed lines are the percentiles corresponding to -1, 0, 1 standard deviations respectively --- and those are systematically biased. Over a large number of iterations the blue (KDE) median values (center dashed lines) are always significantly above the red (data) median values.
