University software courses often push people towards excessive commenting as a way of forcing students to think twice about what they have typed. A nasty rule-of-thumb that was put my way when I was marking undergrad coursework a few years ago suggested a comment every 5-10 lines. Think most Java courses tell you to limit methods to circa 30 lines, so lots of comments within a function is a sign you should break it up. My personal preference is to limit comments to documenting function purpose/inputs/outputs and data structures. Otherwise comments ought to be limited to things that require particular attention (eg things that looks out of place, perhaps bugs, at first glance).
