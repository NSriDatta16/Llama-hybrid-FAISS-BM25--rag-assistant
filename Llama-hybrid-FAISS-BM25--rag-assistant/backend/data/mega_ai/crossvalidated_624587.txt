Ensemble learning with models of different quality. Develop a voting method that takes accuracy, F1, recall, calibration of each model into account

Lets assume I have 24 random forest models. Each of 24 random forest models produces a class prediction. I am currently using simple majority voting to select final prediction. Can someone please guide me in the direction of other options that I can use? Specifically , weighted or using another model on top of this? I see that out of 24 random forests, some have quite bad recall and f1 scores, some are also really badly calibrated. Thus, I want to develop a voting method that takes this into consideration.
