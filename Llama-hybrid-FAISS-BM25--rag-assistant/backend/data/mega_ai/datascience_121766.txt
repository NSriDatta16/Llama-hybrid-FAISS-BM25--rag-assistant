Modeling the non-linear term $λ(s)$ in your equation using PyTorch can be approached as a parameter estimation or function approximation problem. Since you know the true solution for $λ(s)$ , you can use the generated data to train a neural network to approximate the non-linear term based on the given input and output values. To model $λ(s)$ using PyTorch, you can treat it as a learnable parameter in a neural network and train the network to approximate the true $λ(s) = sin(s) * cos(s)$ based on the given data. Instead of using a single input $s$ , you can use a concatenated input of $s$ and the corresponding solution values. This way, the model can learn the relationship between $λ(s)$ and the given solutions. Here's an example of how you can implement this using PyTorch: import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.optim as optim from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset # Define a custom dataset for the data class CustomDataset(Dataset): def __init__(self, data): self.data = data def __len__(self): return len(self.data) def __getitem__(self, idx): return self.data[idx] # Define a neural network to approximate λ(s) class Model(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super(Model, self).__init__() self.linear = nn.Linear(2, 1) # Input dimension is 2 (s and solution) def forward(self, x): return torch.sin(x[:, 0]) * torch.cos(x[:, 0]) + self.linear(x) # Prepare the data data = df.values # Include all columns dataset = CustomDataset(data) dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True) # Create the model and optimizer model = Model() optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001) criterion = nn.MSELoss() # Training loop num_epochs = 100 for epoch in range(num_epochs): for batch in dataloader: optimizer.zero_grad() inputs = batch[:, :-1] # Input data (exclude the last column) targets = batch[:, -1] # True λ(s) values (last column) outputs = model(inputs) loss = criterion(outputs.squeeze(), targets) loss.backward() optimizer.step() print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {loss.item()}") # Test the model test_input = torch.tensor([[1.0, 0.0]]) # An example input (s=1.0, solution=0.0) predicted_output = model(test_input) print(f"Predicted λ(s) for input s=1.0: {predicted_output.item()}") # Continue with your desired analysis or visualization using the predicted lambda values This code defines a custom dataset class, a neural network model with a linear layer, sets up the optimizer and loss function, and trains the model using the provided data. The model approximates the true $λ(s)$ by combining the learned linear term with the sin(s)cos(s) term. The input dimension of the model is now 2, consisting of s and the corresponding solution value. The model's linear layer is adjusted accordingly to accommodate the concatenated input.
