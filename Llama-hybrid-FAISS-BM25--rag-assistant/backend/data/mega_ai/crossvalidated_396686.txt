So there's a few options here: the code raises an exception because the shape is wrong; the code is semantically wrong and computes the wrong value but does not raise an exception; the code works correctly and the text simply mis-states the shape (equivalently, the code implements a different shape than stated in the text); both the text and the code are wrong. We know that logistic regression is just a transformation of a linear model. Therefore, we know that a linear combination of the features is correct. This implies that the code is correct given specific shapes for inputs, and also that the text is correct given a different specific shapes for inputs. Therefore, we can exclude (4). That leaves explanations (1), (2) or (3). I can't validate whether the code works correctly based on the content of the original post. If I had to place a bet, my money would be on option (3): the author wrote the code and the text separately, and never bothered to check whether the description matched the code. As you point out, one can rewrite a matrix-vector product using transposes -- it seems that the authors did so but their notation is sloppy.
