I kinda like the type field, actually. You could use the magic of single table inheritance , but it's well-known to be a fragile system that, surprise, includes a type field, anyway. And then you could use the polymorphism solution, but seems a bit silly to have four different tables to represent almost exactly the same thing. Honestly, using a simple type field and changing the interpretation based on that will probably give you the best results and fewest headaches. As far as what you'd do in your template goes, that you can probably play by ear. One clean solution might be a simple helper to call like snippet_content which, based on the type field, will call the helper snippet_content_text or snippet_content_image or snippet_content_code or snippet_content_video . Or you can just do the if-then branching in the template, or refer to any number of partial templates (though be careful with that, since those can get slow when used unnecessarily).
