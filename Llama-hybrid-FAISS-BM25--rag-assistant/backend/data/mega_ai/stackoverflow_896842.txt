Change position of currency selector in Magento

Currently, the currency selector is at the top, here’s my development site: http://nordschleife.metaforix.net/118/118/index.php/kyocera.html However, I would like to switch the currency selector to just under “Price” heading of the table. I tried echo $this->getCurrency(); but there’s nothing. I guess I need some method like getCurrencyHtml() , but it seems that there’s no such a method. Or must I edit layout files, and how should I go about doing this?
