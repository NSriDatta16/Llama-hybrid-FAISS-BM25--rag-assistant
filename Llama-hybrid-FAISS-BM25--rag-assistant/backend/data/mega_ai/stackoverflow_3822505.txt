I know this is a bit more of a comment than an answer to your issue, but I'm putting this in an answer because I can't comment yet. It would really help if you could narrow down the place in your function where it hangs. Although adding print functions/statements will change the state of memory slightly it could be worth a try here, as a likely source of hanging is the network calls you are making. Also - sounds simple, but are you sure that you are on the network and able to access the Google storage site?
