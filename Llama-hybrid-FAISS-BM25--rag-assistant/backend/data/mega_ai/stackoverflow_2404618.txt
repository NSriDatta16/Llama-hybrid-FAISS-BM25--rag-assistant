If you have 2 different Default.png files, you should be able to specify explicitly which one of them each target should copy to the application bundle. If you expand a target in Xcode, there should be 3 subcategories where one of them defines all resources that are copied. This is the category that should contain the desired Default.png. Delete it from both your targets, and then drag each Default.png into the appropriate target to make sure they both reference the correct file. Drag is ok but be careful to: uncheck "Copy items into destination group's folder" select "Relative to Enclosing Group" select the appropriate target when adding the resource. Is it right?
