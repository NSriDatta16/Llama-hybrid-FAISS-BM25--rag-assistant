Yes - if you want to accurately benchmark "DO STUFF" then you shouldn't take into account disk IO also. So one thing you could do is buffer the whole file into memory, and then process it and time that. But if the file is too large or it would make your line handler more difficult, another thing you could do is read the file into memory line by line 10 times or so WITHOUT processing, average the times, and then time the function the way you have it now (including processing and disk I/O), and then subtract the average disk-reading time from the total time. Edit: I don't know why I didn't think of this before, but you could also just put a timer around the execution of "DO STUFF" and add to a sum after each execution.
