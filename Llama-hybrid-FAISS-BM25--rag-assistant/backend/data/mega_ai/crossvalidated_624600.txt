The two processes are not identical. Your ARIMA(1,1,0) is $BY_t=0.3BY_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$ , using the backshift operator $BY_t=Y_t-Y_{t-1}$ , or $Y_t=1.3Y_{t-1}-0.3Y_{t-2}+\epsilon_t$ , and the AR(1) is just $Y_t=1.3Y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$ , without a $Y_{t-2}$ term. This implies that the second model indeed explodes. For instance, if I try to simulate it using R's arima.sim() , I get an error: Can a Non-Stationary ARIMA Series Be Simulated Using arima.sim in R? In contrast, your ARIMA(1,1,0) model yields well-behaved time series that do not explode. Here are 20 simulations for your ARIMA(1,1,0) model: Compare to 20 simulations for your nonstationary AR(1) model: R code: n_rows
