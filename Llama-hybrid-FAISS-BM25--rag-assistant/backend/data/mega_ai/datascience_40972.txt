NEAT XOR Example gives different results at each run

I have just started learn to use NEAT algorithm. I was thinking I understood the basics of NEAT when I read "Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies" paper and current python documentation. However, in practice I m in trouble. I have run XOR examples from source ( https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python.git ). However, when I run any of "evolve-feedforward.py", "evolve-feedforward-parallel.py" or "evolve-minimal" codes more than once, results are changing. For instance, When I run "evolve-feeedforward.py" it gives : 1 when I run same code for second time, it gives: 2 and it changes with each run. I have also deleted generated neat-checkpoint files before each run, but structure still changes. I would like to understand reason what cause this, I think I m missing some essential points here.
