What I tend to do is have a separate test project complete with it's own bindings -- I'm of course assuming that we're talking about unit tests of some sort. The test project uses its own kernel and loads the module in the test project into that kernel. The tests in the project are executed during CI builds and by full builds executed from a build script, though the tests are never deployed into production. I realize your project/solution setup may not allow this sort of organization, but it seems to be pretty typical from what I've seen.
