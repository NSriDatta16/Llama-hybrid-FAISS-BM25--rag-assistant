Netbeans Profile JUnit 4 problem

I have a unit test that takes 200 sec to run. I am trying to use NetBeans profiler to speed it up. But the profiler doesn't run the unit test. It just creates an object of the test and exits. Doesn't run the actual test methods or @Before / @After methods. This is a maven project with surefire and junit 4. And partial output is below. Profiler Agent: Waiting for connection on port 5140, timeout 10 seconds (Protocol version: 9) Profiler Agent: Established local connection with the tool ------------------------------------------------------- T E S T S ------------------------------------------------------- Running com.cris.puzzle.solvers.SudokuSolverTest Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.031 sec Results : Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0 Profiler Agent: Connection with agent closed Profiler Agent: Connection with agent closed Profiler Agent: Initializing... Profiler Agent: Options: >C:/Program Files/NetBeans 6.8/profiler3/lib,5140,10 Does anyone know how to make it work? Thank you.
