The use of the phrase "upper and lower confidence bounds" to describe the "90% margin of error" in your cited source suggests that it is referring to 90% confidence limits. The explanation in the citation, however, is incorrect; see this page for extensive discussion of what frequentist confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals actually represent. If the data are from a normal distribution then the median provides an estimate of the population mean. The confidence interval, however, depends on the size of the sample. If you only had 2 cases in your sample the confidence interval around the mean would be very wide. If you had 2000 cases in your sample then it would be quite narrow. So the "90% margin of error" doesn't provide information about the width of the distribution in the population unless you also know the size of the sample. Thus the answer by Michael Grogan describes how you can proceed with your analysis. You need to know the sample size, too.
