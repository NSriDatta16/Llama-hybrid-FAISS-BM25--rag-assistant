I personally think the following is the most elegant solution. I am not sure why I didn't get that in the first place - I initially was using the bloodshed c++ compiler and it seemed to fail - but g++ this is cleanest? If people disagree with me, I'll remove my answer and give it to someone else. Note that the A* actually means A* but is note required template const A& operator=( A & rhs) { std::cout (&rhs)) m_t = rhs.get(); return *this; }
