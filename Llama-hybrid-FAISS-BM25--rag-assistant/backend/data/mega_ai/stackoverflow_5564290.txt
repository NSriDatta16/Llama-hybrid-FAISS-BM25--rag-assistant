It all depends on how much effort you go to; for example, you could enable database failover, which tends to be expensive (second server, license, etc) but has a very quick recovery onto the pair. You could code your app to do something either in-memory (which gets tricky if your app recycles), or to an independent store. The most common choice here is pragmatic: we need a DB (whether that is sql, nosql, or whatever; some central data repository); if the DB server goes offline, so does the app. You should be looking to have very good uptime on your DB tier; your time would be better spent trying to see how to improve that uptime. Another choice for read only applications would be to keep a copy of the DB on each app-tier server, and update incrementally. When the app server is up, so (generally) is the local DB.
