I strongly recommend you to go to http://www.adobe.com/devnet/f4v.html and download the FLV/F4V specification made freely available by Adobe. Using the techniques I described in my answer you linked at, you should be able to achieve your goal. Be careful however when trying to join files with different codecs, since the resulting file has good chances to confuse the flash player, or even not playing at all past the junction point. Otherwise, I don't really understand your goal. If you plan to put a file's audio track into another file, I would really discourage you from doing it in PHP, but instead using video tools such as ffmpeg. If you're stuck with PHP, you should probably read both files concurrently, synchronizing via each tag's timestamp, reading the first file's video, and the second file's audio, combining tags by temporal order into a third new file.
