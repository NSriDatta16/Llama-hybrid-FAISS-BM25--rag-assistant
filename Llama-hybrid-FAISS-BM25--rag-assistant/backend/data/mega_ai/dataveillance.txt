Dataveillance is the practice of monitoring and collecting online data as well as metadata. The word is a portmanteau of data and surveillance. Dataveillance is concerned with the continuous monitoring of users' communications and actions across various platforms. For instance, dataveillance refers to the monitoring of data resulting from credit card transactions, GPS coordinates, emails, social networks, etc. Using digital media often leaves traces of data and creates a digital footprint of our activity. Unlike sousveillance, this type of surveillance is not often known and happens discreetly. Dataveillance may involve the surveillance of groups of individuals. There exist three types of dataveillance: personal dataveillance, mass dataveillance, and facilitative mechanisms. Unlike computer and network surveillance, which collects data from computer networks and hard drives, dataveillance monitors and collects data (and metadata) through social networks and various other online platforms. Dataveillance is not to be confused with electronic surveillance. Electronic surveillance refers to the surveillance of oral and audio systems such as wire tapping. Additionally, electronic surveillance depends on having suspects already presumed before surveillance can occur. On the other hand, dataveillance can use data to identify an individual or a group. Oftentimes, these individuals and groups have sparked some form of suspicion with their activity. Dataveillance has significant impacts on advertising theory and practice. These impacts particularly stem from recent infrastructure and technological advancements that increase the extent to which advertisers can gain data information about consumers and their behaviours. For example, collecting data can be extended into collecting consumersâ€™ offline behaviors and to places that are considered private. Types The types of dataveillance are separated by the way data is collected, as well as the number of individuals associated with it. Personal Dataveillance: Personal dataveillance refers to the collection and monitoring of a person's personal data. Personal dataveillance can occur when an individual's data causes a suspicion or has attracted attention in some way. Personal data can include information such as birth date, address, social security (or social insurance) number, as well as other unique identifiers. Mass Dataveillance: Refers to the collection of data on groups of people. The general distinction between mass dataveillance and personal dataveillance is the surveillance and collection of data as a group rather than an individual. Facilitative Mechanisms: Unlike mass dataveillance a group is not targeted. An individual's data is placed into a system or database along with various others where computer matching can unveil distinct patterns. An individual's data is never considered to part of a group in this instance. Benefits and concerns Pros There are many concerns and benefits associated with dataveillance. Dataveillance can be useful for collecting and verifying data in ways that are beneficial. For instance, personal dataveillance can be utilized by financial institutions to track fraudulent purchases on credit card accounts. This has the potential to prevent and regulate fraudulent financial claims and resolve the issue. Compared to traditional methods of surveillance, dataveillance tends to be an economical approach, since it can monitor more information in a less time. In this case, the responsibility of monitoring is transferred to computers, therefore reducing time and human labor in the process of surveilling. Dataveillance has also been useful in assessing security threats associated with terrorism. Authorities have utilized dataveillance to help them understand and predict potential terrorist or criminal threats. Dataveillance is very important to the concept of predictive policing. Since predictive policing requires a great deal of data to operate effectively and datave
