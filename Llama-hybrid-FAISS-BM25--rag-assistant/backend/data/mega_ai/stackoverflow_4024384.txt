The reason is that most of the time, you want a constant, not a const -qualified variable. The two are not remotely the same in the C language. For example, variables are not valid as part of initializers for static -storage-duration objects, as non-vla array dimensions (for example the size of an array in a structure, or any array pre-C99).
