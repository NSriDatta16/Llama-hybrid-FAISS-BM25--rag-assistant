How do you implement an ASP.NET role provider?

I've got a few top-level questions about ASP.NET Membership and Role providers. I've done some searching but am having a hard time finding some layman tutorials. I have been coding in ASP.NET for a while now but the only real experience I have with authentication is the use of FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(usernameFromDatabase, false); When I use the SetAuthCookie() method above am I using the ASP.NET Membership Provider? Correct me if I'm wrong please but I don't think I am. I am just setting an authentication cookie right? I usually implement my own custom methods in my data repositories like GetUser_ByUsername(string username) which then talks to the ORM and gets the right user. Do the Membership and Role Providers have their own data storage? What if I want to use my own data storage? Do I need to implement my own membership/role provider, and how would one go about doing that? Or is my way of just setting the auth cookie and then using my own retrieval methods, etc, the best way of doing a custom membership/role provider? I'm just looking for a brief tutorial/explanation of this system. If you have any good references for me to look at I will happily take a look :)
