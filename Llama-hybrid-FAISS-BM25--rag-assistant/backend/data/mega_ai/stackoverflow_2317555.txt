It looks like you've got a UITableViewController, not a UIViewController. Your table view is intercepting and handling touches before they make it up to your view controller. You'll need to subclass UITableView, override it's -touchesBegan:withEvent: method, and then create a standard UIViewController that adds your new subclass to the view hierarchy.
