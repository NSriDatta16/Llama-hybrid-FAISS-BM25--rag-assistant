Different ways to understand neural networks

I have come across a few main ways of understanding neural networks. Neural networks as neurons with synapses. Neural networks as probabilistic inference machines. (Bayes, information etc) Neural networks as transformations on data. (similar to the matrix transforms you see in graphics) Neural networks as aggregations of experts (also called features). (each node is some sort of expert, wisdom of crowds etc..) Neural networks as a player in a game with nature. Where nature is an adversary trying to get the NN to make as many mistakes as possible Are there other ways to think about what neural networks?? What are they?
