Does Bayesian Statistics have no concept of statistical hypothesis testing?

I was told that the framework of Bayesian Statistics has no concept of statistical hypothesis testing or confidence intervals. How does this make sense? Bayesian statistics only says that we iteratively update our prior belief based on evidence. Consider the following example I got from my textbook where we use Bayesian statistics to model the behaviour of some variable C. t e [0, 20] C ~ Poi(lambda) lambda = { lambda1, if t>10; lambda2, otherwise } lambda1 ~ exp(alpha1) lambda2 ~ exp(alpha2) Run MCMC to compute posteriors of lambda1 and lambda 2 The parameter lambda takes on two different behaviours: one before 10 seconds and another after 10 seconds. Now we'll do a t-test on to check whether the distributions of lambda1 are statistically different from lambda2 to check whether these two distributions are indeed different. I do not know whether doing this t-test makes sense, I was told we cannot do statistical testing in a Bayesian framework. We are supposed to use visualizations and reject them ourselves. Can anyone confirm whether this is true? Is statistical testing invalid from a Bayesian perspective?
