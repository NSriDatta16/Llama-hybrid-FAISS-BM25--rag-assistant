I will let others on this forum answer your question, but wanted to comment on something that you may find useful. If you are ultimately interested in the "main" effects of A and B, then you should consider using the Anova() function from the car package of R with the appropriate type option for your setting, which will be a choice among type II or type III. This function would need to be applied to your fit2 model, which includes an interaction between A and B. If you simply apply the anova function to your coxme model (note the lowercase a in its name), you will end up performing a type I (or sequential) anova, which is not what you need. This nice post explains why you may want to consider a type III anova in your case (though ultimately you have to decide what makes most sense for your setting): https://towardsdatascience.com/anovas-three-types-of-estimating-sums-of-squares-don-t-make-the-wrong-choice-91107c77a27a?gi=25c0f9e695cc The post is titled ANOVA’s three types of estimating Sums of Squares: don’t make the wrong choice! and is written by Joos Korstanje for Towards Data Science . The R commands you would therefore need are: library(car) Anova(fit2, type = "III") Note: Another nice post is https://mcfromnz.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/anova-type-iiiiii-ss-explained/ . P.S. Can you list all estimated coefficients for your output? Some are missing.
