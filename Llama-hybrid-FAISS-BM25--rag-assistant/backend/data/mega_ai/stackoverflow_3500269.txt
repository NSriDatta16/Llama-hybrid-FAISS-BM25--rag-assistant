I think you should not do this with a for loop. The code you posted will go to the db for every single active mediatype twice to get Count() and additionally, twice to get actual results. Checking the Count() property is not necessary: concatenating empty result sets has no additional effect. Furthermore, I think what you're trying to achieve can be done with a single query, something along the lines of (not tested): // build up the query var rootTypes = _db.MediaTypes.Where(e => e.int_MediaTypeId != 1 && e.int_MediaTypeId_FK == null); var activeChildren = _db.MediaTypes .Where(e => e.bit_IsActive); var activeChildrenForOrganization = _db.MediaTypes .Where(e => e.int_OrganizationId == Authorization.OrganizationID && e.bit_IsActive); var q = from types in rootTypes join e in activeChildren on types.int_MediaTypeId equals e.int_MediaTypeId_FK into joined1 join e in activeChildrenForOrganization on types.int_MediaTypeId equals e.int_MediaTypeId_FK into joined2 select new {types, joined1, joined2}; // evaluate the query and concatenate the results. // This will only go to the db once return q.ToList().SelectMany(x => x.joined1.Concat(x.joined2));
