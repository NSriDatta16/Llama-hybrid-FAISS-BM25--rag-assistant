Can I apply PCA to combine correlated variables into one variable?

I have a dataset with 11 observations and 11 features. I want to use linear regression for estimating the coefficients by using OLS method. I know it is not advisable to use linear regression with such a big number of features, comparing with the number of records. I have about 6 features that are highly correlated (correlation > 0.88). But I don't want to delete these columns, as I can loose information. So can I use PCA on these 6 highly correlated features to transform them into one column? Then, I want to combine this column with other features and use linear regression.
