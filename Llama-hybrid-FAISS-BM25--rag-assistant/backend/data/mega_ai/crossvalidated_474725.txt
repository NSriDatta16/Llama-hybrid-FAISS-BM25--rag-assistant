It is not that one-hot encoding "helps with performance". One-hot encoding for categorical variables is necessary , at least for algorithms like logistic regression, as you can learn from the Why do we need to dummy code categorical variables thread. If you have big number of categories, there are some alternatives or ways of making one-hot encodings more managable. If memory usage is the problem, you can use sparse data structure for storing such data. If number of categories is a problem , you can reduce the number of categories by collapsing them , or using hashing trick , i.e. use hash function to "randomly" map them to lower number of categories. Alternatively, you can use target encoding , where you replace the category labels with mean of the target variable.
