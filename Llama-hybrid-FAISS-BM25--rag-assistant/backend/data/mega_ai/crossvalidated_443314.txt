Testing for normality in SPSS: Procedure for two or more independent variables WITHOUT levels/groups

In order to do a linear regression, I need to test my data set for normality. I have one dependent variable plus three independent variables. The independent variables are all scale variables, i.e. without any groups/levels (e.g. male/female). How do I test for normality in SPSS? Unfortunately, I can only find procedures that describe what to do if the independent variables have different groups/levels. In such a case, it seems you have to establish normality for all separate combinations of the groups/levels of the independent variables by splitting the file and organizing the output by the different groups/levels. See this instruction video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiedOyglLn0 . But what if my variables don't have any groups/levels?
