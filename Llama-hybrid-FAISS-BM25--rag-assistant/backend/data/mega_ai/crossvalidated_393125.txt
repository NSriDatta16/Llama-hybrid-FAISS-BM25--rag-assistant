Measure of randomness that maps well to "hard to guess"?

It was recently pointed out to me that entropy does not necessarily map well to "hard to guess". E.g.: consider a distribution where there's a very high (say, 90%) chance you select a single, specific value, and otherwise you draw from some other high entropy distribution (say, generating 1024 bits uniformly randomly). Such a distribution can have arbitrarily high entropy (in the case above, ~103 bits I believe) despite the odds of an attacker guessing in one try also being arbitrarily high (in the case above, 90%). Is there some other measure of randomness to use that better captures this sense of "hard to guess"? Some things I thought of were: Maximum information content instead of expected value. But this feels like it would treat distributions as equal too aggressively. Median information content. But this also seems like it might be possible to "game". Directly measuring something closer to what I care about, like "average number of guesses an attacker would need to make". But this seems difficult to compute, and I was hoping for something simpler.
