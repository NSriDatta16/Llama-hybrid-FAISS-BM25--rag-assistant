I'd modify the application to pick up the files from a specific location (e.g. specific folder on a filesystem) rather than specifying each file on the command line. UPDATE: If the requirement is to be able to drag an item onto an .exe via Windows Explorer to start the application as Mark mentioned then you could put all of your files into one folder and drop the entire folder on the .exe.
