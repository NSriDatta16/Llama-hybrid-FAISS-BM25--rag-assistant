Is there a name for the midpoint of a sum (not a mean or median)?

I have a set of purchases with $ values like this: {1, 1, 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 10, 20, 20}. Sum: 80. Mean: 8. I had thought that if you split this into equal sums (of 40), this would occur at the mean (8). In fact you have to split at a different point in the set: {1, 1, 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 10}, {20, 20}. Clearly I was incorrect that this was a property of means, and this point isn't the median either, but I feel this is an average of some basic kind, as I'm splitting the data into two equal halves. Is there a name for this? Is this one example of something analogous to, but not quite, percentiles?
