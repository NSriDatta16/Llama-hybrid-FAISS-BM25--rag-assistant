I would move the IIF conditions to the where clause and make the ProductCode high and low restrictions and the new values into parameters. Then run the query 19 times in code with different parameters. If you had a SQL Server back end, there would be a more elegant way to do this, but for a pure Access solution you'll have better luck keeping the query logic simple and making up the difference with some VBA code.
