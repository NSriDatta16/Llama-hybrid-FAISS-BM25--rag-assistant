run programs on the client..... without adding a psedo server on the client You cannot have the cake and eat it too. If you need to command another host to execute a program then the other host need to have some process that listens for the command. So the question boils down to finding the most lightweight or simplest solution. The simplest solution would be to use shared folders for listing files and copying files and to use RMI for executing remote programs. More complex options involve developing a Distributed Agent using tools like JADE , using messaging middle-wares,say,JMS or using multi-casting tools like jGroups . PS: Developing a custom SNMP agent and manager might also work
