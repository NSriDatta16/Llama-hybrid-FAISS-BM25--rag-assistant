What is the safest way to run an executable on Linux?

I am trying to run a program compiled from C code from an unknown source. I want to make sure that the program does not harm my system in anyway. Like for instance, the program might have soemthing like system("rm -rf /") in the source, which is un-detectable, unless the code is thoroughly examined. I thought of the following 2 ways Run it inside a VM like VMWare Build a windows exe on linux and run on wine Both are not very elegant solutions and I cannot automate them. and also, in case of 1, it can harm the VM. Any help would be appreciated. I want to run the program in what we can call a "sandbox".
