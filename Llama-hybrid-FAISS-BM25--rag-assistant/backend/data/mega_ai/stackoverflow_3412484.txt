Consider downloading the Natural Language Toolkit ( NLTK ). Then you can create sentences that will not break for things like "U.S.A." or fail to split sentences that end in "?!". >>> import nltk >>> paragraph = u"Hi, this is my first sentence. And this is my second. Yet this is my third." >>> sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(paragraph) [u"Hi, this is my first sentence.", u"And this is my second.", u"Yet this is my third."] Your code becomes much more readable. To access the second sentence, you use notation you're used to. >>> sentences[1] u"And this is my second."
