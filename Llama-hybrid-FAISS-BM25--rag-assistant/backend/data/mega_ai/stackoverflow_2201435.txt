I note that your method does not do everything that a "using" statement does. For example, it does not introduce a new local variable declaration space in which a variable that holds on to the resource may be declared. Nor does it allow for multiple disposable resources of the same type to be declared all at one go. And finally, it does not seem to compose particularly elegantly with itself. One of the nice things about "using" as a statement is that you can say: using(something) using(someotherthing) using(somethirdthing) { use all three, they'll all get disposed } How would that look in your proposal? something.Using( x=>someotherthing.Using( y=>somethirdthing.Using( z=> { use all three } ))); A bit gross, frankly.
