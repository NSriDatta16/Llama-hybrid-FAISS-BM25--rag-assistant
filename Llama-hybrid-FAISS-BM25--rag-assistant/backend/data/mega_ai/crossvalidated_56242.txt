Here are the (signed) square roots of the individual cell contributions to chi-square, essentially Pearson residuals for a Poisson model. They're not actually z-scores (they're on average a bit smaller - your $z^2$'s are probably actual squares of z scores). > (a$observed-a$expected)/sqrt(a$expected) x1 x2 [1,] 2.1528248 -0.36534648 [2,] 2.0825076 -0.35341325 [3,] 0.2045836 -0.03471899 [4,] -0.8535520 0.14485258 We see - exactly as you suggested - the first two categories in the first variable seem to be what's "causing" significance. Those values are slightly "unusually" large, while none of the others are.
