One small tip here: Two of your variables ( total floor area and number of floors ) have a direct causal relationship that will make them strongly correlated. In order to reduce this collinearity I recommend you change the first variable to look at average area per floor instead of total area. This change in the input variables will allow you to decompose the effects of the number of floors and the area-per-floor more easily and will make the output of your model easier to interpret. You can also add an interaction term between these variables and if you do it will decompose the relationships more sensibly.
