The first thing to do is to reorganize the data in a way which suits the problem that you're trying to solve: since the goal is to predict the number of each type of vehicle by month, your data should contain a column for this number. Here you need to count the number of rows for each month and each type of vehicle so that you obtain something like this: v_type district month number Advanced District 1 jan 1 General District 1 jan 2 Advanced District 2 jan 0 General District 2 jan 3 Advanced District 1 feb 2 General District 1 feb 3 ... After that you will probably need to represent the month (and year) in a way that a regression algorithm can use, typically an integer starting at month 1.
