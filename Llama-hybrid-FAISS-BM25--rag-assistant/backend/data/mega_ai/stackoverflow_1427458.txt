Removing the status bar in my app

I'm making an small game for iPhone in openGL. First I removed the "status bar" by writting [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES]; Which worked, but only removed the status bar when my app began to run. Then I modified my project.plist UIStatusBarHidden And now the status bar is never show, just how I wanted. The problem is that I'm reading touches without problem in any portion of the screen, except for the zone where the status bar used to be. // This method deals with events when one or more fingers touch the screen - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [myProject newTouch:touches withEvent:event]; [self.nextResponder touchesEnded: touches withEvent:event]; } // This method deals with events when one or more fingers moves while touching the screen - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [myProject movingTouch:touches withEvent:event ]; } // This method deals with events when one or more fingers stops touching the screen - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [myProject oldTouchEnded:touches withEvent:event ]; } // This method deals with events when the system is interrupted ( for example an incomming call) - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // } I guess that hiding the bar is not enough and it must be removed, but how can I do it ?, or there Is another solution ?
