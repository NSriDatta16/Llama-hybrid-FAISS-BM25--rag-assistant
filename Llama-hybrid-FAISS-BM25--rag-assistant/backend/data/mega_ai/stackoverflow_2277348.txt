WYSIWYG image uploads in Rails App

Can anyone recommend a way of creating a view where users can upload images to my app through a WYSIWYG editor? I've tried solving this using CK Editor and Paperclip but am having lots of trouble... Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. If someone's done this before I'd really like to know how! I don't have a editor or file storage mechanism preference so fire away...
