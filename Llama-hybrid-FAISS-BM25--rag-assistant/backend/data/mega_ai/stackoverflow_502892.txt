MySQL has pluggable storage systems. That means that engine can use different storages. It currently has 5-6 of them that you can use. And since it's open source, you can see how it is done. SQLite uses it's own B-Tree implementation with journaling. Open source - you can look at it. Firebird and Interbase are using B-Trees with multi-record versioning systems for storage. Firebird is open source. Worth looking. Can't tell for Oracle , MS SQL Server or other proprietary database systems, since they keep storage information secret.
