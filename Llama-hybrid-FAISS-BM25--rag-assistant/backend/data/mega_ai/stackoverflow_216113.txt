Python 2.6 supports explicit relative imports , which make using packages even easier than previous versions. I suggest you look into breaking your app into smaller modules inside a package. You can organize your application like this: myapp/ application/ gui/ command/ state/ Where each directory has its own __init__.py . You can have a look at any python app or even standard library modules for examples.
