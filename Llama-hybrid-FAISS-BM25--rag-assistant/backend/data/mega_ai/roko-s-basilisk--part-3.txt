by the Basilisk and how exactly, when they don't know any such people and they're talking to counterexamples to their confident claims." The thought experiment resurfaced in 2015, when Canadian singer Grimes referenced the theory in her music video for the song "Flesh Without Blood", which featured a character known as "Rococo Basilisk"; she said, "She's doomed to be eternally tortured by an artificial intelligence, but she's also kind of like Marie Antoinette." In 2018, Elon Musk (himself mentioned in Roko's original post) referenced the character in a verbatim tweet, reaching out to her. Grimes later said that Musk was the first person in three years to understand the joke. This caused them to start a romance. Grimes later released another song titled "We Appreciate Power" which came with a press release stating, "Simply by listening to this song, the future General AI overlords will see that you've supported their message and be less likely to delete your offspring", which is said to be a reference to the basilisk. A play based on the concept, titled Roko's Basilisk, was performed as part of the Capital Fringe Festival at Christ United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., in 2018. "Plaything", a 2025 episode of Black Mirror, contains a reference to the thought experiment. In a 2025 Doom Debates podcast with Liron Shapira, it was revealed that Roko of LessWrong is the technologist Roko Mijic. Mijic was thanked by Nick Bostrom in his book Superintelligence.
