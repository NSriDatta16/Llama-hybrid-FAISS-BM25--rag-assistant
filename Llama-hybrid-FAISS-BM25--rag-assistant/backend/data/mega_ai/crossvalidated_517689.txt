Logistic regression using a predictor that's part of the outcome

Say I have 2 continuous variables measuring the same thing (e.g., at-home blood pressure monitor and in-office blood pressure cuff with in-office measurements being the gold standard). At a cut-off of BP > 130, we would consider a person hypertensive. However, because in-office measurements are more troublesome to do, we want to see how often at-home blood pressure monitors misclassify hypertension. So, my outcome is if both measurements agree at the threshold of 130 (if one is 130, then the outcome = 1 (disagree) and if both are > 130 or both are I'm a bit unsure since it seems like we'd be using a variable that is part of the outcome as a predictor.
