Variance is the mean of squared deviations from the mean. Analyzing variance tests, the hypothesis that the means of two or more populations are equal. Bias versus variance trade-off Every model has both bias and variance error components in addition to white noise. Bias and variance are inversely related to each other; while trying to reduce one component, the other component of the model will increase. The ideal model will have both low bias and low variance An example of a high bias model is logistic or linear regression, in which the fit of the model is merely a straight line and may have a high error component due to the fact that a linear model could not approximate underlying data well. An example of a high variance model is a decision tree, in which the model may create too much wiggly curve as a fit, in which even a small change in training data will cause a drastic change in the fit of the curve.
