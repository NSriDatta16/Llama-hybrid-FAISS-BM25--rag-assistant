Model Selection Logistic Regression: Wald vs LRT

To select a model I use stepwise with the likelihood ratio test but I have seen that people use the z test (the one that appears in R when obtaining the summary) to include the variable with the lowest p-value and discard the one with the highest p-value. My question is, is this procedure correct? Thank you for your answers.
