From my experience with Nintex Workflows, it integrates really well into SharePoint and would work in a hierarchical company organization structure. If Active Directory is correctly set to indicate "bosses", "subordinates", etc, this information can be used within the workflow. For instance, "Send this workflow to my boss", followed by "send it to his boss", would be simple to program, since that information would be available from Active Directory. Depending on what is needed, standard OOB SharePoint and Nintex can be used together to produce amazing workflows. One of the major advantages of using Nintex Workflows is that it can be used without programming. However, if programmers are available, additional logic can be added to augment a workflow (such as event-level programming).
