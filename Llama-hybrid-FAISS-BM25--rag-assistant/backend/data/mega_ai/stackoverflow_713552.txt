Zend_Session lost when using regenerateId()

I've had this problem in a couple of ZF applications now and it's very frustrating: Near the top of my bootstrap I have the following two lines Zend_Session::start(); Zend_Session::regenerateId(); My application requires authentication using Zend_Auth and uses default session storage for persisting an identity. At random the session is lost giving the effect that the user has logged out. If I remove the call to Zend_Session::regenerateId() the session is not lost. Regenerating the session id increases security so I'd like to get this working. This problem occurs on both my local development server (windows) and our staging server (linux)
