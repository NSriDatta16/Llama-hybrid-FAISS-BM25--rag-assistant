There's also a cool thing called ELMAH that will log any ASP.NET errors that occur in a web application. I know you're asking about a Winform App solution, but I felt this could be beneficial to anyone needing this type of thing on a web app. We use it where I work and it's been very helpful in debugging (especially on production servers!) Here's some features that it has (pulled right off the page): Logging of nearly all unhandled exceptions. A web page to remotely view the entire log of recoded exceptions. A web page to remotely view the full details of any one logged exception. In many cases, you can review the original yellow screen of death that ASP.NET generated for a given exception, even with customErrors mode turned off. An e-mail notification of each error at the time it occurs. An RSS feed of the last 15 errors from the log. A number of backing storage implementations for the log, including in-memory, Microsoft SQL Server and several contributed by the community.
