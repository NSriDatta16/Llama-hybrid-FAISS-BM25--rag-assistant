Generate new images based on a dataset of images

Is it possible take a training set of one million 120 x 120 pixel tiles, feed these tiles into a machine learning algorithm. And then make it synthesize images that look like the original training set with a certain, adjustable level of entropy? What ML techniques should I consider?
