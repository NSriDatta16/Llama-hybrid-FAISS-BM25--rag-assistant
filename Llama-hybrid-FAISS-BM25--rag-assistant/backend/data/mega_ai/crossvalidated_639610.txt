I generally agree with what has already been written in the other answers and comments, so instead of echoing what has been said, here is my hot take (which is too long to be a comment). I recall from writing Actually Modelling the Data I came across this lovely quote: Quotation (as cited in Sundberg 1994 ) Most real-life statistical problems have one or more nonstandard features. There are no routine statistical questions, only questionable statistical routines. This quote is attributed to J.M. Hammersley in a footnote of Sundberg 1994. It is also attributed to D.R. Cox here where I found the same link to Sundbergâ€™s paper. What I've learned from doing data analysis myself, learning from McElreath's Statistical Rethinking lectures, and reading Bayesian Workflow , is that quote is correct. Many novices are not aware of how much iteration can be involved in a seemingly-simple modelling task. It is routine for professionals to have to learn more about their problem as they attempt to solve it, so transferable processes and principles are often more valuable than a flow chart of simple recipes. Recipes can show what analyses can look like, but to me this is just a staging area for a more principled approach. I also find that many of the results I see proven in textbooks are not directly applicable. Try doing statistical forecasts of non-stationary processes that feed into client-customized discrete event simulations doing both simulation optimization and counterfactual causal inference and you're likely to see what I mean. The mathematical formulations of such problems often lead to extremely difficult change of variables. And yet I find that continuing to learn the math, even if not directly-applicable, teaches me lessons about the cases I cannot directly deal with in pure mathematics. Statistics, like other complex skill sets, needs to cover some fundamentals. For me it was studying more mathematics and learning Monte Carlo methods (believe me, the stuff can drive you NUTS !) that gave me the confidence to go beyond the simple recipes. The best textbooks build up our repertoire of fundamentals and tools. The worst teach us to mindlessly follow flow charts leading to erroneous conclusions.
