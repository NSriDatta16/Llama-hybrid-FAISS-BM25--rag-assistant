Model for detecting contact information in text

Is there a SOTA solution for finding texts with contact information (phone numbers, social media links, etc.)? I know that this task is advised to solve by regular expressions, I've already tried it myself, but there are problems with numbers of this type: "8 994 966 twelve 72", "39 30 03*", "912 five69 O7 OO", "8918ob801ra70sha10s" etc. If you write regular expressions under all of them, they already start to affect regular numbers, which don't need to be deleted. I tried to use NER models, but they don't see phone numbers specifically. I am not asking to write a universal regular expression, I am specifically interested in a solution using machine learning techniques (I tried NER for example, but it did not work). I also put off using BERT and similar SOTA models, because there are no good embeddings for them and my computational power and time are limited :(. Thank you in advance.
