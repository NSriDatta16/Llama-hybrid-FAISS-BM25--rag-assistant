Initializing a struct is easily done by enumerating it's member values inside curly braces. Beware, though, 'cause if a member is omitted from the enumeration, it will be regarded as zero. struct A { int a_, b_; }; A a = { 1, 2 }; A b = { 1 }; // will result in a_=1 and b_=0 A as [] = { {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,5} }; Strangely enough, this also works for the public members of an "aggregate" class. It's to be discouraged, though, since this way your class will lose it's ability to do the necessary things at construction time, effectively reducing it to a struct.
