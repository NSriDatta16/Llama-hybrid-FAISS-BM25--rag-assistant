Approaches to regression with zero inflated response

I have zero inflated response variable I am trying to predict. I am facing few issues applying different regression models that should correct for this. This is my 10,000 obs dataframe e_weight left_size right_size time_diff Min. :0.000 Min. : 1.000 Min. : 1.000 Min. : 737 1st Qu.:0.000 1st Qu.: 1.000 1st Qu.: 1.000 1st Qu.: 4669275 Median :0.000 Median : 3.000 Median : 3.000 Median : 12263474 Mean :0.022 Mean : 6.194 Mean : 5.469 Mean : 21000288 3rd Qu.:0.000 3rd Qu.: 5.000 3rd Qu.: 5.000 3rd Qu.: 25420278 Max. :3.000 Max. :792.000 Max. :792.000 Max. :155291532 Here the frequency count for my 3 variables Indeed I have a problem with zeros... I tried respectively a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression and a Zero-inflated Poisson Regression library(pscl) m1 |z|) # (Intercept) -3.8826386 0.0696970 -55.707 |z|) # (Intercept) 1.753e+01 6.011e+00 2.916 0.00354 ** # time_diff -3.342e-04 1.059e-06 -315.773 and library(MASS) m2 which gives There were 22 warnings (use warnings() to see them) warnings() Warning messages: 1: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge ... 21: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge 22: In glm.nb(e_weight ~ left_size * right_size + time_diff, ... : alternation limit reached If I ask a summary for the second model summary(m2) # Call: # glm.nb(formula = e_weight ~ left_size * right_size + time_diff, # data = s, init.theta = 0.1372733321, link = log) # # Deviance Residuals: # Min 1Q Median 3Q Max # -3.4645 -0.2331 -0.1885 -0.1266 2.7669 # # Coefficients: # Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) # (Intercept) -3.239e+00 1.090e-01 -29.699 Also both models have very low p-values for heteroskedasticity bptest(m1) # # studentized Breusch-Pagan test # # data: m1 # BP = 244.832, df = 3, p-value How should I approach this regression. Would make sense to simply add 1 to all my dataframe before running any regression?
