Thanks for your answers, but I don't think mine was an IIS6/IIS7 problem. I traced it to the fact that the default value for ImageStorageMode on a ChartControl has changed from UseImageLocation to UseHttpHandler . My ChartControl now has some extra attributes and all works fine. I had to also change the ImageLocation to be non-relative (by adding /Temp/ ) as that also caused a problem when iterating over the ChartControl 's DataPoints in some code-behind.
