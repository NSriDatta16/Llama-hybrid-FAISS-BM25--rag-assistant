Setting up feature vectors

I am working on a classification project and I want to use SVM's and/or Clustering Algs. What I am having trouble with is deciding how to set up my feature vectors. I have already decided what my features will be and I have already taken into account things like correlation and overfitting. Some of my features are categorical (region, gender, occupation...) and some are numeric (age, income,...) I would like to use some if not all of these. But I am not sure how to quantify the features in such a way that is accurate and will not create noise. (One thing I thought to do was for each categorical variable, say gender, calculate something relevant that has to do with the variable (say probability of default given that you are of some gender). The idea is to find something highly correlated with the categorical variable and use that value instead.) Id appreciate any tips or references! Thanks
