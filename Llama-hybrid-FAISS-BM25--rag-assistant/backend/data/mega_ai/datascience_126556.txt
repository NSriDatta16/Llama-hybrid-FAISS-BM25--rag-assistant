The Random Forest model exhibits potential for extrapolating f(i, t) values to indices 81-100, albeit with certain caveats. Its training on functions with indices ranging from 0 to 79 allows it to learn patterns within this specific domain. The critical factor lies in the trends exhibited by features (i and t) and target values (f(i,t)) across the dataset. Assuming predictable evolutions of A(i) (10% increase) and r(i) (1% decrease), the model can attempt to extrapolate these trends to unseen indices. However, such extrapolation inherently carries uncertainties, particularly in the presence of non-linearities or complexities not represented in the training set. Cross-validation offers a means to augment the model's robustness. By evaluating its performance on various training data subsets, it facilitates the detection of overfitting or underfitting phenomena. This practice yields a more reliable assessment of the model's generalizability to unseen data, potentially leading to improved predictions for indices 81-100. So a segregated set of Test set(0-60), cv set(61-80) and finally test set(81-100) is likely to provide further refined and robust predictions, hence further increasing the chance of predicting accurate possibilities for the test set.
