Programmatically accessing internal storage (not SD card) on Verizon HTC Droid Incredible (Android)

I'm trying to find information on how to programmatically access the HTC Droid Incredible's supposed 8GB of Internal Storage Memory . To determine the External Storage (SD Card) Location , I'm using the command: android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(). I've not been able to find any corollary for Internal phone Storage . In examining HTC/Google Nexus One , Motorola Droid , and HTC Dream/G1 phones , there (as would be expected) does not appear to be any Mount Point for such Arbitrary Internal Storage . On these phones the Internal Storage is divided amongst /data , /system , and /cache partitions. The Incredible's Internal Storage is certainly not going to be located in /system . /cache is also unlikely given that it is globally non-readable/non-executable . I'd read in reviews that the phone will still be limited to 512MB or so for apps, suggesting that it is not simply a subdirectory of /data . I do not have access to a Droid Incredible unit myself, of course.
