Changing the value of one attribute in a Ruby collection

Say for example I've got a collection like this: [{"name" => "Ganesh", "magic_number" => 7}, {"name" => "Comrade", "magic_number" => 2}...] How can I change the value of ALL the magic_numbers in the collection to be the same value (e.g. 8)? I'm sure it's using something like map or collect but I can't seem to do it at the moment and return me the whole collection with the changes, just one or the other...
