Actually it has nothing to do with being "in the center". In fact, those statistics can sometimes be far from what many people consider as "center", e.g. for skewed distribution . The point is rather that they provide a single-value summary of the distribution: mean is the value where probability mass concentrates , it is the outcome that we "expect on average" , median is the value that divides your data in two halves (50% lies on the right of it, 50% lies on the left), while mode is the "most common" value. Each of those statistics gives you some simple summary of the data.
