How to manipulate data in a TreeView? Should i use the ViewModelPattern?

A part of the editor i'm writing uses a Wpf-TreeView. I'm using DataBinding and an ItemTemplate to populate the TreeView. So far i'm manipulating the ItemsSource(mostly ObeservableCollection's) dircetly(using for example Drag&Drop). But now i read this and i'm not sure if it would realy simplify thinks for me. And before i go on with the project i whould like to know all Pros and Cons. If Data(ItemsSource) is added, edited or delete, how to keep the Data and the ViewModel consistent? Is that something the ViewModel has to take care of? If i have to take care of the consistens how does this simplifies thinks?
