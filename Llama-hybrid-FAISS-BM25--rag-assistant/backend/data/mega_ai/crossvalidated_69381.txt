Taking your second point first, your analysis of Day looked at the aggregate across days and there is no Day effect on average. There might be one on Day 2 but you really should have a justification for believing Day 2 more than other days. Point 1, that Day 1 isn't significant while Day 2 does show an effect is a meaningless point to make. Ignoring the correlation and analysis techniques, even if what your colleagues claim is true, it's not useful. The implied argument is that the effect of group in Day 1 is different from Day 2 and that wasn't tested . That's what your interaction tested and it's not significant. Finally, from the tenor of this report it sounds like there's a lot of being hung up on what significant and what's not. For example, if Day 1 and Day 2 effects are both in the same direction but one is significant and one is not are they really contradictory? Think about that.
