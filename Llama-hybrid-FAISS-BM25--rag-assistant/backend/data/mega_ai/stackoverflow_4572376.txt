How to run stored procedure 1000 times

I have a stored procedure that I'm using to populate a table with about 60 columns. I have genereated 1000 exec statements that look like this: exec PopulateCVCSTAdvancement 174, 213, 1, 0, 7365 exec PopulateCVCSTAdvancement 174, 214, 1, 0, 7365 exec PopulateCVCSTAdvancement 175, 213, 0, 0, 7365 Each time the stored procedure will be inserting anywhere from 1 to 3,000 records (usually around 2,000 records). The "server" is running desktop hardware with 4 gigs of available memory on a server OS. The problem I have is that after the first 10-15 executes of an average of 1-2 seconds each time, the next 10-15 seem to never finish. Am I doing this correctly? How should I do this? Thanks!
