I think you have 1200*2 in-between layers. So, total connection will be (1200^2)*2 (what you wrote is correct.) This is correct, if you are not considering any biased weights. If you add biased weights to each neuron then it would be (1200^2)*2+1200*2 number of connections. In RNN, each node will be connected twice with itself (Node1 --> Node1 --> Node1). So, (1200^2)*2+(1200^2)*2 (without considering any biased weights). You may generalize it.
