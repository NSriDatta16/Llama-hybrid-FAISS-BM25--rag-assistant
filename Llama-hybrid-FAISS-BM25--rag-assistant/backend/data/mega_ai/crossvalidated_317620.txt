Machine learning models learn from the data that you provide them, as you'd stated. However, what you want for them to do is to learn so that they can fit data beyond the data you supplied. This is typically done via some sort of assessment, like the accuracy that you mention. Often, but not always, this is done by removing some of the data, then trying to fit that data and measure the accuracy.
