Ordinal regression validation in R

I have constructed an ordinal logistic regression model in R using lrm or polr function. I have checked the prediction power by checking the Pseudo R square as one of the indexes to check the model. I'm still a bit confused in terms of which function and which direction I should look into to make sure my model follow those assumptions, to which i can make inference from the model.
