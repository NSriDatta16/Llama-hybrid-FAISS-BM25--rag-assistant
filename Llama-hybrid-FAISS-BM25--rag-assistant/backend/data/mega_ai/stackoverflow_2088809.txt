Concatenating space-separated numbers together in a batch file

I need to randomly generate a number of values in a batch file that share a certain range and concatenate them together separated by spaces. Everything works except for concatenating the space-separated numbers together. The specific problematic issue is concatenating with the numbers with spaces, how do I go about this? The relevent portion follows: ::Assume %minA%, %maxA% and %randB% are defined correctly. set /a randA=(%random% %% %maxA%) + %minA% set agent_counter=0 :start_agent_loop if %agent_counter% equ %randA% goto end set /a randApos=(%random% %% %randB%) + 1 ::supposedly (if I recall), simply having a space between %agent_starts% ::and %randApos% should do the trick, this doesn't seem to be the case. set agent_starts = %agent_starts% %randApos% set /a agent_counter +=1 goto start_agent_loop :end echo -A %agent_starts% Ideally, this should print something like... C:\Path\>genparams.bat -A 2 4 5 Currently I get -A
