I have spent the past 16 years on Wall Street. Everything we do is based on time series data. You really should re-train the model as new data becomes available, or predicted results and actual results will quickly start to diverge. Also, you will probably use all data for training (you may not have enough data to set some aside for testing purposes). Check out the link below for more insight into how all of this works. 3 facts about time series forecasting that surprise experienced machine learning practitioners In terms of deploying your model, it should be pretty straightforward. I did this just 1 day ago. I followed the instructions from the link below. Try that, and see how you get along. Deploying scikit-learn Models at Scale | towardsdatascience
