I currently have a string (XSLT 1.0) which I'd like to turn into a NodeList A string is not a node . The only way to make a node from a string is to try to parse it with an XML parser. This cannot be done dynamically within an XSLT 1.0 or 2.0 transformation. If the string is statically defined and it represents a well-formed XML fragment, then it can be specified as the body of an or an instruction and converted to a regular node-set by using the xxx:node-set() extension function provided by the particular vendor, as shown in more detail in @Alejandro's answer. If you provide more details about the task you want to solve (XML document, wanted result, how the result is related to the source XML document), then many people would be able to help.
