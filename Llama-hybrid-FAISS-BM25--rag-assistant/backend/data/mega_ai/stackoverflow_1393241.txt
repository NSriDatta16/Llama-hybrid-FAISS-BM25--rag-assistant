There are loads of tools. Amoung ORMs I would look at. ADO.NET Entity Framework BLToolkit DataObjects.Net NHibernate EntitySpaces I am using DataObjects currently but others are also ok. For WPF applications, I would recommend Microsoft Composite Application Library with Third party controls. For example, Telerik . infragistics. Devexpress These three are proved to be ok. For web applications, Composite Web Application Block LiveUI.NET .NET RIA Services ASP.NET Dynamic Data ASP.NET MVC (if UI is not going to be complex)
