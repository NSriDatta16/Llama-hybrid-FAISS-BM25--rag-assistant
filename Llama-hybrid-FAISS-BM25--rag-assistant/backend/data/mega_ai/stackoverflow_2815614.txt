Perhaps the class declares its own operator new that get storage from some mystery location? e.g. The author of the class may have written: class MyClass { public: void * operator new (size_t amt); void operator delete(void *); }; Then their operator new beats your operator new. Either that or the DLL is built with /MTd while the executable uses /MD.
