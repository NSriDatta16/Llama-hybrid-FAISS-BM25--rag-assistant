Bias term $c$ can be eliminated (eg by subtracting the averages from $A$ and $B$ ) and the approximation be framed as: $$B = M \cdot A$$ Using minimum sum of squared residual errors criterion (similar to MSE) the best approximation (and the matrix $M$ ) is given by Least Squares method . Using a python package like numpy , the least squares solution can be implemented relatively easily. Some packages like scipy have implemented it already. NB If it is known that the matrix $M$ is fixed and constant (and not an approximation) then one can identify the transformation matrix $M$ (and translation $c$ ) given only up to 3 points and their transformations. ( scipy implements this as well if I am not mistaken).
