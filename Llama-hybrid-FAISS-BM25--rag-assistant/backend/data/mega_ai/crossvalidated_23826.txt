How to interpret "weight-position" plot when using self-organizing map for clustering?

I used MATLAB neural network toolbox to train a self-organizing map for a given data set. The obtained "weight-position" plot is given as follows. I do not think this plot looks good in comparison to the sample plot given in the MathWorks website . I followed the standard MATLAB routine to train this SOM. Thus, I am having three questions on this case study. Which kind of information can I obtain from this plot? Given the shape of this plot, what can I say for the input? Since the training method is trivial and standard, I am wondering whether SOM can fit to my data set? My data set is composed of 3,000 data points, and each data points has 20,000 dimensions. The example given by MATLAB is only for 4 dimensions.
