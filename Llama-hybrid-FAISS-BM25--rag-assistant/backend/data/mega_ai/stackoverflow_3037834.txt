Note that this is not quite an answer. If I forgo the discussion around not keeping the correct version of the file for posterity, I will at least comment on one part of your question, that might make you reconsider not keeping all the revisions of the file in the repository. Version control systems typically doesn't store the entire file on each new revision, they store changes. Depending on the system, you might occasionally have a full copy of the file, but most of the changesets will be changes only. For instance, in Mercurial, I tried this: First I downloaded the C# 3.0 language specification as a word file from this url: http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/8/8/388e7205-bc10-4226-b2a8-75351c669b09/CSharp%20Language%20Specification.doc Then I committed this to a fresh Mercurial repository. Size before the commit (empty repository) was 80 bytes, size of file on disk was 2.387.968 bytes, and repository after commit was 2.973.696 bytes. Note that the file is now effectively stored twice, once in my working copy (the one I can edit), and once in my repository as part of my initial commit. Then I opened the file, and changed all occurances of 3.0 with 4.0 (without the quotes), and all occurances of C# with VB , and saved. Then I committed the new version with a single-letter comment. Size of repository after commit is now 3.497.984 bytes. Difference is 512KB (there's some chunking involved in the repository, hence the size being an exact 512KB value.) If I now open up the file again, change only the title page VB back to C#, save, and commit again, the size of the repository grows by 276KB, up to 3.780.608 bytes. As you can see, changes does not commit an entire copy of the file, but granted, the differences aren't in the "10KB" range either. Let's assume that the average size of each diff, for this file alone, will be somewhat inbetween those, let's say averages to 50% between the two values. This means that 300 commits of changes to this file, averaging 394KB totals 115MB. This is not alot My suggestion is as follows: Stop being cheapskates, disk space is cheap, compared to the headache you will have when someone says "I really wish I knew what that file looked like last week before you corrupted it".
