Create a union or join on the values returned from groovy sql.rows()

I am using Groovy's sql.rows(SPCallString) function to call a stored procedure which is returning some rows based on the arguments. I am doing this for 3 different stored procedures. Is there a way in groovy I can perform a "union" on those rows that are returned from the three calls? I basically want something like this: if these are the rows returned from sql.rows for each of the three calls, ->"X","Y", "M" ->"X","Y", "P" ->"X","Y", "Q" I want to return ->"X","Y", "M,P,Q" Thanks!
