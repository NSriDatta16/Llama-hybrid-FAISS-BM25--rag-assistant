Don't know about SQL2008, but this sounds like a connection pooling problem on the application side. In the old days, we added "OLEDB Services=-1" to the connection string to turn off connection pooling. There is probably a more elegant way to do this now. edit: ADO.Net 2.0 seems to have added a ClearPool function to the SQLConnection object. ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.clearpool(VS.80).aspx ) I am very interested to know if this works.
