The core data persistent store won't get automatically added to your app. You will need to add this file to your project so that it becomes part of the app bundle when you build the app. You can see what will happen in xcode after you've added this file under your target settings. Additionally apple discourages modification of the SQLite data store directly outside of core data. You may be better off just using SQLite in that case. If you feel you really need core data, you may want to make a default SQLite database that is part of your app. The first time the app is run (or the data is reset) you can then import that data into your user's custom core data persistent store. See this portion of apple's documentation on how to import an existing SQLite database into core data. This allows you to have default data but gives you the flexibility of being able to reset the database easily.
