Yes, a predictive model can be developed to predict the Survived feature. A problem similar to this is given in the link https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic . It has some very good tutorials too. This is a binary classification problem. A logistic regression, Neural Networks or Random forests are suitable techniques. In this example, most of the features are categorical. Convert them accordindly, for eg. to numerical features (via one hot encoding) before inputting to a machine learning algorithm. Use cross validation to select the best technique.
