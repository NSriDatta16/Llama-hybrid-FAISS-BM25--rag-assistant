Should I expose web methods via ASP.NET MVC actions or WCF?

I want to be able to Ajax-ly retrieve JSON data from some kind of web service. (The web service calls will be wrapping a call to SQL, processing the DataSet returned, and returning a JSON representation.) Initially, I thought an ASP.NET MVC project with appropriately named Controllers and Actions that return JsonResults would suffice. However, a colleague suggested WCF might be a better fit for something like this. It's been my experience that WCF is difficult to configure; moreover, the way MVC exposes Actions through Controllers seems very elegant. Which is a better fit for what I'm trying to do, MVC or WCF?
