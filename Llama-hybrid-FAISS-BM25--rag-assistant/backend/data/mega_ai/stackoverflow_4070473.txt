Well I'd like to share even more simple solution rather than installing a package. As it was stated before the DocumentComplete event somehow depends on Microsoft.mshtml.dll file. You can find it on a machine with Visual Studio installed. So it needs to be copied and installed to the target machine. Here's the description of the process: Place the Microsoft.mshtml.dll file into the "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft.NET\Primary Interop Assemblies" folder. Then drag and drop it into the "%SystemRoot%\Assembly" folder. Register the library with RegAsm.exe utility (which is located in the appropriate subfolder of "%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework"). P.S. May be it may be done in a better way but this solution works and I hope it'll be useful for you.
