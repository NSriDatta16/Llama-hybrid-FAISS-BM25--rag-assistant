I can't figure out the reason why I should standardize with respect to the feature By no means a complete or authoritative answer... I just wanted to point out that PCA finds the axes that are orthogonal to each other and which explain most of the variation in the data. I.e. PCA rotates the data so that the first component captures more variation than the second, the second more than the third etc. This means that the unit of measure of each dimension matters. If one dimension is "weight" and you measure it in grams, it contributes a lot more to the total variance than if you measure it in kilograms even if the relevance of that dimension ought to be same whatever the unit. If you standardise the dimensions you remove this dependency on the absolute values. Is this always desirable? In gene expression analyses where rows are samples and columns (dimensions) are expressions, it is common practice to standardise the columns. This is because, typically, what matters is the relative change of genes' expression across samples rather than their absolute expression levels. However, this also means that a very lowly expressed gene gets the same importance as a highly expressed one if their relative change is the same: this may or may not be desirable.
