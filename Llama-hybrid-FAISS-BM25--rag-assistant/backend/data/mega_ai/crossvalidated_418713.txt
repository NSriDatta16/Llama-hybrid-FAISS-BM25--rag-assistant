This is a two part quote I've heard a few times: Machine learning is statistics minus any checking of models and assumptions. Brian D. Ripley In that case, maybe we should get rid of checking of models and assumptions more often. Then maybe we'd be able to solve some of the problems that the machine learning people can solve but we can't! Andrew Gelman Link (Ripley is quoted as making the statement at the useR forum, Gelman responds to the quote on his blog). There's some irony in the sides taken by these two statisticians in this conversation. That is, some of Brian Ripley's early work was on Neural Networks, which is an extremely popular topic in Machine Learning, where as Andrew Gelman is exclusively known for Bayesian statistics in which he advocates taking one's statistical models very seriously.
