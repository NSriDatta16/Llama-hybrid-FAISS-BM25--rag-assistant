@ AdamO is more knowledgeable than me, but if what you are trying to do is see if adding a biomarker to a model improves the model then this is a case of "nested" models. What's needed is: Define the null hypothesis as H0: No improvement in risk prediction Apply the likelihood ratio test to calculate twice the change in the log-likelihood statistic (D). This difference D follows a chi-squared distribution with n degree of freedom (n=1 in this case if you are adding just 1 biomarker). You look up D in a chi-squared table to find a p value. I've played with assessing the added value of a biomarker risk to a logistic regression model. If you are interested in there are some new statistical metrics (including net reclassification - often poorly applied) and a way of visualising them that are far more informative than merely comparing AUCs (c stats). See my paper Pickering, J. W., & Endre, Z. H. (2012). New Metrics for Assessing Diagnostic Potential of Candidate Biomarkers. Clinical Journal Of The American Society Of Nephrology, 7, 1355â€“1364. doi:10.2215/CJN.09590911
