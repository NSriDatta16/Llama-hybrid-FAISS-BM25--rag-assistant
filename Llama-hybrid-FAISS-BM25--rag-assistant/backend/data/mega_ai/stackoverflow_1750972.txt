Upgrading from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7: best programmer's practices?

Although I am using drupal since the D4 series, I only started developing professionally for it with D6, so - despite I did various site upgrades - I was never faced by the task of having to port my own code to a new version. I know the Drupal community will come up with lot of technical support about changed API's and architectural changes (see the deadwood module for D5-D6 or even these stubs of D6-D7 how-to's for modules and themes ). However what I am looking for with my question is more in the line of strategy thinking , or in other words, I am looking for inputs and advice on how to plan / implement / review the process of porting my own code , in the light of what colleague developers learned by previous experience. Some example: Would you advice to begin to port my modules as soon as I have time for doing it, and to maintain a concurrent D7 for some time (so I am "prepared" for the D-day) or would you advice to rather wait for the day in which the port will be actually imminent and then upgrade the modules to D7 and drop the D6 version? Only some of my modules have full test coverage. Would you advice to complete test coverage for the D6 version so to have all tests working to check the D7 port, or would you advice to write my test directing at porting time, to test the D7 version? Did you find that being an early adopter gives you an edge in terms of new features and better API's or did you rather find that is more convenient to delay the conversion so as to leverage the larger amount of readily available contrib modules? Did you set for yourself quality standards / evaluation criteria or did you just set the bar to "if it works, I'm happy"? Why? If you set certain standards or goals, what did they where / what will they be? How did they help you? Are there common pitfalls that you experienced in the past and that you think are applicable to the D6-D7 porting process? Is porting a good moment to do some refactoring or it is just going to make everything more complex to be put back together? ... These questions are not an exhaustive list, but I hope they give an idea of what kind of information I am looking for. I would rather say: whatever you think is relevant and I did not list above gets a "plus"! :) If I did not manage to express myself clearly enough, please post a comment with the info you think I should add in the question. Thank you in advance for your time! PS: Yes I know... D7 is not yet out and it will take months before important contrib modules will be upgraded... but it's never too early to start thinking! :)
