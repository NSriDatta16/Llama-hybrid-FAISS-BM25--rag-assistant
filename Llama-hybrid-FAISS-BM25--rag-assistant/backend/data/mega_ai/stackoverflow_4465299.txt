To solve the error : "Internet Explorer cannot download download.php from www.example.com", Add these headers to your script: header("Pragma: "); header("Cache-Control: "); The code will remove the Cache-Control from headers which makes the download problem. The above code should be added at the top of the file. It works fine for us.
