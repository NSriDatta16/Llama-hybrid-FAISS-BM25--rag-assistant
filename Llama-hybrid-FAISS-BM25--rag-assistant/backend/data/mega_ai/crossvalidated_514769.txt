How to model a new short term beaviour in time series using ML approaches?

I had been modeling time series which contain many SKUs , due to corona there was a short-term drift in seasonality. I want to know how can i deal with this problem. Usually, sales are high in April, but due to corona sales had dropped significantly in aprilb2020, this is causing models performance to deteriorate, I have tried using categorical variables to explicitly label corona effect, but this is not helping ML to learn significantly, what would be a good approach that i can try to mitigate this unforeseen effect. I am using tree-based models for machine learning.
