Recreate logistic regression equation from table of odds data

I'm reading the technical manual for a linking study between two assessments. It's pretty clear that the table is model output from a fitted logistic regression equation. Here's what pass odds look like on test 2 as a function of score on test 1 (RIT score): It seems silly to use a lookup table that rounds to 5 when the model that made that table could give a better estimate. But how do I recreate that equation from this output? I have a good sense of how I would fit this model if I had the raw data, but I'm not sure what to do here. Not glm(family=binomial) because the data I have is are odds ratios, not pass / no pass (i.e., 1s and 0s), right? Here's the data: PASS
