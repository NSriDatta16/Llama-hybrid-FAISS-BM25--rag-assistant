Comparison between MDL and BIC

I'm currently studying Hidden Markov Models. There's a set of observations from which I need to determine the optimal number of states. After having found the maximum likelihood using Baum-Welch, I considered two model selection criteria for determining the optimal states. These are Minimum Description length (MDL) and Bayesian Inference criterion (BIC). However, with MDL, the number of states=2 whereas with BIC it's 4. Does this mean that MDL performs better than BIC?
