The Silverlight project I'm working on used the RIA Business Application template from MS. It had all their styles in an 'assets' folder and the file was called Styles.xaml. I've been sticking to their organization and like it, though I've also added separate folders for "dialogs" and custom "controls." You can download their sample here, which may answer your questions: http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2009/07/10/amazing-business-apps-example-updated-for-silverlight-3-rtm-and-net-ria-services-july-update.aspx
