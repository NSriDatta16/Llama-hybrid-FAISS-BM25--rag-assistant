Expanding on @Brandon 's excellent comment (which I think should be promoted to answer): The geometric mean should be used when you are interested in multiplicative differences. Brandon notes that geometric mean should be used when the ranges are different. This is usually correct. The reason is that we want to equalize the ranges. For example, suppose college applicants are rated on SAT score (0 to 800), grade point average in HS (0 to 4) and extracurricular activities (1 to 10). If a college wanted to average these and equalize the ranges (that is, weight increases in each quality relative to the range) then geometric mean would be the way to go. But this isn't always true when we have scales with different ranges. If we were comparing income in different countries (including poor and rich ones), we would probably not want the geometric mean, but the arithmetic mean (or, more likely, the median or perhaps a trimmed mean). The only use I've seen for harmonic mean is that of comparing rates. As an example: If you drive from New York to Boston at 40 MPH, and return at 60 MPH, then your overall average is not the arithmetic mean of 50 MPH, but the harmonic mean. AM = $(40 + 60)/2 = 50$ HM = $2/(1/40 + 1/60) = 48$ to check that this is right for this simple example, imagine it is 120 miles from NYC to Boston. Then the drive there takes 3 hours, the drive home takes 2 hours, the total is 5 hours, and the distance is 240 miles. $240/5 = 48$
