We moved about 6 months ago to git from cvs and been very pleased with the move. The latest version of eGit (Eclipse git plugin) works very nicely and does what we need to do on a daily basis. The plugin just needs to be installed once after an Eclipse upgrade. Since eclipse.org is slowly switching to git, I expect that it will eventually enter a main distribution. The real benefit comes from the non-core functionality in terms of visualization, tooling support (in e.g. Hudson, which is many, many times faster with git than cvs) and distributedness. The daily backup is just a remote mirror in a very distant location and so on. I really like how github works which I would suggest for your primary work place. Unless you have very good reasons to stay with CVS, I would encourage you to look at the various modern alternatives. People recommend bzr, hg and git - which are the three I believe have critical mass these days - and which one fits you best is up to you to find out :)
