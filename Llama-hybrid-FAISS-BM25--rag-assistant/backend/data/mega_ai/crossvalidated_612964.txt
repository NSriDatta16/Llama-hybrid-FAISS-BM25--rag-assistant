About the question: When you say "classifying 100 classes" I think you have 100 output categories. The VGG16 output had 1000 output categories, so it isn't unreasonable. The question: Given a problem whose output is the selection of 1 of 100 candidate classes, tell me about the machine learning tools that could be used to engage it, and their relative strengths and weaknesses. Answering: Your answers are much closer than you imagine. If you did it right you could make them nearly exactly the same except for the bootstrapping in the random forest. Independent logistic regressions: easy to make, understand, troubleshoot, and communicate by themselves. Altogether might be a bit overwhelming. requires enough but not google-big data to do a good job not as good at understanding variable interactions across classes Neural network with logistic then max indicator: easier to code, straightforward to train single monolith model sometimes wants more data sometimes long to train O(n^6) Random Forest single monolith model less noisy output, targets mean, robust does well with interactions does well with moderate data So I have to ask, what is the nature of your data (type, input element description, input ensemble description)? Is it words, numbers, images? Do you have 10, 40, or 100 samples per output category?
