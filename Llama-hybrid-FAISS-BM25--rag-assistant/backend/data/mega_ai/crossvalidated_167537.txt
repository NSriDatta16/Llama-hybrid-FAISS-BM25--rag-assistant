The metafor package computes the CI for $\tau^2$ using the Q-profile method, which is described in: Viechtbauer, W. (2007). Confidence intervals for the amount of heterogeneity in meta-analysis. Statistics in Medicine, 26 (1), 37-52. This is an exact CI, so it is guaranteed to have nominal coverage (under the assumptions of the model). Since $I^2$ and $H^2$ are just functions of $\tau^2$ (and the 'typical' sampling variance; for details, see here ), one can just take the CI bounds for $\tau^2$, plug them into the equation for obtaining $I^2$ and $H^2$, and thereby obtain exact CIs for $I^2$ and $H^2$. The meta package uses the method described in section A2 in: Higgins, J. P. T., & Thompson, S. G. (2002). Quantifying heterogeneity in a meta-analysis. Statistics in Medicine, 21 (11), 1539-1558. This is an approximate CI that does not always have nominal coverage.
