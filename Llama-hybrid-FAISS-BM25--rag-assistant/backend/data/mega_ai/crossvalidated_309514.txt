how can I train the model to predict duplicate records in machine learning?

I have the adjustment data in telecom domain: There are problems that sometimes the automation script generates the bill twice which causes duplicate records. I want to know how to prepare the data and train the ML model. Currently, I am considering the duplicate record as issues and training the SVM model for one-class classification. Duplicate Bill ABC13C,13.59,2017-03-01,2017-03-01,2017-03-01,118,I,A,0,C,2011 1 Should I train the model with actual bill and duplicate bill as both issues and train the model and then predict the rest or is there any other way to consider or should I implement time-series classification?
