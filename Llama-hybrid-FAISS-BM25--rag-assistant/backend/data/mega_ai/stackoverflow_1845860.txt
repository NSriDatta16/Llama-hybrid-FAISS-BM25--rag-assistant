What tools do you use to upload files to amazon ec2 Linux instances?

I am using the standard fedora AMI with the LAMP stack bundled and I want to upload files onto the server from my Windows desktop. What is the "normal" approach for this? I am not a UNIX admin by any stretch, although I am more than comfortable with FTP and the basics of a BASH shell. As far as I can see there is no FTP server installed by default on the remote virtual machine, and I am unable to open one up at my end because of firewall restrictions. I looked at WinSCP, but before I go to the lengths of installing and configuring that I wondered what the expected means of doing this might be. In any case I don't see how WinSCP or any other FTP based tool can work without the target machine listening, which implies something like and FTP server. Is there anything like a Windows remote desktop connection? I could mount an S3 elastic storage volume from within EC2, but it is a bit of a sledgehammer to crack my little nut of just wanting 100k of files copied up to the server. This is a different question to getting my web application running on the virtual server to save files locally, which is what the other SO questions in a similar vein seem to be asking. Any ideas welcome.
