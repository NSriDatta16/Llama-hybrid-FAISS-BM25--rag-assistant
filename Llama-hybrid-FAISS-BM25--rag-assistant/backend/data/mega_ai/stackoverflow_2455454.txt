Retrieve binary data from S3 storage through AWS.NET in C#

I've tested most of the included samples in the AWS SDK for .NET and they all works fine. I can PUT objects, LIST objects and DELETE objects in a bucket, but... lets say I delete the original and want to sync those files missing locally? I would like to make a GET object (by key/name and bucket ofcause). I can find the object, but how do I read the binary data from S3 through the API? Do I have to write my own SOAP wrapper for this or is there some kinda sample for this out "here" ? :o) In hope of a sample. It does not have to tollerate execeptions etc. I just need to see the main parts that connects, retreives and stores the file back on my ASP.net or C# project. Anyone???
