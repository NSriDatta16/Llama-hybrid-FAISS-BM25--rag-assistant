Estimation with MCMC

I would like to ask some high-view questions about MCMC. I do not have a specific example, I just want to get a general intuitive idea. Suppose I have a data set $X$ and a rather complex model with parameters $\theta$ . I would like to fit the model and find the parameters. How can I do that with MCMC? If I already have the data, why do I continue to generate samples? a. Am I generating data samples $X'$ and then fit the model to get an estimate $\tilde{\theta}$ ? But why I have to do this if I already have the data? b. Or am I generating samples of the parameters $\theta'$ (using data $X$ , I don't know how though) then use the mode or mean of the posterior distribution $\mathbb{E}_{p(\theta'|X)}(\theta)$ ? c. I have seen a lot of places use the term "Metropolis-Hastings update" (for example here at page 4). I wonder what they mean by the updates? Is it the next parameter sample $\theta'$ sampled from the algorithm or is it the updated parameters $\tilde{\theta}$ that I estimated from the sampled data $X'$ ? If all my above guesses are incorrect, what is the correct one? Thank you very much for your help!
