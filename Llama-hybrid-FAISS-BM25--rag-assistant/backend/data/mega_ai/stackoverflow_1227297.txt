Iterate through the students in a class The Iterator design pattern provides us with a common method of enumerating a list of items or array, while hiding the details of the list's implementation. This provides a cleaner use of the array object and hides unneccessary information from the client, ultimately leading to better code-reuse, enhanced maintainability, and fewer bugs. The iterator pattern can enumerate the list of items regardless of their actual storage type.
