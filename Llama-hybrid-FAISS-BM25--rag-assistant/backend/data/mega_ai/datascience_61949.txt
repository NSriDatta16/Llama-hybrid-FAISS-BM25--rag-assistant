Need help on pandas data frames filtering on a csv file

Raw data gets generated daily We need to get success rate for current month on a daily basis & success rate of each cell by end of that month from Jan till current month. Raw data has following columns: Column Names example values BackupClient an4lsbk0304.an.ppp.com BackupDriver NetBackup BackupMaster an4lsbk0300.an.ppp.com BackupPolicyID an.72699 BackupPolicyName ancfsv02a_aggr1_ancfs02n02b_L_an_vlw_atom_001 Cell an LastFullResult Failure LastFullStartTime 4-10-19 PolicyType NFS Status Active LastFullExitCode 96 Each column – “Cell” I need to find following result columns: Oct Full ran, failed & not completed yet Oct Full not ran Oct full ran successful Grand Total Success rate for full ran in Oct Success rate of full backup Percentage of backup coverage Oct Full ran, failed & not completed yet: Oct full ran, failed & not completed yet means – “LastFullStartTime” – contains current month date and non-empty && “LastFullResult” – Failed && “status code” – greater than 1 Oct Full not ran yet: Oct Full not ran means – “LastFullStartTime” - empty or date older than current month Oct full ran successful – Oct full ran successful means – “LastFullStartTime” – contains current month date && “LastFullResult” – success Grand Total Grand Total means – Count of BackupPolicyID for each distinct cell; should be ideally equal to above 3 columns (1+2+3=4) Success rate for full ran in Oct Success rate for full ran in Oct means – Above column1/(column1+column3) in percentage Success rate of full backup Success rate of full backup means – Above column1/(column1+column2+ column3) in percentage Percentage of backup coverage Percentage of backup coverage means – Above (column1+column3)/column4 code: import pandas as pd import os RD = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/acharbha/Desktop/fullbackup_success/python/raw_Data_success_Rate.csv") print(RD.info())
