In linux a filesystem is implemented via a series of system calls that provide all the operations you expect, open , close , read , write , that kind of thing. The kernel provides a method of mapping these calls to an underlying filesystem implementation. This mapping layer is called the VFS and there are a bunch of pages that describe it (for example the VFS Tour ). Not all filesystems necessarily live on a spinning disk or any permanent storage medium. As you said, /proc is completely in memory. The implementation of its functions like read and write provide access to various aspects of the Linux kernel.
