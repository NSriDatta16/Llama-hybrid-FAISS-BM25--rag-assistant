The use of tau cuts from an ordered logistic regression

I runned several ordered logistic regression using the polr function from the MASS package and interpreted the odds ratios for each model. However, I'm in doubt how to use the intercepts/tau-cuts from the regression summary output. Can I use them to say that the distance between each category is far or close to the higher order? I have 7 independent variables and each variable have many categories, so I don't think it make sense to calculate each value using the intercepts and estimate coeff and insert them in the regression model to get values (hope this make sense).
