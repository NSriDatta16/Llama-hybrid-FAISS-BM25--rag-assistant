Just to add Why LOC and Code Coverage of Tests are less than ideal: Agile emphasizes outcome, not output (see Agile Manifesto). These two simply track output. Also, they do not properly measure refactoring, which is a vital aspect of Agile processes. Another metric to consider would be Running Tested Features.
