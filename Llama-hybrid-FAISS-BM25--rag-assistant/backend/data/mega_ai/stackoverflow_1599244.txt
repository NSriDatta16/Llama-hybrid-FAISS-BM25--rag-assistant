I guess it was first introduced by Struts controller mapping. It states for "do" something. In the web.xml file, you configure the framework ActionServlet as the servlet that will handle all requests for a given mapping (usually the extension .do is used). The ActionServlet is the "switchboard" mentioned in the opening paragraph. ( Source ) Nowadays it's commonly used outside of Struts, so there's no way to be sure of which technology is behind the scenes.
