Fundamental difference between PCA and FA?

According to this , the fundamental difference between PCA and FA can be illustrated via the following image: So, the direction of arrows changes. According to this answer and a few others: Loadings are coefficients in linear combination predicting a variable by the (standardized) components. Also, according to this , loadings are: correlation between a component and a variable. I am a little stuck because the correlation is symmetric and because FA and PCA "reverse the arrows". As a result, here comes my question: The interpretation of the loading is: The higher the loading of a PC, the more influence it has in the formation of the variable. The higher the loading of a variable, the more influence it has in the formation of the principal component score. Both ?
