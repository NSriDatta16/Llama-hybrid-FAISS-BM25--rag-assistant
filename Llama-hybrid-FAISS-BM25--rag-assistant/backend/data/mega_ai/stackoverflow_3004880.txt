Instead of using the IDs, if you just gave those same elements a class, like class="draggable" you can make this much shorter, like this: function EnableDragAndDrop(cBox) { $(".draggable").draggable(cBox.checked ? "disable" : "enable"); } $(function() { $(".draggable").draggable({ containment: '#divDragArea', scroll: false }); }); Instead of {disable: boolean} you just need to call the "enable" or "disable" methods, this does that, depending on if the box is checked or not. As a side note, you can place as much as you want inside a single $(function() { }); wrapper, you don't need one for each statement :)
