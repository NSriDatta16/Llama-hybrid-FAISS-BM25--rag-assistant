jQuery Get Previous and Next element on Drag

I am trying to do a timeline. The timeline have few dynamically keyframe elements placed with absolute position on random positions. Is there a way to get the Previous and Next element relative to a draggable dragger? Something like "if the #dragger is at left:55px, the next element is .keyframe 102px at left: 102px and previous element is .keyframe 32px at left:32px". I have a demo at http://jsfiddle.net/3pXC9/1/ just drag the red bar around, on drag I should get its "siblings" based on position. Thank you
