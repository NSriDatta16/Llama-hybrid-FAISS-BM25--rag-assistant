How I turn an average desktop PC into server for hosting a website using Ruby on Rails?

What is the best way to turn an average desktop PC into server for hosting a website using Ruby on Rails? I am open to changing operating systems, buying parts if I need to, using whatever Database People recommend and any software. Here are the approximate details of the computer: The computer is an HP Desktop with 1.86GHz Duo Core CPU. Intel chipset. 1GB Ram, 200GB Hard Drive Runs on Windows XP FYI, This is not a commercial project and this is not about saving money. I just want to pick up some new skills and I think it would be fun. Thanks, Jeremy
