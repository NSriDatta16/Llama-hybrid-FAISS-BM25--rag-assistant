What does "1-unit change" mean when centering predictors in regression?

I know that when we standardize a predictor, "one unit change" becomes one standard deviation in the predictor, but what if we only center the data on the mean (i.e. only subtract all values by the mean) ? edit below: bounty This example is from Winter (2019: 139): mutate(SER_c = SER - mean(SER, na.rm = T) term estimate intercept 0.66 SER_c 0.11 POSVerb 0.72 SER_c:POSVerb 0.50 Obs: SER is a continuous predictor and POSVerb is a categorical predictor with two levels (0: Noun, 1: Verb) The author concludes the following: " POSVerb is the difference between nouns and verbs for words with average SER , rather than some arbitrary 0". All right, that makes sense. The intercept should be, then, the value of the outcome variable for the mean of SER. Ok. But, still, what does one-unit change in SER mean? If it wasn't centered, I'd say "one unit change in SER implies + 0.11 points to the outcome variable for the noun category", but I now that the intercept means the value at SER mean, how do I interpret this? this post was helpful, but not enough. Thanks in advance! edit : bounty: Hello, again. Now I have a follow-up question: 1 : My model has a 2-level categorical predictor and a continuous one centered around its mean (no interaction). Should I say "one-unit change in the continuons predictor" or "one-unit change in the mean of the continous predictor" adds X to the mean of each categorical level?
