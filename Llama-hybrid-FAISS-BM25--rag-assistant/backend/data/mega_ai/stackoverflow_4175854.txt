I would start by asking what problem the company expects Requisite Pro to solve for them. More often than not companies select a tool as a band-aid for a process that's fundamentally broken to begin with. If an organization doesn't fix the real problem then they'll end up just spending a bunch of money and get little value out of it. My 2 cents. Brandon
