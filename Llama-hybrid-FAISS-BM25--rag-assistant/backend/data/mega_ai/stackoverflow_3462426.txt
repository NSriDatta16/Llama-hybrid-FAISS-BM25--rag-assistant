Do you have access to change the web site? Probably the most elegant solution would be to abstract the functionality behind the web form into its own class and have the web form and a web service call it. Then create a client application (windows service or scheduled console app... I recommend the latter because it's easier to debug and maintain over time) that hits the web service. The site can still be hit manually if/when needed. If the answer to my first question, however, is "no" then I would suggest a scheduled client app that just builds a web request and fires it off. Does anything more need to be done other than just loading the page in order to initiate the process?
