roughly speaking ML models are automated non linear statistical models. ie in a 'traditional' statistical approach, you would add/iterate over a few well chosen non linear transformations of data, interactions etc and fit using linear model. a typical ML model, eg xgboost, builds trees to capture the interactions and nonlinearities automatically. ( and afaik given a fixed,trained xg boost model you can essentially convert it into a linear regression model, by adding each tree as a non linear transform/interaction of the input - with coefficients representing leaves of the tree.)
