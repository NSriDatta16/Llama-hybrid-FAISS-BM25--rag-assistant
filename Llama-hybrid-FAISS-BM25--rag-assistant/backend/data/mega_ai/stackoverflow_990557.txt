as also one mentioned, don't try to implement a ORM tool yourself, there are a lot of them freely available. But a DAL isn't a ORM tool, the ORM tool will be used within your DAL. The DAL is just for hiding the data access logic from the rest of your app in order to have a more maintainable solution. In the end you could also have normal SQL statements i. your DAO class. What you should pay attention at when creating your DAL is to decouple it as much as possible from the rest of the app/other layers. This can be achieved by coding against interfaces and by using dependency injection. Spring is a great help here (given you program in Java). Beside that, there is no big magic on building such a layer.
