Magento "File was not uploaded"

I'm currently using the magento admin interface, trying to upload an image in the "manage products" and I get the error "file was not uploaded" after I browse the file and click "upload file". I've looked on other forums and the main solution I saw were to make sure that php.ini has the following lines... magic_quotes_gpc = off short_open_tag = on extension=pdo.so extension=pdo_mysql.so I have Windows/IIS with ISAPI_Rewrite. Is there a max file upload size that I can change somewhere. I'm uploading pictures from my local desktop of size ~100kb. help!
