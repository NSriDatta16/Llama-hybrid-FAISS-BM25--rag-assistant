How to recognize names from a text using php

I want to extract name(firstnames and lastnames) from a text using php. Example: From text below I want to extract names(in this case Aline Wright and Jesse Wright) Aline Wright is a cancer survivor, amputee and a newlywed. Wednesday night she began to show signs she was having a stroke. "I started feeling some left arm numbness and a facial droop," said Aline. "It appeared to me that I was probably having a stroke." That's when her husband of four days, Jesse Wright, put her in the car and rushed her to the Erlanger Medical Center. Wright knows an emergency. He is a nurse technician at Erlanger.
