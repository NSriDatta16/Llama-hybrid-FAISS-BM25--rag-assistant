If the input contains unicode characters in the range 4E00-9FFF, then it contains Chinese characters, so the language probably is Chinese, Japanese or Korean. In order to guess whether it is Chinese, you might want to check whether some of the most frequent characters in Chinese language occur in the input (see for example http://www.zein.se/patrick/3000char.html ). Or alternatively, check whether Hiragana (3040–309F), Katakana (30A0–30FF), or Hangeul (1100–11FF) characters occur in the input; they only occur in Japanese and Korean; if they occur in the input, you do not have Chinese language text even though the text contains Chinese characters.
