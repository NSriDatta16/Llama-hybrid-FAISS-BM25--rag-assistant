Are line breaks in XML attribute values allowed?

I realise that it's not elegant or desired, but is it allowed (in well-formed XML) for an attribute value in an XML element to span multiple lines? e.g. Yeah I realise there's better ways of writing that. I would personally write it like: this value goes over... multiple lines! or: But we have our own XML parser and I'd like to know whether the first example is allowed in well-formed XML.
