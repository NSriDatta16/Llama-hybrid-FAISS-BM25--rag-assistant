How to draw a text outside rect in cocoa

I am trying to construct a graph using cocoa.To display the points on x -axis and y- axis i used methods called drawATPoint and drawinRect which allows to draw apoint inside rect not out side . So please mention if there is any solution to display the points.I am using the following code. NSTextStorage *textStorage = [[NsTextStorage alloc]initWithString:@"0.0"]; [textStorage drawAtPoint:NSMakePoint(0,0)];
