How to evaluate an Earth system model in light of the spatial variability of observed variables?

Context My effort is to evaluate the performance of a physics-based numerical model to determine how well it simulates different state variables of a soil column (1D inside the model). The temporal scale of the evaluation is daily, and the spatial scale of the model output is point-scale. One of the evaluation metrics I use is the coefficient of determination, $R^2$ (the square of Pearson $r$ ). Question To judge the model performance in simulating soil moisture dynamics at a certain depth and for a given period, how can I incorporate the given information: the R $^2$ between two adjacent soil moisture at the depth of interest is 0.2 (Figure a)? This could be an indication of high spatial variability of soil moisture in the natural system. The R $^2$ between the model and average of the sensor measurements is 0.23 (Figure b). What are the different ways to judge the model performance? I tend to think of the low R $^2$ (0.2) between the sensors as a low benchmark. Therefore, I will not deem the model as an inadequate one if the R $^2$ between the model and observations is not higher than 0.2.
