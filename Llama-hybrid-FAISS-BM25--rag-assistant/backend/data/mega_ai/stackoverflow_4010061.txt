The short answer would be no . Now, I am going to elaborate why . Correctly i18n-ed mail message supports these features: Internationalized Domain Names (IDNA) support for From and To headers (as well as CC, BCC, Reply-To, etc.) Recognizable and safe encoding of Subject and other headers Correct body encoding For the time being, i18n-ed domain names are basic ASCII strings, encoded via Punycode (you can read more about it in RFC 3492 , RFC 5891 and RFC 5890 ). To cut a long story short, you should use IdnMapping class to convert from UTF-16 string to ASCII (which you can do by calling GetAscii() method. By safe encoding for subject line and other (non-address like) headers, I meant that for the time being, it should still be 7-bit safe, as quite a few old and outdated Mail Transfer Agents does not support 8-bit encodings here. Therefore you can actually support user's choice here, but if user choses something like ISO-8859-x, KOI-8-x, or Shift-JIS, I would recommend to further encode headers using Quoted Printable or Base64 algorithm, just to make sure. If user choses UTF-8, you can encode headers with UTF-7 as well as QP or B64. Last but not least, you can and even should support user chosen encoding for e-mail message body. However, if it is 16-bit base (like UCS2 or UTF-16), I would recommend to set the Transfer Encoding to something like Base64.
