One solution is to navigate to the private directory from within testsub , get a function handle to the private function you want using STR2FUNC , then navigate back to do the testing using that function handle. You could even put these steps in a separate helper function for your unit testing, like so: function privateFcn = get_private_fcn(privateDir,fcnName) oldDir = cd(privateDir); %# Change to the private directory privateFcn = str2func(fcnName); %# Get a function handle cd(oldDir); %# Change back to the original directory end And you would use this function in testsub as follows: function testsub() privateDir = '...\project_root\code\private'; %# The path to the private %# directory privateFcn = get_private_fcn(privateDir,'sub'); %# Call get_private_fcn assertElementsAlmostEqual(privateFcn(), 123); %# Apply your test end This works, although the MATLAB Editor gives me an M-Lint warning for using the function CD : "MCC use of the CD function is problematic." I think it's safe for you to ignore this warning since 1) the function get_private_fcn changes the current directory, then immediately changes it back after getting the function handle and 2) you're not dealing with a deployed application .
