Cloning a C# Reference Type to a Derived Reference Type

Coming from a C++ background, I am finding cloning of objects in C# a little hard to get used to. To clear up some of my confusion, I am looking for an elegant way to clone an object of a base type to a derived type. To illustrate: public class Base { public string Member1; public int Member2; public float Member3; public bool Member4; } public class Derived : Base { public List Children; } Base base = new Base(); And with that I want to create an instance of "Derived" whilst doing a memberwise copy of the Base object - preferably without assigning them manually. Note: Maybe this would be more suited to a value type?
