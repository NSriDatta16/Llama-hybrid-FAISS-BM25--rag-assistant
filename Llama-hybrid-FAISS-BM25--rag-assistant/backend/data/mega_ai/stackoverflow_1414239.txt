If the data has to be sent, I would wait until the transfer's done in applicationWillTernimate:. As far as I know, the application won't quit if you block the thread in applicationWillTerminate.(Correct me if I'm wrong). But be careful, if the data is huge or the user's internet speed sucks, you should quit anyway and resume the transfer next time. Set up a timer to check timeout is suggested. Attention: This may be rejected by App Store.
