how and what parameter to choose for a random forest classifier?

I am building a random forest classifier for DoS/DDoS attack detection , it is a binary classification problem. While tuning the parameters I got confused about what parameters to focus on exactly and what values I should choose. I chose some parameters as shown in the code, but I kept thinking what if I didn't include that one value that would give me the best result. So my question is, from all the random forest's parameters , what parameters to focus on and which values I should give them? #hyperparametres tuning #finding best params forest = RandomForestClassifier() params = { 'n_estimators': [100,150,200], 'max_features': ['auto','log2'], 'max_depth' : [4,5,6,7], 'min_samples_split' :[2,3,4,5,6], 'max_samples': [100,150,200,250] } CV_rfc = GridSearchCV(estimator=forest, param_grid=params, cv= 5) CV_rfc.fit(x_train, y_train) CV_rfc.best_params_
