Training a model with only averages of ground truth labels

I have a large dataset of feature vectors, and I want to predict some value from them using either linear regression or a neural network. I do not have ground truth labels for each sample separately, but I do have ground truth for label averages of groups of 100 samples. For each sample, I know which group it belongs to and the average label of that group. What is the best way to train on this type of dataset? Should I average the feature vectors of each group, so that every averaged sample has a label? Or should I train on the individual samples, and assume that all samples within a group have the same label (the average label)? Does the answer to this question depend on whether I am using linear regression or a neural network? Is there a different model for prediction more suitable for this case?
