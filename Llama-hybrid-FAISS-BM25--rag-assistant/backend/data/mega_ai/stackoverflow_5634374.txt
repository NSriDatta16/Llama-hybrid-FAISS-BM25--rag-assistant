Your javascript will only be allowed a short time before it is aborted: JavaScript running on the Mini server will only run for a couple of seconds before pausing, for resource constraint reasons. This applies to JavaScript run due to an event firing e.g. onload, as well as code run because of a user action. ~ http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-mini-web-content-authoring-guidelines/#javascript So the best would be to serve the least javascripty version of your site to the Opera Mini user-agent.
