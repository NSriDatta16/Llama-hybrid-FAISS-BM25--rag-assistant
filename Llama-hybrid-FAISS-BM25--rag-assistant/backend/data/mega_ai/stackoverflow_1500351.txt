Possible to launch JWS applet within browser instead of standalone?

Is it possible to embed an applet in HTML so that it will be displayed within the browser window yet launched through Java Web Start via a JNLP file instead of using the browser's Java plugin? If so, how is this done? I've only been able to launch my applet in a standalone window, but disliking the user experience pop-ups create, I'd prefer that it be embedded in the browser window. I'd like to use JWS instead of the plugin because I need to control my applet's maximum heap size, which I don't believe is possible with the browser plugin, at least not on Mac OS 10.5.
