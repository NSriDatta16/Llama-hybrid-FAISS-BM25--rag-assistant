Is it correct if I multiplied datatest with the loadings from the datatraining and get the scores of pca datatesting? It depends on whether the you set cor = TRUE in your call to princomp . In any case, just use predict which will make sure to potentially scale, potentially center, and rotate the data. The code below shows both the "manual" way to get the result and by using predict.princomp pc.cr
