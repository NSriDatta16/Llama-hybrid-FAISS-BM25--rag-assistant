You should use the mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) method of the MouseAdapter class. As you drag your main window around, you will get many of these mouseDragged events - handle each one by moving the second window around to a position that's relative to the location of the main window. If you see 'lag' or if it doesn't reposition until the main window stops, try forcing Swing to repaint by calling repaint() on the second window after repositioning and/or by putting your repositioning code inside a SwingUtilities.invokeLater(...) block: SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { // your logic here } }); Let me know if this helps.
