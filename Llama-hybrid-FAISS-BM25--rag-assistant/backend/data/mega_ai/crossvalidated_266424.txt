This is a very nice compact introduction to the basic ideas! Reinforcement Learning I think your use case description of reinforcement learning is not exactly right. The term classify is not appropriate. An better description would be: I don't know how to act in this environment , can you find a good behavior and meanwhile I'll give you feedback . In other words, the goal is rather to control something well, than to classify something well. Input The environment which is defined by all possible states possible actions in the states The reward function dependent on the state and/or action Algorithm The agent is in a state takes an action to transfer to another state gets a reward for the action in the state Output The agent wants to find an optimal policy which maximizes the reward
