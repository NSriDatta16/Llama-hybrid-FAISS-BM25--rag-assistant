C++ new / new[], how is it allocating memory?

I would like to now how those instructions are allocating memory. For example what if I got code: x = new int[5]; y = new int[5]; If those are allocated how it actually looks like in RAM? Is whole block reserved for each of the variables or block(memory page or how-you-call-it - 4KB of size on 32bit) is shared for 2 variables? I couldn't find answer for my question in any manual. Thanks for all replies. I found on wikipedia: Internal fragmentation of pages Rarely do processes require the use of an exact number of pages. As a result, the last page will likely only be partially full, wasting some amount of memory. Larger page sizes clearly increase the potential for wasted memory this way, as more potentially unused portions of memory are loaded into main memory. Smaller page sizes ensure a closer match to the actual amount of memory required in an allocation. As an example, assume the page size is 1024KB. If a process allocates 1025KB, two pages must be used, resulting in 1023KB of unused space (where one page fully consumes 1024KB and the other only 1KB). And that was answer for my question. Anyway thanks guys.
