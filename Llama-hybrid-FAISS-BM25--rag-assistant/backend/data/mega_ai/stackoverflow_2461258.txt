If you don't know how big the other queued files are, then there's no way to accurately display a percentage value that's relevant and proportional to the required time. A number of workarounds come to mind: One approach that looks like you know but are in fact deceiving the user would be to assume all the queued files are the same size as the file in progress, or the average of files processed so far. Based on this, the progress bar would be showing "the truth" if all files are indeed the same size, and would be very off if sizes differ significantly. Another approach would be for your second progress bar to show not the percentage of bytes transferred but the percentage of files. Thus, if you have 4 files, that bar would hop from 0 to 25% to 50% to 75% to 100%. It wouldn't accurately reflect time taken but at least you wouldn't be lying. You can do even worse with an approach like Microsoft's: Make your progress bar's growth asymptotically slower as it approaches 100%, so that it never actually reaches the end. All the user sees is constantly closer values of "almost finished." Such a display looks cool but is in effect giving the user the least possible information.
