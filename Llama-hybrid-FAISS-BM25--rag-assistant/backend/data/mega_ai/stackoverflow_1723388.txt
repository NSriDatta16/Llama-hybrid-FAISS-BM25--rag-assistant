I have no problem with the long example. I see that you are repackaging compound data very elegantly. It's the short ones that will drive your colleagues to investigate the advantages of voluntary institutionalization. Please declare some kind of constant to hold your format string and use "that String.Format-thing over and over". As a C# programmer, I know what that does without looking elsewhere for home-spun functions. That way, when I need to know what the formatted string will look like, I can just examine the constant.
