Does training time of CNN includes the validation time performed after every epoch?

I want to record train time of a CNN architecture in keras. My question is that while we are training a CNN, we also validate the model after every epoch to monitor that how well it generalizes which actually gives us a pretty good idea about our model performance. Now, if I have to report training time of this model, will I be considering only the training time or I have to include the validation time too. Secondly, the training time reported in published literature of CNN, does it include the validation time after every epoch or just the train time without any validation on a separate dataset (other than train)?
