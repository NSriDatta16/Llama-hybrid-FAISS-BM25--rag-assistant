Magnitude of a relationship

If I run Pearson correlation between Variable A (buyer/nonbuyer of ice-cream) and Variable B (buyer/nonbuyer of yoghurt) and have: Ho as "There is no relationship between...." Ha as "There is a strong relationship..." then what would "strong" mean in this context ? Is the meaning of "strong" dependent on the context of my study or are there some guidelines on what is strong (as opposed to - I presume - "weak" or "average"). Is this something to do with "one-tail" and "two-tail" testing?
