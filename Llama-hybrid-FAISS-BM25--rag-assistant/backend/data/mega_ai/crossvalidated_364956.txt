Choosing the number of labels in a multiclass classification problem

I've recently come accross a multilabel classification problem. Here, multiple labels can be simultaneously assigned to a single instance. I am interesting how one determines the number of labels to be predicted on an instance level. Normally, if only one label per instance is given, one does: $$ P_x = argmax (P_{i \dots j}) $$, i.e., the label with the highest probability is selected. What if multiple labels are possible (e.g., recommendation systems, where a person can like multiple movies?). I understand, that a neural network, for example, already yields a vector and one could do $$P_x > 0.5$$, yet this does not seem as the best option, or is it? Thank you.
