Polynomial degree is only used for the polynomial kernel, so "tuning" degree while using the RBF kernel is just wasted time. Gamma is only used for the RBF kernel, so tuning it with a polynomial kernel is likewise a waste. Gamma can be any positive number; the heuristic values 'scale' and 'auto' might or might not be useful for your problem. C can be any positive number; the range to $[0,1]$ is implausibly restrictive. Given these facts, and your stated goal of reducing the time it takes to tune the SVR, my recommendation is to just use a RBF kernel and only tune C and gamma. RBF kernels generally perform well on a wide range of problems, so it's a safe default. Some suggestions for $C$ and $\gamma$ in the case of the RBF kernel: Which search range for determining SVM optimal C and gamma parameters?
