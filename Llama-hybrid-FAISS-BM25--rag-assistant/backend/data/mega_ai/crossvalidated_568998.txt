The answer by Stephan Kolassa works, but it is not general as noted in the answer by knrumsey. Several questions here have had similar issues with the overlap/double counting. For methods to solve this see Probability of a similar sub-sequence of length X in two sequences of length Y and Z A fair die is rolled 1,000 times. What is the probability of rolling the same number 5 times in a row? Below is an example of a Markov chain that can be used to solve it. In this case it is case insensitive (if we have x correct letters then there are two possible letters, upper case and lower case, that can be added to get x+1 correct letters) To compute the probability you take the appropriate power of the matrix that describes the Markov chain. library(matrixcalc) stateNames In the above links, there are examples of how to compute estimates of the solution obtained with this Markov chain.
