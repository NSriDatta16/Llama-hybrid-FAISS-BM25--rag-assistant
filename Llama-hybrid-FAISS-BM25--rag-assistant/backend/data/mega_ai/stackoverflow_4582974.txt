What's the most elegant lambda expression (action) that does nothing?

So I currently have the following code: BCLThread bclThread = new BCLThread(() => Thread.Sleep(0)); because I can't think of another way to state that I actually don't want that method to do a thing. Is there any other more elegant way of achieving this? Thanks
