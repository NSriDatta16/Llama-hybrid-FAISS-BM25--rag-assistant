The release plugin doesn't have built-in support for this, to my knowledge. Two possibilities come to mind: Option 1: Don't include the pom in your jars - you can control this using the 'archive' parameter to the jar goal. false Write a program to strip out the elements you don't want in your published POM. You'd have to do this between release:prepare and release:perform, which would probably only work if you have support in your SCM for modifying tags after creation, or do the modification under a different tag/branch and then release:perform from there. I think Option 1 is yucky. Option 2: try to leverage the preparationGoals parameter to the release plugin. If you can write the pom manipulation as maven actions, it might be possible to do it this way. I think Option 2 is harder. If none of that works, you'll probably have to use something like release:stage and do the sanitizing by hand, but you'd still want to exclude the POMs from the jar contents.
