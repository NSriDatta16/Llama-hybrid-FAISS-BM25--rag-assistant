The filters in a CNN are also 3D volumes. The width and height of a filter is a hyper parameter, but the depth is usually equal to the depth of whatever the filter is convolving with. With a filter size of 5, your first layer filters will have dimension 5x5x3 because they are convolving with your input image that has a depth of 3. The feature map produced is only 2D because after you multiply a 5x5x3 area of the image together with a filter, you sum together all 5x5x3 (75) values produced into just one value that can be thought of as a single number representing how similar that area of the image is to the filter. This is a very common question here and I'm still not sure why there is a lack of information about it. For your second question you should have 96+96=192 different feature maps created if you had two layers and both layers had 96 filters each. One feature map is created for each filter.
