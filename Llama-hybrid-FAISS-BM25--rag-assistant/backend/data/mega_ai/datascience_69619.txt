If you want to reduce the number of classes you are predicting over, then you could manually map them to a simpler set (i.e. map poodle, greyhound to dog ) OR if you don't have the domain knowledge you can cluster your data and predict the cluster instead of their original labels. You could use PCA or t-SNE to reduce the number of dimensions before clustering. This is best practice if you have many features (~>100) as you will often run into the curse of high dimensionality.
