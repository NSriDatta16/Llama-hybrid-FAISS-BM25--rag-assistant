VCL alternative to IStorage

To preface I am using Borland C++ and the VCL. I need some sort of structured storage object which can be saved to disk as a single file and can contain multiple named blobs of binary data which I can programatically enumerate, access and manipulate. The IStorage interface seems to be close what I want but I would prefer a VCL style solution as converting TStream's (VCL) to IStream's among other things gets awkward and their must be a simpler solution using the VCL stuff allready available, like a TIniFile but for binary data. I don't want to use XML as the binary data blobs are very large and when correctly encoded for use in XML it's completely inneficient. Thanks in advance for all suggestions.
