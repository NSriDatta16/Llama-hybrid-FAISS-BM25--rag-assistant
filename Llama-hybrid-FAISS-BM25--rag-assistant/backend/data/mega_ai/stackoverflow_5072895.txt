SWT: Drag-and-drop Internal Object

My application has a canvas and a table, I need to add drag-and-drop capabilities to it. However, I read in a tutorial that Transfer converts the data I want to move into a platform-independent type. I have no need to drag anything outside of my program, and it's important that the exact object be sent. How can this be done?
