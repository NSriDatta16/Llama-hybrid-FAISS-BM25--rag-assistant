Percentiles or average ranks can actually be decent summaries when you have perhaps more than two tests. For two tests the adequacy of averaging percentiles is less clear. But first make sure that percentiling for one test is a good idea. Percentiling implies that the absolute scores are not properly quantifying an attribute, and that the appropriate way to judge one individual is only in regards to how that individual competes with others. When you want to reward or instill competition, use percentiles.
