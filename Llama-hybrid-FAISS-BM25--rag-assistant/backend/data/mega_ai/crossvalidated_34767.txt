Why is tf-idf used in conjunction with SVMs for classifying documents?

Term frequency - inverse document frequency is term count within a document weighted against the term's ubiquity within the corpus. This weight is based on the principle that terms occurring in almost every document are therefore less specific to an individual document and should be scaled down so that a tf-idf value represents the term's relative importance within a document. However, won't an SVM using a linear classifier appropriately weight term frequency within a document? Wouldn't it automatically account for ubiquitous terms and decrease their weight respectively?
