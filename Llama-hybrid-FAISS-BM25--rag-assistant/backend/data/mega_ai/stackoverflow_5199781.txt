Seeing large area of UIScrollView background when zoomed-in & pan down

Problem : The problem I’m having is when I zoom into my UIScrollView (with paging enabled), and then I pan (scroll?) down – I can drag well past my view and see a large area of the scrollview’s background. The further I'm zoomed-in, the more of the UIScrollView's background is exposed. (I have set the scrollview's background to green so I can tell what I’m looking at). Not sure why the background area is exposed like that...? I've played around with setting the scrollview's frame size, bounds size, content size etc. in various locations to no avail. Unfortunately I cannot post screenshots of whats happening due to being a new user :( Further details: My app’s main view contains a full-screen sized UIScrollView populated with a number of UIView subviews. These subviews are added to the scrollview by creating the nib names in a for loop, and then retrieving them using the loadNibNamed method to create & add the UIView. Each of these UIViews were designed in IB and contain the following: A UIImageView whose image attribute is set to a .jpg image, another smaller UIScrollView below that, and a transparent UIView over top of my imageview which contains a bunch of custom UIButtons. After I populate my scrollView, I set some of it’s attributes such as contentSize, pagingEnabled, min & maxZoomScale, etc. & then set it’s delegate to self (MainViewController). MainViewController's relevant methods: @implementation MainViewController_iPhone @synthesize scrollView, loadedNibView; // Implement viewDidLoad to do additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib. - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; [self loadNibs]; [self initializeOrientation]; } -(void) loadNibs { currentPage = 0; for (int i = 0; i And it's .h: @interface MainViewController_iPhone : MainViewController { IBOutlet UIScrollView *scrollView; //The main ScrollView that scrolls between pages of different images to search UIView *loadedNibView; //The UIView that we load from it's corresponding nib (i.e. IMG1_iPhone.xib) int currentPage; } //methods -(void) loadNibs; - (UIView *)viewForZoomingInScrollView:(UIScrollView *)myScrollView; - (void)scrollViewWillBeginZooming:(UIScrollView *)myScrollView withView:(UIView *)view; - (void)scrollViewDidEndZooming:(UIScrollView *)myScrollView withView:(UIView *)view atScale:(float)scale; - (void)scrollViewDidZoom:(UIScrollView *)myScrollView; - (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)myScrollView; //properties @property (nonatomic, retain) UIScrollView *scrollView; @property (nonatomic, retain) UIView *loadedNibView; @end Any ideas/advice would be greatly appreciated...Thanks!
