The reason of overfitting is generally because of the high(unnecessary) complexity model. So if you train a too complex(large) model, you will get a high training accuracy and low test set accuracy. Then you can start to fight with overfitting with getting more data , dropout , regularization , early stopping , global average pooling , feature scale clipping or dropping some of layers from your network .
