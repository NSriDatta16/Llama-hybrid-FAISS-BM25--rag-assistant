tag being split accross multiple lines when genereated from MasterPage

I have created a website in VS 2008 (C#) that is using masterpages. In the ASPX pages that are based off the masterpage I'm using the @ PAGE title directive to set the title of the genereated HTML page. When I run the page on my development system the title displays correctly i nthe browser. However when I view the source code in the browser the tag is being broken into 3 lines. My Page Title ...other meta tags... That looks very strage to me. Is there something that I am doing wrong to cause the type of behavior? Will search engines look down on this syntax with the line breaks? I'm expecting output like this: My Page Title ...other meta tags...
