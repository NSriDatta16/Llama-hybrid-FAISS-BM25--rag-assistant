You're correct but for any given error distribution the two are related by a simple scaling constant; for example, with normal errors and large samples the mean (absolute) deviation, MD of the residuals, is $\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}$ (~80%) of the standard deviation or equivalently the standard deviation is about 25% larger than the mean deviation. As such, under some assumption about the error distribution, the standard deviation of the errors does in fact tell you something about the average distance of observations from the mean. More generally, the RMS distance is always at least as large as the mean absolute distance, but it's typically only a moderate percentage larger; such relationships can be useful. RMS distance (i.e. standard deviation) is also arguably a sort of weighted-average-distance where the observation weights are proportional to the individual distances.
