Bayesian hierarchical model on large data as a meta-analysis

I would like to fit a mixed effects model on a large dataset, and with a large number of parameters, which makes it computationally prohibitive. As an alternative, I considered fitting (1) multiple group-level models (with flat priors), (2) approximating the posterior of each group-level model with a multivariate normal, and (3) fitting the hierarchical part to the approximations of group-level posteriors. In other words, the actual hierarchical model wouldn't use the data, but only estimates of group-level models. The fact that so far I haven't read about this being done routinely makes me think that this might be a bad idea. I'd appreciate either any explanations of why this is not a good idea, or any pointers to literature on this or a similar methodology.
