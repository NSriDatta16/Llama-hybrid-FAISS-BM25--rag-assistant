I have the impression that neural networks are not the right tool for the task. Instead, I think you need to identify the source gaussians in the data using expectation maximization of a gaussian mixture model . This step outputs means and covariance matrices of the two gaussians that generated the data. In the second step, you can use a simple Bayesian classifier and evalue probability of the output coming from either of the gaussians ($y=1$ or $y=2$) as: $$p(y=1|x)=\frac{\mathcal{N}(x|\mu_1, \sigma_1)p(y=1)}{\mathcal{N}(x|\mu_1, \sigma_1)p(y=1) + \mathcal{N}(x|\mu_2, \sigma_2)p(y=2)}$$
