If we make these assumptions: The Array instance is held in a variable named employees The Array holds a collection of instances that all respond to the message lastName by returning a String instance You want to sort the collection in ascending order Then you can get the job done with the following code fragment: employees asSortedCollection: [ :a :b | a lastName This code sends the asSortedCollection: keyword message to the Array instance named employees . It passes in the Block instance, delimited by the square brackets, as the parameter to that keyword message. The Block passed in has two arguments that are named a and b and are marked by the preceding colon character all before the | character. The code within the Block after the | character will then be used to sort all the elements from the employees Array and add them to a new instance of the class SortedCollection. Note, though, that this code ends up returning a new collection that holds the same items also held by employees , but now in the desired order. In fact, that new collection holds onto the sort criteria (the Block instance that was used as the parameter to the asSortedCollection: message) and as you add more instances to that collection in the future they will automatically be inserted in the correct sort order.
