using unsupervised learning algorithms on images

I am working on a project to classify images of types of cloth (shirt, tshirt, pant etc). While this is a standard supervised classification problem, the accuracy of the neural network is not good. This is because of the close similarity of the types of cloth that I am trying to classify. I am working with 9 classes with around 10,000 images per class. For the classification problem I tried using CNN to classify the images. But over fitting took place with a good training accuracy (around 95%), but not so great validation accuracy (around 77%). I wanted to know if there was any way I could create clusters based on the type of cloth using some unsupervised learning algorithm like K Means or DBScan.
