jQuery UI: Can an object be selectable and draggable simultaneously?

I have objects that I want to be both draggable and selectable. Is this possible? var course_li = $(sprintf(' %s ', already_scheduled_class, course["fields"]["name"])); // ... course_li.draggable(DRAGGABLE_COURSE_SETTINGS); // ... if (in_course) { course_li.draggable('disable'); } // ... $(".course").selectable(); // fail Everything is good until it gets to that last line. That appears to cause an exception in jQuery: elem.ownerDocument is null This occurs on line 4691 of jQuery.js (1.4.2): var defaultView = elem.ownerDocument.defaultView; Am I doing something wrong here, or is selectable and draggable just incompatible?
