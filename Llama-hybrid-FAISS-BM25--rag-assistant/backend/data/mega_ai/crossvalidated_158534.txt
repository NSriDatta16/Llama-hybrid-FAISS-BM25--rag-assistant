This paper presents term weighting schemes for LDA, and reports improved precision on an example retrieval task. I've not verified these results, and it doesn't mention an available software implementation, but this may be a good place to start. In brief, it suggests using term weight rather than raw count, and presents a few different weighting schemes (logarithmic and point-wise mutual information). If you'd like to go further, you may wish to peruse the subsequent papers citing this one.
