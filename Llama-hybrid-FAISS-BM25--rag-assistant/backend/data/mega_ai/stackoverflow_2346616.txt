Need clarifications in C-style, reinterpret, and const casts

Am I right in assuming that C-style casts (which are discouraged) are nothing but reinterpret_casts? Using the latter is visually striking and easy to search when looking for nasty casts, and hence it's recommended over C-style casts? If casting away const using const_cast and writing to a originally const object is undefined, what is the purpose of const_cast? Note: I know that Bjarne rightly condemns casting operations that they are unsafe and even goes to the extent of stating "An ugly operation should have an ugly syntactic form." and hence the verbosity of casting operators in C++. So I'll try to minimize their usage. Promise. :)
