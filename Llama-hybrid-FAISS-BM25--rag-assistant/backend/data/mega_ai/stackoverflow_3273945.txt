Cocos2d: Detect touch on rotated sprite?

How would one detect a touch on a rotated CCSprite? I am familiar with the general technique of using ccTouchesBegan and contentSize, anchorPoint etc. to have a sprite detect if a touch was within its bounds ... but I am not sure how to proceed once the sprite has been rotated by some angle. I want the sprite itself to detect the touch (encapsulation) and report the event via a delegate to another object. If anyone has some code to share ... would be great.
