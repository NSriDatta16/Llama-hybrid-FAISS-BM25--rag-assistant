MemoryError for ScikitLearn Kernel PCA

I have a data set consisting of roughly 170,000 input vectors having 3,000 features each. On this data set I would like to perform a Kernel PCA using scikit-learn . Unfortunately, any attempt always results in: MemoryError I'm on a PC having 32 GB of RAM and setting the copy_X parameter to 'false' doesn't help. Any suggestions?
