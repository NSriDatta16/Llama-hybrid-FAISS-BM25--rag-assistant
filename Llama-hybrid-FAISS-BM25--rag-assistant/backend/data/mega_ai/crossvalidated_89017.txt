Formal test for heteroscedasticity

Are there any formal tests for heteroscedasticity for non-normal data? I want to run the test on time series logged returns, so would it be okay to assume a linear relationship? To me it makes intuitive sense that the greater the return (rise or fall in price) the greater the variance.
