flex datagrid columns drag

I have a data grid where users can drag columns and reposition them. But there is a strange requirement that some columns should not be draged to the left of some other column. eg, assume the columns are : name, price , start date, end date, The end date should not be dragged and placed before the start date. i.e. The user can have start date, price , name , end date. name, start date, price , end date. But at no point can end date appear before start date. Is there a way to do this flex? Is there a way to know where the user is trying to drop the column and show error message ?
