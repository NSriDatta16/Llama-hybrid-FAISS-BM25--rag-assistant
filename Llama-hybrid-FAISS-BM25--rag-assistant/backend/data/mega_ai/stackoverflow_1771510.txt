Why does this IF statement return false?

I have two text boxes and I want skip a block of code only when both are empty: if (txtBox1.Text.Trim() != string.Empty && txtBox2.Text.Trim() != string.Empty ) { // Do something } If either of the text boxes has something, I want the //Do something part to execute. Only when both are empty do I want to skip. However the above code fragment doesn't work. Why?
