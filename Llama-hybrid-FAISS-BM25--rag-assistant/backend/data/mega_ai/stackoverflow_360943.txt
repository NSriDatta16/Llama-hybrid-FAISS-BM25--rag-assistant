read text from file and apply some operations on it

I have a problem on how to read text from file and perform operations on it for example i have this text file that include //name-//sex---------//birth //m1//m2//m3 fofo, male, 1986, 67, 68, 69 momo, male, 1986, 99, 98, 100 Habs, female, 1988, 99, 100, 87 toto, male, 1989, 67, 68, 69 lolo, female, 1990, 89, 80, 87 soso, female, 1988, 99, 100, 83 now i know how to read line by line till i reach null . but this time I want later to perform and average function to get the average of the first colume of numbers m1 and then get the average of m1 for females only and for males only and some other operations that i can do no problem I need help i don't know how to get it what i have in mind is to read each line in the text file and put it in a string then split the string (str.Split(','); ) but how to get the m1 record on each string I'm really confused should i use regex to get the integers ? should i use an array 2d? I'm totally lost, any ideas? please if u can improve any ideas by a code sample that will be great and a kindness initiation from u. and after i done it i will post it for you guys to check. { as a girl I Think I made the wrong decision to join the IT community :-( }
