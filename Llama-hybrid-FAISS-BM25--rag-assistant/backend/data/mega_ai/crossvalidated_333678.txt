Explained variance in logistic regression based on regression coefficients

I am wondering about the relation between the explained variance and the regression coefficients in logistic regression. So given a multiple linear regression $y_i = \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \beta_k x_{ki} + e_i$, I know that $R^2$ can be simplified to $ R^2 = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \beta^2_k + 2 \sum_{k So given that we now the values of the regression coefficients and their interrelation $\rho_{kk'}$ we can determine $R^2$ for the linear case. Is there an equivalent in logistic regression? How would it work?
