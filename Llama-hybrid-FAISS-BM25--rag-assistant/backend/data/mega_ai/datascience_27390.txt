Speaking of ' $99\%$ of the points in a hypercube ' is a bit misleading since a hypercube contains infinitely many points. Let's talk about volume instead. The volume of a hypercube is the product of its side lengths. For the 50-dimensional unit hypercube we get $$\text{Total volume} = \underbrace{1 \times 1 \times \dots \times 1}_{50 \text{ times}} = 1^{50} = 1.$$ Now let us exclude the boundaries of the hypercube and look at the ' interior ' (I put this in quotation marks because the mathematical term interior has a very different meaning). We only keep the points $x = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{50})$ that satisfy $$ 0.05 What is the volume of this ' interior '? Well, the ' interior ' is again a hypercube, and the length of each side is $0.9$ ( $=0.95 - 0.05$ ... it helps to imagine this in two and three dimensions). So the volume is $$\text{Interior volume} = \underbrace{0.9 \times 0.9 \times \dots \times 0.9}_{50 \text{ times}} = 0.9^{50} \approx 0.005.$$ Conclude that the volume of the ' boundary ' (defined as the unit hypercube without the ' interior ') is $1 - 0.9^{50} \approx 0.995.$ This shows that $99.5\%$ of the volume of a 50-dimensional hypercube is concentrated on its ' boundary '. Follow-up: ignatius raised an interesting question on how this is connected to probability. Here is an example. Say you came up with a (machine learning) model that predicts housing prices based on 50 input parameters. All 50 input parameters are independent and uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$ . Let us say that your model works very well if none of the input parameters is extreme: As long as every input parameter stays between $0.05$ and $0.95$ , your model predicts the housing price almost perfectly. But if one or more input parameters are extreme (smaller than $0.05$ or larger than $0.95$ ), the predictions of your model are absolutely terrible. Any given input parameter is extreme with a probability of only $10\%$ . So clearly this is a good model, right? No! The probability that at least one of the $50$ parameters is extreme is $1 - 0.9^{50} \approx 0.995.$ So in $99.5\%$ of the cases, your model's prediction is terrible. Rule of thumb: In high dimensions, extreme observations are the rule and not the exception.
