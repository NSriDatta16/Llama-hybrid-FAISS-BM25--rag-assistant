Mysql - second auto_increment col with diff behaviour

I have a proposals table like this - ID (auto_increment) - proposal_id - client_id There a way in sql that the proposal_id increments just for each client_id example: ID proposal_id client_id 1 1 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 4 3 1 5 2 2 6 3 2 i know i can get the last poposal_id and +1 and i add the new entry... but i dont want to do a sql instruction just to get this value... instead i want to use in a sql!
