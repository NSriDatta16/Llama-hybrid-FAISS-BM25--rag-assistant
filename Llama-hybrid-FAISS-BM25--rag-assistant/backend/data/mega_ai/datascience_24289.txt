I assume that you are solving a supervised classification problem, that is, you train your model on a labeled sample. I can think of two approaches to this problem. I. Classify tags, use neighbor tags for the features For each tag you can calculate features like: (x, y) distances to the closest image (x, y) distances to the closest image above this tag number of images near this tag ... Such features could be fed into any classifier like SVM or decision tree. II Classify pairs of tags For each tag $i$, you can consider all other tags $j$ and predict probability that $i$ is a caption of image $j$. This prediction may be based on concatenation of: features of $i$ features of $j$ joint features of $i$ and $j$, like vertical and horizontal distance from $i$ to $j$. After these probabilities are predicted, you can classify $i$ as a caption indeed, if any of these probabilities exceeds some threshold.
