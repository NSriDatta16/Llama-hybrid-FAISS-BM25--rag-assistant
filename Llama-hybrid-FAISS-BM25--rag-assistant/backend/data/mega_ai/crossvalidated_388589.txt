We don't usually say that a confidence interval is biased or not. That is a property of an estimator (here: $\hat{f}(x)$ ). But yes it's a result of Slutsky's theorem that if $n(\hat{f}(x) - f(x)) \rightarrow_d N(\mu, \sigma)$ then $E(\hat{f}(x)) = f(x) + \mu/n$ where $\mu/n$ is a bias. The main operating characteristic of a CI is its coverage. We can calculate the % of coverage of the CI. For instance, if the 95% CI only captures the $f(x)$ 50% of the time, we can say the CI is anticonservative in that it reflects too optimistically the level of precision of the estimate. Coverage higher than the nominal level implies an estimator is too variable, too low implies the estimator is biased.
