Lets see if i understand this correctly. You are trying to show an image by turning an image, that is placed above it, invisible? It seems that the easier way would be to change the image of the actual imageview your are turning invisible. image.setImageResource(R.drawable. ) Where you change to the name of the image placed inside your res/drawable-hdpi/mdpi/ldpi folder.
