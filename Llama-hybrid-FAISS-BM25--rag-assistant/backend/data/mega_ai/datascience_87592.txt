I would follow two avenues: Combine/concatenate all your datasets and perform some kind of dimensionality reduction (e.g. TSNE, PCA). This can help you visualise which datasets are similar to each other. Your work seems to belong to the class of attribution methods or more recently called explainable AI. This field tries to find the relative contribution of each feature/variable to the target variable. Have a look at this e-book, especially chapter 5. Book . There are methods that can calculate the variable attributions even with no access to the model prediction function (i.e. the function that maps the features to the response variable).
