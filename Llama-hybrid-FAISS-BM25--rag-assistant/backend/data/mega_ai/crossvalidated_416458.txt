I say they can have opposite signs. Let's look at the following simulation. # Set a random seed so that everyone can get the same results # set.seed(1) # Import the library that simulates correlated bivariate data # library(MASS) # Simulate bivariate normal data with standard normal # marginals and 0.9 Pearson correlation. To those 99 # observations, add a gigantic outlier completely out # of the mainstream of the other 99 points. This is why # we end up with negative covariance. # X However, we can take the simulated data as a discrete population. # Apply the empirical CDF function to perform the probability # integral transform. If we regard the sampled data as a # discrete population, we have tricked R into calculating the # population Spearman correlation. # cov(ecdf(X[,1])(X[,1]),ecdf(X[,2])(X[,2])) # Positive, same value as before The "ecdf" (empirical CDF) tricks R into making the population CDF of this discrete variable, so I think we're working at the population level and that this is a counterexample.
