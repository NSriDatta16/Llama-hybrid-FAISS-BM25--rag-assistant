May not really answer you question, but to be honest, if you just want to find one specific object that you know beforehand, I wouldn't use a neural network at all (in my opinion you should use the right tool for a task). For easier tasks like this, you can use more "old school" methods (boo) like template matching . With such approaches you just take an isolated image of your object and, for example, extract a set of features (e.g. using opencv) and then move a rectangle over images where you want to find that object and just compare features. The advantage of such approaches is that you do not really need training data, like you would for training a neural network. If you really, really, really want to use a CNN, you could try to just paste an image of your object into thousands of random images and then take even more images to train a classifier that examines if the object is in the image or not.
