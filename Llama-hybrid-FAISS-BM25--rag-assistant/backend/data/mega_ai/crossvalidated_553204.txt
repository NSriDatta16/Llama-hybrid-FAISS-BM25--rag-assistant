Thanks for the advice guys! However, I ran a multinomial logistic regression, but the problem is that it compares 3 of the behaviours to the 4th of them. I need to see if behaviours on their own differ from a baseline level, let's say "zero". And I couldn't reset that baseline to zero, so the model took behav1 as a baseline and checked how the other behaviours changed... that doesn't answer my question: is the likelihood of one behaviour (or more) higher/ lower when the environmental conditions change?
