Capturing DNS responses with PCap.Net?

Q1 - Is it possible to capture DNS request/responses with the library? Q2 - If yes, once I have the packet does anyone have any sample code that shows how I could extract the fields from the DNS response? In particular the IP address that DNS resolved for the given DNS name provided in particular.
