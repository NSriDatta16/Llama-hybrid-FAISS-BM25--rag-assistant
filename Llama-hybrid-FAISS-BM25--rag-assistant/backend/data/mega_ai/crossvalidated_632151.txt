A good fit of the model but the estimates are very low

I'm trying to model soil quality using the soil quality index (SQI) as a function of earthworm abundance and elevation. The SQI is restricted to values between 0 and 1. I used multiple soil indicators to elaborate the index (soil chemical indicators and biological indicators). More details can be found in those articles(Leul et al., 2023; Obriot et al.,2016). The model summary shows a coefficient of determination of 0.93, but the estimates are very low. here are the results of the summary: Call: lm(formula = SQI ~ Elevation * Earthworm, data = SQI_test) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.07640 -0.01925 0.01111 0.02691 0.04396 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 3.584e-01 2.893e-02 12.391 8.36e-08 *** Elevation 1.772e-04 8.242e-05 2.150 0.05460 .

The data here represent the averages of three replicates, since there is only one value for soil chemical properties per parameter (composite sample) the averages have been calculated to correspond to the soil chemical data
