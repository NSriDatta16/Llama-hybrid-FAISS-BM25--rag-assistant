Both deployment methods (API and Portal) allow you to deploy from a file that is already uploaded to Azure Storage. The VSTS tools are just utilizing this feature behind the scenes. (In 2010 you have to provide storage credentials for this reason). You should look into uploading the .cspkg into a Blob directly (vs through VSTS, and then write up a simple upload client that will break the upload into blocks, which can be uploaded simultaneously. You can then tweak this (block size and # of blocks uploading at a time) to better utilize your outgoing bandwidth. Then you just use the api to "assemble" them in Azure once they are all there. This should really speed up the upload. I think to answer your question as to "whats happening", you are just getting synchronous WebClient I/O to Azure Storage, and all the limitations that come with it.
