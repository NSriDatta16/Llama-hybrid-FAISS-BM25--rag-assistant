Basically, you're looking for outliers in a time series. You're most interested in low outliers (but high outliers might be interesting too). This site already has a lot of information posted on this topic, but I'd like to specifically point you to this answer by Rob Hyndman: The basic idea is to find robust estimates of the trend and seasonal components and subtract them. Then find outliers in the residuals. ( link to question ) In your case, it's a little trickier, as there's a 2 "seasonalities" in your data: minute-of-the-day and day-of-the week. One place to start might be a simple linear regression with dummy variables for minute-of-the-day and day-of-the-week and a simple linear trend variable (number of minutes since the start of the dataset). Fit this model to the data, and then look for outliers on the residuals. Once you've got that working, you can look for more robust estimates of the 2 seasonal periods and the trend, using either loess smoothers, splines, or some variation of the stl function .
