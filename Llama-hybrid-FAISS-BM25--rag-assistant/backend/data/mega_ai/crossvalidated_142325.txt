SVM Three Way Classification

I would like to verify the following methodology for using SVMs for three way classification. That is, the response $Y$ can be either $\{-1, 0, 1\}$: First train an SVM to distinguish between $\{-1,1\}$ and $\{0\}$. Then train an SVM to distinguish between $\{-1,1\}$. For each instance $X$, first use the first SVM, and if it is not $\{0\}$, classify it using the second SVM. My main questions are: Whether this type of thing is common Whether I can possibly get better results by using other combinations, e.g., first distinguishing between $\{-1, 0\}$ and then $\{0, 1\}$?
