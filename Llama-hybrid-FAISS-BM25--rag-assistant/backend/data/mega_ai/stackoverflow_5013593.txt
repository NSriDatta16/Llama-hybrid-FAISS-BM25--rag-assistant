Definite better alternative to ant (and a good successor) is Maven. Maven has advantages over ant, and the plugin development for Maven is going on at a rapid pace. Advantages of Maven (over ant you can say) Dependencies are downloaded automatically Standardized, very consistent layout Standardized, very consistent naming Code coverage Extensive reports maven easily works with JUnit tests Initial couple of hours would be tricky, but once you get accustomed and see the advantages, you would not go back to ant ;-)
