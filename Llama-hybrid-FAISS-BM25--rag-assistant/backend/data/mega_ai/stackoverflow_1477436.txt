how to Use JAXWS/JAXB rename the parameter

I use CXF(2.2.3) to compile the Amazon Web Service WSDL ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/2009-07-15.ec2.wsdl ) But got error as below. Parameter: snapshotSet already exists for method describeSnapshots but of type com.amazonaws.ec2.doc._2009_07_15.DescribeSnapshotsSetType instead of com.amazonaws.ec2.doc._2009_07_15.DescribeSnapshotsSetResponseType. Use a JAXWS/JAXB binding customization to rename the parameter. The conflict was due to the data type show below: I create a binding file try to address the issue...but it didn`t do the job false And the command i used, was like below ${basedir}/src/main/resources/wsdl/EC2_2009-07-15.wsdl -b ${basedir}/src/main/resources/wsdl/Bindings_EC2_2009-07-15.xml What is wrong with my code???? And you can check out my project by using svn.... svn co http://shrimpysprojects.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/smartcrc/AWSAgent/
