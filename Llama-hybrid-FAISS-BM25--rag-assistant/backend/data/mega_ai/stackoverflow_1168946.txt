why is embedding JSON in XML bad?

My gut tells me that putting one format in another is wrong, but I can't seem to come up with concrete reasons. thing versus just putting it in the xml thing b c The two sections are logically going to be parsed by different code, but as an interchange format, is it ok to mix and match syntax? Does your answer change if we have an existing endpoint that parses the JSON response? We would have to recode this endpoint for XML ingestion.
