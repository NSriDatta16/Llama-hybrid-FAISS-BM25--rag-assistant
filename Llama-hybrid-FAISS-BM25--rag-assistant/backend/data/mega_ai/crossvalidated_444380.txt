Confused about meaning of subject-specific coefficients in a binomial generalised mixed-effects model

In * A Comparison of Cluster-Specific and Population-Averaged Approaches for Analyzing Correlated Binary Data* , Neuhas, Kalbfleisch, and Hauck state: "With the cluster-specific approach, the probability distribution of $Y_{ij}$ is modelled as a function of the covariates $X_{ij}$ and parameters $\alpha_{i}$ specific to the $i$ th cluster." I am having trouble getting an intuitive sense of what this means when coefficients are expressed as a single coefficient in a regression output. For example in the analysis referred to in this post, where I tested the effect of week in treatment (measured at 4 time points per individual, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks) and experimental group (two levels: placebo vs active) on the odds of people guessing that they had been allocated to the active group, specified in a binomial generalised linear mixed effects model in the lme4 package in R like so: glmer(guess ~ group * week + (1 | id), data = w24, family = binomial()) The clusters in this model are participant id. The coefficients for the fixed effects were Fixed Effects: (Intercept) group2 weekFac2 weekFac3 10.2474 5.0411 2.8542 -1.8699 weekFac4 group2:weekFac2 group2:weekFac3 group2:weekFac4 0.7396 7.8657 0.8067 9.5187 I just fundamentally don't understand how you can get a single estimate that is "specific to the $i$ th cluster", when there are multiple clusters/participants.
