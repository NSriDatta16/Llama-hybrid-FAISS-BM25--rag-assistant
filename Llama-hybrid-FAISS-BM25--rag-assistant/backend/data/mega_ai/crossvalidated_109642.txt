I suggest you look more carefully at the model before discarding EM. Here are a few points which I hope will help. The most important point is : 1) Ill conditioned result does not suggest EM has messed up. It suggests the problem setup may not be most appropriate. Try making the model simpler. One step where I generally notice scope for improvement is the covariance matrix. Consider making it diagonal to avoid overfitting. 2) It is completely NOT true that EM will not work when you increase the dimension size. On the contrary, if you look up the Probabilistic PCA (Tipping and Bishop), you will notice that as dimension size reduces, most authors recommend the EM algorithm despite the existence of an analytic solution!!! The convergence is much faster. 3) It must be noted that Variational Bayesian approaches like MCMC are extensions of EM so I wouldn't expect a different solution. ILL CONDITIONING HAS TO DO WITH THE NATURE OF THE RESULT. IT IS NOT THE ALGORITHM'S FAULT THAT YOUR SOLUTION IS ILL CONDITIONED. YOU NEED TO MODIFY THE SETUP TO IMPROVE THE CONDITION NUMBER OF YOUR OUTPUT
