How to implement a uniform random walk on a simplex?

I am looking for an uniform random walk algorithm on a simplex for MCMC purposes. Hence the process should on average spent the same time in any given area. I want this to be my proposal algorithm. The Dirichlet distribution has all sorts of problems at proposing samples near the boundaries. This is well documented. The only algorithm I could find was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%3aSkinnerd/Simplex_Point_Picking . It looks like the algorithm will "struggle" to escape when near the boundary of the simplex i.e for values close to zero xnew = xold*random_number. Am I correct in that this algorithm is not a random walk on a simplex? or am I missing something? I implemented the algorithm and as I thought too many samples are at the boundary of the simplex.
