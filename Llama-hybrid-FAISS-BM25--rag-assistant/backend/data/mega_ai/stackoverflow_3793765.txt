JavaScript Google Maps API and web application on IPhone

I have developed a web application for mobile phones that uses JavaScript Google API. It works fine on any Android phone however on IPhone the map is not "dragable" - I can't move the map (I click on a map and try to move it but it stays the same as if I was trying to move a static image). I found some information pointing out that it is a bug on the IPhone side. If it is true - is there any workaround? The application that I developed is used as a web application using JavaScript Google Maps API V3, not the IPhone application. Thanks for any suggestions. Best Regards, sass.
