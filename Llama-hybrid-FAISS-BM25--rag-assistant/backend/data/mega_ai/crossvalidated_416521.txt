How to interpret this PCA plot?

Legend: Each point represents a trial. The circles and pluses represent two different conditions of the experiment. Each color represents a different subject. We used five variables. There are 20 experiments, two of them are pictured above. The axes are the first two principal components (the first two principal components explain an average of ~70% of the variance in all of the experiments) I'm having difficulty drawing meaningful interpretations from these plots. It seems that individual subjects are very consistent when they work under the same condition. Beyond that, I don't know what else to make of it. I cannot post the raw data - my apologies. Does anybody have any suggestions about how to interpret these data? Edit: All of the variables are scaled to mean = 0, sd = 1
