Once in a while the ant script (nbproject/build-impl.xml) will get out of sync with the project (nbproject/project.properties). This is easily fixed by makinga another change to the project to encourage NB to rewrite the ant script. Open the project properties dialog (File > Project properties) and select Compiling . Toggle the state of Compile on Save . Click OK to close the dialog and rewrite the ant script. Give it a moment to be sure it's not busy scanning the project (Status displayed in the bottom right.) Then open the dialog again and toggle the value back. Close the dialog and try compiling again.
