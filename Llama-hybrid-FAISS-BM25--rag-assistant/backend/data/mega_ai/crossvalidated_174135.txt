Applying machine learning in a real world example

I've almost finished the Stanford Machine Learning Course from Andrew Ng . Now I think I am capable of applying algorithms like logistic regression, linear regression, Neural Networks and so on. To practice, I started to look at Titanic Kaggle dataset . I was thinking to apply a Logistic Regression method to the problem. As far as I know, I think I need to make a descriptive analysis of my dataset, for example, to choose the features set. The Andrew Ng course didn't cover this. Whats the importance of make a Descriptive Analysis of dataset before start to train an ML algorithm? Or Is it best to apply a "simple and dirty" ML algorithm to the dataset and start to refine? I was thinking in this course.
