From imakewebthings on Forrst: http://forr.st/~B9d You cannot nest target selectors. Documents can only have one fragment identifier (thing after the #) so there can only be one target. A parent selector would work to keep the parent tab at the desired width, if such a selector existed, but it does not for good reason.
