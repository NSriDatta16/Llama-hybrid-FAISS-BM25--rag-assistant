Yes, preserving this spatial structure is exactly what makes convolutional neural networks so good at their job. Is the operation between weights and inputs in Neural Network going to become element-wise like what it is in RNN? I'm not clear on exactly what you mean by element-wise in this context, but the weights used in a CNN are shared across spatial locations of the input, inducing some sort of translation-invariance/equivariance prior.
