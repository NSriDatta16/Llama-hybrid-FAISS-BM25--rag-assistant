Median can be be calculated in MS Access using just regular queries and without VBA. Median is the 50th percentile. So, create select queries normally; then go into SQL view and include "Top 50 Percent" after select keyword. Sort ascending for bottom 50 percent; sort descending for top 50 percent. Then find maximum of bottom percent result set and minimum of top percent result set. The average of these two is the median. When using "Top 50 Percent", make sure criteria in the query is specific for that result set from which median will be calculated.
