I did this for a large C++ project by using svn blame combined with the output of gcov. If you zip those two results together you have revision information and coverage information for each line. I actually loaded this all into a database to do queries (e.g. show me all the uncovered lines written by joe since r1234 ). If you only want an aggregate number you can just avoid counting 'old' uncovered lines in your total.
