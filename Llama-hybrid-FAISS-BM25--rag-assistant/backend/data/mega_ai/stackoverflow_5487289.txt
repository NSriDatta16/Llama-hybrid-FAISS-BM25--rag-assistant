Is there an equivalent to Symfony's Localized Schema in Rails 3

I've been searching for an equivalent to Symfony's built-in Localized Schema which provides a native support for managing internationalized Tables/DB. Here is a link to Symfony's documentation covering their implementation of I18n & L10n , with the relevant part on Localized Schema (appx. a third down the page, such as the paragraph "Text Information in the Database"). I've checked out Globalize2 gem, but not sure as to whether it is fully supported in Rails3. Also found the gem puret , which seems to have more recent commits/activity. All in all though, it's very likely I am missing out on other possible options, as still getting my bearings in RoR dev. Open to any info/suggestions you may have! ;)
