How to organize an ASP.NET project

I am a PHP developer moving into an ASP.NET environment. I would like to know the best way to organize the different types of files. Right now in my project I have the following: 3 Master Files 5 User Controls 1 Base page class Several Web Forms The web forms are organized into directories based on the sites structure. But do I just leave the rest of these things on the root level? The base class can go into the app_code folder, but where do masters and user controls go?
