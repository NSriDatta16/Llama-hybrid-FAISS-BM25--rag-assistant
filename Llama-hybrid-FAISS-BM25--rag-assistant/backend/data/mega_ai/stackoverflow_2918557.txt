The /proc/ /stat file contains the necessary information - you're after the utime and stime fields. Those are cumulative counters of the process's user-mode and kernel-mode CPU time used; read them at the start of the measuring interval, then read them again at the end and calculate the difference. That will give you used CPU time in jiffies. To determine the total elapsed wallclock time in jiffies (so you can convert to an average utilisation), sum the numbers on the cpu0 line in /proc/stat (before and after, just like /proc/ /stat ). This is the layout of the first few fields in /proc/ /stat , from Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt in the Linux source: Table 1-3: Contents of the stat files (as of 2.6.22-rc3) .............................................................................. Field Content pid process id tcomm filename of the executable state state (R is running, S is sleeping, D is sleeping in an uninterruptible wait, Z is zombie, T is traced or stopped) ppid process id of the parent process pgrp pgrp of the process sid session id tty_nr tty the process uses tty_pgrp pgrp of the tty flags task flags min_flt number of minor faults cmin_flt number of minor faults with child's maj_flt number of major faults cmaj_flt number of major faults with child's utime user mode jiffies stime kernel mode jiffies cutime user mode jiffies with child's cstime kernel mode jiffies with child's
