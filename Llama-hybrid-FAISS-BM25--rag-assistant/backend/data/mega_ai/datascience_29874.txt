You would use categorical_column_with_* to get a _CategoricalColumn to feed into a linear model; this column returns identity values, often using a vocabulary. On the other hand, indicator_column is a multi-hot representation of a given categorical column and would be used if you want to feed the feature into a DNN, for example; it produces an _IndicatorColumn . embedding_column is analogous but you'd use it if your input is sparse.
