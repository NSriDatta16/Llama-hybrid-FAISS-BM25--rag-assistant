If you do not care about the scores of individual subjects (Chemistry, Economics, etc.) you can just average the scores for every city and compare them as suggested in the comment. Otherwise you could use multinomial logistic regression which allows you to predict a nomial outcome variable ('city' in your case) by your independent variables ('subject' and 'mean score').
