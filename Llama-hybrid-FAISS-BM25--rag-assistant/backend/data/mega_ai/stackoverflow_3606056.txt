What sort of project did you create? I created a simple View-based application in my Documents folder. I built and ran it in the simulator successfully. I then quit Xcode, dragged the project folder to the desktop. I reopened the project and ran it successfully in the simulator again. Did you make any changes at all to the project? I can't repeat what you've experienced. Is there anything different between what we did? How about creating your project on the desktop in the first place? Does that work? Are you running as an administrator account? Sometimes there are problems with Xcode if you run in an account where the user isn't a member of the Dev group.
