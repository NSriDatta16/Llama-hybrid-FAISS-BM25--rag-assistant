How to pre-train a deep neural network (or RNN) with unlabeled data?

Recently, I was asked about how to pre-train a deep neural network with unlabeled data, meaning, instead of initializing the model weight with small random numbers, we set initial weight from a pretrained model ( with unlabeled data ). Well, intuitively, I kinda get it, it probably helps with the vanishing gradient issue and shorten the training time when there are not too much labeled data available. But still, I don't really know how it is done, how can you train a neural network with unlabeled data? Is it something like SOM or Boltzmann machine? Has anybody heard about this? If yes, can you provide some links to sources or papers. I am curious. Greatly appreciate!
