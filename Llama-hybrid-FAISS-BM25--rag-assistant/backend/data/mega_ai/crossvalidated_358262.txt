The receptive field of of a neuron in the final feature map can be larger than 3x3. Consider a simple neural network with 10 layers of 3x3 convolutions -- a given neuron in the last layer is affected by all the inputs in 21x21 area around it. Pooling also increases the size of the receptive field. Therefore, information from areas outside the immediate domain of the last convolution can be transmitted and used to make accurate detections.
