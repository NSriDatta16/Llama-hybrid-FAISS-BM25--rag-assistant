I would encourage you to advocate for upgrading those XP machines at least to Service Pack 2 as it was a major upgrade in terms of functionality and security. It's also been at least 5 years since it was rolled out so I can't imagine you'd have compatibility issues with 3rd party software. That being said. Wireless for XP was seriously reworked with Service Pack 2 and the Wireless Network Policy was created that allows you to push out policy to all machines on your network via the Group Policy MMC.
