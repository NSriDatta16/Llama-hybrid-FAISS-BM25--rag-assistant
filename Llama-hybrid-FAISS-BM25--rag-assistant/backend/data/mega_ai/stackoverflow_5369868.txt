Default Django behavior is to save file on the filesystem, not the database itself). You have several options how to do this, the simplest one is to have a filesystem exported from you "other" machine and mounted on the machine with the django application. For the filesystem export you can use NFS, MogileFS or GlusterFS (which I'm using) or many more :). If you do not need real-time save&serve, simple rsync may be an option too. Second option is to utilize existing django mechanisms StogareAPI . There are already available different storage backeds you can use and may be helpful for you (e.g. ftp).
