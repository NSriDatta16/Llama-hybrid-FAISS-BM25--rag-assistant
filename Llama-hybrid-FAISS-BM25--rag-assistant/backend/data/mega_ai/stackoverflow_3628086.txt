Python Logic Help:

I am writing a game where there are two losing conditions: Forming a word longer than 3 letters. Bee is okay, Beer is not. Forming a word that can't be made into a longer word. Zebra is okay, Zebras is not. Wordlist is a list of words, frag is the previous fragment and a is the new letter a player enters. so frag may look like 'app' and a maybe 'l' with the idea of forming the word apple. def getLoser(frag, a, wordlist): word = frag + a if len(word) > 3: if word in wordlist: print 'word in wordlist' return True else: for words in wordlist: if words[:len(word)] == word: print words,':', word print 'valid word left' return False else: print words[:len(word)] print words,':', word print 'false found' return True else: return False For some reason when I enter my 4th letter, it automatically goes to the else in the for loop, even when the if statement functions in the for loop works correctly when I test it alone on dummy data in the interactive trail. Here is output for the frag alg and the letter e with the word algebra in the wordlist. e aa aa : alge false found True Any ideas?
