Magento extension not registering in core resources table

I am writing a Magento extension and I just cannot get it to show up in the core resources table. I believe I am declaring the resources part of my config correctly. Why is my extension not visible in the resource table? 0.2.0 CTRL_Analytics_Block CTRL_Analytics_Helper CTRL_Analytics core_setup core_write core_read Marketing and Analytics 100 analytics/admin standard CTRL_Analytics analytics
