How do I choose parameters for WINDOW SIZE and POLYNOMIAL ORDER to calculate the detrended cross-correlation coefficient rho?

In my project I generate synthetic energy demand data using a neural network. I want to check the cross-correlation of those two time-series: the original and the synthetic one. I found, that the detrended cross-correlation coefficient is a good measurement to determine cross-correlations between two non-stationary time series. I want to calculate the cross-correlation coefficient rho using the R package "SlidingWindows" (in Python) based upon the work of Zebende: rhodcca_SlidingWindows = SlidingWindows.rhodcca_SlidingWindows(y1, y2, w = 98, k = 10,nu=0) The function asks for parameters for WINDOW SIZE (w), AN VALUE INDICATING THE BOUNDARY OF THE DIVISION (N/k) and POLYNOMIAL ORDER (nu) - how do I find the optimal parameters? Is it sort of trial and error like when tuning hyperparameters in machine learning models or is there a precise way how to calculate them? One idea was to use a training set of 10 years, optimize it using the optuna Python package and test the parameters on the test set of 2 years. Does that make sense?
