Categorizing MsTest Cases

I'm looking for the easiest way to categorize my tests so I can run them separately. My organization would be something like the following Units Tests Integrations Tests Systems Test The reasoning for this is all our testing hasn't evolved to be completely automated yet. Most of our unit tests are completely automated, while integration and system tests aren't. However all tests are still useful to invoke on developers machines. For simplicity I'd like it if we could just commit our different types of tests with distinctive attributes [IntegrationTest] or [TestCategory("Integration")] so our build server only runs the tests we want. I'm aware nUnit has test categories but our team likes the Microsoft Stamp of approval on MsTest + IDE integration. How has your team solved this problem? Are there extensions that provide this functionality? Will this be built into .Net 4.0? Thanks
