I am assuming you want to drag&drop a hyperlink from an HTML page rendered in a UIWebView control to another control on the screen. Unfortunately I doubt that this is trivial, if at all possible. There is no documented way to find out if a UIControlEventTouchDown event received by a UIWebView object is hitting a rendered hyperlink and discover that hyperlink's URL. If you were able to do that, you would still have to create and show a custom view that would track touchesMoved and touchesEnded to know when the user drops it, and if it falls on the intended destination control.
