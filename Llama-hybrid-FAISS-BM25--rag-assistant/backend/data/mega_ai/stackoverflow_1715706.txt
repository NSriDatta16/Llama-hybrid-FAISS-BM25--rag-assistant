Use an ActionFilter to populate ViewData with the menu information you need. Apply it only to the classes and/or methods (possibly on a base Controller class if it's needed everywhere). Create some extension methods on Controller that make accessing the data from ViewData strongly-typed (and transparent in case you change its storage location later). I recently did a blog post with a similar approach (I needed a list of Sponsors to display on every page). It may help point you in the right direction.
