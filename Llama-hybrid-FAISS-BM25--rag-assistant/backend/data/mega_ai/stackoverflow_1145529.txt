C#: Notification before WeakReference is collected?

In C#/.NET, is there any way to get a notification before the object pointed to by a weak reference is destructed? Basically, I want to allow an object to be collected, but do something right before the object is destroyed, without modifying code to add destructors (since I won't know exactly what types of objects will be sued with my code). Thanks, Robert
