Triggering a draggable on mousedown

This is my problem i'm trying to create a event to trigger a draggable. Here is what i already tried. and the JS. $('#ecard-image').draggable(); $('#ecard-border').mousedown( function(event){ $('#ecard-image').trigger("mousedown.draggable", [event]); }); But offcourse this doesn't work the mousedown event fires but the mousedown.draggable isn't triggerd. is this even possible? What am i doing wrong??
