In the video, the normalizing constant is given as $$Z=\int p(Y|X,\theta)p(\theta)d\theta$$ All makes sense when the original equation is $$p(\theta|X,Y)=\frac{p(Y|X,\theta)p(\theta|X)}{Z}$$ and $p(\theta|X)=p(\theta)$ because it is a prior in MCMC context. This is also the case for the normalizing constant.
