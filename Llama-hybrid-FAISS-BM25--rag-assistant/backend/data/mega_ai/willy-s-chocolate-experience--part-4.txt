olate Experience LA" cocktail and performance evening. It was staged by a collective of local artists in Los Angeles, unaffiliated with the Glasgow event. Attendees were offered three jelly beans, and proceeds were donated to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. The Guardian was positive in its review of the event, noting that Paterson was severely jetlagged during her performance but asked, "how can you complain when shoddiness is the point?" Richard Kraft produced a musical stage reading about the event for the 2024 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, including performances from the actress and comedian Riki Lindhome, the actresses Shelley Regner and Cassandra Parker, the actor Eric Petersen, the Broadway songwriters Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner, the director Andy Fickman, the Emmy Award winners Tova Litvin and Doug Rockwell, and Kirsty Paterson, who played herself and a narrator. Additionally, he recruited cast members from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory Paris Themmen, who had played Mike Teevee, and Julie Dawn Cole, who had played Veruca Salt. The Stage gave it two stars, saying that "the show is self-aware enough to point out that we're watching a crappy, thrown-together piece of entertainment based on a crappy, thrown-together piece of entertainment". Multiple subsequent events have been compared to Willy's Chocolate Experience. These include the Detroit Bridgerton Themed Ball in September 2024, Christmas Spectacular Bury St Edmunds in December 2024, and the A Million Lives Book Festival in Baltimore, Maryland in May 2025.
