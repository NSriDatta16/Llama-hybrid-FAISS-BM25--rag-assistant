auto.arima() believes the best model (as per its default criterion, AICc) is an ARIMA(0,0,0) model with non-zero mean. That is, a pure intercept model with no autoregressive terms, no moving average terms and no integration. So your forecast is simply the historical average. Looking at your historical data, it is hard to say anything else should do a better job. You don't have enough data to assess seasonality. You don't have a trend. You don't have obvious AR or MA behavior. (If you want to, you can look at ACF and PACF plots, but I doubt that will show anything auto.arima() did not pick up on.) And yes, a constant mean forecast can certainly outperform a (nonconstant) ARIMA forecast, and frequently will do so .
