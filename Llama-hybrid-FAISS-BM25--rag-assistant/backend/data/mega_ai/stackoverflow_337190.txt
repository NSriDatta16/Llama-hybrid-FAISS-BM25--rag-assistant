In the Styles and Formatting pane, look at the styles that have the letter 'a' next to them (instead of the paragraph mark Â¶). Those are character styles. For example, the Emphasis style applies italics, and the Strong style applies bold. You can define other character styles for your own templates; just change the "Style type" dropdown in the New Style dialog from Paragraph to Character. In the Protect Document pane, after checking the "Limit formatting" box, click the Settings link below it and choose the styles you want to allow. You can choose character styles there as well as paragraph styles. The users can apply either kind of style, as long as it's a style in the list you allowed.
