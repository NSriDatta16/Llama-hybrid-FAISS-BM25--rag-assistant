The Fisher's Exact Test does not compute the $p$-value from the odds ratio. The Fisher's Exact Test tests the independence of a 2x2 table. If a table is independent, the odds ratio is 1, so they are related. The odds ratio is technically a parameter, and a test thereof is logistic regression or Pearson's $\chi^2$-test. Pearson's test and Fisher's Exact Test are asymptotically consistent, meaning they arrive at the same conclusion in the long run. For odds ratios that have continuously support and their (Wald test) p-values and CIs, it is true that if the 95% CI contains 1, the $p$-value is > 0.05. This is true of the relation between Pearson's $\chi^2$ test and logistic regression: the log odds ratio and its standard error can be used to compute both values arithmetically. Not true of FET. The Fisher's Exact test considers as a support all permutations of the 2x2 table conditional on the marginal frequencies as you say. For each of those tables an odds ratio can be computed. The support, then, of odds ratios is not continuous. To obtain 95% CIs and p-values which agree, one must "invert the hypothesis test" so that the 95% CI has only 5% of the possible tables with larger odds ratios in the tails under the null hypothesis. This is the de facto way of computing 95% CIs for odds ratios from Fisher's Exact Test: questions about programming are technically off-topic for this site, but for reporting you should verify this yourself by computing the results in Python, R, and maybe even SAS or Stata. So yes the two "checks" (tests) are related: $p
