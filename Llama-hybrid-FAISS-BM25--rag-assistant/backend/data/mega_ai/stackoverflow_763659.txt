Unity 2.5 now has an IDE that runs on windows. There is also a web viewer so that (using a plugin) you can view immersive environments right on a web page. Indie license is just $200. BTW GarageGames now licenses a newer tech called Torque3D Also worth checking is the C4 Engine which gets high praise over at devmaster.net
