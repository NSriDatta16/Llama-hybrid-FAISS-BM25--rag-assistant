"Perfect" .NET development environment?

I've been given an early Christmas Present: Permission to step out of the development cycle to reorganize and document our application. I have complete freedom to restructure, refactor, and set up any amount of infrastructure I see fit. If you had carte blanche , what's your "perfect" .NET development environment? About the application: VB.NET client-server application. (Windows Forms front end, ASPX Webservices back end) Currently using Visual Studio and SQL Server 2003 and... Visual SourceSafe. I'd like to have some combination of: * Better versioning. (leaning towards Subversion) * Wiki or other system for bug tracking and documentation. (leaning towards Trac with Subversion) * Simplified build process and daily builds ( Visual Build ? CruiseControl.NET ?) * Version control for the SQL Server database * Upgrade to Visual Studio 2005 (or 2008)? ... for a small team of 5 or so developers
