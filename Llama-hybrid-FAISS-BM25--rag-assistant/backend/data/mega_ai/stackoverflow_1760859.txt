suppress additional braces in emacs electric mode

I started using ruby-electric-mode. I like it except that I am used to closing open brackets myself (the other pairing are still useful to me). How can I make emacs suppress additional brackets when I type in the closing brackets myself? I now am manually deleting the auto-magically inserted bracket every time. Thanks in advance, Raghu.
