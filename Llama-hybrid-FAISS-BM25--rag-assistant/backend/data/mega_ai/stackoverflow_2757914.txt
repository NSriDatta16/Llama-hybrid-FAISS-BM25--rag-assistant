For example: pax> expr 1 + x expr: non-numeric argument Based on your comment that your output is: [ NPROC USERNAME SWAP RSS MEMORY TIME CPU Total: 143 processes, 2449 lwps, load averages: 1.76, 2.56, 2.94 NPROC USERNAME SWAP RSS MEMORY TIME CPU Total: 148 processes, 2443 lwps, load averages: 1.82, 2.57, 2.95] [ 4] [ 2] [ 2] it's possible that the spaces preceding your numeric values are causing your problems. Try replacing all your occurrences of: |wc -l with: |wc -l|sed 's/ //g' to get rid of spaces in the wc output.
