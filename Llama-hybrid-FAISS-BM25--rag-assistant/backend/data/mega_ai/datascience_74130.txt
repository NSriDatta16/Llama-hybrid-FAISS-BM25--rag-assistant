SimpleImputer drops columns consisting entirely of missing values. It is indeed unpleasant when trying to associate original columns; the sklearn devs have been discussing this: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/16426 Vincent's answer is good, if you are working directly: just detect and remove the offending all-missing columns, since they don't contribute anything to your model. If you need something more automatic (e.g., you have a highly-missing column that in cross-validation leads to some training folds being all-missing), then perhaps use a ColumnTransformer , where the columns argument is a callable that checks for all-missing? Then you can use the ColumnTransformer's get_feature_names method to find out when/if a column was removed.
