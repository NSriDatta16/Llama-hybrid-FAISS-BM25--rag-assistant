I played around with an image cropper that has that feature, and it uses Prototype , so it should be good to go for ROR. The code is pretty easy to figure out if you just want the elastic band element. If you want to roll-your-own it's not too hard to glue a Scriptaculous Draggable object to a DIV and resize/move the DIV. See my crappy demo .
