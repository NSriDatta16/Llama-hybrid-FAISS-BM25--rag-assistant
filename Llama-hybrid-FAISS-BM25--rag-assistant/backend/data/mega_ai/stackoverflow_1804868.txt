For continuous integration and creating builds TeamCity is nice and free for smaller operations (up to 3 build agents). It's powerful, supports NAnt and friends (e.g. MSBuild) out of the box, and it's best feature is ease of use and configuration. Even upgrades are painless. The rub is that it isn't completely free, and if you need more features (e.g. more than 3 build agents) it costs. Also, you ask about a Maven replacement - it won't handle dependencies like Maven does.
