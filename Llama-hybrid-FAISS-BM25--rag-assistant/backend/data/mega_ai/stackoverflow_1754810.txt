Sorry to say that, but you cannot populate an array this way, since strings are usually not parsed and executed. All you can do is: $photographer_array = array('Alberto Korda', 'Annie Leibowitz', 'Ansel Adams'); Or this ( EDIT : Adapted it to your query code): $photographer_array = array(); while ($photographer_row = $result->fetch_assoc()) { $photographer_array[] = $photographer_row['photographer_name']; } P.S.: You just love long variable names, don't you? ;)
