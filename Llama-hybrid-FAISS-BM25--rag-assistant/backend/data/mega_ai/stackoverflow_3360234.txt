How to parse random/unorganized rss feeds in Ruby/Rails?

I am facing problems while parsing RSS feeds from different sites. I need to fetch url, title and image from the feeds, but all of the sites have different structure for their feeds. Is is possible to have a generic script to fetch content from feeds of any structure? How do browsers/feed readers/Google Reader handle this situation?
