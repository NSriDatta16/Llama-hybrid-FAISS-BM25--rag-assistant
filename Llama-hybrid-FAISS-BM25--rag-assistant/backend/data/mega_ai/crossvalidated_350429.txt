Consider variable clustering using hierarchical clustering on a similar measure which is the squared Spearman correlation, as implemented in the R Hmisc package varclus function. Though this will not keep the variables within a group together, it will provide a free-floating depiction of how variables interrelate. More to the point it will show you how to implement exactly what you need when you force your own clusters, because the result of hierarchical clustering is to quantify the Spearman $\rho^2$ for one cluster with another cluster by computing the average of all the pairwise $\rho^2$ between all possible pairs of single variables from different clusters.
