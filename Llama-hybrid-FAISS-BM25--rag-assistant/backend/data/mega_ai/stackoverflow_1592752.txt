How did you handled click/touch on UIImageView ? TouchesBegan/Ended? Try putting some logs ( NSLog ) and run your app in debug mode (put some breakpoints) to see if control reaches your action method... Also, when you do presentModalViewController , you do not need to POP out with back button on navigation bar... you only need to dismissModelViewController to hide it.
