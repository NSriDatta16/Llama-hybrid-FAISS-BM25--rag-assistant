I am not sure whether anyone has written any extensions for PDF formatting, most people seem to replace it entirely with a PDF they have written. This is because Magento's PDF writing is terribly written, and not really up for changes. If you cannot find an extension to modify the existing PDFs, plan around it. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
