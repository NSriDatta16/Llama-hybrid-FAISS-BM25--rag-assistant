This is a difficult causal inference problem (see e.g. this book that is freely available online for an extensive treatment of the topic). You want to compare the outcomes for the subjects that took the course with those outcomes they would have (counterfactually) had, if they had not taken the course. The simplest way to get that answer, is by randomly assigning some subjects eligible for the course to receive the course and some to not receive the course. With enough subjects randomized in this way, you would be able to easily get the average effect that taking this course has on average on the population (but not what effect the effect is for each individual person, which may vary around the average). Of course, that is not what was done here. The next possibility is to take into account the whole mechanism of how people end up in the course and what affects outcomes (you can e.g. draw yourself a directed acyclic graph, if you like that approach, to think about this). One relatively simple approach for this is to build a model for why people end up in the course. Best case: it is simply due to reading scores in the previous year (with worse scores leading to an increasingly higher chance of getting into the course), there are absolutely no other variables that influence it (i.e. unmotivated children cannot decline participation, parents have no say in it either, no further judgement is applied based on other unrecorded factors etc.) or at least no other ones that are no recorded on your dataset (in practice, it will be possible to verify these assumptions). In this best case, you create a propensity score for ending up in the course and adjust/stratify your comparison of the change of reading score based on that. People that do not have a chance to end up in the course or are 100% certain to be in the course do not have an effect in this analysis. That, of course, tells you that you have a problem, if participation was 100% below a certain score and 0% above that score. In that case, you can either conclude nothing or need to start making increasingly stronger assumptions. One possibility for stronger assumptions might be to find similar people in other places (or the same place, but in different years - perhaps the year before and the year after to cacel out temporal trends as much as possible?!), in which case you also need to account for differences between populations of schools (or years), which starts to involved e.g. socioeconomic factors, quality of teaching in different schools/years, differing/changing access to libraries and so on. With that, one often runs into the issue of all the possible confounders not being available. Depending on what your exact situation is, this may be a case of the famous RA Fisher quote on calling a statistician after an experiment is done.
