There is CouchDB which is a DB written in Erlang that uses HTTP as the transport. This eliminates the need for middle-ware and permits you to navigate the DB directly with AJAX calls. I can't speak good or bad about it. I haven't heard much about it in months and it seems as if the hype train departed a few years ago. You can't have an ORM to a remote DB in Javascript.. An, ORM requires transcendental knowledge of the DB schema, and sending that out with an API just isn't that pragmatic as of yet. For persistent local storage, there is the now deprecated Google Gears and the HTML5 Clientside DB.
