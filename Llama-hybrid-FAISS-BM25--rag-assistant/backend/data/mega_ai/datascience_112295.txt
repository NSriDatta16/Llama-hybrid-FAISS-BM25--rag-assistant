Supply chain modeling requires a good simulator. You can use existing software like anyLogistix but you might be limited if you want to use other features such as the weather or the stock markets. That's why a good option is to use simulators like supplychainpy or simpy , together with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest to connect multiple features together and make interesting simulations and predictions like demand forecasting or network optimization .
