From a quick look at the specifications of the JSR: (you might want to look for code examples, starting with Appendix D of the spec itself, the latest JavaME SDK, Sony Ericsson developer website, then google) As always, I would be worried about fragmentation in the diverse implementations of the JSR, but here's my first idea: import javax.microedition.sensor.*; SensorInfo[] powerSensorInfoArray = SensorManager.findSensors("power","ambient"); //let's assume there is one SensorInfo in the array. //open a connection to the sensor. SensorConnection connection = (SensorConnection)Connector.open(powerSensorInfoArray[0].getUrl(), Connector.READ); // add a DataListener to the connection connection.setDataListener(new MyDataListener(), 1); // implement the data listener public class MyDataListener implements DataListener { public void dataReceived(SensorConnection aSensor, Data[] aDataArray, boolean isDataLost) { //let's assume there is only one channel for the sensor and no data was lost. // figure out what kind of data the channel provides. int dataType = aDataArray[0].getChannelInfo().getDataType(); //now, I suggest you switch on dataType and print the value on the screen // experimentation on the JSR256 implementation you're targetting seems to be // the only way to figure out out power data is formatted and what values mean. //only one of the following 3 lines will work: double[] valueArray = aDataArray[0].getDoubleValues(); int[] valueArray = aDataArray[0].getIntValues(); Object[] valueArray = aDataArray[0].getObjectValues(); // let's assume one value in the valueArray String valueToPrint = "" + valueArray[0]; // see what happens with that and you plug or unplug the power supply cable. } } You'll need to add javax.microedition.io.Connector.sensor to your MIDlet permissions. -------EDIT------ Documentation from the JSR-256 implementation on Sony-Ericsson Satio phone (S60 5th edition): The battery charge sensor has the following characteristics: Quantity: battery_charge Context type: device URL: sensor:battery_charge;contextType=device;model=SonyEricsson Channels: (index: name, range, unit) 0: battery_charge, 0-100, percent 1: charger_state, 0-1, boolean
