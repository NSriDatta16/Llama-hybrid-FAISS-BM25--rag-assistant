How many samples are needed to distinguish the means of two distributions in multi-armed bandits?

In a paper on Multi Armed Bandits, I came across the following statement: This generalizes the well-known fact that one needs of order $\frac{1}{\Delta^2}$ samples to differentiate the means of two distributions with gap $\Delta$ . (cf. Audibert et al. (2010) ) To me, this is not "well known". That is why I would appreciate a hint where this "fact" comes from. In Multi Armed Bandits, a common assumption is that the random variables are bounded between 0 and 1. However, the exact distribution is not known.
