As for Xcode 4, the Release Notes state The ORGANIZATIONNAME substitution value in templates is now replaced with the Company Name from the current userâ€™s Address Book card if present, rather than _ MyCompanyName _. If the PBXCustomTemplateMacroDefinitions user default has already been set, it will be honored. Yet, the latter was not the case for me.
