You're right that gems offer a little more than plugins. Versioning and dependencies on other gems being the main ones for me. One gem needn't be shared across everything using ruby. You can install multiple versions of a single gem and specify in your environment.rb that a gem requires a specific version. E.g. config.gem 'my-gem', :version => '1.2.3' Also you can freeze gems into your rails application so that you know you are working with a specific version. You might want to look at the jeweler gem which makes creating your own gems easier. UPDATE To include CSS, javascript etc I think you'll need to make an Rails engine which can then be bundled as a plugin or a gem. I've not done this but there's some coverage here and here .
