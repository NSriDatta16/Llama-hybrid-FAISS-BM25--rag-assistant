Given that $\theta_{\text{MLE}}$ is a point estimator, the obvious counterpart in Bayesian analysis would be the posterior mode estimator $\theta_{\text{MAP}} \equiv \arg \max_\theta f( \theta | x )$. Although this is a Bayesian estimator, you could still derive its frequentist sampling properties, including its standard error and corresponding coefficient of variation, just as you can with the MLE. Both the MLE and MAP estimators have asymptotic normal distributions under appropriate regularity conditions. In Bayesian analysis it is common to encounter problems where the posterior mode does not have a closed form solution and so you would obtain this via MCMC methods, and similarly, its frequentist properties would also be obtained via numerical methods.
