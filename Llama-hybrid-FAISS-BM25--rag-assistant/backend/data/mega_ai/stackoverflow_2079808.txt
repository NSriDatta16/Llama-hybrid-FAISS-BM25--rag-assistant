I had a similar issue To solve I had to do one additional step to unforgivens answer In my main nib 1) create a UITabController 2) Then I dragged out a UINavigational Controller into the tab controller 3) Then dragged out a UITableViewController into the NavigationalController as a child 4) Then changed (3) class to be my MyTableWithSearchBarViewController in the inspector - check if the nib name is correct and change this if necessary in the inspector as well 5) I then had to delete the tableView which is automatically created by IB in step (3). Only then would the search bar show correctly... If in step 3 I dragged out a different controller onto the stage or left the tableView there it would only ever display the table and not the search bar weird
