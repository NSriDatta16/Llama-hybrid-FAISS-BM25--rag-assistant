Time behavior doesn't work that way. All you can really say there is that those three datasets are roughly O(n) from each other. That doesn't mean the algorithim is O(n). The first problem is that I could easily draw a curve that goes exponential ( O(e**n) ) that nonetheless includes those three points. The big problem though is that you didn't say anything about the data. There are many sorting algorithms that approach O(n) for sorted or nearly sorted inputs (eg: Mergesort). However, their average case (typically randomly-ordered data) and worst case (often reverse-sorted data) is invariably O(nlogn) or worse.
