Regular expression to parse useragent string

I need extract data from a string. Heres an example: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; tr-tr) AppleWebKit/418 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/417.9.3 I want to get what's after the "Safari/" (417.9.3) but : The "Safari" string can be in any character case and can be anywhaere in the string. The version is separated from "Safari" by "/", " /", "/ ", " / " or any whitespace. The version string end by any whitespace, ")", "(", ";", or the end of the string. Anyone can help me build this up? Thanks!
