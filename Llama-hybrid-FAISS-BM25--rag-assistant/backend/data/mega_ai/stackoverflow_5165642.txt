Remote BLOB Storage and FILESTREAM in SQL Server 2008

I'm a SharePoint develop and I have just learned about remote blob feature in SQL Server 2008 that makes storing BLOBs more effecient. My English's not good, somebody can tell me the difference between terms: FILESTREAM and Remote BLOB Storage. Is it work well in farm environment with SAN device. Thanks so much.
