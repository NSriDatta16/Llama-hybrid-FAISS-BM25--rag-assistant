It seems like you are asking a basic question as to whether or not one can compute an analog to R square from linear regression to logistic regression or perhaps more generally to the generalized linear model. The basis for this being possible with linear models is that that the total sum of squares can be separated into two non-overlapping sums of squares (model sum of squares and error sum of squares). But for generalized linear models R square does not carry through as a measure of goodness of fit for a model. The analog is the deviance which can be used to measure the effect of variables on the model by looking at the change in deviance when the variable is added to the model.
