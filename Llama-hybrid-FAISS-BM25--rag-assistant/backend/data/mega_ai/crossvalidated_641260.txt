Can we still use a multi-factor logistic regression model? 2. The results of the single-factor logistic regression analysis suggest that the D-dimer concentration index has statistical significance (P=0.034) in relation to the presence or absence of MP, while the other indicators have p-values greater than 0.05. Can we include variables such as gender and age in the multi-factor logistic regression model? How many variables should be included at most in the multi-factor logistic regression model? As others have pointed out, the sample size is too small to allow many predictors. Too many predictors of a binary outcome tend to results in complete separation with large coefficients and huge standard errors. Coefficients in generalized linear models are asymptotically consistent, meaning that they are biased but the biases get smaller when the sample size increases. Similarly, their standard errors are at best consistent. In small samples, this bias may be relatively large. The p values you reported whether based on Wald, score, or likelihood-ratio tests are not trustworthy because they require asymptotic interpretations, which only apply when the sample size is large enough. See my comment on these tests Likelihood ratio vs. score vs. Wald test: Different p values, which to use? . If the multi-factor logistic regression model is not feasible, can we only perform a single-factor logistic regression analysis to demonstrate the influence of D-dimer on the dependent variable? Not a good idea to abandon multiple predictors if they actually affect the outcome and are correlated among each other. This will result in omitted variables, which bias the estimate. If logistic regression is not used, can we utilize the adjusted Poisson regression (robust Poisson regression) mentioned in the referenced article ( https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1EQjsKvLyWXRVFMX_u0y-w ) and website ( https://mengte.online/archives/11695 )? Can the 95% CI of the odds ratio converge to single-digit values? No, this will not solve the small-sample size problem. Poisson regression directly reports the relative risk estimate. But one can easily get the same quantity in logistic regression by using post-estimation tools. See marginaleffects::comparisons() in R. Here the "robust" is about the standard error only, which tries to correct the coefficient variance-covariance matrix by a sandwich estimator to make it consistent. "Consistent" means that it approaches the true value as sample size increases. With the sample size fixed and small, the robustness or consistency of standard errors are not very insightful. If none of the above approaches are suitable, what other statistical methods can be employed? Bayesian function？Exact logistic regression. The exact logistic regression appears to be the best option. It compares to permutation test in one-factor analysis. See a tutorial https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/exact-logistic-regression/ which also has a sample size of 30. "Exact logistic regression is used...when the sample size is too small for a regular logistic regression." The concentration of MP is also one of the outcome variables, which is a continuous variable. Therefore, we have already used a multiple linear regression model for statistical analysis. You have a sample-selection issue in the linear regression. We can only observe MP concentration if MP is present. Therefore, the effect of a predictor on MP concentration is biased if we estimate it from the 24 observations where MP is present. See Toomet, O., & Henningsen, A. (2008). Sample selection models in R: Package sampleSelection. Journal of Statistical Software, 27(7). https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v027.i07 and Toomet, O. (2020). Treatment eﬀects with normal disturbances in sampleSelection package. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sampleSelection/vignettes/treatReg.pdf . I believe these sample-selection correction operates also on large-sample properties. Nevertheless, you can bootstrap the small sample and get exact p values. I guess we need stratified bootstrap here, each time sampling six cases from the non-MP cases and 24 cases from the MP cases with replacement.
