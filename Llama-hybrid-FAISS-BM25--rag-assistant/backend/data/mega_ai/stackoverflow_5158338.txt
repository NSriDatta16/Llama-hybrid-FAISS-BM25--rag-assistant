How to convert a collection to an array in javascript

I'm trying to figure out how to convert a javascript collection (i.e. something returned from getElementsByTagName/etc) to a normal array so I can perform array functions on the data. I'm looking for a solution without using any libraries and haven't been able to find any sort of elegant solutions anywhere online. Has anyone written a good util function for this problem?
