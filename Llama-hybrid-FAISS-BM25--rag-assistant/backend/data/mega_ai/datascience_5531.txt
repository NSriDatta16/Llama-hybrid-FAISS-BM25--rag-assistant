Make a pandas Timedelta object then add with the += operator: x = pandas.Timedelta(days=365) mydataframe.timestampcolumn += x So the key is to store your time series as timestamps. To do that, use the pandas to_datetime function: mydataframe['timestampcolumn'] = pandas.to_datetime(x['epoch'], unit='s') assuming you have your timestamps as epoch seconds in the dataframe x . That's not a requirement of course; see the to_datetime documentation for converting other formats.
