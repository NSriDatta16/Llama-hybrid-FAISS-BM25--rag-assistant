Logistic regression for probability of action in next n days

I've built a Logistic Regression model in Python for the likelihood of an individual doing an action in the next n days . I am not very experienced at this! My data comprises one row per individual. I have >500k individuals. I have five individual-level features, and a sixth time-based feature: median gap between actions. I've built a model with a test F1 score >0.95. My question : is this sufficient to predict individuals doing this action in the next n days -- or am I accidentally classifying them according to whether they'll do this at all?
