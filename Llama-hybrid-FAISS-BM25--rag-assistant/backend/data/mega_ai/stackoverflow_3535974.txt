Are there any optimizers that don't care about compile times?

Are there any compilers in use that pay little attention to compilation speed but rather seek maximum optimization even at an order(s) of magnitude compile time slow down? It seems to me that having a compile take hours/days vs minutes/second wouldn't be a major issue once you get very near the final release. (And if you have enough tests, it should be safe to.) Edit: What I'm interested in are compilers that include optimization passes that can take hours or even days to run on modestly side programs (something that takes 10min or less with normal optimizations, e.g. the Linux kernel, apache or GCC its self).
