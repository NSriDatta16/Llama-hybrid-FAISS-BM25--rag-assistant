As it turns out, there is actually no great solution out there for this answer. You can either protect everything with SSL or devise your own home brew authentication system. A common method is to send the user a unique HASH, store the HASH in the database and in a cookie on the client's machine. Then only that user's IP, User-Agent, etc.. will be authenticated to that cookie. So the answer is yes, the solution is viable. Extra security precautions will need to be maintained in order to disallow account hijacking. SSL for login will protected the password. A unique hash will allow the user to continue being authenticated without giving away their password to the account. Storing a large amount of information about the user such as IP, browser agent, etc... will disallow easy hijacking of an account.
