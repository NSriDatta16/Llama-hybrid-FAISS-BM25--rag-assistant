Nexus: removing repository

I accidently removed a hosted snapshot repository from Nexus containing a few artifacts needed by other developers on my team. Fine, I'll be able to recreate it fairly easy, but when I tried to add the repository again with the same name as the one I removed, the "Upload Artifact" tab did not show. I tried to clean the cache and reindex the public and public snapshot repos, but that didn't help. I also tried setting an alternative storage path by entering an alternative path on "Override Local Storage Location", same result. Will I have to create a brand new repository with a different name and change all repository reference in my projects? Thanks, David
