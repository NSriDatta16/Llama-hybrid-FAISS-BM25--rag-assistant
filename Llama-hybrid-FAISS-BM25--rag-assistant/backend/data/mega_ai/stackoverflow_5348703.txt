The storage engine for the table doesn't support repair

I m getting the error - The storage engine for the table doesn't support repair while repairing the tables through command - mysqlcheck -u root -p --repair "database" It displays error for 4 tables only out of 106 tables , for rest of the tables it displays OK. Pls help if there is any work around. Thanks.
