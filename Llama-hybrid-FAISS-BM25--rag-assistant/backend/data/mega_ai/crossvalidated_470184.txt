Understanding plot for stats::predict

I created a time series for 15 years (in each year 123 days), and I created a forecast using stats::predict for the next 5 years. temps_ts My concern is the interpretation of plot, according my understanding there is no change or variation in the data, but the upper and lower levels present variations, that is for the period of the time in evaluation or it means something else?
