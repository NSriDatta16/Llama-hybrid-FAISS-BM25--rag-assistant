preg_replace not doing what I expect

I have the following paterns in a paragraph of text and I need to replace it with nothing, so that it disappears from the paragraph. The sendtence contains CONSULTANTS [45416,2010-05-11] I need to remove the [] and everything within these [] , not the characters within the [] could be anything I tried the below but this only removes the [] $par = preg_replace('/[\[*\]]/','',$par);
