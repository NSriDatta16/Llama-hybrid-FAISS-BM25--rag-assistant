Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming." And since these days any serious data is in the millions of records, I content that good data modeling is the most important programming skill (whether using a rdbms or something like sqlite or amazon simpleDB or google appengine data storage.) Fancy search and sorting algorithms aren't needed any more when the data, all the data, is stored in such a data storage system.
