If you're using .NET 3.5, then you can write this using LINQ: JiggleMyList(people.Select(p => p.FullName).ToList()); The Select method takes a lambda expression that is used to convert each object from the source collection to some new value and these new values are collected into IEnumerablt type. The ToList extension method converts this to List . Alternatively, you can write the same thing using query syntax: JiggleMyList((from p in people select p.FullName).ToList()); Similar feature is also available in .NET 2.0 (C# 2.0) and you could use anonymous delegate instead of (more elegant) lambda expressions: JiggleMyList(people.ConvertAll(delegate (Person p) { return p.FullName; }));
