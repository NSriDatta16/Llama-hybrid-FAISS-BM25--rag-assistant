is is possible to move/copy an s3 bucket to a different account?

Does Amazon provide a way to copy a bucket from one account to a different account? I am uploading several gb of files to my own bucket for a client app for development purposes, but when handing off the code I'm going to want to switch the bucket to their account (so I am no longer paying for the storage). Uploading is taking quite awhile because there are many small files, and I would like to avoid the same arduous process later, when I move the files into the other bucket.
