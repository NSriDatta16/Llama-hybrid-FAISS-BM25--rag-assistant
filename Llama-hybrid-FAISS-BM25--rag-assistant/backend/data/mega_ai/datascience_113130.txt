Feature Engineering Encoding for multiple category with huge category range

I need to encode a column "Tags" that has a total of 144 different types and at the same time a row can contain multiple tags. What's the best encoding method in this situation? One-hot Encoding would be computationally expensive. Binary Encoding only works if a row contains 1 tag (please correct me if I'm wrong).
