It is generally a good idea in unit testing that you want to mimic the original functionality as close as possible while covering as much of the code you are testing (code coverage). Stubs aside, which I am not familiar with, an example would be that you want to make sure that, provided the wrong filename is given, etc line 3 in your file: if( openfile(rStrFileName) == successfull ) then you will accurately handle this situation and return false. If this can be done by stubs then so be it. In my case I would use a sample test file and store that with my tests. This is a common practice. Remember that the whole point is to test out the function as close to reality as you can. This will ensure a lot of strange cases that you can't anticipate will be caught automatically so you can fix it, which is the point of unit testing to begin with.
