You can transform multiple times. just call map:transform again (with a different xsl) - before you serialize. you can also use map:part/map:aggregate to mash together multiple matcher and then apply a map:transform on them (or the i:include transformer). I dont really know what you mean with "no tags found", so maybe i am addressing the question wrong. -- if you want to see debug output (ie. what exactly is generated based on the xml, you should work with views - declare it in the sitemap (see: http://cocoon.apache.org/2.0/userdocs/concepts/views.html ) and add a label to your transformer. you can then see exactly what data is being used for the xsl by calling url?cocoon-view=YOURLABEL
