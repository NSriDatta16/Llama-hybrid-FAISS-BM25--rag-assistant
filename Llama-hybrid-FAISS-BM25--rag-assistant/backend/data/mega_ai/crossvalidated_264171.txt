How to do two way repeated Measures ANOVA using aov() in R?

I am attempting a 2-way ANOVA with repeated measures using the aov() function in R. I am trying to compare average heights ("X1" and "X2") of algae by treatment ("CODE") and site over time ("MONTH"). The data I entered into R is already averaged. Therefore each row = one observation per treatment, per code, per month (1-60). I have created a column called "ID" to identify each observation (1-60). head(HNME1) ID MONTH SITE CODE X1 X2 1 OCT BPT C+ 3.526667 3.440000 2 OCT BPT C- 3.296667 3.540000 3 OCT BPT U+ 2.146667 1.000000 4 OCT BPT U- 3.146667 3.016667 5 OCT BPT P 2.827778 2.122222 6 OCT FLC C+ 3.620000 1.990000 However, when running this code: "x1.aov ... I am not receiving any p-values in my ANOVA summary. I have read other forums telling me to make the ID values into factors. "HNME1$ID I have tried this and received the error: "Error () model is singular." However, I do not have any gaps or missing data values. I am not sure what else could be going wrong. Just messing around - I tried a one-way ANOVA with "MONTH" where "ID" was and this produced p-values... Any suggestions/ help would be much appreciated! Thank you.
