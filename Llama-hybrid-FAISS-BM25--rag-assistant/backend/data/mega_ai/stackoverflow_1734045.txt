The immediate issue you are facing is a misunderstanding of what is "local code" in Python (I am not sure if there is an official terminology, so I am making this one up) and how to import it. When you run python src\test\python\test_power_estimator.py , the first element in sys.path is set to the directory containing the test_power_estimator.py script, not the current directory. So the statement "import src.main.python.power_estimator as power" looks for the package src in the directory src/test/python , and that fails. One way to work around the issue is to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to "H:\PRO\pyEstimator" But the recommended way to run tests is to use a test runner script. I recommended using nosetest . In addition, nosetest has support for collecting coverage data while running your tests. Besides, it sounds like a bad idea to have a python package named "src". You should rename your package to be your project. Maybe "estimator" or "pyestimator" (lowercase, please).
