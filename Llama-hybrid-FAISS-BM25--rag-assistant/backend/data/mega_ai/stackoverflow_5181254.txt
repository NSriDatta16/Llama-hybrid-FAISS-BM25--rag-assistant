Dynamics CRM Get Current Organization Name

I need to get the current organization name inside of an aspx page in the ISV directory. The only example I've seen of this tries to parse it out of the URL or the domain name, but the URL doesn't have the current org name because the page is in the ISV directory...and the domain name doesn't have it period in my case. How can I get the org name? I need this so that I can call CrmAuthenticationToken.ExtractCrmAuthenticationToken. Thanks.
