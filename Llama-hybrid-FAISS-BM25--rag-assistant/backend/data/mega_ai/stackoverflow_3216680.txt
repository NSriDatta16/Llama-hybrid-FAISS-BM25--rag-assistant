Is GAE a viable platform for my application? (if not, what would be a better option?)

Here's the requirement at a very high level. We are going to distribute desktop agents (or browser plugins) to collect certain information from tons of users (in thousands or possibly millions down the road). These agents collect data and periodically upload it to a server app. The server app will allow for analyzing collected data (filter, sort etc based on 4-5 attributes) and summarize in form of charts etc. We should also be able to export some of the collected data (csv or pdf) We are looking for an platform to host the server app. GAE seems attractive because of low administrative cost and scalability (as users base increases, the platform will handle the scale... hopefully!). Is GAE a viable option for us? One important consideration is that sometimes the volume of uploads from the agents can exceed 50MB per upload cycle. We will have users in places where Internet connections could be very slow too. Apparently GAE has a limit on the duration a request can last. The upload volume may cause the request (transferring data from an agent to the server) to last longer than 30 seconds. How would one handle such situation? Thanks!
