Honestly I find the idea appealing but doubt it could be practical. You mention "plain text" but not sure if this means source code or a natural language description. If it is source code maybe you can find something that automatically generates flowcharts from a specific language (you could have better luck if you stated what the language is). If you are trying to extract a flowchart from a high-level English (or whatever) language descriptions I think it will prove quite a challenge. If I had to do this, I'd go with Perl starting by https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Flowchart::Script for the "rendering" while reading a bit on NLP for the parsing (ex.: http://www.perlmonks.org/?node=41281 ).
