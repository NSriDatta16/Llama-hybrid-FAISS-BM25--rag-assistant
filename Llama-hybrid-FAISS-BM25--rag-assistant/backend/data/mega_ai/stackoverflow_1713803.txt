Just to make sure: do not expect to find a font that supports Chinese Traditional, Chinese Simplified, and Japanese. There are glyph differences for the same Unicode code points, so a native user will immediately spot that you are not using the proper font for their language. For a web application it is probably best to give a list of fonts, and in the list you need a typical Windows font, a typical Mac font, and a generic one (like "serif"). Tagging the html page (or the paragraph) with the proper lang tag will help some (smarter) browsers to select the right font if the specific ones are not installed.
