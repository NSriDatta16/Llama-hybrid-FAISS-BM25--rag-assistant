So... After a lot of forum searching - I agree, there is no graceful way to do this haha! The solution I ended up going for was basically to make JS objects for each swf on $(document).ready() Basically, the JS object would have various values, among them "data" and "isReady". When a swf became visible and would call the JS to say "im ready" I would simply catch that call, then find the JS object it was referring to (I managed to do this by passing the DOM id for each swf as one of its flashVars; yes it made me feel dirty). From there it was basically just a game to make sure that the each JS had "isReady" before I tried manipulating it. The only bit of elegance in this whole mess was that by using JS objects, I could still apply new data to "hidden" swfs by simply updating the "data" property in their respective JS objects. Then, when a swf finally became visible, I would just update whatever data it had (ie, current data) and it worked pretty well but yeah, I still agree that this whole situation is unfortunate. So... *answered.
