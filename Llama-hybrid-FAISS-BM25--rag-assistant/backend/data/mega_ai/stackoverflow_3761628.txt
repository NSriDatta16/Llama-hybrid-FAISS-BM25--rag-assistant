Clojure: fully qualified name of a function

In Clojure, is there a more elegant way of finding the fully qualified name of a function (known to have meta info) than (defn fully-qualified-name [fn] (let [fn-meta (meta fn ) fn-ns (ns-name (:ns fn-meta)) ] (str fn-ns "/" (:name fn-meta)))) A run-time solution is required. Read-time and compile-time solutions are welcome.
