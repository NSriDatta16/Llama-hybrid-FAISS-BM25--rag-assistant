I guess the first question is: why do they need to modify the list? Would it be possible for them to return their changes as a list of modifications rather than actually modifying the shared list? Could they work with a list which looks like it's a mutable version of the original list, but is actually only locally mutable? Are you changing which elements are in the list, or just the properties of those elements? These are just questions rather than answers, but I'm trying to encourage you to think about your problem in a different way. Look at the bigger picture as the task you want to achieve instead of thinking about the way you'd tackle it in a normal imperative, mutable fashion. Changing the way you think about problems is very difficult, but you may find you get some great "aha!" moments :)
