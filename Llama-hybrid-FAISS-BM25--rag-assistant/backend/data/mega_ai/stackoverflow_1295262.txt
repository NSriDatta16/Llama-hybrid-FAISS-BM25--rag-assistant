Possible bug in Excel.Interop's Worksheet.UsedRange property?

Take a gander at the following code. Basically, this is a function that gets called in order to identify the used range of a worksheet, loop through that range, and hash social security numbers. Here's the problem. If I create a spreadsheet and populate one cell, the function does not hash that cell. However, if I populate more than one, it works. Could this be a bug in the UsedRange property? Or am I missing something? thanks much. Woody try { foreach (Excel.Worksheet ws in _excelWorksheet) { // Grab the range of numbers that populates the XLS. Excel.Range range = ws.UsedRange; // In the following cases, Value2 returns different types: // // 1. The range variable points to a single cell: // Value2 returns a object // // 2. The range variable points to many cells: // Value2 returns object[,] object[,] values = (object[,])range.Value2; for (int row = 1; row
