0.75 is a pretty modest discrimination, I would say that's a decent model in the case of recommender systems where the volume of material someone is exposured to is gigantic relative to what the encounter and eventually like. You'd expect only an incremental positive predictive value in that case, since the outcome is rare, so discounting the model for having low PPV would be too harsh.
