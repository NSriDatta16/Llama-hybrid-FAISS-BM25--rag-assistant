Embedding Silverlight App into ASP.net webpage for smoother transition

Currently I have a pure silverlight website with navigation. Im worried about the customers that are hitting the website and are leaving straight away because they are have to have the SL plugin installed and they also have to wait for the 1.5 meg xap file to download. The first page of the silverlight application is the login/registration page where the user must login or register to proceed to any other page in the site. Im thinking about swapping this page out for an ASP.net MVC webpage. So when the user hits the site the first page loads up automatically (since it will be the ASP.net MVC part of the site) and as they are signing up or logging in, the silverlight app is downloading in the background, or if they dont have the plugin than i will handle it a bit more gracefully. Once they log in it will pass them over to the silverlight app. Just wondering if anybody has gone down this root and has any advice on the subject? Thanks in Advance
