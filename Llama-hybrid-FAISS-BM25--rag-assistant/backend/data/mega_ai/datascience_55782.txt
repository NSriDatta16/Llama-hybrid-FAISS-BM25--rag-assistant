To add on @Peter's answer, you can use the method: classifier.predict_proba(X_test) to get the probability of X_test belonging to each class. This is called a soft prediction and would most likely need something called probability calibration to get usable probabilities. Hard prediction is what the classifier.predict() method does. It takes the class with the highest probability and assigns its label to your X_test . PS : If you are sticking with Logistic Regression you won't need probability calibration since LR automatically optimizes logloss probabilities. However just in case you opted for another classifier, you will need to calibrate it.
