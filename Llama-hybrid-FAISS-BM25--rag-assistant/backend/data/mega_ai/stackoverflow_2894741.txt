Should I be storing the Instance references in a structure more suitable for random access (e.g. dictionary with KeyValue as the dictionary key?) Yes, if you are mapping from a key to a value (which you are in this case), such that one typically accesses an element via its key, then a dict rather than a list is better. Is a dictionary any more efficient in this case? Yes, it is much more efficient. A dictionary takes O(1) on average to lookup an item by its key whereas a list takes O(n) to lookup an item by its key, which is what you are currently doing. Using a Dictionary # Construct the dictionary d = {} # Insert items into the dictionary d[key1] = value1 d[key2] = value2 # ... # Checking if an item exists if key in d: # Do something requiring d[key] # such as updating an attribute: d[key].attr = val
