gglagplot function plots a series of scatterplots between the timeseries and the lagged values of the timeseries. For example consider the following time series: > ts1 A lagplot with lags = 1 for this time series will be plot using x-axis as ts1 and y-axis as ts1[-1] . Following code will plot the following combination of points (0.10,0.11), (0.11,0.12),(0.12,0.13) and so on ... > gglagplot(ts1, lags = 1)
