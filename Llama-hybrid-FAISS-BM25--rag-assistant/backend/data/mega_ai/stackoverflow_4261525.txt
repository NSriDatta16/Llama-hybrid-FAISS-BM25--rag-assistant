Best way to store and retrieve a DAWG data structure for fast loading

I have a 500k+ wordlist that I loaded it into a DAWG data structure. My app is for mobile phones. I of course don't want to repeat all the conversion steps to load this wordlist into a DAWG every time, since it would take to much storage space to have the wordlist on the phone and to much time to load it into a DAWG every time. So, I am looking for a way to store the data in my DAWG to a file or DB in a format that will both conserve space and allow for me to quickly load it back into my DAWG data structure. I received one suggestion that I could store each node in a SQLite DB, but I am not sure how that would exactly work and if I did that how would I retrieve it quickly. I certainly wouldn't want to run lots of queries. Would some other type of storage method be better? I also received suggestions of creating a serialised file or to store it as a bitmap.
