Yes, your edit indicates correct reasoning. Like you said, Example 3 aims to show the role of $\pi$-a.e. $x \in \mathcal{X}$. Theorem 4 applied here would mean that if you start the Markov chain at values where the stationary distribution has positive mass, then the Markov chain converges to that stationary distribution. In the example, $x = 1$ is the only point of mass for $\pi$, so if we start the chain from $x = 1$, then since $P(1, \{1\}) = 1$, we deterministically stay at this point, which is also the stationary distribution. The behavior of the chain starting at any other point is immaterial since those points are not $\pi$-a.e. $x \in \mathcal{X}$. Another thing to note is that $\phi$ is chosen to be $\pi$ in this case, which leads to $\pi$-irreducibility. For other measures that chain may not be irreducible (for e.g., counting measure), but that doesn't matter, because for Theorem 4 to hold, there needs to exists one such $\phi$. As R+R (2014) say in their paper, to replace $\pi$-a.e $x \in \mathcal{X}$ with $x \in \mathcal{X}$, the Markov chain needs to be Harris recurrent. This would mean that for all starting values in the space $\mathcal{X}$, the chain will eventually reach all sets of positive mass with probability 1. This is not true for this example, because for starting value say $x = 2$, the chain has positive probability of not going to $\{1\}$ for all $n$. So there exists no such $n$, such that $P^n(2, \{1\}) = 1$. Hence, Example 3 descries a chain that is not Harris recurrent.
