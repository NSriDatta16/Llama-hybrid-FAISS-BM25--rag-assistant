The absolute uri: http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core cannot be resolved

I picked up a newly created maven webapp project, and wants to do the simplest of the mvc application with it. my environment looks like so: spring-core spring-test spring-beans spring-context spring-aop spring-context-support spring-tx spring-orm spring-web spring-webmvc spring-asm log4j hibernate-core hibernate-cglib-repack hsqldb taglibs standard provided javax.servlet servlet-api provided 3.0.5.RELEASE 3.6.1.Final 2.1_3 1.2.14 2.5 1.8.0.10 5.1.6 1.5.2 1.5.8 3.7.ga 1.1.2 org.apache.maven.plugins maven-compiler-plugin 2.0.2 1.6 1.6 org.apache.maven.plugins maven-war-plugin 2.1-beta-1 false admin-webapp endorsed sun.boot.class.path org.apache.maven.plugins maven-compiler-plugin 2.0.2 ${settings.localRepository}/javax/javaee-endorsed-api/6.0/javaee-endorsed-api-6.0.jar${path.separator}${sun.boot.class.path} javax javaee-endorsed-api 6.0 UTF-8 Tomcat60 ${env.CATALINA_HOME} ${project.artifactId} my applicationContext is as simple as: web.xml as simple as so: 30 iwadminservlet org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet contextConfigLocation /WEB-INF/project-admin-webapp-config.xml 1 iwadminservlet / my controller is just like so: @Controller public class HomeController { @RequestMapping(value="/") public String Home(){ System.out.print("THIS IS a demo mvc, i think i like it"); // this is temporary, will use viewresolver when everything clears up return "/views/home.jsp"; } } my view is: JSP Page Hello World! the error I'm getting is org.apache.jasper.JasperException: The absolute uri: http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core cannot be resolved in either web.xml or the jar files deployed with this application Question 1 : i'm wondering if it's due to the versions I'm using, I think I've read something about supported version in tomcat, and the java ee version used.don't really get from that a way to fix my problem. How can I fix this? Question 2 : before this error I was having code 400 because I wasn't pointing it to views/home.jsp correctly but I did notice that when I run the app in netbeans, it opens the browser with the url: http://localhot:8080/ while i was expecting http://localhost:8080/admin-webapp/ admin-webapp being the name of my war. I believe this is a problem and would like to address it.
