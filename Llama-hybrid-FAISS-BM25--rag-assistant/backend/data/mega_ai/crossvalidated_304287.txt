Bias initialization in convolutional neural network

What is the correct way to initialize biases in convolutional neural networks ( tf.zeros , tf.truncated_normal , tf.random_normal ), and why? Should biases be constant? Do we even need biases in a deep neural network (like VGG-16)? In a siamese neural network, do we also share the biases along with the weights?
