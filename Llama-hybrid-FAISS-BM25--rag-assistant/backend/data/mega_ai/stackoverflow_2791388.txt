The aggregate methods don't provide rolling max/min/count/average etc - they provide a single value when the original stream completes. So for example, if you change your code to: var avgOfBids = bids.Take(5).Average(); var avgOfBidsSubscription = avgOfBids.Subscribe( b => Console.WriteLine("Avg Bid: {0}", b) ); Then once 5 bids have been made, it will display the average of them. The "average" stream will then complete too.
