nerating news stories, they programmed the AI to include commonly searched words on Google. El Pais, a Spanish news site that covers many things including sports, allows users to make comments on each news article. They use the Perspective API to moderate these comments and if the software deems a comment to contain toxic language, the commenter must modify it in order to publish it. A local Dutch media group used AI to create automatic coverage of amateur soccer, set to cover 60,000 games in just a single season. NDC partnered with United Robots to create this algorithm and cover what would have never been possible before without an extremely large team. Lede AI has been used in 2023 to take scores from high school football games to generate stories automatically for the local newspaper. This was met with significant criticism from readers for the very robotic diction that was published. With some descriptions of games being a "close encounter of the athletic kind," readers were not pleased and let the publishing company, Gannett, know on social media. Gannett has since halted their used of Lede AI until they come up with a solution for what they call an experiment. Wikipedia Millions of its articles have been edited by bots which however are usually not artificial intelligence software. Many AI platforms use Wikipedia data, mainly for training machine learning applications. There is research and development of various artificial intelligence applications for Wikipedia such as for identifying outdated sentences, detecting covert vandalism or recommending articles and tasks to new editors. Machine translation (see above) has also be used for translating Wikipedia articles and could play a larger role in creating, updating, expanding, and generally improving articles in the future. A content translation tool allows editors of some Wikipedias to more easily translate articles across several select languages. Video games In video games, AI is routinely used to generate behavior in non-player characters (NPCs). In addition, AI is used for pathfinding. Some researchers consider NPC AI in games to be a "solved problem" for most production tasks. Games with less typical AI include the AI director of Left 4 Dead (2008) and the neuroevolutionary training of platoons in Supreme Commander 2 (2010). AI is also used in Alien Isolation (2014) as a way to control the actions the Alien will perform next. Games have been a major application of AI's capabilities since the 1950s. In the 21st century, AIs have beaten human players in many games, including chess (Deep Blue), Jeopardy! (Watson), Go (AlphaGo), poker (Pluribus and Cepheus), E-sports (StarCraft), and general game playing (AlphaZero and MuZero). Kuki AI is a set of chatbots and other apps which were designed for entertainment and as a marketing tool. Character.ai is another example of a chatbot being used for recreation. Kinect, which provides a 3D bodyâ€“motion interface for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, uses algorithms that emerged from AI research. Visual images The first AI art program, called AARON, was developed by Harold Cohen in 1968 with the goal of being able to code the act of drawing. It started by creating simple black and white drawings, and later to painting using special brushes and dyes that were chosen by the program itself without mediation from Cohen. AI platforms such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Imagen, and Midjourney have been used for generating visual images from inputs such as text or other images. Some AI tools allow users to input images and output changed versions of that image, such as to display an object or product in different environments. AI image models can also attempt to replicate the specific styles of artists, and can add visual complexity to rough sketches. AI has been used to generate quantitative analysis of existing digital art collections. Two computational methods, close reading and distant viewing, are the typical approaches used to analyze
