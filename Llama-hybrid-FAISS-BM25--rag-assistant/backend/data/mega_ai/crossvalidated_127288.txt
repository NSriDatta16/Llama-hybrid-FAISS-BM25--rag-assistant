In the presence of a unit root, a shock will cause a long-term effect on the dependent variable does not imply If then the pre-strike period is stationary and the post-strike period has a unit-root, the effect is permanent . A simple way to solve your problem (part of it was already suggested in the comments): Split the sample at the strike date into pre-strike and post-strike subsamples. Fit a time series model on the pre-strike subsample and another model for the post-strike subsample. (You could start from e.g. ARIMA model using function auto.arima() in package forecast in R .) From the models, obtain the means (with standard errors) for both periods. Compare the means using a t-test. Why couldn't you just use a simple t-test for equality of the means in the two subsamples? Because the standard t-test requires the data points to be independent. Meanwhile, the data points in each subsample are most likely not independent of each other as your data is a time series.
