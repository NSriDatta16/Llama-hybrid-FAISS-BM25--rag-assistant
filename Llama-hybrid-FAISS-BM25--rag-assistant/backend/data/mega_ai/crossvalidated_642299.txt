Income Prediction using Joint Classifier and Regression Models

so I have an Income Regression task for which I'm building an XGBoost Model. When I built my first model there was an issue that the low incomes would get highly overestimated and high incomes underestimated. I was recommended to split the incomes by segments and create a Regression model for each one, then use a classifier to classify the income segment (My predicted income is the dot product of all 3 predictions and classification probabilities). This approach actually proved to be better in almost all metrics and due to the nature of the data outperformed just a single XGBoost approach. So my flow is this: 3 XGBoost Regression Models for incomes ( 1500) and an XGBClassifier. One issue I'm currently facing, is that while the individual Regression models perform very good, e.g. the I've tried tuning all the models individually, but I was thinking if there's a way to have train individual models on the shared loss somehow (Similar to how you would in Deep Learning), or maybe my approach is flawed from the beginning and It's better to stick to a single Regression model? I haven't been able to find any sources on similarly structured model, so any help & guidance will be much appreciated.
