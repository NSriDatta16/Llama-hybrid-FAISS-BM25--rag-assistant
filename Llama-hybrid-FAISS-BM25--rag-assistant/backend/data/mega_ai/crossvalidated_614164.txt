Error-in-Dependent-Variable in Panel Data

Given an unbalanced panel of data points $(X_{i,t})$ , I calculate variances in a rolling window (labelled $Y_{i,t}$ ). I want to calculate the time series mean of cross-sectional averages of this generated variable $Y_{i,t}$ . In Fama-MacBeth (1973) language, I estimate an OLS regression of $Y_{i,t}$ on a constant for each time period $t$ and then calculate the mean of the time series of intercepts. I calculate the standard error using Newey-West (1987) correction. Question: How do I incorporate the fact that $Y_{i,t}$ is a generated regressand (similar to Shanken correction for independent variables)?
