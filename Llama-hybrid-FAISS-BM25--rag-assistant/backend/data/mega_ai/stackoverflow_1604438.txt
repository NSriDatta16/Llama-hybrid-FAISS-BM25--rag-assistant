Temporary Storage in FireFox Extension

I've developed an extension that creates alot* of data during a browsing session. Think, 2 to 3 times the total HTTP traffic (images, HTML, etc.). Currently I'm just stashing all of this in a Javascript variable, but this obviously isn't tenable if the extension is going to get any serious usage. So, the question is, where should I stash this data? Its very rarely accessed, but when it is ALL of it is. Additionally, it'd be nice if the data doesn't persist beyond the current session; stale data is useless in this case, and I'd rather not fill up disk needlessly. *For something running in a browser, in Javascript
