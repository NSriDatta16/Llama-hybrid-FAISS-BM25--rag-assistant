Search Query Sample Size Determination for validation set

While designing a search system, which searches in N identifiable categories, how many search queries does one need in each category to validate the target metric (DCG) scores accurately (balanced variance and bias)? does this number depend on N or the corpus size or both? Please add any publications possible. I would also like the understand if effect size and and bayesian effective sample sizes play some role here. Given a set of search queries Q for retrieving documents from another set D , where there are N possible categories in the corpus with k(n) documents in each set, the objective is to define test minset( Q ) such that DCG obtained is reliable. Example: Searching for Fruits Search queries: [Red apple, Green apple] Category: Apple Documents: [Red Apple, Gala Apple, Green Apple,...]k1 documents Search queries: [Alphonso, Haden, Keitt] Category: Mango Documents: [Keitt, Kent, Haden,....]k2 documents . . . The search results will be ranked and the accuracy of search is measured with DCG. How many search queries do you need in each set to have a reliable DCG as a function of the categories and the document set?
