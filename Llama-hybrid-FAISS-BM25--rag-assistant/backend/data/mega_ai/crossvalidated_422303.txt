For your three questions: Since the estimation of any parameter in the model also depends on the other variables/values of the other parameters in the model, there is no reason to expect that $\hat{\beta}_0^{lasso}$ will equal $\hat{\beta}_0^{log}$ . This is clear from the version of the normal equations for logistic regression that you can find in this answer: When is logistic regression solved in closed form? . No, the intercept must be estimated iteratively together with the other parameters. I don't think much can be said in general. If the constant vector consisting only of 1's which represent the intercept in the matrix formulation of the model, is orthogonal or closely so to the other predictors, probably not much. Otherwise could change a lot, I guess. Look at examples.
