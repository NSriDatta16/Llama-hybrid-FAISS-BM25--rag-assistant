access report from dynamic crosstab query and vba to "manually" generate reports

I have come across the problem of generating complex access reports (by complex I mean with data processing, variable number of fields, among others). Let me explain in deeper detail some of the things I need to implement: Some fields should not show according to some values in a query If a certain record does not exist, a nice colored (very noticeable) message should appear instead of the values that would be there (Suppose, for example, that a record with 03/04/2009 in the date field exists, a record with 03/06/2009 in the date field also exists but no record with 03/05/2009 exists. Before showing the data related to the last record, I should print something like "Didn't show up on 03/05/2009") A bar chart that takes as data not the values in the records, but instead something else that is calculated over a set of records (like an average of all grades for a certain date). The number of series in this chart also varies according to values in the records, this chart would not be in the detail section, but instead in the page heading or some kind of group heading. It should also be mentioned that the query is a TRANSFORM query (more precisely, an INNER JOIN of many TRANSFORM queries), and thus the number of columns returned by the query varies. While in the past I've been unable to bind this query as the recordsource for the report, somehow Access stopped complaining for now (can someone please clarify this? Is this normal, should I not worry about it and use it as a recordsource or should I avoid it?) There are two options to achieve what I want (that I can see for now): Create a report with no record source and lots of unbound fields, and through several events (Report_Open, Section_Format, etc.) and with the help of DAO, manually set the values of these fields. Changing the Data Series of the chart is also possible through VBA. Set the record source to the query, and create some crazy and confusing VBA code to deal with the data and implement everything I need. It seems to me that option 2 is going to be a huge headache and waste of time, and I recognize option 1 is pretty much like writing to an Excel file (since all the data is obtained with DAO), which would be much easier since I have much more control over almost everything there (but for many other reasons, we want everything in an access report) While I'm biased and intend to go with option 1, I have found several problems with this option, for example: I can't find a way to create new pages in the report with VBA, and thus I'm limited only to the first page. Lack of some kind of free, online, decent and complete documentation on VBA and Access Reports Also, if option 2 is more viable, I'm certainly willing to go with it, but I would also need some advice, and perhaps some tips to solving the problems I mentioned in this question. So, the questions are: Where can I find some decent and complete documentation on Access Reports and VBA? How can I create pages in an access report, and choose which page I want to write to? With the problem I have in my hands, will I reach any bottlenecks I should know about? Should I already be thinking of alternatives to Access Reports (writing to a spreadsheet, for example?)
