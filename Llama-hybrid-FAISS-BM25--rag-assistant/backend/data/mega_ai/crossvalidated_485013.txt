Ergodicity and mean-ergodicity are not the same properties. Ergodicity is a much stronger property than mean-ergodicity (mean-ergodicity just means an $L^2$ -LLN holds). There are easy examples of ARMA processes which are not ergodic. What was shown by previous answer is that an ARMA process is mean-ergodic. (This is simply because that $l^1$ , the space of absolutely summable sequences, is closed under convolution, and this makes the autocovariances also $l^1$ , which implies mean-ergodicity.) Why is ergodicity not a requirement for ARIMA modeling? There is no reason for it to be. These notions have different historical origins. Ergodicity was first introduced in statistical mechanics, and intended to capture the phenomenon that "time average equals ensemble average". On the other hand, ARIMA models were introduced by Box and Jenkins for time series modeling. You can already see from the definitions that they occur in different settings. Ergodicity is a property defined for strictly stationary processes, whereas ARMA processes are considered under covariance-stationarity. From a time series perspective, first, the strict stationarity under which ergodicity is considered is too stringent an assumption to impose on general data. Second, the weak LLN that holds for many covariance-stationary processes (e.g. under $l^1$ -condition for the autocovariances) is empirically just as good as the strong ergodic LLN. For a good while, these two literatures developed separately and did not talk to each other. Later there were attempts to link the two notions by characterizing when ARMA processes satisfy strong-mixing type of conditions, which is a strengthening of ergodicity for more general processes (by, e.g. Kolmogorov and co-authors). But the connection is still incomplete. ...is there an example of a ergodic, but non-stationary process? As stated above, ergodic processes are by definition strictly stationary.
