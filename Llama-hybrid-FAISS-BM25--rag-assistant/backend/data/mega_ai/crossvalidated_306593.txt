This response should be a comment but it's too long for that format. I'm open to suggestions of deleting this response and breaking it down into multiple, more bite-sized comments. Thread participants (i.e., that relatively small and oligarchic set of active, senior CV members), please weigh in on that. Your question is analogous to the skill vs luck or "hot hands" debate in statistical, probabilistic sports analysis. "Hot hands" refers to the phenomenon whereby athletes are perceived to be making more successful shots in a run or sequence of shots relative to some long run expectation. Gelman had a post about this a year or so ago. In other words and at least locally for a given block, run or sequence of attempts, that run significantly exceeds the global or unconditional expectation of success. Based on such unconditional analyses, it was concluded that "hot hands" phenomenon didn't exist or, if it did, it couldn't be confirmed using classic statistical models. This conclusion has had a big impact on decision theoretics insofar as it confirmed or was consistent with the assumptions of memoryless markov processes based on exponential distributions. Many very senior statisticians and decision theorists have weighed in on this problem, e.g., Tversky. That you state that the odds of success, given a success, go back to the long run average of 5% is consistent with this classic or "commonsense" approach to thinking about the "hot hands" issue. However, there is another way to frame the analysis which amounts to a "success breeds success" point of view, kind of like a statistical Matthew Effect as described by Derek de Sola Price aka Price's Law . By framing the problem as a conditional expectation, the classic, unconditional approach is falsified as incorrect. In other words, given a success, a conditional model contends that the likelihood or odds that the next attempt is also a success goes up. Based on their analysis of the NBA three-point basketball contest, Miller and Sanjuro in a paper titled Is it a Fallacy to Believe in the Hot Hand in the NBA Three-Point Contest? (ungated copy here ... http://www.igier.unibocconi.it/files/548.pdf ) develop the likelihood function associated with this phenomenon and demonstrate that, in fact, the "hot hands" phenomenon does exist. As long as you maintain your statement that, given a success, the odds or likelihood of the next attempt also being a success roll back to the unconditional expectation of 5%, the insights Miller and Sanjuro bring can't help in answering your question.
