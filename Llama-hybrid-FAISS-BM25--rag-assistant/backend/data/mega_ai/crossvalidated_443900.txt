If one follows a Bayesian approach, it should apply to all aspects of the model and not only to one particular parameter $\theta$ . Hence I suggest considering the posterior distribution on $\mathbb E[X|\theta]$ , which mathematically derives from the posterior distribution on $\theta$ . Plug-in estimates contradict one of the reasons for adopting a Bayesian viewpoint, namely to convey uncertainty as well as point estimates.
