To avoid saying everything Mark Ingram already said a little tip for using namespaces: Avoid the "using namespace" directive in header files - this opens the namespace for all parts of the program which import this header file. In implementation files (*.cpp) this is normally no big problem - altough I prefer to use the "using namespace" directive on the function level. I think namespaces are mostly used to avoid naming conflicts - not necessarily to organize your code structure. I'd organize C++ programs mainly with header files / the file structure. Sometimes namespaces are used in bigger C++ projects to hide implementation details. Additional note to the using directive: Some people prefer using "using" just for single elements: using std::cout; using std::endl;
