Online index creation and rebuild are available only on Enterprise Edition. See How Online Index Operations Work and Guidelines for Performing Online Index Operations . There are some restrictions, most notable ones being: clustered index must be created/rebuilt offline if they contain any BLOB fields (image, ntext, text, varchar(max), nvarchar(max), varbinary(max), and xml). intitial clustered index on a view must be created offline. You must ensure your database have enough space to perform the online index operation, as it requires about 1.5 times the size of the table in addition to the current size. During the online index creation the table exist twice in the database, hence the extra space needed. Since your case falls in the excluded category (initial clustered index on a view) then you need not worry about online indexes. You must use an offline index operation. BTW you must also be aware that indexed views are considered by the optimizer only in Enterprise Edition. On lower editions one must specify the NOEXPAND clause in the view to leverage a possible index on the view.
