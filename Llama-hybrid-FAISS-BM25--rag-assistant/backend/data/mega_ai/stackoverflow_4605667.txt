You can change the type name in the dbml/designer. It doesn't have to be an exact match to the table name. Re the constructor; to chain to another existing constructor you can use the :this(...) syntax after your constructors declaration (nut before the body). No: you don't need to modify the data-context if you are just adding a partial class fragment. Yo create a new instance just use new - it is the same type as it was before (a partial class just splits a type over several physical files that the compiler must merge). Re the DB name in the data-context; it is common to pick up the connection details from config at runtime, in which case this is ignored.
