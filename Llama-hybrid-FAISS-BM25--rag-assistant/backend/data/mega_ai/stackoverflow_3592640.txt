Whether you should be able to do this is basically a matter of who you ask. The email RFC states that you should. Best practice for hosting and ISP says you shouldn't. So seen from PHP point of view. Yes you should Edit: And btw you're not sending the mail from somebody's account your simply stating that you email is something differrent from what's actually true. Which is basically the same as introducing yourself to a stranger as, let's say "Bill Clinton". If the receiver is paying attention they'll know it's wrong. In the real world because you don't look like him and in the email world you can simply test if the sending server is allowed to rely from that specific domain.
