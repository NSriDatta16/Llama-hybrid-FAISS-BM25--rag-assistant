Since the team has already brainstormed on some high-level requirements for the project, you are well on your way to a decently-organized project. I would suggest that you collaboratively write up and review a more technical specification of what you are developing. The act of getting it all on paper, defining discrete components/modules/etc, and defining the interactions/expectations for these parts will all help to iron out details and identify potential problems and misunderstandings early in the project. Spending the time to do this early in the project will help to avoid wasted time later. Use version control. Keep the group talking to one another and informed of any changes to the specs or requirements. If it is a complex project, I would suggest making some milestones, so that you have your crucial functionality before the deadline so that you can start adding any nice-to-have functionality as time allows. Take a look at "functional specification" templates and examples online to get some good ideas of what yours might include. Don't take them too seriously, and don't follow them to the letter - you know what is needed to properly define your project, and what is not necessary. But I think getting it all on paper and talking it over is what will help your project the most.
