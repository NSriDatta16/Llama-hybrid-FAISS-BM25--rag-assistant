You could do Regression Analysis to predict the number of downloads on a given day. This image from Wikipedia shows some sample data points and the best-fit line. In case of downloads, the X axis could represents days, and Y axis could represent the number of downloads. Keeping that assumption, one would see that the number of downloads are going up each day on average. Here's a good article explaining Linear Regression and IBM has written two articles on how to implement Simple Linear Regression with PHP ( 1 , 2 ).
