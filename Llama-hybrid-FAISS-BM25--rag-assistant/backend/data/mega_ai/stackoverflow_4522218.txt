Python - Separate program logic and GUI code?

What would be the best way of separating program logic to the GUI code? I wanted different GUI (GTK, KDE, CLI) code using the same program logic. I was thinking of using different python module (winecellar-common, winecellar-gtk, winecellar-cli) not sure how I would do this and if its the best way. * EDITED * Just to add to my question what would be the best way to organize the projects file structure and build platform with different modules. Keep in mind its mainly being used on Ubuntu.
