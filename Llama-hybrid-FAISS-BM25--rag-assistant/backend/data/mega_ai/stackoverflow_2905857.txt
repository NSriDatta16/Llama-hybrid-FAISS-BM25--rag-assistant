Table Column Resizing/Drag 'n' Dropping in jQuery

I'm looking for a way to implement both resizing and drag 'n' drop for columns (not rows) within a predefined table using jQuery. I've done a bit of Googling and haven't really found anything that fits the bill as many require you to essentially reconstruct your table using jQuery. I simply want to plug this functionality in, not have my entire table structure dictated by a third-party. Does anyone know of any plugins that might help me to do this, and if not are there any jQuery Gurus out there that have solved this problem already?
