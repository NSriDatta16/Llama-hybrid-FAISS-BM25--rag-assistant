image information along a polar coordinate system

I have a set of png images that I would like to process with Python and associated tools. Each image represents a physical object with known dimensions. In each image there is a specific feature of the object at a certain pixel/physical location. The location is different for each image. I would like to impose a polar coordinate system on a given image with the origin at the location of this feature. I would then like to be able to get the following information: - the image intensity as a function of radial position for a given polar angle - the image intensity as a function of radial position when values are averaged over all polar angles. I am experienced in Python programming and the use of many functions in NumPy and SciPy, but I am a complete novice when it comes to image analysis. I would appreciate any advice you can give me on possible approaches to use to solve this problem. Thank you.
