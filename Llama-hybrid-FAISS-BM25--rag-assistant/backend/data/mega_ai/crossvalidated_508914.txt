Graph Neural Network for “Classification” - The right approach?

Problem statement System System(Level 1) of systems(Level 2) of systems (Level 3) (hierarchical, maximum 3 Levels) Level 1 describes the entire system which is composed by some systems (let's say 1-5) Level 2 can be composed by multiple subsystems (Level 3) The minor level systems (Level 3) are described by a feature vector X and can be described in various ways Z which I simplified to integers: 0-5 The entire structure leads to multiple output values. My approach is to summarize the output value to a point system from 0 to 10 where 0 means bad quality and 10 means good quality : Result Value Y Data I guessed that a Graph representation is describing the problem quite well so.. I have a set of trainings data M different graphs including feature vectors N and representations Z for each node and the system output value Y Objective Given a new graph including feature vectors N and representations Z , I want to predict the quality of the system (give points from 0 to 10) Schematic Depiction The exemplary grayscale rows at the bubbles depict the feature vectors (N) , the numbers in the node represent the representations (Z) Question(s) I am not a Computer Science Professional nor a DL/ML expert. However, I did pass some online courses for ML/DL tasks. The topic of GNN seems to be over the top of these courses, so I havent heard of them and only slowly starting in GNNs. So: Do you think GNN is the correct approach for this problem or this type of data structure? I cant find any simple tutorial on how to use GNN for this purpose. Any recommendations or advices or hints? What is the best way to introduce the representation Z to the data? Straightforward would be to add another column to the feature vector which contains Z , but in my opinion that doesnt sound quite smart.
