In relation to organising your php project, I would probably aim to Sit down with some paper and a pen and design your whole project on paper. It's always going to be easier to see potential problems before they arise if you know ahead of schedule what might go wrong. Regarding 1, this will involve what data types are going to be used, and where and how in your front end UI you will be asking for data and what it should look like - that'll help with writing your php. All fairly standard approach really. Regarding coding standard, try here for one. Create a decent test plan. I prefer to do this towards the end of development as things are bound to change during your development cycle. Every area of your php code must be tested so you're satisfied it all works as expected - including boundary exceptions. Again, fairly standard stuff really.
