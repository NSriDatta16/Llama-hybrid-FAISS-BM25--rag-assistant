I need the same solution that porta is looking for. My scenario is i'm building a drag and drop cms. Users can drag drop html elements to build their pages. Now how do i save these changes (to db or to a session var) and must be able to create a static page with all the above changes that the user made with php. Can someone shed some light. I'm totally new to jquery and wouldn't consider myself expert in php.
