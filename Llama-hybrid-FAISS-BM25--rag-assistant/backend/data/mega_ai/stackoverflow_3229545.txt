This is actually pretty tough to answer. I'm sure each algorithm is good at picking up different types of input triggers. More than likely, you'll need some statistical analysis to determine what each algorithm will usually detect as cancer. Additionally, you may go so far as to do something like make a Bayesian model to describe/determine if a patient has cancer based off of the algorithmic results. you may find that 3 algorithms consistently miss the specific type of cancer that the other two are moderately good at picking up. you may discover similar relationships that occur, like when algorithms 2, 3, and 5 say there is no cancer, algorithm 1 says there is, and algorithm 4 is inconclusive, that there are usually typically-benign spots of a certain shape and color intensity that should be analyzed but probably aren't cancer.
