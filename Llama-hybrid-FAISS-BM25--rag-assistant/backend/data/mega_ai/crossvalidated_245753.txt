It is the nature of $y$, the outcome you're trying to predict/explain, that determines whether you use a regression approach or classification approach. If $y$ is continuous, e.g. count, cost, profit, etc., then you use a regression approach. If $y$ is categorical, e.g. yes vs. no, then you use a classification approach. Both approaches allow both continuous and categorical predictors $x$. Note: this distinction generally comes up in machine learning; in statistics, both approaches fall under the term 'regression', e.g. logistic regression is for yes/no outcomes.
