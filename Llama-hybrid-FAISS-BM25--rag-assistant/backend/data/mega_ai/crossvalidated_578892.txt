Computing average cost per foot of paved road

(In this example some details are changed to avoid revealing customer secrets, but I think for all intents and purposes, the actual problem I'm presenting here is equivalent to the one I'm having.) I have in mind a particular improvement to a process, but before I propose it I want to be able to measure it's effect. I hope my idea would make it cheaper to construct paved roads in my region. So to start with, I want to find out how expensive it is to construct road today. I have access to a listing of all roads constructed in the past few years . What I want to do is make a random sample of these roads , then contact the relevant people to find out how many feet were constructed, and at what total cost . From this, I expect to be able to compute an average dollar-cost per foot of road in my region. This sounds simple enough. Here's my problem: I can think of two ways of doing the computation: Either I treat the roads themselves as units. Then I would compute dollars/feet for each, and then average together those numbers. Alternatively, I treat the feet-of-paved-roads as units. This would result in each sampled road contributes a different number of feet to the average – hypothetically, if there's a really long road that turned out to be very expensive, it would drive up the average compared to the previous method. Either way, from what I can tell, each foot of road has an equal opportunity to end up in the sample. So the decision is mainly "do I count average foot-cost per road, or average cost per foot of road?" On this, I have two questions: Which of these two approaches give the most correct result? I honestly cannot tell you if "foot-cost per road" or "cost per foot of road" is the more meaningful measurement. What am I missing? If the most meaningful measurement is "cost per foot of road" then the computation effectively becomes, for the entire sample, sum(dollars)/sum(feet) – how do I get the variance of this statistic? Sorry if this sounds basic. I know I should know this stuff, but for some reason it escapes me and I haven't been able to figure it out the past few days. I've been looking both into Cochran's Sampling Techniques and Levy's Sampling of Populations – I know both books come close to this specific question, but they never linger on it and go deeper into it. I'll continue my research into the sampling literature I have at home, but in the meantime if any of you happen to know the answers – please share! I'm aware stratifying the sample would allow me to treat very long roads separately in case they practically make up a separate population cost-wise, but that ends up being the same problem: do I weigh the strata by number of roads in each, or by the total length of road in each?
