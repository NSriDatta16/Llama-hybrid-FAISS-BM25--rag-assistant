Use centered variables or include an intercept in time series analysis?

I have read that analogous to univariate AR(p) models, there are two possibilities to allow for a non-zero mean with VAR(p) models: a) either use centered variables in the model: Φ(B)(Xt − μ) = Zt b) or include an ‘intercept’ in the regression: Φ(B)Xt = v + Zt Is there any difference in interpretation when using the first or second approach in the context of time series analysis?
