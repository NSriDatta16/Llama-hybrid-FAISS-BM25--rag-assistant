Under the assumption you can run the stored procedure successfully from SQL Developer, my guess would be that you are passing an incorrect value for the input parameter i_prof_sk, perhaps something like you're passing a C# float value to the procedure. If that doesn't make sense, please post the C# code calling the procedure, including the parameter setup. Some of the C# sharps around here can probably tell you what isn't right. I've also added the C# tag to perhaps get the attention of one of those folks.
