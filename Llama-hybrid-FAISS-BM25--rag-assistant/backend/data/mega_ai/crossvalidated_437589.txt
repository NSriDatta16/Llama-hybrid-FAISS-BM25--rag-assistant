First, for normal data $S = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X)^2$ is (mean) biased for $\sigma,$ especially so for small $n.$ The unbiasing constant depends on $n.$ For your sample size $n = 32$ my simulation below in R, illustrates this. With a million iterations it is reasonable to expect about 2-place accuracy. set.seed(1123) s = replicate(10^6, sd(rnorm(32,4,8))) mean(s) [1] 7.93691 # biased: The sample variance $S^2$ has median below $\sigma^2.$ This is not surprising because $\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \mathsf{Chisq}(n-1),$ a right-skewed distribution. median(s^2) [1] 62.64106 # 1/2 I am not sure what formula you are using for your 95% confidence interval. The commonly used CI for normal $\mu$ is based on $S$ as defined above and Student's t distribution with $n - 1$ degrees of freedom: $\bar X \pm t^*S/\sqrt{n},$ where $t^*$ cuts probability 2.5 from the upper tail of $\mathsf{T}(\nu = n-1).$ A sample size $n = 32$ is not quite large enough to substitute the normal quantile 1.96 for $t^*.$ R code continues from above: set.seed(1123) a = replicate(10^6, mean(rnorm(32, 4, 8))) mean(a); median(a) [1] 3.999486 # aprx 4 [1] 3.998304 # aprx 4 qt = qt(.975, 31); qt [1] 2.039513 # not 1.96 LCL = a - qt*s/sqrt(32) UCL = a + qt*s/sqrt(32) mean((LCL = 4)) [1] 0.94955 # aprx 0.95 I am not sure I follow the syntax of your uncommented R code, but it seems you may be using 1.96 and a version of the sample variance with denominator $n$ instead of $n-1.$ If that is the case, then it should be no surprise that your coverage probability is not exactly 95%.
