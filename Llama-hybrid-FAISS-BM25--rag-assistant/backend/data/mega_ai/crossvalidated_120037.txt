Assuming independence between the grid cells, then yes it appears Bayes' Theorem has been properly applied. The denominator can be expanded, e.g. $$P(X) = P(X|A)P(A) + P(X|A^c)P(A^c)$$ using the law total of probability where $A^c$ is the complement of $A$, i.e. the person is not there. Likely you would assume $P(X|A^c)=1$. I'm not really sure what "normalized in the normal Bayesian fashion means" since I didn't write the manual. But they are certainly talking about the fact that the following three equations are sufficient to find $P(A|X)$: $$P(A|X) \propto P(X|A)P(A)\quad P(A^c|X), \propto P(X|A^c)P(A^c), \mbox{ and } P(A|X)+P(A^c|X) = 1$$ So you never have to calculate $P(X)$, i.e. the normalizing constant. Whether they used this to update the probability for a single grid cell or for the entire map, I don't know (probably both). Let's expand the notation to have grid cell $i$ and $A_i$ be the event the individual is in grid cell $i$ and $X_i$ be the event that grid cell $i$ was searched and nobody was found. With the new notation, $X$ is going to be the collection of searches that failed. We assume the following: $\sum_i P(A_i|X)=1$, i.e. after performing searches, the sum overall cells of the probability that the individual is in that cell is 1. This is the total law of probability again. If we assume searching in one cell does not tell us anything about any other cell, then for cells that were searched $P(A_i|X) = P(A_i|X_i)\propto P(X_i|A_i)P(A_i)$ and for cells that were not searched $P(A_i|X) \propto P(A_i)$. If we don't assume independence, the formulas will be more complicated but the intuition will be similar, i.e. calculating $P(A_i|X)$ up to a proportionality constant. We can use these two assumptions to calculate $P(A_i|X)$ and update the map accordingly.
