Why am I getting accuracy of Xgboost model 0.00%?

I am trying to build Job Recommender System using Deep Learning. dataset used From this dataset i have taken only users.tsv, user_history.tsv, apps.tsv and jobs.tsv to build a hybrid recommender system. The steps i have performed till now are: One hot encoding on this dataset Embedding on one hot encoded features to reduce dimension and sparsity Concatenated all the 4 datasets(Embedded matrix and non-categorical features of dataset) Created Xgboost model for feature regularization But I am getting accuracy of xgboost model equal to 0.00%. After this i also need to perform CNN to get the top-k recommendations, but since i am getting accuracy of xgboost model zero i cannot proceed further. So, please help me.
