As you said, you are familiar with relevant answers ; see also : So, as long as "Factor analysis..." + a couple of last paragraphs; and the bottom list here . In short, PCA is mostly a data reduction technique whereas FA is a modeling-of-latent-traits technique. Sometimes they happen to give similar results; but in your case - because you probably feel like constructing/validating latent traits as if real entities - using FA would be more honest and you shouldn't prefer PCA in hope that their results converge. On the other hand, whenever you aim to summarise/simplify the data - for subsequent analysis, for example - you would prefer PCA, as it doesn't impose any strong model (which might be irrelevant) on the data. To reiterate other way, PCA gives you dimensions which may correspond to some subjectively meaningful constructs, if you wish, while EFA poses that those are even covert features that actually generated your data, and it aims to find those features. In FA, interpretation of the dimensions (factors) is pending - whether you can attach a meaning to a latent variable or not, it "exists" (FA is essentialistic), otherwise you should drop it from the model or get more data to support it. In PCA, the meaning of a dimension is optional. And yet once again in other words: When you extract m factors (separate factors from errors), these few factors explain (almost) all correlation among variables, so that the variables are not left room to correlate via the errors anyhow. Therefore, so long as "factors" are defined as latent traits which generate/bind the correlated data, you have full clues to interpret that - what is responsible for the correlations. In PCA (extract components as if "factors"), errors (may) still correlate between the variables; so you can't claim that you've extracted something enough clean and exhaustive to be interpreted in that way. You may want to read my other, longer answer in the current discussion, for some theoretical and simulation experiment details about whether PCA is a viable substitute of FA. Please pay attention also to outstanding answers by @amoeba given on this thread. Upd : In their answer to this question @amoeba, who opposed there, introduced a (not well-known) technique PPCA as standing halfway between PCA and FA. This naturally launched the logic that PCA and FA are along one line rather than opposite. That valuable approach expands one's theoretical horizons. But it can mask the important practical difference about that FA reconstructs (explains) all the pairwise covariances with a few factors, while PCA cannot do it successfully (and when it occasionally does it - that is because it happened to mime FA).
