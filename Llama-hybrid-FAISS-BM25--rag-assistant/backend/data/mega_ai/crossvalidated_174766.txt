As @jlimahaverford said, there is not enough information. You are trying to determine $$ P(H|B=b,P=p) $$ where $H$ is the event "a hit", $B=b$ indicates the batter is $b$, and $P=p$ indicates the pitcher is $p$. But the information you have is $$ P(H|B=b) \quad \mbox{and} \quad P(H|P=p) $$ and there is no obvious way to get from these two pieces of information to what you are trying to determine. One approach you might want to look into is logistic regression where the response is the binary outcome of each at bat (hit or no hit) and the explanatory variables are the IDs of the batter and hitter in that at bat. Then you could learn the quality of each batter and pitcher. From this information, you could predict what would happen for a particular batter-pitcher combination.
