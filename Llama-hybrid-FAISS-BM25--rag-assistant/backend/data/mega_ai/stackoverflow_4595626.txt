I haven't done this before with WCF, but the following should work: Define a DataContract type containing start and length properties. Declare it as a SOAP Header to be used in all of the data retrieval operations. Write an extension method on IEnumerable that accepts the SOAP Header object. This method would return enumerable.Skip(start).Take(length) . Call the extension method in the return from each data retrieval method.
