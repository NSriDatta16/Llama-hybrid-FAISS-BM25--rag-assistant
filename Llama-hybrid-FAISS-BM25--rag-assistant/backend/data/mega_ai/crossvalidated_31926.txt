As always, it depends on the purpose of the plot: what is it intended to communicate to whom? In any event, cumulative plots tend to be interesting and informative. The NY Times has lately been producing many nice examples. Some examples of similar plots appear on the " Edward Tufte forum" . This combination of "sparklines" (cumulative plots without labeled axes), tabular data, and the raw time series provides a lot of information in one place: Note the subtleties of design , such as positioning the table rows and the righthand plots (just binary time series plots) at heights corresponding to the final standings; and using consistent colors across the sparklines, the table, and the time series plots. In looking these over, I would be tempted to redesign them slightly: either scale one or both plots by time, rather than game index, to introduce chronological information; or--perhaps better--put gaps between the individual series of games. (Baseball is usually played in series of three or four games between pairs of teams. This structure can be important in understanding the data.) Even better: at the right, color-code each series according to the opposing team (or perhaps just the strength of the opposing team) rather than using monochromatic series. These recommendations follow principles enunciated by Tufte in his first book on the topic, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information , in which he advocates increasing the data-ink ratio through erasing (here, putting gaps in the data to show the series) and modifying the graphical modes of representation (here, replacing an uninformative single color by changes of color).
