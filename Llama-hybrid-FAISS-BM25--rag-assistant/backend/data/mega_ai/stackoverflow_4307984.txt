I try to recap: You want to build a CMS Your CMS manages a single web site A web site is made of content There are differenti type of contents, and I am assuming every type of content has its own behaviour Contents are organized in a tree Here is the plan I suggest you: Create the Content resource; use the scaffold to have something already working, adding few field (title and body in example) Add validations to your new model Write a couple of unit tests against your validation (quite useless, just to see how it works) Install awesome_nested_set and manage to make it working with your model Work on the UI to make it quite easy to create new content, move content around, edit a single content Now its time to implement the content types; STI is the Rails way, but I have to warn you it can be really hard . I suggest you to reiterate 1, 2, 3, 5 to create new models for Photo and BlogPost Once you will be there, you will have hundreds of ideas to implement. Have fun :)
