InnoDB is a safer ACID compliant engine with some integrity features that MyISAM lacks. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-engines.html Clearly, if you are concerned with de safety of your data I would use InnoDB. Would you use an engine that does not support transactions? MyISAM is used for performance reasons.
