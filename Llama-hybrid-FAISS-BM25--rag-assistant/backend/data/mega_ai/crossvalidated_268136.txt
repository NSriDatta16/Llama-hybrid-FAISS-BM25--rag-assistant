What's a "corner" in a parameter space?

I'm learning about Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and one of the stated benefits is that it can move around a parameter space more efficiently and that it can (from Bayesian Data Analysis , 3rd ed.) turn corners in parameter space to preserve the total 'energy' of the trajectory. What does BDA mean by a "corner" in the parameter space and why wouldn't a Gibbs or Metropolis-Hastings sampler be able to "turn the corner?"
