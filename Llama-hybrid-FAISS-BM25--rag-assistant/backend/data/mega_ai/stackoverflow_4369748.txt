Entity Framework and SQL Server Synonyms

Hasty research tells me that even EF4 still doesn't support SQL Server synonyms. What are my options for setting up a synonym based entity set as if it were a table based entity set? The crudest I have come up with is to copy the underlying table for the synonym, add it to my model, and then rename the entity set in the store model. Is there no more elegant workaround using the POCO or code-first approach?
