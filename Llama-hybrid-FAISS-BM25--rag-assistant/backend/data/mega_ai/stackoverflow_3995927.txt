The Publish field of Publishing section contains a date and time for an item to be published from. If you do not specify anything here, the item is publishable by default. These changes are applied to the whole item (the field is shared). If you'd like to change this for different versions, use the LifeTime section instead. I would encourage you to get acquainted with Content Cookbook for more details.
