writing down likelihood for dynamic state space model?

I have a discrete-time state space model where observations depend on a latent rate $X$. The prior on the rate is $X \sim \mathrm{Normal}(\mu_x, \sigma_x)$. Each observation $Y_t$ is generated using the rate and the previous observation $Y_{t-1}$: $Y_t = Y_{t-1} + Y_{t-1}X$ where $Y_0 \sim \mathrm{Normal}(\mu_y, \sigma_y)$. The rate $X$ could be time-dependent as well but for simplicity assume there is a single rate $X$ fixed across time. I want to find $P(X \mid Y_1,...,Y_t)$. The question is: What is the likelihood function of $Y_t$ given $X$ and $Y_{t-1}$, i.e. $P(Y_t \mid Y_{t-1}, X)$? update: as @jbowman said $P(Y_t \mid Y_{t-1}, X)$ is degenerate since $Y_t$ is completely determined by $Y_{t-1}, X$. more about the problem to respond to @peuhp: my data are observations $Y_1,...,Y_n$, of levels of a material through (discrete) time. the rate of change of the material ($R$) is the parameter I want to estimate. $R$ constrains $Y$ in a deterministic way, so the probability is degenerate. is there a way to formulate this more naturally as a hierarchical bayesian model, to avoid degenerate probability distributions?
