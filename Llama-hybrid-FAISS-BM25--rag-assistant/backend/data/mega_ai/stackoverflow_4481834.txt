You might be better off looking at Prefuse (http://www.prefuse.org), or Flare (http://flare.prefuse.org). The former is Java based, the latter Flash. Protovis is a little different in that it's plain old Javascript running the browser, using SVG as the canvas. You're not going to be able to readily leverage that in a Python rewrite. If you're after a graph/network visualisation package, you might want to check out NetworkX: http://networkx.lanl.gov/
