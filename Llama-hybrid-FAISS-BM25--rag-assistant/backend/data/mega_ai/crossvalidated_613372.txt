NO The point of the ROC curve is to assess model performance across a range of thresholds. In that sense, the ROC curve and the area under it are measures of how well the model is able to separate the two classes. This is separate from applying a threshold and going with the classifications that arise from the two-step model that first makes predictions on a continuum and then uses a threshold to decide on the bin to which each prediction corresponds. It might be that some thresholds are terrible for your task, and that is okay. If you get to a point where you have to use a threshold, you would just use a different one and be okay with the fact that some thresholds do not work. In fact, if you have a logistic regression that makes probability predictions on the interval $[0,1]$ , setting a threshold of $-2$ or $+2$ puts you in a position where every observation is classified the same way no matter what modeling you do, which probably is not acceptable performance. In that situation, there is literally nothing you can do to tune the model to make varied categorical predictions.
