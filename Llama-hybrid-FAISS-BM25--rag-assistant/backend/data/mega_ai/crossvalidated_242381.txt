1. How good / bad is the model? The results aren’t very good. Precision of 0.12 means that for each 100 cases your model classified as ‘positive’, it was right in only 12 (correct classifications out of classifications by the model). Recall of 0.52 means that for every 100 cases in which the real result was ‘1’, the model classified 52 correctly (correct classifications of of real cases). f1-score is a harmonic mean between the two. Support states how many observations belonged to the class (for example, in your case there were 472 observations with a real value of ‘1’). An answer to the question "which metric is more important" depends on the context and the price of each mistake. There's an elaborate explanation on precision and recall here . How can the model be improved? As stated here , an imbalanced dataset is a common issue in Machine Learning. I’d start with undersampling the dominant class since it’s the simplest approach. In your case, you might decide on taking around 1000 positive cases and 1000 negative cases as your train set, and keep a similar proportion in your test set. I’d try random forest or SVM instead of logistic regression. There are a lot of considerations to take into account when choosing a model, but since you just started exploring the field, these are two very popular choices you can consider.
