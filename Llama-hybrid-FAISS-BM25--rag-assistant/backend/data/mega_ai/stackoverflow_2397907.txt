If you want a fast and memory efficient implementation you are going to want to use an array to back your map. Use the hashing algorithms that you want to index into the array and store the object in that slot of the array. There are a lot of little details that you will want to pay attention to. When to resize the array, how to detect and resolve a hash collision, etc. I'd recommend making your class implement java.util.Map as it will give you a good idea of what methods will be necessary and useful.
