Programmer collaboration system

Do you ever face the problem that there are a bunch of programmers in your organization that you met at the coffee machine one day, but you have no idea what the heck they're up to? Are you ever faced with a problem you're pretty certain someone in your company has solved before, but you don't know who, and how to find out? These are some of the challenges I'd like to address, but how? Is there any decent "programmer's collaboration software" out there that offers blogs, discussion forums, file areas for code snippets, documents, white papers, and of course a knowledge base and more? We have Sharepoint and I do not feel it qualifies. Any idea? Recommendations? I would think someone must have solved that problem before, but how do I find out?
