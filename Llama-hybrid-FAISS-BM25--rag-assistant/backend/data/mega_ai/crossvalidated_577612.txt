applying bayesian stats to pre-natal screening

Can it be that given a negative test result the probability of the disease is only 0.02% ? I would like to know the probability of having the disease given a negative test (screening) result. I'm unsure if the contingency table and my calculations are correct. prevalence of 0.1% in population; 1 in 1000 people get the disease. screening sensitivity 80%, 4 out of 5 sick people are detected. screen positive 1.45% of tests, 145 out of 10000 people have a positive test result. disease not disease + 80 1370 1450 - 20 98530 98550 100 99900 100000 Can this be answered as follows? P(disease | screen negative) = P(screen negative | disease) * P(disease) / P(screen negative) P(screen negative | disease) = 0.2; since 20 out of 100 people have the disease but screen negative. P(disease) = 0.001; prevalence in population. P(screen negative) = 1 - P(screen positive) = 1 - 0.0145 = 0.9855 plugging in the numbers P(disease | screen negative) = 0.2 * 0.001 / 0.9855 = 0.02%
