It's really broken! I didn't know it #include int main(void) { int counter = 1; char command, prefix; int input; do { printf("counter: %d: ", counter); scanf("%c %c%d", &command, &prefix, &input); printf("---%c %c%d---\n", command, prefix, input); counter++; } while (command != 'q'); } counter: 1: a b1 ---a b1--- counter: 2: c d2 --- c1--- counter: 3: e f3 ---d 21--- counter: 4: ---e f3--- counter: 5: g h4 --- g3--- The output seems to fit with Robert's answer.
