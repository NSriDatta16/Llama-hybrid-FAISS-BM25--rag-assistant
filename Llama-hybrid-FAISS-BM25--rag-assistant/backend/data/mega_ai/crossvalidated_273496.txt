Alternative to logistic regression - effect of a covariate

I have a data set with one binary response variable $Y$, and three categorical covariates $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$. I want to find out what effect $X_1$ has on $Y$ (and if the effect is significant). Naturally, I solve this by fitting a logistic regression model (using all three covariates), and analyse the table of deviance. Are there any alternative methods to solve this problem? I'm aware of the classification methods mentioned here Alternatives to logistic regression in R , but my problem doesn't concern prediction.
