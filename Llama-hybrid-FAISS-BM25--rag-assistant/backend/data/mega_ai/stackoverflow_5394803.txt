Printing SVG from Browser (IE and FF)

I have a project that generated a svg representation of a tree and saves it as a svg. I tryed to print the resulted svg file from the browser (any browser) but it prints only the upper left corner that fitts the screen. The rest is clipped. I tryed embedding it on a html, I tryed giving fixed dimensions to the svg file, but the problem persists. I searched this topic intensivley but no one seems to have this problem. Thanks
