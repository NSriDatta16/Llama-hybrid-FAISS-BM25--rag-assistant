Statistical relationship between the stages of a stochastic optimization problem

What exactly do the "stages" of a stochastic program say about the statistical relationship between the problem variables? From what I understand, the stages imply both an "ordering" and "grouping" of variables. What are the semantics of such designation of variables? For example: Is it correct to say that stages are a modeling assumption of the statistical relationship between the problem variables? What's the information theoretic nature of that relationship? Example: In a typical "two stage" (e.g. production) stochastic program one often distinguishes between: "First-stage" decisions (variables) "Second-stage or "recourse" decisions (variables) In terms of their statistical dependency or Bayesian relationship , is it correct to say that this simply states that: 1st stage variables are "realized" (decided) independently of 2nd stage variables The realization (decision) probabilities of 2nd stage variables depend on the realization of 1st stage ones? Or is there anything deeper to it? In case it helps, I found the following in our sibling SE.OR site: Oe might confuse the notion of time periods and stages in stochastic programming. [Quoting from King and Wallace 's book on page 16]: “ We should not confuse information stages with time periods. Stages model the flow of information; time periods represent the ticking of the clock in a model. Stages, on the other hand, are points in time where we make decisions in the model after having learned something new .”
