I forgot to set the backend type for the new attribute to "int" so it was automatically set to static (which means magento looks for it in the entity table). The other thing is that i couldn't set the attribute value like this: $model->setData("newattributecode", 123); Magento just didn't save the attribute. Instead I had to use the undocumented function Mage_Catalog_Model_Product::addAttributeUpdate() to save the attribute value of this model: $model->addAttributeUpdate("newattributecode", 123, 0);
