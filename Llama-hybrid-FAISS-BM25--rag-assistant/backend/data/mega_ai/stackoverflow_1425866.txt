If you're confident that your overloaded method taking a string just converts to a connection object and then delegates to the original, you should add one more test method. However this breaks down if you refactor the underlying overloaded methods such that no delegation takes place. In this scenario I'd feel more confident replicating all the tests for both methods. I think the first route is the most pragmatic. However it's a good idea to run code coverage analysis once in a while, and that will indicate at a later time if more tests are required.
