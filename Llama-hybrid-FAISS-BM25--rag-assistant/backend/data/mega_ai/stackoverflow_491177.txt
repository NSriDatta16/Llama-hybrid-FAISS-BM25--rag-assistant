Counting lines, words, characters and top ten words?

Hi I'm pretty new to Stack Overflow so I hope that I'm doing this correctly and that someone out there has the answer I need. I'm currently coding a program in Java with Eclipse IDE an my question is this: I need a snippet of code that does the following It's supposed to get a .TXT file containing text and from that .TXT file count the number of rows and print it, count the number of words and print it, count the number of characters and print it. And finally make a list of the top 10 words used and print that. Allt the printing is done to system outprintln I'm pretty new to Java and am having some difficulties. Anyone out there who can provide me with these lines of code or that knows where i can find them? I want to study the code provided that's how I learn best=) Thanks to all Didnt find the edit button sorry... I Added this to my question: Hehe it´s an assignment but not a homework assignment ok i see well i could provide what i've done so far, i think im pretty close but it´s not working for me. Is there anything i have missed? // Class Tip import java.io.*; import java.util.*; class Tip { public static void main(String [] args) throws Exception { String root = System.getProperty("user.dir"); InputStream is = new FileInputStream( root + "\\tip.txt" ); Scanner scan = new Scanner( is ); String tempString = ""; int lines = 0; int words = 0; Vector wordLength = new Vector (); int avarageWordLength = 0; while(scan.hasNextLine() == true) { tempString = scan.nextLine(); lines++; } is.close(); is = new FileInputStream( root ); scan = new Scanner( is ); while(scan.hasNext() == true) { tempString = scan.next(); wordLength.add(tempString.length()); words++; } for(Integer i : wordLength) { avarageWordLength += i; } avarageWordLength /= wordLength.size(); System.out.println("Lines : " + lines); System.out.println("Words : " + words); System.out.println("Words Avarage Length : " + avarageWordLength); is.close(); } }
