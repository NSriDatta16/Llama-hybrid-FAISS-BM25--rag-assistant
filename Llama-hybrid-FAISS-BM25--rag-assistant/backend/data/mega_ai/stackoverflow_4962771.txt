RGB is not a color profile, it's a color space . Valid color profiles would be (for example) sRGB and Adobe RGB. If you check the images you linked to, you'll see the original has an sRGB IEC61966-2.1 color profile embedded, and the resized has no color profile, so it's going to be shown differently based on which profile it is assumed to have. Unfortunately, I don't think the GD image functions in PHP pay any attention to the color profile. You can try saving out images for web via Photoshop where they're converted to a generic sRGB profile, or use ImageMagick to do the resizing (which I believe is color profile aware).
