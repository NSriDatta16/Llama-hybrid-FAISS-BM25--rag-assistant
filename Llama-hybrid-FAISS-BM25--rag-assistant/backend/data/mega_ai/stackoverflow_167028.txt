We use one big repository, and just have everything structured in subfolders (/project1, /project2 etc) and that seems to work fine. The Apache project has a huge svn repository and it seems to do OK for them! :) In terms of organisation, the structure you gave looks quite reasonable. I think anything goes, pretty much, so long as it's rational (i.e. mixing up every single tool with every single project is probably a bad idea etc). So pick something which works for you (tools/, projects/ etc). Subversion has pretty good support for moving things around in the repository, too, so you can always change if necessary.
