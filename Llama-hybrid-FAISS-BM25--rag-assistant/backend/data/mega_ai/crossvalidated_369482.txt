For EEG analysis, why is it more efficient to use the raw data than images of the data?

Data Science publications for EEG analysis like EEGNet: A Compact Convolutional Network for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces use the raw EEG data (see: github vlawhern/arl-eegmodels ) rather than gif or png files of the data to predict the data. Why does it make more sense to work with the raw data instead of the images of the data? My asumption would be that detecting special patterns in EEGs (like edges, slopes etc.) would also work with the same or similar neural network topologies like those uesd for image recognition.
