When it could be helpful? The simplest example: a list of paragraphs and headings, each with a margin-top and margin-bottom . You want a margin on the top and bottom of the article, and between different elements. With margin collapsing, you can do without setting special margins on the first or last item (NOT a part of the original CSS spec!) or padding the container. But I agree, on a whole, it's a pointless feature.
