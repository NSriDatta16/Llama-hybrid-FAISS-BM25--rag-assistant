A quote from a really nice textbook (Brown, 2006, pp. 22, emphasis added). PCA = principal components analysis EFA = exploratory factor analysis CFA = confirmatory factor analysis Although related to EFA, principal components analysis (PCA) is frequently miscategorized as an estimation method of common factor analysis. Unlike the estimators discussed in the preceding paragraph (ML, PF), PCA relies on a different set of quantitative methods that are not based on the common factor model. PCA does not differentiate common and unique variance. Rather, PCA aims to account for the variance in the observed measures rather than explain the correlations among them. Thus, PCA is more appropriately used as a data reduction technique to reduce a larger set of measures to a smaller, more manageable number of composite variables to use in subsequent analyses. However, some methodologists have argued that PCA is a reasonable or perhaps superior alternative to EFA, in view of the fact that PCA possesses several desirable statistical properties (e.g., computationally simpler, not susceptible to improper solutions, often produces results similar to those of EFA, ability of PCA to calculate a participantâ€™s score on a principal component whereas the indeterminate nature of EFA complicates such computations). Although debate on this issue continues, Fabrigar et al. (1999) provide several reasons in opposition to the argument for the place of PCA in factor analysis. These authors underscore the situations where EFA and PCA produce dissimilar results; for instance, when communalities are low or when there are only a few indicators of a given factor (cf. Widaman, 1993). Regardless, if the overriding rationale and empirical objectives of an analysis are in accord with the common factor model, then it is conceptually and mathematically inconsistent to conduct PCA; that is, EFA is more appropriate if the stated objective is to reproduce the intercorrelations of a set of indicators with a smaller number of latent dimensions, recognizing the existence of measurement error in the observed measures. Floyd and Widaman (1995) make the related point that estimates based on EFA are more likely to generalize to CFA than are those obtained from PCA in that, unlike PCA, EFA and CFA are based on the common factor model. This is a noteworthy consideration in light of the fact that EFA is often used as a precursor to CFA in scale development and construct validation. A detailed demonstration of the computational differences between PCA and EFA can be found in multivariate and factor analytic textbooks (e.g., Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). Brown, T. A. (2006).
