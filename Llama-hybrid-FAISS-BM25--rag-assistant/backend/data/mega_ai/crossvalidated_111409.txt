There are multiple ways to address the question you are asking, depending on what data you have and what you are willing to suppose. One problem is that you (presumably) don't have any $y$ data, if $y$ are the scores for the last test, a test that hasn't happened yet. In this case you cannot build a regression model of the form $\hat y = E(y|x)$ (where $x$ are the exogenous variables, ie students' id and score histories), because you cannot compare your predictions $\hat y$ with 'true' observed $y$... Once you know that, there are two main possibilities I suppose: either you predict $\hat y$ as a weighted mean of the previous test scores (with weights chosen by you, not much machine learning there) or you treat all test scores (both observed and unobserved) as auto-regressive time series: $score_{i,t}= f(score_{i,t-1}, score_{i,t-2}, ...)$, where subscript $i$ stands for student id, and $t$ is the time index of tests. I can't help you much from there, but I suppose a simple model with a trend and fixed individual effects could do the trick. If you had more data, eg. of the class of last year, you could use (nonlinear) regression techniques by fitting a model on the data from last year and using it to predict the final scores for this year.
