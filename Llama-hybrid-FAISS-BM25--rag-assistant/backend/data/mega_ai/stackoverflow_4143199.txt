In my experience NetStream is one of the most inaccurate and dirty features of Flash (NetStream:play2 ?!!), which btw is quite ironic seeing how Flash's primary use is probably video playback. Trying to sync it with anything else in a reliable way is very hard... events and statuses are not very straight forward, and there are multiple issues that can spoil your syncing. Luckily however, netStream.time will tell you quite accurately the current playhead position, so you can eventually use that to determine starting time, delays, dropped frames, etc... Notice that determining the actual starting time is a bit tricky though. When you start loading a netStream, the time value is zero, but when it shows the first frame and is waiting for the buffer to fill (not playing yet) the time value is something like 0.027 (depends on the video), so you need to very carefully monitor this value to accurately determine events. An alternative to using NetStream is embedding the video in a SWF file, which should make synchronization much easier (specially if you use frequent keyframes on encoding). But you will lose quality/filesize ratio (If I remember correctly you can only use FLV, not h264).
