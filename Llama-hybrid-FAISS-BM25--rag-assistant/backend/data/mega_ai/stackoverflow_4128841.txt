Looking over this code, I think it's more likely that your Agent class is leaking phone. Assuming Agent uses retain for the phone property, this will cause the phone to persist longer than it should. The creator of the object gets "credited" with the leak, even if the extra retain is somewhere else. In other words, in Agent: - (void)dealloc { self.phone = nil; // anything else you need to do [super dealloc]; }
