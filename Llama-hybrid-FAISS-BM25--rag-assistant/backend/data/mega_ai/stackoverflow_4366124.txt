msession not defined

I am trying to run this example program - http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/examples/1.x/snmpbulk.html I am on Mac OS X, and I installed pysnmp by - $ sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install pysnmp Now when I run the program I get - Traceback (most recent call last): File "pysnmptest.py", line 2, in from pysnmp import msession ImportError: cannot import name msession UPDATE: seems like pysnmp 4.x doesn't have msession, so I tried http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/examples/4.x/v3arch/index.html and now I get - Traceback (most recent call last): File "pysnmptest.py", line 2, in from pysnmp.entity.rfc3413.oneliner import cmdgen File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/pysnmp/entity/rfc3413/oneliner/cmdgen.py", line 2, in from pysnmp.entity import engine, config File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/pysnmp/entity/engine.py", line 2, in from pysnmp.proto.rfc3412 import MsgAndPduDispatcher File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/pysnmp/proto/rfc3412.py", line 3, in from pysnmp.smi import builder, instrum File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/pysnmp/smi/builder.py", line 4, in from pysnmp.smi import error File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/pysnmp/smi/error.py", line 1, in from pyasn1.error import PyAsn1Error ImportError: No module named pyasn1.error The webpage also says they have dependencies on third-party libraries - Latest PySNMP releases (4.x and later) depend on the following: ASN.1 library for Python used for handling ASN.1 objects Python Cryptography Toolkit used for SNMP message authentication and encryption How do I install them? and would it better to install from the tarball from webpage directly?
