This problem is almost certainly memory fragmentation. On 32 bit Windows the largest contiguous region you can allocate is about 1.1GB (because various DLLs in your EXE preventa larger contiguous range being available). If after deallocating a memory allocation (or a DLL load, or a memory mapped file) ends up in the middle of your previous 1GB region then there will no longer be a 1GB region available for your next call to new to allocate 1GB. Thus it will fail. You can visualize this process using VM Validator .
