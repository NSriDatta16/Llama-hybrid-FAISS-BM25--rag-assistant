BPEL based process is one option. You would go that route if you envisioned leveraging future BPEL tools for the job. Otherwise, BPEL is kind of an overcomplicated mess (as all such general "all can plug in" solutions are). Something simple is to realize that workflow is really often about queues rather than workflow. That is, it is more about putting something on someones desk rather than directing the flow of the work according to a rigid pattern. In that context something that holds a queue, which is a defined stage of work, and then links to other potential chunks of work in a flexible way. There is a general process, but there are exceptions to that process. A rules engine can move things between queues as a matter of general process (and kick off external processes as needed), with the option for a user to arbitrarily move things into the "right" queue when the defined rules don't cut it.
