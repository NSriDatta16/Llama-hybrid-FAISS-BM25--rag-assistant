Delphi Streaming Problem

I'm using a blob field in a kbmMemTable to store a custom component that I've developed from TComponent and I use the read and write component stream methods of the TReader to read and write the component to the blob field. The data in the kbmMemTable is eventually stored inside a structured storage file created by GpStructuredStorage . This has worked flawlessly, until I moved my component (along with the kbmMemtable ) to a new application and tried to have the new application read the blob field. At first I was getting a component naming error (component name already exists), but later I started getting an Access Violation when the TReader tries to read a TPersistent property of my component. As far as I know, I did not change anything with regards to the way I retrive the kbmMemTable data from the gpStructuredStorage file and the way I read the component back from the blob field using TReader . I've made no changes to the component and, I don't seem to have any problem with other components that I'm storing in other blob fields in the same table (at least I'm not getting any errors when they are read back). I'm miffed at what could be the problem. Any help / suggestion would be greatly appreciated. I am using Delphi 2007.
