XG Boost result interpretation for unbalanced datasets (Accuracy & AUCROC)

My dataset is of shape â€“ 5621*8 (binary classification) Label/target : Success (4324, 77 %) & Not success (1297, 23 %) (success and Not success were been equally important for my prediction i.e, TP & TN) I split my data into 3 (Train, Validate, test) For train & Validate i perform 10 fold CV. Test is the seperate data, which I evaluate for each folds I tune my scale_pos_weight ranging between 5 to 80 , and Finally I fixed my values as 75 since I got average higher accuracy rate for my Test set (79 %) for those 10 folds But, If i check my average auc_roc metrics it is very poor , i.e only 50 % for all 10 folds . If i did not tune scale_pos_weight my avg.accuracy drops to 50% & my avg auc_roc increases to 70 % . How can I interpret from the above results between AUCROC & Accuracy in this situation? What might be the problem in my case?
