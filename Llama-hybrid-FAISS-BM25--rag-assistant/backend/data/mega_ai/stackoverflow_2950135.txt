If you are putting code into production, I recommend using an "installer" such as an RPM package to install your code. That way it will be version stamped and you will be able to leverage the installer package to support updates to the production code. Git is not really designed to support production installations, it is intended to track changes to the code itself. In any event, with an .RPM (or EXE or whatever) built, you can just FTP it to the production system and install it like any other package.
