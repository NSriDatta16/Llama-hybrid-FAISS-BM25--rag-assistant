Just to add to Nick's answer, different browsers support the idea of persistent storage in one form or another. There have been a bunch of efforts to normalize these for all browsers over the last year. Here's one library that wraps around HTML 5's DOM Storage, Microsoft's UserData , Session Cookies and window.name (using JSON serialization as window.name can only store strings ). Here's another that focuses on window.name only (which actually works in Opera 9+, IE6+, Firefox 1.5+, Safari [3 I think). Here's a jQuery plugin that uses a .swf (flash) file to offer the most cross-browser support (although it does support native solutions if you configure it to do so). I can't vouch for it but it should be mentioned for this jQuery-lovin' community.
