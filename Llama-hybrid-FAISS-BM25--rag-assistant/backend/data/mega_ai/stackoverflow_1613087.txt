Does storing a lot of images in a single directory slow down image retrieval?

If i have a site where users can upload as many images as they want(think photobucket-like), what is the best way to set up file storage (also, all uploads get a unique random timestamp)? site root --username ----image1.jpg ----image2.jpg ----image3.jpg --anotheruser ----image1.jpg ----image2.jpg ----image3.jpg ... or siteroot --uploads ----image1.jpg ----image2.jpg ----image3.jpg ----image4.jpg ----image6.jpg ... ----image50000.jpg I think the first method is more organized. But i think the second method is standard(keeping all uploads in the same dir), but i wonder if it would be slower when retrieving an image if there are thousands of image in the same directory --- edit --- Thanks for the great answers so far. Also, i will be creating thumbnails, so i also would have to insert that directory somewhere... or , create a naming convention such as thumb_whatever.jpg. so many different ways to do this. Yes disk space will be a problem. but for now i am concerned with retrieval time. When i have to output an image to the browser, if that image is in a directory with 10,000 other images, i am worried on how slow that could get.
