java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation

Good day everyone, i have faced with such an issue as linkage error like this: java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: when resolving method "javax.xml.transform.Transformer.transform(Ljavax/xml/transform/Source;Ljavax/xml/transform/Result;)V" the class loader (instance of org/jboss/mx/loading/UnifiedClassLoader3) of the current class, org/richfaces/renderkit/TemplateEncoderRendererBase, and the class loader (instance of ) for resolved class, javax/xml/transform/Transformer, have different Class objects for the type javax/xml/transform/Source used in the signature I have googled a lot, but all i found is the suggestion to exclude from classpath such kind of libs as xml-apis-2.9.1.jar or jaxrpc-1.1.jar. I did that, but i still have the same error. This library is actually included into jdk 1.6 (rt.jar). So, i did check all my included jars and it seems no kind of jars that might use target class... Maybe i don't take in account smth? is there some magic trick?? Thanks' for help in advance.
