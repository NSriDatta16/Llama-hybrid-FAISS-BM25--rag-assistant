Training for classification using libsvm

I want to classify using libsvm. I have 9 training sets, each set has 144000 labelled instances, each instance having a variable number of features. It is taking about 12 hours to train one set ( ./svm-train with probability estimates ). As I don't have much time, I would like to run more than one set at a time. I'm not sure if I can do this. Can I run all 9 processes simultaneously in different terminals? ./svm-train -b 1 feat1.txt ./svm-train -b 1 feat2.txt . . . ./svm-train -b 1 feat9.txt ( I'm using Fedora Core 5 ).
