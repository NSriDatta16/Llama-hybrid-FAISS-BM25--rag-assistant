Logistic regression uses the general linear equation $Y=b_0+âˆ‘(b_i X_i)+\epsilon$. In linear regression $Y$ is a continuous dependent variable, but in logistic regression it is regressing for the probability of a categorical outcome (for example 0 and 1). The probability of $Y=1$ is: $$ P(Y=1) = {1 \over 1+e^{-(b_0+\sum{(b_iX_i)})}} $$
