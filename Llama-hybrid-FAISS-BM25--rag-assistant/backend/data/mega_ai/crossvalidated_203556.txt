Hartigan's dip test significant for bimodality with clearly unimodal data

I have used the following data x to check whether my results produced by Hartigan's dip test are ok or not. But the data I used suggest a unimodal distribution while Hartigan's test indicates that the distribution is not unimodal. Now what to do. Am I not understanding it? x = c(1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2.5,2.5,2.5) hist(x) dip.test(x) # # Hartigans' dip test for unimodality / multimodality # # data: x # D = 0.13636, p-value = 0.04419 # alternative hypothesis: non-unimodal, i.e., at least bimodal
