This is a special case of finding mappings between quadrilaterals that preserve straight lines. These are generally called homographic or projective transforms. Here, one of the quads is a square, so this is a popular special case. You can google these terms ("quad to quad", etc) to find explanations and code, but here are some for you.

The math isn't particularly pleasant, but it isn't that hard either. You can also find some code from one of the above links.
