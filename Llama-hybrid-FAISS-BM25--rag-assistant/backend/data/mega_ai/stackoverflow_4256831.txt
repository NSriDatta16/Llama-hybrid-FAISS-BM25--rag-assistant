Saul's answer is more elegant than mine, but I'll still share. I had the same problem with showing monthly activity for the last year. Sites that had only been active briefly, or who had no traffic/growth/whatever I was tracking didn't display correctly. Instead of using a cfchartseries displaying a query, I looped over the time to be displayed, used a query of queries to extract the data for that month, and then added a data point for that month. A bit brute force, but it worked.
