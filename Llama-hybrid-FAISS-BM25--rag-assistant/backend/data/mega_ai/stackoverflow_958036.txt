So do I get this correctly? Your "Window1" is a WPF window class, which implements the service contract IGanador? That seems a bit odd.... how about just creating a class of its own, e.g. "GanadorService", which implements IContador? Then this CLASS would be created / instantiated for each request - not your window. public Window1() { this.InitializeComponent(); starthost(); } private void starthost() { host = new ServiceHost(typeof (GanadorService), new Uri[]{ new Uri("net.tcp://localhost:8000") }); host.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(IGanador), new NetTcpBinding(), "Contador"); host.open(); //it fails with this line here but not in a button } public class GanadorService : IGanador { .... (whatever methods you need) ..... } That should help, I hope! Marc
