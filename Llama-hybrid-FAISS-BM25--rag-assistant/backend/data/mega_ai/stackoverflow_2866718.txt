From my experience with Alfresco, this is going to take a lot of customization of the Alfresco repository. I wouldn't go there myself. But if had to, I would answer your questions like this: Reasons for storing documents into the DBMS instead of the file could be: use of DBMS backup/security tools to copy/save/backup the documentation around, and this one is probably a good one: access to these documents could be easier from other applications. I mean, if you're rewriting the storage service anyway, then you can rewrite it so that you store some of the metadata in the new database structure too. This would create some redundancy, but it would make the documents accessible from other systems without having to depend on Alfresco. I have some experience with applications that use DBMS as storage - the application was used to store the incoming invoices, so that those could be approved, disputed or sent for payment or whatever. It had decent LAN performances, but the company had really good bandwidth. On the remote locations, though, it was a bit lagged as the documents were transfered back and forth.
