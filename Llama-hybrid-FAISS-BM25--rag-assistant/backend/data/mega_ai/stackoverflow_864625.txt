I recommend SSIS. It allows you to design the entire data flow including the FTP get operation, application of transformations and mapping of the file to a table. You can then have the SSIS package even run on a schedule using the SQL Server Agent if needed. EDIT: You can define variables inside the SSIS package, which you can then pass on through the Agent job. This can include your FTP path and credentials. alt text http://www.webholstad.com/clarity/blogpics/ssissetvar.jpg
