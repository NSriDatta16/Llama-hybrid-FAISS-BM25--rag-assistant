Why deep learning prefer the probability distribution with a sharp point?

I am reading Ian Goodfellow's book about deep learning and when it introduces exponential distribution, it says "In the context of deep learning, we often want to have a probability distribution with a sharp point at x=0." I don't understand why the probability distribution should have this character, does it help to train the model?
