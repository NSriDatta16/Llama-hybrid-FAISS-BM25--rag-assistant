How do you unescape URLs in Java?

When I read the xml through a URL's InputStream, and then cut out everything except the url, I get " http://cliveg.bu.edu/people/sganguly/player/%20Rang%20De%20Basanti%20-%20Tu%20Bin%20Bataye.mp3 ". As you can see, there are a lot of "%20"s. I want the url to be unescaped. Is there any way to do this in Java, without using a third-party library?
