Can I use correlation metrics also for time series?

I was using the cross correlation function in R ( ccf ) until now to discover correlations and lags between two time series. I was wondering if I can use all other correlation metrics for time series as well or are there any restrictions with time series? For example, I want to use Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to compare two ordinal scaled time series. Is that a valid approach and can I use it to detect lags as well? The same for nominal-scaled time series (events like on/off or status) like phi or Cram√©r's V?
