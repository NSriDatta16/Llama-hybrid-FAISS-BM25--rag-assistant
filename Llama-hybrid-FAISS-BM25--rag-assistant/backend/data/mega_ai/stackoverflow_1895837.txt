To some extent its graphics card dependent, the proprietary driver packs include their own libGL.so and also include the libGL.la (to link against the .so) and any relevant header files. Nvidia - OpenGL libraries and headers are included in the proprietary driver package. ATi FGLRX - OpenGL libraries and headers are included in the proprietary driver package. Open Source Drivers - OpenGL libraries and headers are provided as a part of Mesa. Depending on your distribution you may need to install the *-devel packages to get the headers and linkable libraries you'll need. If you're using an Intel or Matrox card, or you're running an ATi card with the rage, radeon or radeonhd driver you're using the Open Source drivers. GLUT will be the shortest path to a working program. Otherwise you'll need to write the code to create the OpenGL context (OS specific) yourself. If you're still having issues, let us know more about whats not working for you. EDIT Here's some sample commands/code that might be relevant or useful. GCC Compiling: gcc -lGL glprogram.c -o glprogram Includes: #include #include #include
