If that's the best way to organise it, you're probably doing something wrong. If it's more than just a toy program or a simple script, then you should break it up into separate files, etc. It's the only sane way of doing it. When your project gets big enough that you need someone else helping on it, then it will make the SCM a whole bunch easier. Additionally, sooner or later you are going to need to add a separate utility to your project, that is going to need some common code/structures. It's far easier to do this if you have separate source files than if you have just one big one.
