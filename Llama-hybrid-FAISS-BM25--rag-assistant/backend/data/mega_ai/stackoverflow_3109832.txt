I think you have it the wrong way round. The user-agent will make requests to your servlet, with a given URI identifying the resource they wish to access. You decide what the correct URI for a given resource is, and how to respond to this request. So it's conceptually not a case of your webpage having an "address" that you want to display differently. Rather, it's a case of what URIs you want to use to map to which resources. If you don't want to expose the extension, then you don't need URIs to have any extension at all , they're just strings. You will, however, need to think about how to resolve potential name clashes (as djna notes in the comment). I believe that this is configured for you at the Faces level, and actually BalusC's answer should have all the technical information necessary to do this. I just wanted to point out the backwards nature of your thought processes, clearing this up will hopefully make it easier to grok the process in general. It's better that you understand it, than simply paste something into your web.xml that makes the problem go away (for now).
