Here is what worked for me with ssh; I just tried replacing ssh with rsync below, and it seemed to work: NTEmacs can only use cygwin ssh-agent if launched from cygwin bash. This is not a problem; under Windows I currently use the following VB script to launch: WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run "c:\cygwin\bin\bash -l -c /usr/bin/emacs", 0, false . For testing, simply symlink your emacs.exe to /usr/bin/emacs (if it's not already set up like that) and launch emacs from cygwin prompt. This is whatâ€™s needed in .emacs (require 'tramp) (setq tramp-default-method "ssh") (nconc (cadr (assq 'tramp-login-args (assoc "ssh" tramp-methods))) '(("bash" "-i"))) (setcdr (assq 'tramp-remote-sh (assoc "ssh" tramp-methods)) '("bash -i"))
