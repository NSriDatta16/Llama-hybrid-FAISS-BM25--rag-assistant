Clean elegant solution to form-class level component collection initializing before Initialize Component?

I am converting an old Vb6 solution to .net 2.0 in vs2010. I've been working in C# for about 3 years now and .net for 5. I don't recall having this problem in C# , but if I want initialize a readonly collection of DerivedControlFoo Is there a clean way to do it besides creating a sub to do it all off somewhere else? I'd love to be able to do it at the class level at the declaration for readability and simplicity. Example: Private _formattedFormulaText As IEnumerable(Of Label) = New List(Of Label) From { _ FormulaLabels0, FormulaLabels1, lblBrownFormula, FormulaLabels3, lblGreenFormula, _ lblOrangeFormula, lblRedFormula, FormulaLabels7, lblFormulaTotal} Doing it the straightforward easy way, results in the collection being filled with {nothing,..,nothing}
