I would agree with your assessment that there are no comprehensive benchmarks established for MCMC methods. This is because every MCMC sampler has pros and cons, and are extremely problem specific. In a typical Bayesian modeling setting, you can run the same sampler with diverse mixing rates when the data is different. I would go to the extent of saying that if in the future there comes out a comprehensive benchmark study of various MCMC samplers, I would not trust the results to be applicable outside of the examples shown. Regarding the usage of ESS to assess sampling quality, it is worth mentioning that ESS depends on the quantity that is to be estimated from the sample. If you want to find the mean of the sample, the ESS obtained will be different from if you want to estimate the 25th quantile. Having said that, if the quantity of interest is fixed, ESS is a reasonable way of comparing samplers. Maybe a better idea is ESS per unit time. One flaw with ESS is that for multivariate estimation problems, ESS returns an effective sample size for each component separately, ignoring all cross-correlations in the estimation process. In this paper recently, a multivariate ESS has been proposed, and implemented in R package mcmcse via the function multiESS . It is unclear how this method compares to the ESS of the coda package, but at the very outset seems more reasonable than univariate ESS methods.
