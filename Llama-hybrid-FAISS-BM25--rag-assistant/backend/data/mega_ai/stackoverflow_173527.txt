Creating a new rrd database based on an existing one

I have some old rrdtool databases, for which the exact creation recipe has long been since lost. I need to create a new database with the same characteristics as the current ones. I've dumped a couple of old databases and pored over the contents but I'm not sure how to interpret the metadata. I think it appears in the following stanzas AVERAGE 360 5.0000000000e-01 There are four such stanzas, which correspond to the way I recall the round-robin cascading was set up. Has anyone already done this, or can give me pointers as to how to clone a new empty rrd database from an existing one? Or show me where I missed this in the documentation.
