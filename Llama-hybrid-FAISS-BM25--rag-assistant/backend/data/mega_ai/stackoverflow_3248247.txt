Edit: Totally missed the part where you are doing keep_blank_values = 1 ; sorry, no idea what is wrong. From http://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html : Form fields containing empty strings are ignored and do not appear in the dictionary; to keep such values, provide a true value for the optional keep_blank_values keyword parameter when creating the FieldStorage instance. Therefore, this is happening because this field was left blank.
