These people already know all the arguments for SCM, there is nothing anyone can say to them that will sell them on it. These things must happen: You install SCM on your local machine and use it. If you must, have it autogenerate these .zip files at every build, so no one outside your cube knows the difference. Some kind of disaster occurs, like loss of work, show-stopper bug is re-introduced or some other worst-case scenario that is the real reason we all use SCM (the other features we learn to appreciate later). You are unaffected by the disaster, and/or use your personal copy of the code in SCM to fix the problem/recover the lost work/whatever. You are a hero and everyone wants to know how you did it. Only by experiencing firsthand the pain of loss caused by poor SCM practices will your organization realize the benefits of SCM. You're smart enough to learn from the mistakes of others, but not everyone is. The rest of the time, you'll just be 2/3X more productive than the rest of the team and maybe, just maybe they'll wonder how. By the way, this is how you get agile, continuous integration, unit testing, etc into the organization: lead by example.
