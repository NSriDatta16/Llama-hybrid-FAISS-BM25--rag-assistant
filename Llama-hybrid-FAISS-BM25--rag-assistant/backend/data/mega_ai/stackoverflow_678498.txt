My organization found the Silverlight 2.0/WCF push implementation to be a little "not ready for prime time", at least for what we were planning to use it for. We ended up going with XMPP/Jabber, because it is a more well formed beast, and you can implement it fairly easily in Silverlight, by just getting some resources off the internet. I do believe that Silverlight 3.0 will implement a newer/more well formed push implementation, from what I can tell from publicly available information.
