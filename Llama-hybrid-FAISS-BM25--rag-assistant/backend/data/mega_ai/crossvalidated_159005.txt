An unbalanced data set (like you suggest when you say the proportion of households with CHE = 1 make up 3% of your data) will influence the results of a logistic regression. See the answers to this question for instance. In short, the class imbalance in your data set affects only the intercept term. If you are using your model to say something about you4 8 socioeconomic variables, you should be fine. If it is for prediction, then you could consider lowering your probability threshold below 0.5.
