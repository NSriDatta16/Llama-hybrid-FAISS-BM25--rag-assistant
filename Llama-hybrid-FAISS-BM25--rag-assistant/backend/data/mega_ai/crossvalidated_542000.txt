Ole Peter's presented the same material here with minimal changes, and I tried again to replicate the code, forgetting that I had posted this question until I searched for references to Ole Peter's ergodicity in SE. This time the code did work out to reproduce the idea, so why not share it? Here it is . And these are the pertinent plots: The first one corresponds to the plot to the left in the OP, showing the individual trajectories of the first $23$ individuals of an ensemble of $1$ million subjects. The pointwise average for the ensemble corresponds to the return expectation $$\frac 1 2\left(1.5 + 0.6 \right)=1.05$$ or $5$ percent: $100 (1.05)^{60}=\$1,868.$ In black the noise for the ensemble average is smoothed out using $1$ million subjects. For the second plot I had to reduce the number of tosses from $12$ months ( $518400$ ) to $10,000$ to avoid computationally zero values, and plotted the individual timeline of $10$ subjects: This consistent loss over time "reflects the multiplicativity of the process", with $10$ percent loss every two rounds: $1.5 \times 0.6 = 0.9,$ or $5$ percent per round.
