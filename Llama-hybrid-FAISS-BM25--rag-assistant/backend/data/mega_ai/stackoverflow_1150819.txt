If you are using URLRequest to get the files, then you are running across more than just elegant error handling, you are running into a fundamental difference in the Flash and AIR run-times. If using the URLRequest object to retrieve files you are going to get a security error from Flash on every request to every server that has not set a policy file to allow these sort of requests. AIR allows these requests since it basically IS the client. This makes sense since it's the difference between installing an application and visiting a web page. I hate to provide the non-answer, but if you can't make a server-side call, and you are hitting a range of "not-known" servers, it's going to be a tough road to hoe. But maybe I misunderstand, are you just trying to Link to the files and prevent the user from getting bad links, or are you trying to actually load the files?
