drag and drop not working on iPAD

I would like to use sortable HTML tables driven by a Javascript API (e.g., BBC Glow) with the iPAD - however, I cannot drag an otherwise draggable item using the iPAD as the entire page scrolls instead of the element I would like to drag. Is there a way around this?
