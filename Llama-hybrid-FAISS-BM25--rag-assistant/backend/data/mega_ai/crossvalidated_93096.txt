Different non-parametric methods for estimating the probability distribution of data

I have some data and was trying to fit a smooth curve to it. However, I do not want to enforce too many prior beliefs or too strong pre-conceptions (except the ones implied by the rest of my question) on it, or any specific distributions. I just wanted to fit it with some smooth curve (or have a good estimate of the probability distribution that it might have come from). The only method that I know for doing this is kernel density estimation (KDE). I was wondering, if people knew of other methods for estimating such a thing. I just wanted a list of them and from that I can do my own research to find out which ones I want to use. Giving any links or good references (or intuitions on which ones are good) are always welcome (and are encouraged)!
