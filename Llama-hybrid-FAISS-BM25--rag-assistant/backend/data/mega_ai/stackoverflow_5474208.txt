Need stored procedure to take x number of zipcodes

I am designing a stored procedure to return results from a search. I need all apartments returned that has a specific zipcode.. The select should do what this does: select * from tbl_houses where ( (zip_code in (10000,20000,30000,40000)) or (zip_code > 50000 and zip_code In other words. I want a stored procedure which can both take a zip_code range and series of zip_codes. Anyone know an elegant way of doing this? My current solutions are ugly as xxxx. Cheers Mathias
