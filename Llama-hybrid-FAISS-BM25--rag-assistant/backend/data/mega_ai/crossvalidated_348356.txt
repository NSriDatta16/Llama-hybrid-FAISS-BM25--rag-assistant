Differencing is used to make a time series stationary when applying an $ARIMA(p,d,q)$ model. The order of differencing is indicated by the number $d$ from the orders $(p,d,q)$ of the model. For a seasonal model $ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)_m$, there will be an additional seasonal differencing order $D$ for the seasonal component. In your code $d$ and $D$ are already indicated: sar_m = sarimax.SARIMAX(ts15_train.values, trend='n', order=(2,1,1), seasonal_order=(2, 1, 1, 24), simple_differencing=False).fit() The model being described here is a seasonal $ARIMA(2,1,1)(2,1,1)_{24}$ so you $d=1$ and your $D=1$ and you don't need to do anything, your code is doing the required transformation already.
