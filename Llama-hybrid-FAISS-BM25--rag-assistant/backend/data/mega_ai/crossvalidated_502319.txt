If $P(Z)$ is normal distribution, can $P(Z|X_i)$ be normal distribution with different mean, or standard deviation?

I'm trying to reconstruct variational autoencoder situation with a more "imaginable" example, known all properties. I was playing around, and can't find a way how can for example the sum of two normal distributions ( $P(Z|X_1)$ , $P(Z|X_2)$ ) with different means, and standard deviations multiplied with $P(X)$ can form $P(Z)$ - a normal distributon. Just for example we're checking a group's IQ, and region. The group consists of 10000 participants. $X$ states regions. $X_1$ , region one has a probability of 0.2, so 2000 participants $X_2$ , region two has a probability of 0.8, so 8000 participants $Z$ states the IQ. It is a normal distribution with mean 100, and standard deviation 10. Out of both regions, participants IQ is: IQ P(Z[IQ]) quantity 60-70: 0.0020 - 20 70-80: 0.0210 - 210 80-90: 0.1360 - 1360 90-100: 0.3410 - 3410 100-110: 0.3410 - 3410 110-120: 0.1360 - 1360 120-130: 0.0210 - 210 130-140: 0.0020 - 20 The only way I got the same results back if $P(Z|X_i) = P(Z)$ : X[1]: 4, 42, 272, 682, 682, 272, 42, 4 X[2]: 16, 168, 1088, 2728, 2728, 1088, 168, 16 I was trying out different setups for $P(Z|X_i)$ not be equal to $P(Z)$ , with different means, or standard deviations, but by simply looking at the graphs, it is clear that the shape of them regardless of $P(X)$ won't form a normal distribution. According to my tries, I can't see a way to form a gaussian from two gaussians that aren't equal. However, in VAEs we're trying to accomplish that, so there must be something I'm getting wrong.
