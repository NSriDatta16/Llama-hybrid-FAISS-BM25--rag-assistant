By default, when a page is refreshed, the PostBack event is going to be registered again, which will fire off your button click event again. A simple solution to this would be to add the following command after your AddToDatabase function completes: Response.Redirect(Request.Url.PathAndQuery) This will cause the page to redirect to itself, so that if a refresh occurs, the PostBack event will not register the button click. It is not the most elegant, but it will get the job done. If you have more complex things going on with the page, you may need to look into other solutions, such as wrapping the AddToDatabase function through AJAX or something else.
