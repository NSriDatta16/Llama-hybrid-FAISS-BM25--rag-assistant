I am not sure to understand your question since you talk about k-means, which is basically an unsupervised method (i.e. where classes are not known a priori), while at the same time you are saying that you already identified groups of individuals. So I would suggest to look at classification methods, or other supervised methods where class membership is known and the objective is to find a weighted combination of your variables that minimize your classification error rate (this is just an example). For instance, LDA does a good job (see the CRAN task view on Multivariate Statistics ), but look also at the machine learning community (widely represented on the stats.stackexchange) for other methods. Now since you also talked of k-nearest neighbor, I wonder if you are not introducing a confusion between k-means and kNN. In this case, the corresponding R function is knn() in the class package (it includes cross-validation), or see the kknn package.
