jQuery selector question

I'm in a bit of a dilemma. I need to select div tags based on whether their children have a certain class. This is a code example of the DOM structure: This is item one This is a description This is item one This is a description This is item one This is a description So, what I want to select is a div tag that doesn't have a paragraph with a class of "special", and in the example above, that would be second div tag (#two). Any ideas?
