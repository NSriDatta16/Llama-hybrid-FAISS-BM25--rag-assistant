Communicating between ViewModels in Windows Phone 7

We are using Caliburn.Micro for a simple Windows Phone 7 Application that takes a photo of a particular stock item, and then saves the image and a xml file with information user enters. I have first screen with button to click and "CameraCaptureTask" gets photo, I read photo and save to storage but now I'm not sure how to take user to another View and pass the filename and a unique ID generated in the first View. I tried NavigationService.Navigate("...") with a query string but I cannot get Querystring in ViewModel. I'm confused, say when you make wizard, how do you pass from one View to another View - without using singleton or hacking way. Is there a good Caliburn.Micro way with a good example?
