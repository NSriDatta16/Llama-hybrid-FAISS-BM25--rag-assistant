In VS you Can go to Tools > Options in the menu Then to Environment> AutoRecover to set AutoRecover setting. Keep in mind that AutoRecover seems to only save the info for the page your are currently working on. So like Lambert said "press the Ctrl-Shift-S combination frequently". Also AutoRecover only kicks in once you have first saved your project Also your work should save each time you Run your app. But the real solution here is to stop your pc from randomlly shutting down. i suggest you head over to superuser to try and fix your pc
