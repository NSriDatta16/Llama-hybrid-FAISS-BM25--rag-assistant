Why don't you try and see? [˙ʇ,uɐɔ noʎ 'oᴎ] Update : Just to reflect on the comments below, with the emphasis of the C++ language on smart compiling, the compiler needs to know the size of the class (thus requiring declaration of all member data) and the class interface (thus requiring all functions and types declaration). If you want the flexibility of adding functions to the class without the need to change the class header then consider using the pimpl idiom . This will, however, cost you the extra dereference for each call or use of the function or data you added. There are various common reasons for implementing the pimpl: to reduce compilation time, as this allows you to change the class without changing all the compilation units that depend on it (#include it) to reduce coupling between a class' dependents and some often-changing implementation details of the class. as Noah Roberts mentioned below the pimpl can also solve exception safety issues.
