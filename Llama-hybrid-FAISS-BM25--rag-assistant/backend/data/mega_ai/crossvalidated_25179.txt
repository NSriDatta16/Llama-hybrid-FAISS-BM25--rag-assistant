How to interpret this criterion of logistic regression result

I run a backward variable selection logistic regression and find out the SAS program selected 12 variables and give me the output like this: It is funny that my configuration of the SAS backward selection is to make the SC(SBC) lower. Overall, the result looks like the SC result suppose that intercept with covariates is worse. But other two guys AIC and -2logL supports that Intercept with corvar is better model. May you guys make some judge ment on this result and test output?
