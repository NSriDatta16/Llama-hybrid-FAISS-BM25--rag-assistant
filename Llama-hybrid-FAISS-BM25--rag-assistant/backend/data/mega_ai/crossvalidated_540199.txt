There is a paper titled " Recognizing Overdifferenced Time Series " by Dickey and a co-author ( paywalled ) on this in the Journal of Time Series Analysis back in the mid-1990s. That's definitive. An overdifferenced series will tend to mimic a first-order moving average process with a -0.5 parameter on the moving average term is what I remember the result to be. Indeed, you can discover it via simulation if you use an ARIMA simulator (R's arima.sim) to generate stationary ARMA processes and then difference them.
