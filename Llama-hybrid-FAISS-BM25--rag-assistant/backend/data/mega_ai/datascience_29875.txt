Ryan Zotti offers a good answer, but this is changing. With the addition of Random Forest , Gradient Boosting , and Bayesian methods to TensorFlow , it is headed in the direction of becoming a one-stop solution. More traditional algorithms are listed here . TensorFlow has particular promise, as it is designed to scale well and supports GPU operations. However, scikit learn is the traditional one-stop shop where you can find many standard algorithms. They usually aren't the latest and greatest, so you will likely want specialized libraries as well.
