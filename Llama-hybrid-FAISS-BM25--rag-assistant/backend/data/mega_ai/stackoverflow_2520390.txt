How to create a folder in Eclipse?

I'd like to create a folder under a package in Eclipse... The purpose of this folder is merely for organizational purposes. Meaning, I don't want it to be another package. Every time I try to add a folder under a package, it just creates a package instead. I'd like to have the following structure: project/src/package1/someClass.java project/src/package1/someFOLDER/anotherClass.java project/src/package1/package2/anotherFOLDER/oneOtherClass.java Is it possible to do this without adding a package? I come from a .NET/C# and C++ background... here I'd just add a folder and the reference to that class would be updated in the project. How can I just add an organizational folder in eclipse? Thanks
