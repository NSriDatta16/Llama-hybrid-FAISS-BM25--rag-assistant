Usage of deep learning results as bayesian prior?

Lets consider the following situation. We are trying to estimate the parameters for a predictor where interpretability is of importance (linear regression, logistic regression etc.). When we build our predictor model, we also try a deep learning model where we achieve higher test accuracy, but due to the non-interpretability, we cannot use this model. However, we would still like to use the information from this deep learning model. Questions Is it possible to incorporate the accuracy from the deep learning model into (lets say) the logistic regression model? Would it be possible to use the deep learning classifier as a Bayesian prior for (lets say) the logistic regression model? Is this a thing in general? That is, use "advanced" models with low to no interpretability (such as neural networks), as prior information for data distribution while estimating parameters in a model with good interpretability but lower prediction accuracy? If yes, is there any good example of this? (preferably using a deep learning model as the prior method) Thanks in advance!
