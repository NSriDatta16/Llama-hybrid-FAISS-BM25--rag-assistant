Your problems seem like solving a stock exchange problem with respect to some given values. Take it as a time series problem where the curve of your graph changes according to some low peak and high peak value, take " Mean Absolute Error or Mean Squared Error . Also, take ReLU as a Non-Linearity function and add a penalization term (L1-Regularizer). One thing to note here is that your function is a Non-Convex function for solving this kind of problem increase the width of your neural network but the depth should be low, I mean take 8 to 12 layers of Neural Network and in each layer take 16 to 32 Neurons, also give a Residual Connection after each 3 layers except last. Try all these steps, I hope the model will learn this behavior with minor data points.
